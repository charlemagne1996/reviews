BRD analysis
============

This folder has become a somewhat-confusing mix of scripts used to

1. pair the index (generated by Wenyi Shang) with scraped review data ('''pair_index_with_reviews.py''', and

2. use that paired book-level table to select review-level rows from the original data (```select_fiction_reviews.py```), and

3. summarize or aggregate the resulting fiction data (```aggregate_publishers.py``` and ```analyze_publications.py```), *and*

4. exploratory data analysis on the resulting summaries (```FirstEDA.Rmd.```)
