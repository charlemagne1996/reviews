The key elements here are

titlemeta.csv
-------------

A short list of the periodicals or periodical indexes gathered in this project. Note the column 'index,' which has 'Y' only for periodical indexes.

volmeta.csv
-----------

A longer enumeration of all the volumes we have for those periodicals/indexes. Note that this table may contain repeated lines for volumes that are listed under more than one title; that's a problem that needs to be investigated/diagnosed.

nytbr.txt
