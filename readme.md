Mining periodical indexes and book reviews, 1800-2010. In collaboration with Richard Jean So and Yuerong Hu.

The project is at an early stage of development. Our ultimate goal is to develop a database of responses to fiction (and poetry, where possible). Evidence of contemporary reception can be used to train models of genre and literary prestige.
