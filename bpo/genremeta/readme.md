metadata for initial experiment
======================================

Twenty-eight metadata tables for an initial experiment comparing the coherence of fictional categories to the coherence of book review descriptions.

In each case a positive category (e.g. "folklore") will be contrasted to a contrast set that excludes the positive category (e.g. "folklore_contrast").

We will compare the strength of the boundary between groups of fictional texts to the strength of the boundary between groups of reviews, to understand how closely readers' characterization of fiction is related to the linguistic differences in the texts.

Although this folder is called "genremeta" we acknowledge that not all of the categories would normally be called genres. Some would probably be called subject categories (e.g. books about North America), or audience categories (e.g. juvenile fiction). But the boundary between a genre and a subject is in reality quite blurry (which is why subject classification could be used for so long as a stand-in for classification by genre). And it makes sense to get an overview of this problem before zooming in on the subset of it that most readers would characterize as a question about genre.
