77. Hardenbrass and Haverill, or the Secret of the Castles a Novel. In four Volumes, 12mo. THIS is a Satire on the Fashionable World. The Author has had the boldness to depict, in a style of broad caricature, some modern characters of high rank and notoriety, and to blend, among the incidents of a fictitious story, several transactions of so recent a date as to be still the theme of general wonder and conjecture. In venturing on such perilous ground he has adopted the requisite precaution of suppressing tbose personalities which might be obnoxious to juridical censure, and of qualifying his details of fact by a large admix? ture of invented circumstances. Such of his characters and scenes as are taken from real life may be easily traced to tbeir origin; but (beReader is left to interpret them in his own way, and at his own risk ; for the Work professes to have no more " offence in't" than Hamlet's Play of Gonzaga. There. is another point of view in which it behoves us to consider it. Tbe first question which a Novel reader asks concerning a Novel is, whether it be interesting. This significant term is generally understood to comprehend the mysterious, the perplexing, the horrible, the pathetic, the eventful, and the surprising. In the present instance the question may be fairly answered in the affirmative. The hero of the story, about the time when he discovers that he is in love, is placed in a predicament from which all the learned heads in Doctors Commons would be puzzled to extricate him. This is undoubted? ly a very interesting situation. He fights a duel, and is wounded t that is another. Then there are three or four overturns in travelling-carriages and post-chaises, some desperate midnight rencontres, in which a young, and beautiful, and interesting lady is exposed to imminent danger, anil very gallantly rescued; there also are two horrible murders, and a liberal allowance of other striking adven? tures. Some episodes are introduced after the manner of Smollett and Le Sage; but they are so managed as to be subservient to the main plot. From the multitude of characters brought forward on the scene, a great deal of conversation was to be ex? pected ; in this particular we think the Author has been rather profuse. The fault, however, is a slight one, and may be easily excused; his ob? ject was to pourtray living manners-, and this cannot be clone in a narrative without deviating into tbe dramatic style. There is some humour, too, in tbe idea of relating succinctly the talk tbat evaporates in certain circles calling themselves polished?-a mix? ture of civility and scandal, a jumble of meanings and no-meanings, a de? sultory, superficial* pretending strain of colloquy, in which some who are ambitious to shine, expose them? selves to the solemn irony of others who wait for opportunities to sneer and criticize. Swift's " Elements of Polite Conversation" seem to have afforded the first hint for this species of ridicule; and it is somewhat sur? prising that so few attempts should have been made since his time to im? prove upon it. The writers of No? vels, who might have turned it to the highest advantage, have been either unable or afraid to venture upon it; and some of tbem have, of late, fallen into the very error against which it should operate as a warn? ing. Their dialogues are unnaturally formal and artificial, involving ab? stract propositions and premeditated effusions of sentiment, delivered in ail the stately formality of the old French tragedy. The reason of this appears to be, that, having attempted the high historical style in their nar? rations, they felt obliged, for the sake of consistency, to sustain the same d'igni- dignified manner in their interlocu? tory digressions, and to avoid every approach to the easy familiarity of social intercourse. It is obviously a matter of coarse, that in a satirical novel this monotonous refinement, this overstrained effort atelegaoce, should be made to give place to a more na? tural way-of writing, for tbe merit of tbe satire must depend on the truth of the representation. Folly, extra? vagance, and dissipation, need only be exposed to be ridiculed, and the ef? fect of the exposure can hardly be heightened by exaggeration. It the present Author, as we have already observed, has exhibited many scenes in strong caricature, it is because that medium was at once the safest, and the best suited to tbe nature of bis design. His characters are produced in masquerade; but their deportment, their manners, and their speech, be? tray them. The following extract from a con? versation between the hero of the tale and his friend Serjeant Fullbottom, will serve to illustrate some of tbe observations we have just made: " *Now I'll put a case,' said Haverill; ' suppose I should find any papers that prove tbis. will of Kirkham's to be a forgery, and suppose in tbis very will my father should have- taken care of him? self.-' " 'I beg pardon,* interrupted the Ser? jeant, * tbat cannot be ; he would not be an eligible witness, if a legatee.' "'True, I had forgotten that,' said Haverill; ' but we'll say then, suppose 1 find that tbe substantiating the will will bring me some hundreds, and yet have tbe proof of its not being worth a rush, should I do right to suppress the evidence ?* ?< < Umph,' said tbe lawyer, ' tbat is an awkward case! If you could sup? press it without risk of future discovery, you would be justified in doing so, doubtless, because, in fact, you are, yourself, no party in. the business! but it might happen tbat you could not do it satisfactorily I in tbat case of course you would tell alL' " * Are you giving me your opinion as a lawyer or as a friend ?' said Haverill. " ?As a friend, surely,' replied Fullbottom. * 1 am advising you as I would my own son.' " * And do all lawyers think as you do ?' asked Haverill. ?"All sensible men do/ replied his companion. * 1 would not do a disho? nourable action any more than you or any man ; but at the same time, pru? dence is necessary. These are not times for men to throw away thousands, and indeed every body knows it. 1 see, young man, that you think a lawyer worse than another man. You are egregiously mistaken, I assure you. My fa? ther was a cloth manufacturer in the West-Riding of Yorkshire, where tbe Full bottoms bave flourished in reputa? tion and respectability many generations. When he proposed to me to bring me up to tbe Law, be told me that be thought it wrong to put a lad into a way of life where be would bave constantly recur? ring temptations to do wrong, when an honester profession was to be found; and tbat though the Law was by some deem? ed very far from bonest?at least it was supposed to give a man latitude to be a rogue?be should bring me up to tbe Bar; for let it be as bad as it would, it could not possibly be so bad as Trade. This was said, I assure you, in sober sadness; and I bave often heard him regret tbe difficulty of doing as you would be done by; in short, be said that in business it was utterly impossible :? as, if you did that, where was tbe merit of making a good bargain, or beating down an article to half its value?vow? ing the whole time that you are giving a third more than you ought." * Those parts of tbe Work which expose the follies and vices of fashion? able life, greatly heighten the effect of the more serious passages. The moral aim of the Author bas been to point out, by signal examples, tbe utter ruin to which all who heed? lessly rush iuto the vortex of dis? sipation expose themselves, and to demonstrate, in an impressive man? ner, the dangers of that system of female education in which real utility is sacrificed to display, and of which tbe ultimate tendency is " to frus? trate tbe hopes of parents, and to poison their children's felicity." We shall not attempt to give an abstract of the story. Its catas? trophe turns upon an act of atro? cious villainy, which, however de? praved tbe age may be, we must con? clude to be imaginary, or at least not imputable to any persons now living. Tbe uubounded indulgence of pas? sions inevitably leads to crime, and the possession of wealth and influence may serve as a screen against de? tection ; but a crime so monstrous and inhuman as this could not in our days have been perpetrated with im? punity ; it belongs only to the age of Nero Nero or Caligula. The Marquis of Hard cob rais is a character for which no single prototype ever did exist; some of the features will be recog? nised, but the darker traits must have been sketched from fancy. The fate assigned to him convinces us that the Author intended the matter to be so considered. In detailing tbe secret history of a modern intrigue, he has superadded not only its ac? tual but its possible consequences, and has recorded the act, when only the contemplation of it might have existed. I n a ta'e of fiction, destined to inculcate the necessity of self-controul, this proceeding is perfectly jus? tifiable. The portrait of Haverill is original and well-conceived, and that of Anarella, the heroine, has something more amiable, sprightly, and unaffected, than we are accustomed to see in young ladies of her quality and station, in modern Novels. The minor personages both in high and low life are drawn with much spirit and humour.

The Dull Miss Archinard. By Anne Douglas Sedgwick. (Heinemann.) Maxy readers are glad to hear of a wholesome story for girls ; and if it happens that the book is agreeable, and is carefully written, popularity may be readily achieved. ' The Dull Miss Archinard' is just such a volume; and it contains passages of no little pathos and interest. It may seem hypercritical to refer to the point, but some readers will be puzzled with one character who appears at intervals. He is described as " young Lord Allan Hope, eldest son of Lord Mainwaring." He is usually referred to in conversation as Lord Allan, and his prospective wife is spoken of as Lady Hope. There is here a patent ambiguity, for there is no peer of any rank, not even a marquis, whose eldest son can be so described. The whole novel suggests the probability of better work from the same pen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Isabel, the Young Wife and the Old Love. By J. C. JeafTreson. 3 vols. (Hurst & Blackett.)? Mr. Jeaffreson belongs entirely to the modern school of novelists. He holds all lurid writing in judicious horror, despises trapdoors and miseries, and is even superior to the temptations of thrilling and spasmodic scenes. His story is a story of the world as it is presented to untranscendental eyes; his situations are overhung with little theatrical drapery; his heroes and heroines speak the living language of London clubs and equirearchical country-houses, instead of fighting duels with epigrams or practising the purple-tinted elocution of the melo-dramatic stage. In fact, Mr. Jeaffreson describes the manners of the day, plays lightly with passing topics, and executes a series of careful social pictures. His work contains two uncommon elements?satire unmixed with levity, seriousness free from affectation. The interest of the plot, too, ia of an unusually sustained and varied character. Though the main conception is neither new nor agreeable?it being the ancient, and, to us, somewhat repulsive, idea of a young girl first married to tbe man she respects, and then to the man she loves. A number of pleasant and piquant accessories are grouped around the central incident, and the narrative is managed with so much art that not a superfluous personage is introduced. Even the dialogue?that sin of novel-writers and torment of novel-readers?is seldom carried beyond the point at which it ceases to assist the action of the story, which is laid, alternately, in the rural districts of England, in London, and in Paris. But it is as a social portrait painter that we award Mr. Jeaffreson the highest praise. The contrast between Isabel Potter and Lady Frances Leatheby is prominently, although unostentatiously, suggested,?the nobler lady (according to Peerage laws) being, perhaps, the most natural as well as the most striking illustration of human nature in the three volumes. If we have to qualify our approbation of Mr. Jeaffreson's new novel, it is on account of his tendency to obey the leadingstrings of literary precedent; and this constitutes a serious objection to his whole plan. Is it impossible to point down the vistas of fashionable life without fixing attention again and again on the young gentleman entrapped into high play, and thereby morally and pecuniarily damaged ? Mr. Jeaffreson possesses surely too much faculty of invention to be under the necessity of resorting to these moth-eaten properties, made up for dramas composed, acted, and forgotten long ago. Can he not write a novel which shall not dwell conspicuously upon those conventional episodes which have been worn to shreds by innumerable tatterdemalions of romance? Taking exception to these and to some other faults of construction, we may introduce Isabel to all novel readers as the interesting heroine of an interesting story.

Emmeline: with some other Pica'*, liv Marv I!ruuto:i, Author of 'Self Control,' and * Discipline.* To which is prefixed, A Memoir of lier Lite, it;rinding 1 a a some Extracts from her Correspondence. &c*jtcU> cf fltto JSoofcs. Svo. i?|>. JJO. London, J81<). Tn eke is so much knowledge of human nature, fidelity <d observation, and acuteness of remark, so much good sense and discrimination ol' chara* ter in the writings ot* IN irs Brunton, that they could not Tail of being popular had they even been wanting in the beauty of expression ami correctness of stvle which so particularly distinguish them. Those who have read * Self Control' and 'Discipline,' will hear with pleasure that a new novel has been given to the public from the same pen ; it is, however, a pleasiiie mingled with the regret that it is an uniinished production, and that its fair author has been prematurely snatched from all the scenes of this world. All Mrs. Brunton's novels have a leading moral tendency ; * Self Control' was intended to shew the power ot tile religious principle in bestowing self-command, and to combat the moral and indelicate maxim, that a reformed rake makes the best husband. * Discipline' was a continuation of the same plan, and was intended to exhibit the means through which, when self-control has been neglected, the mind must be trained I?y suffering before it can hope for happiness or true enjoyment; and the object of ' Emme'ine' is to shew how little chance there is of happiness when a divorced wife marries her seducer. To give the story of an unfinished novel would be useless, although tne outline is furnished : we shall, therefore, only make an extract, which will exhibit all the characteristics of Mrs. Brunton's writings:? ' De Clifford was every thing to Emmeline. Depending upon bim for all her pleasures, rinding in his will her bole aim and purpose, she clung to him only the more for the desertion of every other stay. His love, his society, his protection, even bis authority, daily endeared him to the gentle depend ing Emmeline; and her attachment became, if possible, more fervent, than when, in evil hour, she sacrificed fo it all that i-> most precious in time and in eternity. \#% hilt* lie was present, she saw, she heard only De Clifford. 1 he moments of his absence were a dreary blank in ber being; the sound of his returning step made her heart leap light. 'But love,?successful love, at least,?though it may be the business of woman, can never be more than the pastime ot man. De Clifford was a soldier, accustomed to all the rousing interests of war. These interests had given place to an overpowering passion, which had filled, and perhaps delighted such a mind the more, for its struggles, its dangers, and its guilt. These rapids in the tide of Me were past, and all was still. All who have watched the subsiding torrent, know how apt it is to stagnate. Perhaps the most difficult problem in the management ot the human mind, is to lill the void whicS is' lett there bv the accomplishment of supumc de-i e.

' " What -h-ill wi-vlo to day. Emmeline?" was the question he oh en a-ked as they lingered over the break! i t-talde,? question ot eui omen to the happiness of him uno asks it! " 'lo day we must do ^o and m?," is the language ot happiness; for it is the language of activity,?of duty.** * Hut Ivniut'line is not the most interesting part (^f the present volume, which includes a memoir of Mrs. Hi linton by her surviving husband, several of her letters wr?tten to private fiends, and extracts from her Journal, while travelling m different parts nf Midland. As specimens of epistolary wilting', her h tter> are intitled to much praise; there is a neatness of style, carnotness of friendship, and sprightliness of description ita them, that must have endeared her to all her corie>poudeiits. As a specimen of her talents in tins species of writing, we give place to one of her letters; it is to her sister-inlaw, on the pleasure which she anticipated in visiting London for tin* first time:? ' To M..s. Balfour.?

Hut I tru dive shall meet in a home, which will, indeed, be complete to us all; an I who knows whether our propensity to love the place with which we a;e familiar, may not be one means of endearing to us that better home throughout eternal ages.' In travelling through Yorkshire, Mrs. Bruillon was particularly delighted with that enchanting spot, Studley Royal, near Ripon; cd'this place s!:e writes with enthusiasm; the description of Fountain's Abbey we cannot omit inserting;?

so. Te joura of an Exi. t Vo2W. Crmmn Boo. Sunders and Otlev. IN the perusal of these volumes, we have frequently been reminded of the stye and manner of the Sketch Book; the same pathos, the same originality of thought, the same facility of inipression. The Author resided at Marseilles in the year 1822, and has giren in the first volume some lively descriptions of recent historical events, and domestic scenes. The work is written in the form of a Journal, and nnder the date of Nov. 1, we find the following interesting detail: "cThis day was one of gloom and solemnity in the city. I walked there in the morning. The shops were all sllot, the belle of all the Churches were ringing the funeral chime, and the a upon the vessels in the harbour were hf mast high. It was kljour des worts, the day of the dead, when the living cease from their labours to pray for the repose of the millions of soul that are passed away. The Churches were all hung with black, and the people were kneeling around the Confessionals, whispering their guit and repentace to the unseen Cnfessor; while the still silence Wa only broken by the ringing of a small hell, which announced the different periods of the service. But soon the whole multitude joined in that solemn and thrilling hymn, which is more particularly striking to the traveller, meeting as he does, with extracts from it, inscribed upon crosses amid the dangers of his alpine wanderings. There is something singularly affecting to me in this ceremony. Young and old, rich and poor, are all mingled together a they pray fir their buried kindred: thus pointing out to the eontemplative mind an emblem of the future mingling of their dust. "I remained during thb day in the city: the gravity sad composid appearance of every thing suited my helings. Fates and noisy roicing. destroy me, they rrisate me, and make me displeased with myself for not being able to share in the cheerfulness of others. I strolled in the evening into one of the cafis. The variety of persons one sees there makes me forget other thoughts for a time. When I entered it, I perceived two Turks stt~ng aoone side with their cigarsanod their cf before them; a few Englishmen were lounging about, and the nose of the billiardtable was heard from an adjo.ii room. I had scarcely sat down and calIed for some coffee, when some other turbaned personages came in, and placed themselves on the opposite side of the room to that on which the Turks were seated. There was an evident differene in the appearance of the two parties. The Turks, with their overhanging eyebrows and shaggy beards, looked fiercely at the group which was opposate to them. This latr consisted of an elderly man, two younger, and a boy of about fourteen, who appea very much inclined to ridicule the Turk. The costume of these last differed from that of their neighbours. They were Greek, with clear oval countenances, and a brighter and a darker eye than the Turks could boat of. The two parties stared at each othet with that sort of expreio of countenance with which two bulls may be supposed to regard one another, when separated in their furious strife. Here were the two bitterest enemies which can perhape exist, the insurgent and his tyrant, sitting quietly within dhe same room. While the troops of either party were at that moment engaged in war even to the knife, they were sitting at their little marble tables beneath the soft light of the lamp, aod listening to a German girl who was playing upon the harp in the midst o; thecafe T But as I have already said, the Greek boy appeared very muc disposed to commenoe an attack upon the Turks; nt had they not been more peaceably disposed, a scene of confusion might have ensued. They, however, got up and quitted the room. The Greeks remained; they were from Smiiiay rpoe a little French, and told me t h dimade their epe from that place, and were going to the M~orea" In the second volume we find the following animated description of the City and Harbour of Marseilles: "Coming out of the Chapel, I stood gaing upon the various obects which then presnted themselves. The Harbour, the old blak Town, the graceful and fair moder City looking down with reined contempt and superciliousness upon er unvolahed neighbour; the scorched smoig monWans in the distance hutting in the myriads of Bestides, with their endenal and and their atered fg-trees, nd closed shuttwrs Then readi before me, the VWde Mediterrmean , with the Qu tie Islands, who" chor shi looked like some of those dark sad ftl vels which used to convey devoted victim to the monater, or the fire, while the white and sparkling sails of those which contained no sin, flitted along the horizon like summer inects. Ur the quays beneath, six or seven of beAtlantean porters of Marseilles nodded Ilo with their huge burthen, a vast trunk These men are peculiar to Provence, and I never saw any wbo might compete with them, except perhaps the Titan draymen -of London. Yet their nourishment is very slight, a bunch of gres, some bread, and a little wine, being suficient to recruit the strength of their enormous limbs. As they bear along their load, slung by ropes between them, divided into two lines, each man lays his band upon the shoulder of him on the other side of the trunk, who places his in the same manner. Then the wild cries of the sailors as they were heaving the merhendize from their vessels, echoed up to the rock, and brought to my recollection the time when I had heard them in the midst of tempest and the dark Biscay." The reader will, we hope, be enabled to exercise his own judgment respect. ing the execution of this performance, by the quotations we have made from it. We shall only add, that we consider it as a prelude to future excellence, and hope the Author will proceed in his literary career.

Early Adventures in Persia, Susiana, and Babylonia, including a Residence among the Bakhtivari and other Wild Tribes before the discovery of Nineveh. By Sir Henry Layard. In 2 vols. (John Murray.) The bilious politician who said he could never forgive Nineveh for discovering Sir Henry Layard may learn, by reading these volumes, that Sir Henry is a man who, without the aid of Nineveh, would have made himself known to the British public The present work may be said to describe the base of the author's literary and adventurous career. There is some matter of importance with regard to the Karun, the only navigable river in Persia. Sir Henry Layard has now leisure and considerable influence with Lord Salisbury. He could not use it more advantageously than by pressing upon the Foreign Office the recommendations contained in these volumes as to the improvement and the freedom of the navigation both of the Karun and of the great Turkish rivers, the Euphrates and the Tigris, with which the Karun is connected. Sir Henry Layard's life has been influenced throughout by bis boyhood in Italy; but his travels began in 1839, when he and Mr. Mitford, author of A Land March to Ceylon, proposed to journey together. Sir Henry Layard, it seems, was not born for such concurrence ; and the first touch of the strong self-assertion which makes a great part of his character breaks out at p. 16, where he seems to complain of Mr. Mitford for not mentioning his name as that of his companion. The plan of travelling together broke down at Jerusalem, when Sir Henry started off to visit Petra and other sites in the Syrian desert, and to wander among the Bakhtiyari tribes in the Karun district of Persia. Before the author arrives?almost shoeless, and in a tattered Arab cloak, breaking through the quarantine at Damascus?he will have established with any impartial reader a charaoter for all the best qualities of a successful adventurer ? daring, brave, and cautious, with strength of arm and suppleness of speech, ready for any emergency, and at the same time a cool calculator as to the events of the morrow. Perhaps no one will enjoy so much as Sir Henry Layard does the point of contrast between this ragged and almost penniless entry and that of a later period when, " as Queen's Ambassador to the Sultan, I entered Damascus in 1878 . . . through vast crowds of men and women of all creeds? Mohammedans, Christians, Jews, &c.?with their respective chiefs, who had come out to welcome me." At Baghdad, the author assumed "the Persian dress," and soon observed the keen interest with which Persians regard the Turkish town of Kerbelah. This is, indeed, the Mecca of the Shiah Mohammedans, the burial-place of Ali, the son-in-law of the Prophet. From thence the little traders carry to-day, as they did forty years ago, " circular bits of earth upon which devout Shiahs place their foreheads when prostrate in prayer." Nothing is more common in a Persian caravan than to see one of these circular bits of sacred clay passed round so that each in turn may pray, westward, with his forehead pressing upon it to the ground. Persian Khans, the author notes, have a way of interpreting the injunctions of Mohammed so as to admit of great indulgence in " swallowing glasses of fiery arak." Approaching Ispahan, the author " passed through the labyrinth of walls which enclose the gardens and melon beds, the Armenian quarter of Julfa." Now that the controversy on missionary work throughout Islam is going on, it may be well to explain that in Persia the work of the Missionary Society, though nominally directed against Mohammedanism, is practically confined to the Christians, the Armenians of Julfa. There is perhaps no nobler or bolder missionary of the English Church than Dr. Bruce, who has for nearly twenty years resided at Julfa; but no one would be more ready than he himself to acknowledge the utter impossibility of any direct mission in Persia against Islam, or that his own work has been mainly among his Armenian neighbours, of whom he has educated hundreds. Sir Henry Layard says, with reference to forty years ago: " In those days" a Christian speaking against Islam "would have caused a public tumult, and might even have been torn to pieces." The danger to anyone who should speak against Mohammed in the bazaars of Ispahan is scarcely less to-day. Apostasy carries with it a sentence of death in Persia. Even in Constantinople, so late as 1843, an Armenian, who had embraced Islam and then returned to his former faith, was executed, and his head, "covered by a European hat," was exposed in Stamboul. Sir Stratford Canning protested, and the Sultan consented to abolish the death penalty in such cases, but refused to go further. " The law as regards Mohammedans who apostatised was inexorable, and, being prescribed by the Prophet himself in the Koran, the Sultan had no power to alter or modify it." Persian punishments have a horrible reputation Sir Henry Layard, writing of " one of the best administrators in the kingdom," says, " one of his modes of dealing with criminals was what he called ' planting vines.' A hole having been dug in the ground, men were thrust headlong into it and then covered with earth, their legs being allowed to protrude to represent what he facetiously called ? the vines.' ... A tower still existed near Shiraz which he had built of three hundred living men belonging to a tribe whichhad rebelled against the Shah." "The sticks" with which bastinado is inflicted are rarely out of sight or out of use. With regard to two servants of one Suleiman Khan, accused of stealing a gun, the author writes: " The unfortunate men were first subjected to a cruel bastinado on the soles of their feet until they fainted. When they had been revived by buckets of water poured upon them, they were burnt in the most sensitive parts of their bodies with hot irons. They still maintained their innocence, and only admitted they were guilty when unable to resist the excruciating agony of having packing-needles forced under their finger nails." These travels were undertaken more than forty years ago, but they relate the manners of a country less changeful, perhaps, than any empire of the world. Parts of the work are of immediate interest in regard to commercial prospects. Sir Henry Layard, in a note, points out that " As the discovery of the passage round the Cape of Good Hope ruined the trade of Basra (Bussorah), so the passage through the Isthmus of Suez promises to revive it." The free and open navigation of the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Karun is for English trade a matter of high importance. It is probably a mistaken policy that her Majesty's consuls in that region are paid exclusively by the Indian Government. "The Karun," says Sir Henry Layard, "flows through one of the richest, though one of the most neglected, provinces of Persia. These rivers are destined to become great trading highways." It is no exaggeration to say that the trade of this country in Asiatic Turkey and Central Asia would soon be doubled, and more than doubled, if the views which Sir Henry Layard was one of the first to put forth were realised by the co-operation of the Sultan's and the 8hah's governments, acting in concert with those Powers of Europe which may be supposed to have interests in the Persian Gulf.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I Right at Last; axd other Tales. By the author of " Mary Barton," &c. London: Sampson, Low, Son, and Co. Tiiis work consists of four separate stories, whicb, as they have already appeared in "Household Words," and "All the Year Round," scarcely need a notice. They are called " Right at Last,' "The Manchester marriage," "Lois the Witch," and " The Crooked Branch." The first furnisAts the title to the volume. This tale gives the history of a young married couple, Dr. Brown and his wife, who have plenty of affection for each other, but unfortunately very little money. Oue of their shifts to keep up a decent appearance is given in the following-the are just married, and he has begun to practice; S consulting room is therefore a necessity :-Doctor Brown was rather afraid lest Margaret should think the house bare and cheerless in its half furnished state, for he had obeyed her injunction, aud bought " little furniture as nmight be, in addition to the kw things he had iuhfrited from his mother. His coGw$I ing roonm (how grand it sounded!) was complettil arranged, ready for stray patients; and it was well calculated tit make a good impression on them. There was a Turkey carpet on the door, that had ben his mnozher',, and was just sufficiently worn to give it the air of respectability which handsome pieces of furniture have, when they look as if they had not been pOchained for the occasion, but are in some degree hedi' tar!.

Feb 25, 1860  ENGLISH LITERATURE - 19th Century|ENGLISH LITERATURE - 20th Century
The Athenaeum  : 1687 268 - 268
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elfie in Stcily. NEW NOVELS. 2 vols. (Chapman & HalD? There is an interest in these volumes which depends on the subject even more than on the merit of story. Everybody is concerned for the Two Sicilies just now, and any book that will tell us about the loss-known portions of the kingdom would be welcome. The descriptions of scenery, j manners, and local customs of the island are fresh, graphic, evidently done from life,?though occa- | sionally the reader comes upon a passage that j sounds as if it had been culled from a Handbook. ! The author, instead of writing a book of travels, J has thrown her impress-ions de voyage into the i form of a story, in which the Jesuits conduct tho ' love affairs, being at once the heroes and tlie , agents of the intrigue. The craft and the colour j are of a woman's hand and eye,?pretty, delicate, warm. The conclusion of the tale of Elfie's wandering in Sicily, though it will be highly soothing to orthodox Protestant sensibilities, will be found a [/(/ra rut in ff by the general novel reader, who wants more drama, less poetry and description for his share. As the book i3 written with a view to the diffusion of the knowledge of history, geography, and the objects of art and nature to be found in the island, the story is subordinate. Elfie, the heroine, who has been wise since she was a babe and suckling, is a wonderful specimen of the sisterhood of superior beings who inhabit novels?or who five in caves and lonely isles, walking daily "by the shores of Old Romance; and her letters, with their remarks on love, marriage, general deportment, and universal information, might be bound up either with Mrs. Chapone or Mr. Timbs's book of ' Things not generally known.'

The Eustace Diamonds
Trollope, Anthony
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Eustace Diamonds. NOVELS OF THE "WEEK. By Anthony Trollope, 3 vols. (Chapman & Hall.) Miriam's Marriage. By Katharine S. Macquoid. 3 vols. (Smith, Elder & Co.) The Fitful Fever of a Life. By Sir F. Vincent. 3 vols. (Newby.) In the present reprint from the Fortnightly Review, Mr. Trollope has at some length justified the neutral-tinted view of humanity which he adopts, and formally declines the task of describing heroes and heroines, such characters being, he considers, untrue to nature. So long as he avows that he confines himself to the barest average of humanity, we can have no right to complain, but may admire, without arriere pensee, the skill with which he makes us take an interest in his characters. The danger of such an ideal is in his inducing the reader to suppose that the leading personages are intended to be at all typical of excellence, and this misapprehension is impossible in the present instance. Whether every man's experience, even in this work-day world, does not contradict Mr. Trollope's sombre view of his fellow creatures, is another question. As he disclaims any moral purpose beyond the photographic delineation of human meanness, criticism of the moral of his stories is, to a great extent, rendered unnecessary. In a literary point of view, we think the present volumes will not diminish his reputation. His instrument is always the kaleidoscope, but this particular permutation of the old materials is effective enough. We are, of course, introduced to a bishop and a dean, the former rich, the latter gentlemanly but impecunious; we meet with our old friend the barrister, whose opinion upon heirlooms is given at length, and who in this case touches law happily on its poetic side; and "duke," the Duke of Omnium, still lingers on the stage. But Lizzie Eustace,?pretty, unprincipled, adventurous, vulgarish Lizzie,?may be, perhaps, reckoned an addition to the old familiar troupe. Married young, when living on her wits, to a baronet, who is too generous, though deceived in her character, to visit her with pecuniary penalties, she is early left a young widow, whose only care is to retain her wealth and keep her only son at home. This unhappy infant, in truth, is made a stalkinghorse for Lizzie's sentiment?a scapegoat in lier troubles, and a rallying-point for her doubtful respectability. Hard pressed, either in love or law, she finds a refuge in the fact that she "lives but for her child." In the mean time, she reconciles with her maternal duties certain buccaneering ventures on her own account. To retain her diamonds family jewels of which the ownership is doubtful, and to secure a husband who shall have either wealth or " position," are really the first objects of her life. She is unfortunate in both attempts. Hesitating, as she does, between her clever cousin Greystock (whose faith, such as it is, is plighted to little Lucy Morris, a governess) and Lord Fawn of the India Office, a colourless Whig peer, whom we have met with before in Mr. Trollope's works, she unluckily, in a moment of pique with the former, engages herself to the latter gentleman. Now Lord Fawn is the pink of propriety; and, for a stupid man, with views as to political advancement, the soul of honour. From anything like scandal or the publicity of his private affairs he shrinks with the aversion both of pride and moral cowardice. Hence the terrible events which flow from his discovery of Lizzie's determination to fight her late husband's representatives for the possession of the diamond necklace. A novelist less cynical, or rather less " knowing," might have worked up something tragic from a complication like this; but as Mr. Trollope takes care to show us that there is no affection on either side, the matter resolves itself into an amusing system of manoeuvring between the two parties? Lizzie endeavouring to bring her swain to book, and that recreant knight to escape without loss of honour or publicity. The history of the jewels is too intricate and two essential to the story to be recounted here; two burglaries are involved, and much action by grave personages at Lincoln's Inn and by the ingenious executive of Scotland Yard; but the whole results in such an implication of the designing Lizzie that she loses both her lovers, and has to content herself with the part of a tender mother, and the consolations of the Rev. Mr. Emilius, a clerical adventurer, who condones some soiling of the plumage of his dove in consideration of the material advantages her nest affords him. On the whole, we may say the story contains specimens in every variety of our author's happiest manner. Lady Fawn, as a warm hearted Belgravian mother,?Lady Linlithgow, most diverting of ferocious old ladies, whose rudeness we can pardon for her honesty,?Mrs. Hittaway, energetic, unscrupulous, and slangy,?are all natural, and all original. Some others are not so excellent. Lord George and his connexions, Sir Griffin, Mrs. Carbuncle, and the rest, strike one as overdrawn and unreal. But we will not take exception to what is, on the whole, an amusing story. Lucy's virtue is a little colourless, as virtue in Mr. Trollope's hands is apt to be, but she is charming, and much too good for Greystock. Some capital .byplay is afforded in Mr. Palliser's (Mr. Palliser still forms part of the Trollopean gallery) mania for the decimal coinage, as exemplified in "quints'' and "semitenths," and the hunting adventures are told con amore. Mr. Trollope has advisedly limited our expectations, and within his limits we can find scope for entertainment.

Miriam's Marriage
Macquoid, Katharine S.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mrs. Macquoid has chosen a theme in itself not inviting, and one which, less delicately handled, would have resulted in a disagreeable story. As it is, we may congratulate the writer on having constructed, out of very ordinary materials, an interesting narrative, which evinces insight into the various conflicting elements that go to make up the compound we call character and determine human actions. The central fact, upon which all the rest of the book is made to turn, is the marriage of a young girl, with strong impulses and correspondingly feeble will, to a man socially her superior, intellectually her equal, and morally only not inferior, because it would be scarcely accurate to credit his companion with the possession of any moral sense whatever. This marriage, as the victim of Godfrey Brendon's villainy innocently believes it to be, is in the eye of the law invalidated by the fact that Mr. Brendon has on a previous occasion gone through the same ceremony at Buenos Ayres with a Braziliau beauty, whose temper, proving incompatible with his own, provoked him into trying a second venture. The real interest of the story culminates at the point where a knowledge of her actual legal position is brought home to the unhappy girl by a revelation of the facts, and she has to choose between her happiness and her good name. Nothing can be more skilful than the mode in which Mrs. Macquoid has laid bare the workings of Miriam's nature, and one feels that, given her antecedents and early training, it would have been impossible for one so constituted to act differently. A short sentence supplies the key to her conduct throughout: " Darling, it is right to stay with you if I make you happy." The choice made, and her husband suddenly cut off by an accident, she finds herself ready to answer the reproaches of her relations by the plea that after all " we were married." In contrast to Miriam stands her sister Nancy, a woman of a noble type, unselfish, and with a capacity of loving not less intense than her sister's, though she is incapable of bestowing her love upon ignoble objects. Brought up by a father who lavished his caresses on the elder daughter, whose beauty recalled the image of an idolized wife, Nancy Blane has escaped the spoiling of paternal idolatry, and her nature, too high spirited to be cowed by paternal snubbing, has developed in a somewhat onesided manner. If the rapidity with which she instinctively divines the right course to pursue in a given combination of circumstances shows her to be a woman, the dogged tenacity with which she follows up her purpose in spite of every obstacle is probably inherited from her father. Our sympathies are so strongly enlisted on her side as the story proceeds, that we tremble when her happiness is imperilled by the appearance of a formidable rival, and we feel that we could never forgive the author if, at the end of all her troubles, none of which results from any fault of her own, Nancy should not be rewarded by the full fruition of the love which, passionate as it is, is yet dwarfed by hers. We may assure intend- ing readers of 'Miriam's Marriage' that poetical justice is meted out to every personage in whose future any possible interest is likely to be felt. An appropriate Nemesis overtakes the purse-proud parvenu, Mr. Purton, when he is entrapped into marrying an ex-lady's maid by the second-hand gentility and assumed acquaintance with " the aristocracy," which he mistakes for characteristic marks of the great object of his ambition?a real lady for his wife. There are several others of the dramatis persona; so well drawn as to merit particular commendation; but we have said enough to indicate the opinion we have formed of the book. Mrs. Macquoid will, perhaps, not think us hypercritical if we point out one or two blemishes in work which, as a whole, has been executed in the spirit of an artist. We do not remember to have met, even in a novel, with such a phrase as "she had pretexted a headache," which is more than we can say for the expression, " no qualities, social or otherwise." A somewhat more careful revision than it has been subjected to would have freed the book from these and similar defects.

The Fitful Fever of a Life
Vincent, Sir Francis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 " Fever" is an inappropriate title for Sir Francis Vincent's novel. He has collected an immense number of people of a marriageable age, and given them, for the most part, nothing to do but dancing, croquet, riding, and similar amusements, with the addition of cigar-smoking for the male portion of his puppet-show. Of course they drift into love and matrimony, with various success. Caroline Curtis, the leading lady, having somewhat more character than her companions, is rather wicked and very foolish, the others being only rather foolish, and not wicked at all. For her a villain is provided in the shape of one Hargrave, aristocrat, gambler, and forger, who, after acting as philosopher and bear-leader on the Continent to a Mr. William Bradford, a young gentleman of eminent probity, who shows no sort of objection or suspicion with regard to his companion's character, or the places and people he makes acquaintance with under his auspices, repays his pupil's kindness on his return to England by eloping with Caroline when she is on the eve of marriage with his friend. Of course the erring couple are duly punished, Hargrave dying a felon's death in prison, and Caroline, after various hardships, making an eminently satisfactory and saintly end. The other pairs are more conventional and more happy in their loves. For some time an obstacle, in the shape of poverty, hinders the felicity of Mary Bradford and the partner of her choice; but that difficulty being surmounted by the bold expedient of a fortune being left to Mr. Eden, they attain the same successful consummation of their hopes as the half-dozen other couples who drag through three volumes the even tenor of their way. With the exception of too copious a use of scraps of French, and some eccentricities on the part of the printer, there is positively nothing to object to in the ' Fitful Fever of a Life.' It is not at all feverish, and perhaps a trifle hard to read, but this last point may be useful as a mental discipline for those who have ample leisure to employ on novel reading.

Black partridges, and the common gray partri(lge, are plentiful, and a few (julil and hares may be found; but they cannot be pursued on foot, as they lie in the densest and moit impenetrable jungles. An elephant is indispensable, and but few sportsmen are steady enough in a howdah to bag many head of game in a day. The Co'sas de Espana is reprinted from Putman's Ionthly ,l/oyazine (American). It is a smart description of a journey to and through Spain, and of the sights seen in the course of it. The author, whoever he may be, is manifestly an insufferable coxcomb, as witness this account of HO1W THEY LOOKIE) AT Mr. Sitting on mv three seats, that is to say, sitting on the middle one, and with arms akimbo occupying the two others, I took to myself whatever of the public admiration it suited me to appropriate. Of course I gave little heed to the shouts of the small boys, nor any special attention to any of the specimens of masculine wonder which followed our corteye, even to the town's gates. But when an) particularlv pretty maid's face was turned tip in admiration, I did not fail to note it. I did not fail to observe that it was directed not so much to the coach as to the Coupi. On the instant I was ready to answer it. I was down upon the sweet eves with my glassglass in one hand and thle tip of myn moustache in the other. A balance of admiration wvas dlulv struck ere our eves parted. Bless my sotil! lhov many pretty grisettes there are in the town of Lyoni. Ilow white, and neat, and kiss-mie-if-vou-vwill, their caps are. Only it re(quires somic art to draw these pretty creatures out; andl, from my experience, I believe there is nothing like a new coach-and-six to do it. A man might visit Lyons a hundred tinies, and vet, unless he should betliink him of coming out in a new iIcrline Parisienne to huint utp the beauty of the town, he might never get half an idea of what I saw that morning. And in this strain the book is written. So conceited is our traveller that lie is ever supposing himself the object of universal attention. Ile cannot even travel in a diligence from Lyons to Geneva, and occasionally thrust his hlead out at the window, but, in his monomania, he imagines !ly~W TIIEY TALKED OF' 31. T[he prevailing tone of remark, as with cracking whip and braying trumpet, we dashed through the towns, I cannot be expected to have myself heard; hut, if I am any interpreter of phvbiognomy, it must have been as follows :-" 'rhere goes a Milord lAuglais ! 'sas one. " That man has ten thousand a Ivear" says another. 4 lie's a big g-d-d- n, travelling in advance of the crowd !" echoes a third. C'ertaitement. lie has engaged beforehand all the best rooms in all the great hotels in Switzerland " I" P'bltu. Ile occupies the three seats of the coup', amd will want three bedls to sleep in !" " lie's one oi the dn.;es-one of the b:r) s-and is bound for the top of MUnt Blanc in wvinter !' " lie takes the precaution of a seasonable start, so as not to incur the risk of miaking a new acquaintance on his travels " The furious driving gave ine no opportunitv to correct the errors into which these good people fell so readily. Otherwise I would gladly have explained to theni, as I passed, that I was indeed no lion, but simpldy Nick Bottom, the weaver, going to Geneva. Brottom, in(leed! And with the ass's hlead on. and in that plight we leave him, and pass to tIme J'ictures of th e Baittle Fielqs, brilliant sketches brought home by " the Roving Englishman,' whose book is in striking contrast with the vulgarity and aff'ctations of the American tourist. Mr. 'Murrav describes what lie saw, and few can deseribe so well. It is only to be regretted that lie should nmix up with it so much of personal feeling as is showni in his remarrks on the diplomatic service. T'lhe fault found with that may be true; but it would come with a better grace from a stranger, than from one who had belonged to it, quarrelled with it, and quitted it. As this volume will be in everybody's hands, much extract is needless, especially as its contents have been Ialready introduced to the public in the pages of I lousehold Hl"'ords. The following is a good specimen of the author's brilliant style:THlE ZOU'AVE. lrespecting the rights of property, a Zouave's ideas are not quite correct: he would steal anything to eat or drink, in an1 impudent, dashing sort of way, without the smallest compunction; but then he would walk twentv miles through a bog in a snow-storm to return it, if hle found out afterwards that he bad stolen it from anybody entitled to his peculiar sympathy, or if his feelings became subsequently interestedl about thilem-or, perhaps, even for a whim, Ile likes bri'anida-e more from the dangrer and bravado of it. than from any substantial advantages which he mav hope to reap; for if you meet him with his hands full of no matter what, that he may just have become pos. sessed of at the most dreadful risk, his first object and anxiety appears to be how he shall get rid of his burden, to set out again immediately in chase of some. thing else. If any one has ever shown him the smallest kindness, he will pay it with the most surprising mag. nificence. For a pipe of tobacco supplied to him as some forgotten time of need, or for a drop out of ; brandy-flask, he would return a casket of jeweb snatched from a general conflagration in a town given over to plunder. When he has conferred a benefit on anybody, he is apt to disappear with great agility, or even perhaps to do or say something offensive, in his anxiety to avoid thanks; and lie would never thieve with such determined perseverance as when foraging for a sick Englishman: " Car ces Jean Boule, voyez vous, 9a ne salt rien! Ca ne sait pas s'arraagercomme nous autres; qa ne sont que des zenfans, puts qa noto zaime! cr4 nom de chien comme sa nous zaime!' I think I see one of the rowdy, kind-hearted little fellows now. He is the guide, philosopher, and friendof a towering guardsman-for your Zouave is aristocratic in his ideas and predilections, so that he will seldom be seen to consort with the common troops of the line. Both Guardsman and Zouave are proud of their inti. Itiacy, and take every possible means to display it. though their conversation is utterly incomprehensible to thlemselves or anybody else: it consists in eccentric but fruitless sallies into the English language, on the one side, and into the French on the other, each friend oblingly translating into his native tongue what he supposes the meaning of the other friend may be, the first speaker confirming the translation with the ipronptest and most social approval. Our littlefriend looks up at his gigantic companion with an air of admirin- solicitude and protection that completely beggars description. His baggy red breeches come down so low, from want of braces, as almost to hide his legs; his blue jacket flies open in well studiedl disarray; and his immense turban is cocked so much on one side, that it is a wonder how he keeps it on. lie wags his hips martially, as he struts along with his little nose in the air, and his liMtle white gaiterson his little feet, a yard apart from each other. Ile hast no consciousness of being ridiculous, and he believes, with all his stout little heart, that the eyes of the world are fixed on him and his acquaintance-as, indeed, they are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha. By Miguel de Cervantes Saa- vedra. Done into English, with Notes and a New Life of the Author, by H. E. Watts. Vols. I. and II. (Quaritch.) Cervantes has no reason to complain of lack of worshippers in this country, and they are no longer content with booksellers' reprints of Motteux and Jarvis. In 1881 Mr. Duffield brought out a new translation of ' Don Quixote/ in 1885 Mr. Ormsby produced his excellent version, and now we have before us the first instalment of an elaborate translation by Mr. H. E. Watts, handsomely printed on ribbed paper with ample margins, and altogether luxurious. Nor is its splendour confined to externals. The elaborate life of Cervantes, the numerous notes, and the ample appendices mark it out as the most ambitious of the various versions of Don Quixote' that have appeared since Shelton. The first volume of Mr. Watts's book is entirely taken up with a biography by far the most extensive and exhaustive that has appeared in English; nor, indeed, since that of Navarrete has anything so complete appeared in Spanish. Of this life as a wnole no competent critic can speak in other than terms of the highest praise. Mr. Watts has not only used the material to be found in Navarrete, but he has also taken careful note of the little details discovered by the zeal of modern Cervantists?details often published in obscure Spanish periodicals that seldom find their way to England. Further, he has shown himself master of his materials, assigning to each incident its proper place in his narrative, and not expatiating unduly on any single document simply because it is of recent discovery. Yet Mr. Watts has been able, with the help of Don Pascual de Gayangos, to add one little fact to our knowledge, viz., that Cervantes was employed sometime before 1584 in Montanches, a district of Estremadura, to collect tithes for the Priory of St. John. The biography of Cervantes is difficult to write. Thanks to his rhymed epistle to Mateo Vasquez, to Heedo's ' Historia de Argel' and the documents discovered by Caen Bermudez, we know a good deal about his conduct at Lepanto and his captivity at Algiers; but for the major part of his career we have to depend mainly on bare records of isolated facts such as that mentioned above; and although, no doubt, more notices of the kind will turn up when the archives and libraries of Spain are thoroughly ransacked, the biographer is tempted to turn to ' Don Quixote' and the 'Exemplary Novels' in search of something a little less jejune. And to a certain extent he does well. There is no doubt, for instance, that the Story of the Captive in the First Part of' Don Quixote' is in a large measure autobiographical; but unluckily when a biographer once begins to search for autobiography in his hero's writings it is easy to go too far. The late Senor Benjumea, for example, insisted that the tale of 'El Licenciado Vidriera' was partly autobiographical; that Cervantes described himself in Tomas Bodaja; and that Cervantes, instead of going to Rome in the suite- of Cardinal Acquaviva, as has hitherto been supposed, really embarked as a volunteer at Cartagena with a regiment bound for Italy. Now this and a good deal else which Senor Benjumea puts forward is exceedingly ingenious, but it is, after all, pure conjecture, and it is not quite easy to reconcile with Cervantes's statement in the dedication of his ' Galatea.' Besides, if Tomas's voyage to Italy is a piece of autobiography, why not his stay at Salamanca ? Navarrete reports that a professor of Salamanca had seen the name of Cervantes in the university registers (an entry which unluckily nobody has since had the luck to set eyes on), and there is a tradition that Cervantes lodged in the Calle de Moros; so there is quite material enough for an ingenious writer who likes to revive the story of Cervantes having studied at Salamanca. In eschewing speculations of this kind Mr. Watts has shown good judgment, and generally speaking his criticism is cautious and sober. His treatment of the Pacheco portrait is an excellent instance of the prudence which is careful to mention a specious hypothesis and all that can be urged in its favour, and yet as careful to point out that the whole is guesswork. Having said thus much in Mr. Watts's favour, we shall not be misunderstood if we dwell on a few points in which we disagree with him. The first point is the supposed poem 'Filena/ It is, of course, quite possible that Cervantes wrote a pastoral of that name; but the sole authority for the idea is the triplet in the ' Voyage to Parnassus/ which is susceptible of another interpretation; and therefore to assume, as Mr. Watts does, the existence of the poem as a positive fact is at least hazardous. A much more important matter is the identity of Avellaneda. On the general question there is no doubt that Mr. Watts is right and that Mr. Ormsby is wrong. The publication of the spurious Second Part of ' Don Quixote' was an abominable piece of malice, and Cervantes did well to be angry. But just because as to this we fully agree with Mr. Watts do we feel indignant that he should confidently assert that Avellaneda was Lope de Vega. Lope was a great writer ? after Cervantes indubitably the greatest name in Spanish literature ; he was not only a man of genius, he was a good husband, a kind father, a loyal friend? one whose chief fault in our eyes was that he disliked Cervantes, and, blinded by his dislike, belittled ' Don Quixote.' To identify him with the low-minded dastard who called himself Avellaneda is to traduce the character of a man who deserves all respect. And Mr. Watts has really no ground to go upon, except that he dislikes Lope because Cervantes disliked him, and because Lope sneered at Cervantes. Cervantes himself seems not to have known who Avellaneda was; but he declares he was an Arragonese, for his style betrayed him, and surely the judgment of Cervantes on such a point ought to be accepted; but if Cervantes was right in this guess, Lope cannot have been Avellaneda. Yet Mr. Watts not merely suspects Lope, but he declares the case against him is clear. Mr. Watts urges that either Lope inserted the traces of Arragonese in order to deceive Cervantes, or that if he did not write the book, at any rate he wrote the preface. And yet Mr. Watts adduces not the smallest proof that Lope wrote either book or preface. The entire charge is a mere guess, founded on the very faulty syUogism that because Lope detested Cervantes and Avellaneda detested Cervantes, therefore Lope was Avellaneda. A third point on which we are disposed to quarrel with Mr. Watts is his treatment of Philip II. It appears almost impossible for Englishmen to be fair to Philip; it would seem as if they had neither forgotten nor forgiven the Armada. When Mr. Watta denounces Philip in the usual fashion for being a bigot and a tyrant, he ignores the fact that in trying to crush Protestantism in the Netherlands Philip was supported by the Spanish nation very much more unanimously than George III. by our forefathers when he tried to put down the revolt of the American colonies. Nor can it be questioned that autos de fe were spectacles highly popular in Spain. It is not, therefore, just to abuse Philip as if he did out of innate wicked* ness what his subjects much approved of his doing, and, indeed, he would have been a prodigy had he not done. It was not in the nature of things that the King of Spain should side with the Beformation, or that in opposing it he should fail to use fire and sword against heretics within his dominions. It is true that Philip did not care for "boetry," but he did not, like George IL, hate "bainting." He was a warm patron of Titian, and he was an amateur architect of some accomplishment. Generally speaking, Mr. Watts, like the Spanish biographers of Cervantes, is a little too much inclined to put faith in tradition. Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps has set an excellent example in regard to Shakspeare by inquiring precisely into the earliest obtainable mention of each tradition he records. It is difficult to avoid suspecting that a similar mode of proceeding would work much havoc among the traditions regarding Cervantes. It seems unlikely that the Spaniards who neglected and ignored Cervantes handed down traditions regarding him. A good deal of what is currently accepted may, after all, be the result of the stir made by the Academy little over a hundred years ago in preparing its edition. But though we thus differ from Mr. Watts, we none the less admire the wide reading and sound scholarship he shows on almost every page of his life of Cervantes, the great industry of which it bears evidence, ana the excellent criticism on ' Don Quixote' with which he concludes. His style is clear and unaffected?the style of a man who knows what he wants to say and endeavours to say it clearly and shortly. The appendices are as deserving of praise as the biography itself; and the reader will find that on the "Bomances of Chivalry" more particularly interesting, while it will be a real help to the student of ' Don Quixote.' One slight contradiction seems to have escaped the compiler. On p. 293 he rightly mentions that Lopez de Ayala, who was taken prisoner at Najera, was in the habit of reading ' Amadis de Gaul'; yet on p. 301 he adopts the theory that 'Amadisde Gaul' "grew into being with the arrival of the English contingent in Spain, in 1367, under the Black Prince." Having pointed out this, we may perhaps add that in the excellent bibliography which forms another appendix the date of Stevena's revision of Shelton is printed gs 1652. The correct date, of course, is that given by Mr. Ormsby, 1706. We must, in justice to Mr. Watts, defer speaking of his translation till more of it is before us. So far as this volume is evidence he has certainly spared no pains to ensure success.

A Letter to the Right Hon. Robert Peel containing a Free Enquiry into the Justice of the Queen's Exclusion from the Liturgy. LITERARY notices. No. 54. This point, by some people, may be deemed settled hy the Parliamentary decision, whilst others may regard it as one which is scarcely worth settlement. The latter would be clearly in the right, were it not for the felicity ol a description of men called Ministers, who create something out of nothing with inconceivable dexterity, and oblige honest people to follow them. Sometimes they will thank persons for playing the fool, and something worse at Manchester; and sometimes decide the fate of Queens in so peremptory a style, that flesh and blood cannot bear it; and weare obliged to split hairs with them in order to check their cavalier assumption. Parliament has declared for them, both as lo Manchester "and the Queen; which is nothing extraordinary, for in the same spirit of complaisance it once voted that a Bank note which sold for 14s. was worth twenty. In respect to all these decisions, tbe world at large think exactly as if Parliament had said nothing about the matter, and so will continue to think. Never did Parliamentary decision operate less upon human opinion than now-a-days. The argument of the present letter goes to shew that consistently with the Act of Uniformity, the name of her Majesty could not be withheld from the Liturgy without the express sanction of Parliament in the first instance. The reasoning is legally and logically precise upon the premises: and the constitutional argument is still stronger. For the discretion of excluding the Queen's name from tbe Liturgy, indeed, few contend; but like the Manchester letter of thanks, the folly having been committed must he defended. The result in both instances is precisely what it should be when influence carries what reason and humanity condemn ; the follies are out up with, but a thepsealed scorn is engendered which eats into character like* canker. Certain persons may be deeply entrenched and powerful; but while ten letters spell Manchester, and five the words woman and queen, their rank in general estimation is settled. Facts are out of thequestion ; be they wast they may, there is no popular redemption for di* men uno sent Lord Hutchinson to her Majesty, and indited royal gratitude for tbe performances of Manchester.

Letters and Sketches from Northern Nigeria. By MAITNr S. I KiscH, Assistant-Resident. With an Introduction by SIR PERCY GIRoUARD. (Chatto and Windus. 6s. net.) DEATH, no matter when it comes, is always a form of tragedy; but when it comes in time of youth, at the opening of a career full of promise, it is also pathetic. Those into whose hands the present volume falls, even though the name Martin Kisch had hitherto been unknown, cannot fail to be saddened oln behalf of the bright young life so suddenly and prematurely cut off, whose monument this volume forms. Martin Kisch. was born in 1884. He arrived in Northern Nigeria, in order to take his share in the government of that region, towards the end of 1908. Before the close of the following February be was dead. The Empire demands her toll of her servants in distant climes, but to most it is given to attempt something, and perhaps to achieve it. To Martin Kisch not even this satisfaction was granted. Nevertheless, during the few months which he spent in West Africa he secured the admiration, the affection, and the respect of all with whom he was brought into contact, and to those whom his loss affects closely the words of the Governor of the Protectorate, Sir Percy Girouard, which appear as a Preface to the volume, must indeed give some consolation, although a sad one:My personal acquaintance with him and his work was brief, but of sufficient duration to predict a brilliant future had he been spared. His early mastery of languages, his unfailing good humour and camaraderie, and his high mental gifts would have placed him anywhere in the Nigerian Service. . . The young officer's name can be placed upon the roll of men given up by British mothers, wives, and loved ones to the service of their country. The book is made up of the letters-natural, unpremeditated, full of freshness and charm, and permeated with a keen sense of humour-which young Kisch sent home from the day on which he left Liverpool. Mere personal domestic letters, their contents are slight, and go more to picture the character of the writer than of the country and the people to whom he had been sent. Nevertheless, there is much to be found in these letters which should prove useful to those who will follow in his footsteps. Through them all shines the zest which youth alone can give. The volume is Plentifully illustrated by means of both photographs and pen-and-ink sketches, for the author was an artist as well as an administrator. Its value is increased by an Appendix, giving an account of the history of the region and a bibliography of the literature dealing with it. In addition, there are maps of Northern Nigeria and also of North Africa.

First Love. By Marie Van Vorst. (Mills & Boon.) Miss Van Vorst's latest heroine belongs to a type with which modern fiction has made us familiar?the mature, but still fascinating woman passionately beloved by a man much younger than herself. An objectionable husband bars the way to their union, for the lady, though an American, has scruples on the subject of divorce; but when this trying person has at last the good taste to remove himself to another world, his widow, from the loftiest motives, chooses as husband a former admirer, thereby breaking her own heart, and causing her youthful adorer distress, from which he only recovers through the agency of an ** Irish-eyed " girl, the friend of his childhood. The story is very readable, though not remarkable for originality or distinction.

Edited from the original Spanish MS. by o the Author of " Don Esteban," &c. 8vo. v 2 vols. London, 1827. H. Colburn. A DARKER side of human nature wvas never 9 shewvn than that which now appears in Spain: o a weak government; a priestllood whose abuse a of authority is increased by their fear of losing a it; a people crushed and degraded,-these are it fitting materials for tyranny and bigotry. The f pages now before us present a most disnal pie- 1 ture: in the nineteenth century torture and q the Inquisition would seem things only to be N read; here we find them in fearful activity, if a indeed we may believe that this is a true nar. t ration, and not a fiction. We confess our fears i that it is an exaggeration for political purposes, r though prollbablly founded on actual facts. But u'e will give tlhe author's own story. Engaged in some effort of the constitutionalists, he is t detected and lodged in the Inquisition, where, i as he asserts, every effort is used to make him i (hiscover his associates :the following scenes enslue: I At about eight o'clock at night of the same day (Nov. 20th), Don Juanito entered I ray dungeon with a lantern in his hand, fol. lowed by four other men, whose faces were concealed by a piece of black cloth, shape(l above the head like a cone, and falling over the shoulders and clhest, in the middle of which were two holes for the eyes. I was half asleep vhen the noise of the doors opening awoke me, I and hy the dim light of the lantern I perceived those frightful apparitions. Imagining I was labouring under the effects of a dream, I earnestly gazed awhile on the group, till one of them approached, and pulling ne by the leather strap with which my arms were bound, gave me to understand by signs that I was to rise. Having obeyed this summons, my face was covered with a leather mask; and in this manner I was led out of the prison. After walking through various passages on a level with that of my dungeon, we entered a room, where I heard Zorrilla order mv attendants to untie the strap. * The agitation of the moment permitted me to utter only a few words, which, however, were not listened to; and I was hurried away to the farther end of the room, the jailer and his assistants exerting all their strength to secure me. Having succeeded in raising me from the ground, thev placed tinder my arm. pits two high crutchees, from which I remained suspended ; after which my right arm was tied to, the corresponding crutch,-whilst the left being kept in a horizontal position, they en. cased my hand open in a wooden glove extending to the wrist, which shut very tightly, and from which two large iron bars ran as far as the shoulder, keeping the whole in the same position in which it was placed. My waist and legs were similarly bound to the crutches by which I was supported ; so that I shortly remained without anv oither action than that of breathing, though; with difficulty. After forty.eight hours, during which my arms had been constantly pinioned, I did not, till this moment, very acutely feel the pain caused by the tightness of the new binding. Hlaving remained a short time in this painful position, that unmercifuLl tribunal returned to their former charges. Zorrilla, with a tremulous voice, that seenwed to evince his thirst for blood amild venigeance, repeated the first of those he had just read, niamely, whether I did not belong to a society whose object was to overthrow our holy religion, and the august throne of our catholic sovereign ? I replied, that it was imr possible I should plead guilty to an accusation if that nature: I Without any subterftige, say whether it is so,' le added in an angry tone. I It is not, sir,' I replied. The glove which guided my arm, and which seemed to be resting on the edge of a wheel, began now to turn; and with its movements I felt by degrees an acute pain, especially from the elbow to the shoulder, a general convulsion throughout my frame, and a cold sweat overspreading my face. The interrogatory continued; but Zorrilla's q(testion of I Is it so ? Is it so?' were the onl( words that struck my ear amidst the excruel ating pain I endured, which became so intense that I fainted away, and heard no more the voices of those caninibals. When I recovered my senses, I found myself stretched on the floor of my dungeon, my hands and feet secutred with heavy fetters and manacles, fastened by a thick chain, the nails of which my tormentors were still riveting. On this being concluded, the unpleasant mask which obstructed ny sight was removed, and I observed that Zoril a and DIon .Juanito vere the only persons that re. mained in the (ungeomi. Wishing to stifle before such hateful wititesses any expression of pain that might escape me amidst my severe. sufferings, I closed tightly the lapel of my coat with my teeth; but Zorilla, who noticed it, said, loading me with abusive epithets, that rage and despair were the only pains I felt. Left by those vretches stretche4 in the same place, l could have wished that the doors, vhich closed after them, should never again open. Eternal sleep was all I desired, and all I asked of Heaven. It was after much difficulty that r dragged myself to my bed. It seemed to me that the nolse of my chains would awaken the vigilanceit to yn jailers, whose preteti' wvas to rne tile most fatal ot my torinents .

Gabriel Denver
Brown, Oliver Madox
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gabriel Denver. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. By Oliver Madox-Brown. (Smith, Elder & Co.) Margaret and Elizabeth. By Katherine Saunders. (H. S. King & Co.) ' Gabriel Denver ' is a hideous story, hut a story not without some power. It can be told in few words. A young Australian getsengaged to an uninviting cousin, and takes passage with her in a sailing ship to England, where they are to be married. On board, however, there is a very charming young lady, and, after a good deal of " throbbing hearts" and " thrilling pulses," the young gentleman throws over the old love, Deborah, for the new love, Laura. Deborah is furious, and half mad with jealousy. She threatens vengeance, and finally sets the ship on fire. We have some seventy pages describing the scene; and, at last, Denver, Laura, and Deborah, find themselves alone in an open boat, without food or water. The horrors grow thicker and more revolting. Denver tries to make Laura quench her thirst at his bleeding arm. Deborah becomes quite mad, utters a parting curse, and dies. An inevitable ship saves the others, but they still have to undergo a violent storm and a brain fever before all goes right and they are fairly married. This then is the story of ' Gabriel Denver,' and anything much more coarse or disagreeable we have not read for a long time. Yet, as we have said, there is power about the book. The descriptions of the burning ship and the drifting boat, although rather overdone, are still graphic and vigorous. There are life-like touches here and there, as of a man who knows the sea and has heard a gale rattle through the rigging of a ship. Then, moreover, there is real skill in contriving a story the entire interest of which depends on three characters alone. Every now and then, too, we are startled by some observation which seems to indicate a frightful knowledge born of almost personal experience, lt is a mode of giving an atmosphere of reality to the book, which is rather French than English. Thus the writer says :? "Hunger endured for a while becomes strangely soporific and paralysing on the nerves, and this lack ot* energy which it causes is one of the chief reasons why people starve so easily in the midst of /rreat cities. There is even some slight pleasure % be obtained from it, for a starving man sees visions like an opium-eater's." _So, again, the cool assertion, " Indeed, human blood does not quench thirst," and some equally unpleasant reflections on suicide and other matters. As regards style, we should recommend Mr. Madox-Brown to write more simply, not to load his best passages with big words, like "tenebrous," and not five times in a single volume to talk of things being " silhouettes " against the sky.

Margaret and Elizabeth
Saunders, Katharine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miss Saunders's little work forms a pleasing contrast to the usual tedious histories of the flirtations of vacuous men and vulgar women. The author has an eye for character, and a love and knowledge of the sea and seafaring folk. These latter, though rather idealized, and in some cases a little stilted in their language, are too full of character to be other than life-like. Though simple people, they are refined by their contact with nature in its grandest phase, and the best of them attain almost to grandeur in their moral proportions. There is something in the associations of seafaring people that tends to elevate them, where there is any natural thoughtfulness to begin with; while the commoner specimens of humanity, though coarse and sensual, are not generally addicted to the meaner vices. Our author, however, although not ignoring the other side of the picture, prefers to direct our attention to the best examples of her favourite class; and in the little group of fishermen and sailors, with their wives, to which she introduces us, has given a fresh proof of her sympathetic skiU in handling this sort of subject. The plot of the tale is not very original,?' Enoch Arden' with a difference,?the difference in this case being that the long exile of Hector Browne paved the way for a better understanding and more perfect happiness with his wife. The wife, Margaret by name, has had a love affair of an innocent nature before her marriage with him. She has been brought up and made much of by a lady of fortune in the neighbourhood, and has thereby acquired refinement and aspirations above her condition. This has resulted in an attachment between herself and the son of the house. It is mainly through the urgency of what she considers a hopeless passion, and to secure herself against the treachery of her own heart, that she consents to marry the rude fisherman who is so fondly attached to her. On her wedding-day she is summoned to an interview with her former lover, and finds, too late, that he was prepared to do her justice. The misunderstandings necessary to a novel arise out of this episode. Margaret is driven from her husband's house, and takes refuge with the supposed widow, Elizabeth Vandereck. Hector, after taking, as he imagines, a fatal revenge on Kennedy, leads a wandering life. The incidents which have so important an effect on these divided lives, are powerfully told, while the mental struggles of Margaret and Hector, the strong repulsion which at first divides them, and the stronger love which eventually re-unites them, are so analyzed as to rivet our interest in the strongest manner fiction can attain. When the pair have at length begun what promises to be a settled life of domestic happiness, the fear which Hector's guilt has made inseparable from his nature, drives him forth again, and the latter part of the tale is taken up with his adventures when cast away upon an island, where he meets the long-lost husband of Elizabeth, and from which the two return to find their admirable wives still faithful, and the stain of homicide removed from Hector's name. The healthy piety of Elizabeth, the more romantic cast of Margaret's pure nature, the bluff honesty of stout Joshua Vandereck, and the passionate intensity of Hector, a good man warped by the supremacy of one misguided impulse, and winning his way to better things by the slow discipline of repentance and suffering, contribute to make this story what we have said it is a successful contrast to the mass of fictitious rubbish it is our duty to peruse.

The Tragedy of Featherstone.
Farjeon, B. L.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Tragedy of Featherstone. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. By B. L. Farjeon. 3 vols. (Ward & Downey.) Borderland. By Jessie Fothergill. 3 vols. (Bentley & Son.) Our Own Pompeii: a Romance of To-morrow. 2 vols. (Blackwood & Sons.) 4 The Tragedy of Featiierstoxe ' is a novel without a love story, yet it is readable. It would not bear a very critical examination, for Mr. Far j eon seems to be quite careless as to the form in which he casts his narrative. Every device which in less competent hands tends to dulness suits him well enough; soliloquy, retrospect, extracts from diaries, letters, long conversations chiefly monologues, all serve the purpose of conveying the story to the reader, and his natural gifts of humour and of sympathy carry him through very happily. Now he takes a hint from Gaboriau, and introduces an elaborate bit of detective's business, and now he follows Mr. Besant in studying the hard-worked poor in the East End of London. He does not suggest a palace of delight, but he is sure that coffee palaces ought to be painted with bright colours, and should vie with the gin-shops in brilliant lighting. His style is without affectation and always perfectly clear, he writes with energy, and one catches the infection of his vigorous sympathy, so that, although his story presents no very puzzling complications, one can follow the unwinding of the skein with a good deal of pleasure. The story, too, has many a touch of true pathos, and in the chief figure, that of Mrs. Earnshaw, the author has given a touching picture of a noble character.

Borderland
Fothergill, Jessie
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Borderland' shows an improvement in Miss Fothergill's method of telling a story. Throughout the book she has refrained from introducing little essays upon questions which interest her, and upon which she was formerly anxious to instruct her readers. She is now a writer of considerable experience, and it was time that she should overcome the temptation which besets young and energetic writers when they feel their own power. This temptation she has successfully resisted, and her self-restraint meets with its reward. 4 Borderland' is a better constructed piece of work than any of her previous books; the reader's attention is kept more closely to the story, and he is not left with that impression of inequality and disappointment which Miss Fothergill has often created. The defects of * Borderland* are, therefore, not due to the method of telling the story. But it has defects. There are too many characters contending for the first place, and of the three men, the one who becomes most prominent by being mada most intelligible is unfortunately the most commonplace. Of the other two, the bad hero, who starts with possibilities of interest, remains indistinct, and the clever one, who serves the important purpose of connecting the others, ultimately surprises the reader and makes him conclude that the author has changed her mind about the character, or has been unable to give it consistent development. There is no difficulty about the heroine. The second lady is, however, more interesting, because she is something of a puzzle. But the reader has no sufficient opportunity of understanding what is the bond between her and the bad hero, or what is the nature of the fervid attachment she feels for him. In dealing with the heroine, too, the author seems to have set herself against sentiment. This is a pity; for in the delineation of the finer qualities of love lies her best power. The scene is laid in and around Barnard Castle, and the story gains all the charm of tho picturesque which Miss Fothergill knows weil how to use.

Our Own Pompeii: A Story of Tomorrow
anonymous
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is bright satire and touches of humour that is fresh, yet somehow familiar, in some of the scenes and dialogues of ' Our Own Pompeii.' " A romance of to-morrow," by a nameless author, it a little suggests the flavour of ' That Very Mab,' and may possibly prove to be the work of Miss M. Kendall. Unless it were to save the situation and dissemble certain sharply pointed allusions to political personages and crises, and soften down a somewhat bitter presentation of society and its hobbies, there is no reason why it should not have been called "a romance of to-day." There are plenty of typical and scarcely exaggerated examples of manners, tactics, and characters, of such actuality that no phantom future need be saddled with them. Sufficient unto the dav are the evil and the good thereof. The latest attitudes in literature, art, and politics are presented in a way to make poseurs of all sorts either laugh or wince, according to their particular " laws of nature"; but all that is keen and good would have seemed keener and better had the book been reduced by at least one-half. What one expects in a satire is a series of dissolving views held together rather by generals than particulars. We may, therefore, take it amiss in ' Our Own Pompeii' when a certain Claud and his Claudia assume the parts of hero and heroine, for all the world as if their " environment" were that of the common three-volume kind. It might be possible to be touched by Claud's rather " bright-boy " attitude, his growing " subjectivity," his illness, even his death, did we not feel that in the present connexion he has no business to go through any such phases. Readers who prefer to dally with the " views " of Messrs. Leo, Gradley, Redburn, and otheT crusaders will probably agree that serious love-making and typhoid fever (always too much with us) need not have been here insisted upon.

SOME PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF A DISAPPOINTED MAN. WITH AN ILLUSTRATION BY GEORGE CRUIKSHANK. ARE you a sympathetic reader? If not, I pray you to pass over the few pages which constitute this article, and indulge your risible propensity with the happier effusions of the laughing philosophers of this Miscellany. I have no cachinnatory ambition, and would have my leaves well watered, not with the sunny drops of joy, but with the camomilical outpourings of sorrow. Concluding that my request .is granted, I will now proceed, sympathetic reader, to narrate, a few passages. of: my ,.strange, eventful history." I am a disappointed man,-nay, I ..was even a disappointed baby; for it was calculated that the parental anticipations ot my forebears would have been realised on the 1st of May 1792, whereas, by some contradictory vagary of Dame Nature, I entered this valley of tears on the 1st of April I This ought to have' been considered prognosticatory of my -future disappointments, 'and, the law of Sparta should have been rigidly enforced; for what' are crooked limbs to a crooked destiny? ' ' It was the intention. of my- father (whose 'name was Jacob Wise) to have had me christened after my mdteriial uncle, Theodosius Otter, Esq.; but, having selected a stuttering',godfather, I was unfortunately baptized as " The-odd-dose-us Oth-er Wise." Nor was this the only disappbintment which' attended me on this occasion, for the pew-opener having received instructions to clean the copper coalscuttle in the vestry-room,' the basin which contained the vitriol necessary for that purpose was by some means or other placed in the font.; and to' this (lay I have more the appearance of a tattooed Indian 'than a Christian Englishman. My babyhood was composed of a series of disappointments. My hair was to have been, in the words of the monthly nurse, " the most beautifulest horburn," but sprouted forth a splendid specimen of that vegetable 'dye called carroty. I was to have been "as straight as an arrow;" but a cup of tea ihaving been spilled over me as I lay in the servant's lap before the, kitchen fire, I became so dreadfully warped that I am now a sort of demi-parenthesis, or, as a malicious punster once called me, " a perfect bow'." I had the measles very mildly, as it was affirmed, for the whole virulence of the disorder displayed itself in one enormous pustule on the tip of my nose. This luminary so excited my infant wonder, that my eyes (really fine for green) were continually riveted to the spot, and have never forgotten it, for one or other of them is invariably engaged in searching for the lost treasure. I was not in convulsions above a dozen times during teething; but no sooner had I completed my chaplet of pearls, than the strikingweight of a Dutch clock which overhung my cradle dropped into my mouth, and convinced me of the extreme simplicity of dental surgery. My "' going alone " was the source of an infinitude of anxieties to my excellent mamma, who was so magnificently proportioned that it ... - . 7. .., 0. was many months before I could make the circuit of her full-flounced printed calico wrapper without resting. Poor mamma! she lost her life from a singular mistake. The house in which we lived had taken fire, and two good-natured neighbours threw Mrs. Wise out of the window instead of a feather-bed. She alighted on the head of Captain S-, who was then considered the softest man in the three kingdoms, and received little injury by the ejectment; but her feelings were so lacerated by the mistake, that she refused all food, and lived entirely by suction, till she diedfrom it. I will pass over my school-days, merely observing en passant that "d Each day some unlucky disaster Placed me in the vocative case with my master," a squabby, tyrannical, double-jointed pedagogue. He was nicknamed Cane-and-Able, and I can testify to the justness of the nomenclature. At college the same mis-fortune attended me. There was ever an under-current of disappointment, which rendered all my. exertions nugatory. If I was by accident "full of the god," I could never knock down any one but a proctor. If I determined on keeping close in my rooms, the wind immediately changed to N.E. by N. at which point my chimneys smoked like a community of Ya-Mynheers. My maternal uncle, Theodosius Otter, Esq. had signified that my expectations from him must be regulated entirely by my academical distinctions, and I was " pluck'd for my little-go." This occurred three months before the old booby's death. My legacy consisted of a presentation to the Gooseborough free school. The time at length arrived for me to fall in love. I experienced the first symptom of this epidemic at a bombazine ball in the city of Norwich. Selina Smithers was the name of my fair enslaver: she was about nineteen, fair as Russia tallow, tall, and somewhat slender. Indeed her condition is perhaps better described by " the slightest possible approximation to lanky." During one short quadrille she told me of all her tastes, hopes, experience, family connexions, (including a brother at sea,) expectations 'probable and possible, and of two thousand seven hundred and forty-five pounds, fourteen shillings, and sixpence, standing in her own name in the three and a half per cents. With the last ckassez I was a victim. At the close of the ball I handed Selina and her mamma into a green fly, and found the next morning that I had a violent cold in my head, and a violent heat in my heart. As I flourished the brass knocker of Mrs. Smithers' door on the following day, the clock of St. Andrew's church struck two; and chimed a quarter past, as a girl strongly resembling a kidney-potato, red and dirty, gave me ingress into a room with green blinds, seven horsehair-bottomed chairs, a round mahogany table, four oil-paintings (subjects and masters unknown), two fire-screens of yellow calico fluted, and a very shabby square piano. On the music-rest was the song, "1 We met,-'twas in a crowd:' Singular coincidence,-we met in a crowd ! The door opened, and Selina bounded into the room like a young fawn. Our eyes met, and then simultaneously sought the carpet. I know not what object her pale blue orbs encountered; but mine fell on the half-picked head of a red herring I " Can it be possible," thought I, " that Selina- Pshaw ! her brother has returned from sea; and to his account I placed the body of the vulgar fish. I took her hand, and gracefully led her to a chair, and then seated myself beside her. Our conversation grew animated,-confiding. She recapitulated the amount of her three and a half per cents, and in the most considerate manner inquired into my pecuniary situation. I was then possessed of seven thousand pounds; for my father, during the three last years of his life, had been twice burned out, and once sold up, and was thus enabled to leave me independent. She could not conceal her delight at my prosperous situation,-generous creature I Possessing affluence herself, she rejoiced at the well-doing of others. Day after day passed in this delightful manner, until I ventured to solicit her to become my wife. Judge of my ecstasy when, bending her swan-like neck until her fair cheek rested on the velvet collar of my mulberry surtout, she whispered almost inaudibly, "' How can you ask me such a question ?" " How can I ask you such a question? Because-because it is necessary to my happiness. Oh! name the happy hour when Hymen's chain-that chain which has but one link-shall bind you to me for ever !" She paused a moment, and then faltered out, "T To-morrow week." I fell upon my knees. Selina did the same; for, in my joy at her compliance, I had forgotten that one chair was supporting us both. Oh, what a busy day was that which followed! I entered Skelton's (the tailor's) shop with the journeymen. I ordered three complete suits ! As the rolls were taken into Quillit's parlour, I was shown into the office. The worthy lawyer thrice scalded his throat in his anxiety to comply with my repeated requests to " see him immediately." He came at last. A few brief sentences explained the nature of my business, and he hastened to accompany me to Selina. I was so excited l)y the novelty of my situation, that I fell over the maid who was cleaning the step of the door, and narrowly escaped dragging Quillit after. Had lie fallen, I shudder at the contemplation of the probable result; for he was a man well to do in the world, and enjoyed a rotundity of figure unrivalled in the good city of Norwich. His black waistcoat might have served for a bill of fare to an eating-house, for it exhibited samples of all Mrs. Glass's choicest preparations. Away we went, realising the poet's description of Ajax and CaInillu: "When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw, The line too lahours, and the words move slow: Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain, Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main." We resembled Reason andI Hope, or one of Pickford's barges and a towing-horse. The little brass knocker was again in my hand, the kidney-potato was again at the door, and I led in the perspiring lawyer, but looked in vain for that expression of admiration which I fondly anticipated wvouild have illumined his little grey eyes at the sight of ny Venusian Selina. " This is Mr. Quillit,' said 1. "Indeed P" replied Selina. "We have come, mum," said Quillit, " to arrange a very necessary preliminary to the delicate ceremony which my f'riend Wise has informed me will take place on this day week." Selina blushed. Her mother (bless me! I 've quite overlooked her!) screwed up her face into an expression between laughing and crying; and I-I pushed one hand through my hair, and the other into my breeches pocket. "' Mum," continued Quillit, " our business this morning is to make the arrangements for your marriage-settlement; and my friend Wise wishes to know what part of your two thousand--" " Seven hundred and forty-five pounds, fourteen shillings, and sixpence," said I sotto voce. "-You wish settled upon yourself." " Oh, nothing,-I require nothing !" exclaimed Selina. " Hur-!" said I, half rising from my chair in ecstasy at her disinterestedness. "Hem I" coughed Quillit, and took out his toothpick. "Nothing I" I at length ejaculated. " No, Selina; you shall not be subject to the accidents of fortune. Mr. Quillit, put down two thousand pounds." And so he did. The day before my intended nuptials I had paid my customary visit to Selina, and it was arranged that the settlement should be executed (what a happy union of terms!) that night. I had left but a few minutes when 1 missed my handkerchief. I returned for it. The kidney-potato shot out of the house as I turned the corner of the street. I found the door ajar, and, not considering any ceremony necessary, I walked into the parlour. I had put my handkerchief into the left pocket of my coat when I was somewhat startled by a burst of very boisterous male and female merriment. I paused. A child's treble was then heard, and in a moment after a cdid-a live child entered the room crying most piteously. It ceased on beholding me; and when its astonishment had subsided, it sobbed out, " I want mamma!" " Mamma?" said L. " And who 's mamma?" My query was answered from the first floor. " Come to mamma, dear I" shouted-Selina! I don't know what the sensations of a humming-top in full spin may be, but I should imagine they are very similar to those which I expe;rienced at this particular moment. When I recovered, I was stretched on the hearth-rug with my head in the coal-scuttle, surrounded by my Selina, her mother, the maid, and I suppose her " brother at sea." ",What is the matter, love ?" said- You know whom I mean,-I can't write her name again. "Nothing, madam," I replied, "nothing; only I anticipated being married to-morrow,-but I shall be disappointed." The ensuing week 1 received notice of action for a breach of promise of marriage; the ensuing term the cause was tried before an intelligent jury; and the ensuing day Quillit handed me a bill for seven hundred and sixty-two pounds, one shilling, and eightpence, being the amount of damages and costs in Smithers i crsus W ise. I paid Quillit, sold my house and furniture at Norwich, and took up my abode at Bumbleby, in Lancashire, resolving to be as love-proof as Miss Martineau, which resolution I have religiously observed to this day. I was, however, involved in one other tender affair, by proxy, which produced me more serious annoyances than even my own. I became acquainted with a merry good-looking fellow, of the name of Thomas Styles, who had come from somewhere, and was related to somebody, but no one recollected the who or the where. In the same town lived an old gentleman, who rejoiced in the singular name of Smith. He was blessed with one daughter and a wife. The latter did not reside with him, having taken up her permanent residence in a small octagonal stone building in the dissenters' burial ground. Styles, by one of those accidents common in novels, but very occasional in real life, had become acquainted with Miss Smith. They had gone through those comparative states of fieling,-acquaintance, friendship, love; and, when I was introduced to him, he was just in want of a good fellow to help him into matrimony. I was just the boy; my expensive experience, my good-nature, my leisure,-in short, there was nothing wanting to fit me for this confidential character. Now, be it known that old Smith had very strong parliamentary predilections, and one of his sine qua nons was, that his son-in-law should be M. P. for somewhere,-Puddle-dock would do,-but an M. P. he must be. Politics were of no consequence; but he must have a decided opinion that the Bumbleby railway would be most beneficial, if carried through a swampy piece of ground which Smith had recently purchased. Styles was of the same opinion; but then he was only a member of the " Bull's-eye Bowmen," and Mr. Snuffmore's sixpenny whist club. I had made myself particularly uncomfortable one afternoon, in Styles' summer-house, with three glasses of brandy and water and four mild havannas, when old Smith rushed in to announce the gratifying intelligence that Mr. Topple, the member for our place, had fallen into the crater of Mount Vesuvius, and that nothing had been heard from him since, but a solitary interjection, in consequence of which there was a vacancy in the representation. The writ had been issued, and so had an address from Mr. Wiseman, a gentleman possessing every virtue under the sun, save and except a due sense of the advantages of Smith's swamp to the railway. This was conclusive. Smith made a speech, which, being for interest and not for fame, was short and emphatic. " Tom, you must contest this election, or never darken my doors again." "M Ny dear, sir," said Tom, " nothing would give me greater pleasure; but-" " I'll do all that. I'll form a committee instanter," replied Smith; leave all to me. Capital hand at an address-pith, nothing but pith. Ever see my letter in support of the erection of a pound for stray cattle ?-pithy and conclusive:-' Inhabitants of Bumbleby, twenty shillings make a pound.' The motion was carried." ", One moment, said Toni. " It will appear so presumptuous on my part, unless a deputation waited on me." C4 Certainly,-better, by all means,-I'11 form one directly," said Smith. " In the mean time, issue a placard to prevent the electors making promises, and--" " I will," said Smith. And so he did; for in an hour afterwards there was not a dead wall in Bumbleby but was papered from one end to the other. " Other Wise," said Styles, as Smith waddled up the garden, " this won't do for me. I couldn't make a speech of ten consecutive lines, if the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall were depending upon it." "Pooh I" replied I, rolling my head about in that peculiar style which an over-indulgence in bibicals will induce. " It 's a fact," replied Tom. " Now, my dear fellow, you can serve me and your country at the same time. Smith would be equally gratified at your return for Bumbleby; your opinions are the same as my own; and your abilities require no panegyric from me." Whether it was the suddenness of the probable glory, or the effect of the tobacco and brandy and water, I sat speechless. Silence gives consent, says an old adage, and so did the town of Bumbleby the next morning, for every quarter cried out " Other Wise for ever!" It was too late to retract; and accordingly I was nominated, seconded, and unanimously elected by a show of hands. A poll was demanded; and, after a short contest of two days, it was announced in very large letters, and still larger figures, Wiseman, .786 Other Wise, . . . 92 Majority, . . -694 I was satisfied, and so was my party. During the preparation for this unfortunate contest I had allowed Styles to draw ad libitum upon my banker. His friendship knew no bounds; his liberality was as boundless; and so chagrined was lie at the defeat I had experienced, that he left the next morning without an adieu. I must confess that I was rather disappointed at his sudden retreat, and considerably more so on finding that his exertions in my behalf had reduced my income from four hundred pounds to forty pounds per annum. For the first time I doubted his friendship. Subsequent inquiries convinced me he was a scoundrel, and I commenced an immediate pursuit of him, and an action at law. Some three months afterwards, I was sauntering about the streets in the neiglhbourhood of St. James's Square, when I encountered Styles. His surprise was as great as mine, but not so enduring; for, advancing towards me with all the coolness of the 1st of December, he exclaimed, " Other Wise, how are you ? I dare say you thought my sudden departure odd; I did myself; but I couldn't help it. I'm sorry to hear how much your contest has distressed you. I was the cause. Give me your check for fifty pounds, and here 's a bill for five hundred, due to-morrow." Suiting the action to the word, he handed me an acceptance for that amount inclosed in a dirty piece of paper. All this was so rapidly said and done, that before I was aware of it I had given him a draft on Drummond, shaken hands with him, and was mechanically discussing a mutton-chop and a bottle of sherry, which I had unconsciously ordered in the delirium which succeeded Styles' unheard-of generosity. I went the next day to Messrs. Podge and Co. in Lombard-street, with my promise-to-pay-Eldorado in my pocket. I entered the count- ing-house, presentcd my bill, and fully expected to have received either bank-notes or gold in exchange. I waited a few minutes, and wvas then ushered into a back-room, and politely requested to account for this money promissory document. "From whom did you receive this bill ?" said a gentleman with a powdered head and an immense watch-chain. "From Mr. Styles." "Where does he live ?" "I don't know exactly; but I hope there is nothing irregular." "You can step in, Banks," said the powdered head; and a stout well-fed man, in a blue coat, with the City arms on the button, did step in, and very unceremoniously proceeded to inspect the contents of my various pockets. " Conclusive !" said the powdered head, as he minutely examined a small piece of crumpled paper which had occupied one of the pockets of my small-clothes. I was handed into a hackney-coach, and then into the Mansionhouse, where I was informed that I was to live rent-free for the next veek in his Majesty's jail of Newgate. The bill was a forgery I The day of trial approached. I walked into the dock with mens conscia recti depicted on my countenance. I knew I was innocent of any felonious intention or knowledge; and was certainly very much disappointed at being found guilty upon the silent evidence of the little piece of crumpled paper, which was covered with pen and ink experiments on the signature of John Aligold and Co. whose name occupied the centre of Styles' bill. The recorder (in a very impressive manner, I must allow, for his white handkerchief' was waving about the whole time) passed sentence of death upon me, and I was ordered to be taken from thence, and on the Monday following to be hung by the neck till I was dead. A pleasant termination, truly! I was led, stupified by the result of my trial, back to the prison. When I regained the use of my faculties, my awful situation became horridly apparent. There was I, an innocent and injured man, condemned to suffer the extreme penalty of the law. For endeavouring to gain possession of my own, I was about to become a spectacle for the fish-fags and costermongers of London,-to have my name handed down to posterity by that undying trumpeter of evil-doers, Mr. Catnach, of the Seven-dials, who alternately delights the public with " three yards long of every new song, and all for a penny," and " the last dying speech and confession" of those who, dreading to be bedridden, and possessing an unconquerable aversion to doctors' stuff' and virtue, have danced upon nothing, and died with their shoes on. "How often," thought I, " have I seen a withered hag kneeling at the rails of an area, exciting the sympathies and curiosity of servants of all-work, and greasy melting cooks, by the recital of atrocities that the hand of man never executed. ' Here 's a full, true, and 'tickler account of a horrid murder, which was performed in the New-cut, Lambeth, on the body of a baked-'tater manufacturer, who was savagely and inhumanly murdered by that ferocious and hard-hearted villain, Benjamin Burker ;-here you have the account how, arter putting a poor man's plaister, composed of pitch and bird-lime, over the unhappy indivigual's moauf until the breath was out on his body, he shoved him into the oven, and lived seven days and nights on baked taters and the manyfacterers.' Thus might I be misrepresented. The thought was madness !" The morning at length arrived for my execution; but, oh I the horrors of the night that preceded it I Young, and in the full enjoyment of life, the morrow was to, bring me death I In a little week, the hand which I then gazed on, would be a banquet for the red worm of the grave. Even the mother who watched the cradle of my infancy would have turned loathingly away from the corrupted mass; the earth which covered me would be thought unhallowed, and my name would become symbolical with crime. But even this, was nothing to the contemplation of the scene I had still to enact. To be led forth " the observed of all observers," who would look on me with an eye, not of pity, but of morbid curiosity,-to fhang quivering in the air,-and to feel, while consciousness remained, that each shuddering of struggling nature was imparting a savage, delight to those who could be the willing witnesses of the sacrifice of a fellow-creature! My brain sickened with its agony, and I fell into a stupor which my jailor called sleep. I was pinioned, and led forth to die. Life had now no charm for me, -I was beyond the reach of hope, and death was a desired blessing. The hangman's hands were about my neck,-the blood curdled in my veins as I felt the deadly embrace of the cord. I longed for the signal of departure; but I was again disappointed. I was reprieved,for I awoke, and found that the bill and all its frightful consequences were but the result of having eaten a hearty supper of pork-chops very much underdone! So I was once again a disappointed man, though, on this occasion, I must own, most agreeably so.

The Life and Works of Charlotte Bronte and I her Sitters. With Introductions to the | Works by Mrs. Humphry Ward. 6 vols. (Smith, Elder & Co.) (Fint Notice.) The true criticism of the work of the sisters Bronte ought to present to our imaginations on a general view an aspect at once large and simple. It ought to be no more complex than the sight from any vantage point of the famous moors above Haworth parsonage, or, we might add, the picture which memory would bear away even after many hours' wanderings in those almost classic haunts. The journeyings would reveal, of course, many grim or appealing details unapparent in the general prospect, but imagination, after we had come south or gone north, would but see a great picture, synthetic and simple, and would have wrought its own sense of the colour and " spirit" of the heath-lands. The deeper essence of the place would still be a secret of nature, that knows the meaning of matter and spirit and all their manifestations in the universe. So the general features in thoroughgoing Bronte criticism will be sheer, simple, outstanding, the details deftly set in subsidiary proportion. For Charlotte and Emily Bronte were strange and intense souls, and in their books it is the soul - fact that matters. True, there are a hundred less inspired things; let them be quietly touched and passed. The great poetic, passionate, creative stages are elemental and bold, easily seen by those that can see; and having duly marked them and told their quality, criticism has done its broad work. It cannot sound their mystery, wring out the secret of their inspiration, any more than the traveller on the heath can penetrate to the secret below the colour and the lonely beauty of nature. Mrs. Humphry Ward is sometimes thoughtful in her Bronte studies, but she also dwells unduly on none too relevant details. We could wish, on the other hand, that she had boldly considered a vital matter that must be settled before the absolute worth of the sisters' work in literature, or the evolution of literature, is satisfactorily determined. In her introduction to 'Jane Eyre,' she writes with pardonable gratification of the unquestioned spell exercised to-day by Charlotte Bronte's novels on the imagination of England. But this suggests the important, and here unconsidered, question whether the reading world on the whole realizes what great fiction ought to be, whether its general ideal is such that its enthusiasm in the case of Miss Bronte can be said to be a really critical tribute. It is to be feared, as a matter of fact, that England and the Continent have paid more attention to the body than to the spirit in fiction; and, despite Mrs. Ward's high opinion of latter-day developments of the novel, it is by no means yet certain that it can become a supreme medium of literature. A worthy instrument it has been, in some instances a noble one. We have even seen achievements that have suggested the supreme, the novelist in such rare cases showing great soul in action, giving embodiment to, as we might say, spiritual romance, indicating in characters and destinies something of the Soul above souls, vision of the Power that " ever accompanies the march of man." The general desire, however, is that he should walk " rationally " upon earth, and paint the body and circumstance of his age or another. Much ?too much?is expected of him as a delineator of daily manners, till often he becomes but the photographer of individuals, the Autolycus of data that have no more than a transient importance. It might almost seem that the great novelist must be a master of two arts?that of revealing spiritual forces, permanent passions, like a great poet or dramatist, and that of imparting imaginative significance to more ordinary actualities. The two powers?the interaction of the two worlds?make the true novel. To be thus a seer and a convincing delineator of actuality so far as actuality is essential ? a keen problem ? necessitates vision, intuition, opportunity, aud experience on such a scale that we must needs be modest in our expectations on the score of permanent fiction. The vision and the intuition are of the greater importance; on their possession and cultivation depends the fact whether fiction can be absolute literature rather than excellent description or analysis, or the work, as it were, of a syndicate of reporters in the service of a *4 time spirit," which may not be by any means a true daughter of the eternal. If the vision of the sisters Bronte sometimes failed them, it was uncommon at its best. And even as regards their experience or their knowledge of life, Mrs. Ward, like many critics, seems to entertain a too narrow idea. The sources of knowledge are subtle as well as obvious. Knowing the Celtic inheritance of the sisters (of which more anon), their contact with a world of great Northern tradition, the keen ordeals to which their sensitive spirits were subjected at home and abroad, which stirred unimagined forces in their natures, and made them critics of life in a higher sense than, perhaps, is commonly realized?understanding all this, and more, and remembering the subtle ways in which nature and life speak to the chosen mind, we may well be chary of complaint as to lack of knowledge in their case. It is the soul that matters, not the number of miles travelled, the number of cities seen in the actual world. Charlotte Bronte has told, as she was eminently fitted to tell, the ordeals of souls that live alone, in more senses than one?the never finished tragedies of deep natures in plain frames. Her unhappy governesses and teachers are more than governesses and teachers; they are types, old and new as the passion for sympathy, the lack of consideration in any woman's sphere. And crises and partings, journeys and reunions, in her pages sometimes seem to tell of people in more mysterious lands and on more mysterious seas than ours. They speak of souls rather than bodies. Faults and crudities of construction in 'Jane Eyre' and its successors?matters with which Mrs. Ward deals at length ? are sufficiently obvious. Had Charlotte Bronte been careful enough or courageous enough to free herself boldly from old theories of plot-making and other prepossessions, her story of the struggle of duty against affinity would have led to truer ordering, perhaps almost to real fusion, of material. But some of her critic's strictures on details are scarcely tenable. We may not always regard Mr. Rochester so gravely as his creator?he does not justify himself to the imagination in the way of Paul Emmanuel; but his early talk with Jane Eyre is scarcely the delectable food for comedy which Mrs. Ward imagines. The judgment on the country-house party, also, is much too sweeping. Without taking sides on the interesting question of governess versus provincial society, one may gently urge that a governess of genius, in her merciless way, would be likely to detect and record an ugly side of thing* possessing more or less glamour for the polite. It is not really a case of an ignorant governess passing judgment on " high life "; it is injured and incisive genius casting critical eyes on humanity socially more favoured, but spiritually inferior. Convention may seek to put her out of court with scorn, but the spirit of critical judgment, especially after some of Miss Bronte's own stories, recorded by Mrs. Gaskell, will not be convinced that there may not be a great deal to be urged on the other side. It were better, no doubt, to invoke the comic spirit in the treatment of puch issues, but Haworth was not meet, alas! for her airy presence. Certainly Charlotte Bronte had not always the happiness of overcoming ordinary prejudices in the gleam of larger vision, nor had she the unfailing power of shaping ordinary material to artistic ends, as we see in the often delightful and sometimes poetical ' Shirley.' The novelist, as we have suggested, is on occasions hard set to be an artistic interpreter of permanent passion and minute and mobile actuality. But it is possible to slip on points of detail, to fail, now and then, in kindling imaginative life in ordinary material, and yet to be true again and again, in the high hours, to what the imagination recognizes as aoulfact. Because Charlotte Bronte so vividly interpreted soul-fact, not occasionally, but often, we know that, however fallible at other times, she was an eminent novelist. Mrs. Ward maintains the interesting, but, of course, by no means novel theory, that the genius of Charlotte Bronte was fundamentally Celtic. The racial spirit, or rather the deep human one as affected in the light and shadow, the momentum, the environment of a race of changeful fortunes, no doubt lives long and works subtly in unconsidered regions, and is an attractive, if rather tentative study, though put to strange uses by extremists too bent on dividing humanity into compartments. But leaving temperaments and workaday selves, and looking into the souls that live deeply, the souls that create permanent literature, we feel that they are of no race, they know not geographical boundaries. As to Charlotte Bronte and Ireland, she seemed unable to create aa Irish character ? the curate Malone ia ' Shirley' and the drunken Mrs. Sweeny ia * Villette' are beneath notice in this regari ?but it is obviously true that certain qualities well marked in Celtic nature and personality are apparent in her work. It is te be feared, however, that Mrs. Ward has tee conventional an idea of Celtic characteristics. Her remarks are a little too suggestive of Matthew Arnold's lectures on the 4 Study ot Celtic Literature'?lectures fruitful in their day and still useful, but not founded on a comprehensive acquaintance with even translated Gaelic literature and Irish or general Celtic personality. " Celtic melancholy" is but a half-truth. Joyousness is the dominant quality of much Gaelic literature?joyousness and n fierce zest of life. The theory of tho Celt's love of loneliness seems strange when we know that the idea of contention being " better than loneliness" passed iuto a proverb with one order of Celts. For the theory of " Celtic shrinking from all active competitive existence" it would be difficult to find any generai justification ancient or modern. Nor ds Mrs. Ward convincing when she tries te explain Bronte Celticism as a growth of the Ireland of the North, "on which commerce and Protestantism have set their grasp. This, although perhaps a popular notion, is but another half-truth; the Catholic and Celtic traditions and elements of Ulster are, in their way, outstanding. (In any case, did not the Rev. Patrick Bronte come of a south of Ireland family?) Mrs. Ward's consideration of the Celtic basis of the Bronte genius might have been much more interesting had she understood the manysidedness of the real Celticism, and that the Bronte sisters' practicality and order were no more alien to it on the whole than their share of the "vision that remakes the world." Were Gaelic literature accessible as a whole, it would clear away many misconceptions caused by taking it in snatches that concern widely severed years and varying circumstances, and give a disconnected and somewhat shadowy idea of the race or races. Its modern successor, Anglo-Irish literature, does not really display a true grip of later Irish realities, and political controversy has unfortunately obscured certain verities. The Celt has dreamed dreams, idealized his moors and hills, seen visions of hells and heavens that show a Dantesque feeling, without, of course, a Dantesque art; he has realized the tears of things, and known at stages the melancholy that for sensitive souls accompanies the fateful trends of life. But he framed the elaborate Brehon laws and a still more elaborate bardic system, pursued philosophic and scholastic ideals with a strange passion, and in modern days in more lands than one he has proved his genius as an empire-builder. Far from being an elusive creature, half within, half without, existence, he has shown at his highest a remarkable grip of both worlds Mrs. Ward, did ?be really know the various aspects of Celticism, might have profitably considered that phase of it which would appear to have lived a tenacious, if half-inscrutable, life in Emily Bronte rather than Charlotte. Yet the critic conscious of the highest reaches of English genius would claim much of hers as peculiar to his own race. There is truth on both sides. How much of the spiritual, the poetic, the divine even, lies below either racial consciousness, seldom coming into being or concrete embodiment ? This deeper human sub-consciousness, so to say, carno 10 consciousness in the Bronte sisters on their great moors, in their Yorkshire world of distinctive tradition, in the crises of their struggling years. It mixed with moods, and found outlet in forms in which Celt and Touton and all men find much of their more passionate selves. So, when all is said, the origins are of nature's underlying store: the result speaks for and to humanity.

PZCTZON. Tancred; or, The New Crusade. By B. D'ISRA ELI, M.P. I In 3 vols. London, 1847. C[UO~n NOTIC.]! THY second volume opens with a change of scene. Tancred has quitted the salons of London tor the gorgeous East for the " land which has never been blessed with that fatal drollery called a representative government, though Omniscience once deigned to trace out the polity which should rule it." These are the author's very words. Strange sentiments for an aspirant to office in a free country ! But his poetry is better than his politics, as all will admit who read the glowing sketch of JERUSALEM BY MOONLIGHT. The broad moon lingers on the summit of Mount Olivet, but its beam has long left the garden of Gethsemane and the tomb of Absalom, the waters of Kedron and the dark abyss of Jehoshaphat. Fill falls its splendour, however, on the opposite city, vivid and defined in its silver blaze. A lofty wall, with turrets and towers and frequent gates, undulates with the unequal ground which it covers, as it encircles the lost capital of Jehovah. It is a city of hills, far more famous than those of Rome; for all Europe has heard of Sion and of Calvary, while the Arab and the Assyrian, and the tribes and nations beyond, are as ignorant of the Capitolian and Aventine Mounts as they are of the 'Malvern or the Chiltern Hills. The broad steep of Sion, crowned with the tower of David; nearer still, Mount M1oriah, with the gorgeous temple of the God of Abraham, built, alas ! by the child of Hagar, and not by Sarah's chosen one; close to its cedars and its cypresses, its lofty spires and airt arches, the moonlight falls upon Bethesda's pool; further on, entered by the gate of St. Stephen, the eye, though 'tis the noon of night, traces with ease the Street of Grief, a long winding ascent to a vast cupolsed pile that now covers Calvary, celled the Street of Grief, because there the most illustrious of the human, as well as of the Hebrew, race, the descendeat of King David, and the divine Son of the most favoured of women, twice sank under that burden of suffering and shame which is now throughout all Christendom the emblem of triumph and of honour; passing over groups and masses of hduses built of stone, with terraced roofs or sur. mounted with small domes, we reach the hill of Salem, where Melehisedek built his mystic citadel; and still remains the hill of Scopas, where Titus gazed upon Jerusalem on the eve of his final assault. Titus destroyed the temple. The religion of Judwa has in turn subverted the fanes which were raised to his father and to himself in their imperial capital; and the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob is now worshipped before every altar in Rome. Jerusalem by moonlight! 'Tis a fine spectacle, apart from all its indissoluble associations of awe and beauty. The mitigating hour softens the austerity of a mountain landscape magnificent in outline, however harsh and severe in detail; and, while it retains all its sublimity, removes much of the savage sternness of the strange and unrivalled scene. A fortified city, almost surrounded by ravines, and rising in the centre of chains of far-spreading hills, occasionally offering, through their rocky glens, the gleams of a distant and richer land ! The moon has sunk behind the Mount of Olives, and the stars in the darker sky shine doubly bright over the sacred city. The all-pervading stillness is broken by a breeze, that seems to have travelled over the plain of Sharon from the sea. It wails among the tombs, and sighs imong the cypress groves. The palm-tree trembles as it passes, as if it were a spirit of woe. Is it the breeze that has travelled over the plain of Sharon from the sea ? Or is it the haunting voice of prophets mourning over the city that they could not save ? Their spirits surely would linger on the land where their Creator had deigned to dwell, and over whose impending fate Omnipotence had shed human tears. From this mount ! Who can but believe that, at the midnight hour, from the summit of the Ascension, the great departed of Israel assemble to gaze upon the battlements of their mystic city ? There might be counted heroes and sages, who need shrink from no rivalry with the brightest and the wisest of other lands; but the lawgiver of the time of the Pharaobs, whose laws are still obeyed; the monarch, whose reign has ceased for three thousand years, but whose wisdom is a proverb in all nations of the earth; the teacher, whose doctrines have modelled civilized Europe ;-the greatest of legislators, the greatest of administrators, and the greatest of reformers-what race, extinct or living, can produce three such men as these ! The last light is extinguished in the village of Bethany. The wailing breeze has become a moaning wind; a white film spreads over the purple sky; the stars are veiled, the stars are hid ; all becomes as dark as the waters of Kedron and the valley of Jehoshaphat. The tower of David merges into obscurity; no longer glitter the minarets of the mosque of Omar; Bethesda's angelic waters, the gate of Stephen, the street of sacred sorrow, the hill of Salem and the heights of Scopas, can no longer be discerned. Alone in the increasing darkness, while the very line of the walls gradually eludes the eye, the church of the Holy Sepulchre is a beacon light. Although the Duke, his father, insisted that he should be accompanied with a suite, very unromantic and very European, comprising a chaplain to keep his soul in order, a doctor to dose him, and a captain to aid him in his pleasures, his adventures are in the most extravagant vein of romance, utterly improbable and impossible. No long time elapses ere, when awaking from a sleep in a kiosk, he is introduced to THE HEROINE. That face presented the perfection of Oriental beauty, such as it existed in Eden, such as it may yet occasionally be found among the favoured races in the favoured climes, and such as it might have been found abundantly and for ever, had not the folly and malignity of man been equal to the wisdom and beneficence of Jehovah. The countenance was oval, yet the bead was small. The complexion was neither fair nor dark, yet it possessed the brilliancy of the north without its dryness, and the softness peculiar to the children of the sun without its moisture. A rich subdued and equable tint overspread this visage, though the skin was so transparent that you occasionally caught the streaky splendour of some vein like the dappled shades in the fine peel of beautiful fruit. But it was in the eye and its overspreading arch that all the Orient spake, and you read at once of the starry vaults of Araby and the splendour of Chaldean skies. Dark, brilliant, with pupil of great size and prominent from its socket, its expression and effect, notwithstanding the long eyelid of the desert, would have been those of a terrible fascination, had not the depth of the curve in which it reposed softened the spell and modified irresistible power by ineffable tenderness. This supreme organization is always accompanied, as in the present instance, by a noble forehead, and by an eyebrow of perfect form, spanning its face with undeviating beauty; very narrow, though its roots are invisible. The nose was small, slightly elevated, with long oval nostrils fully developed. The small mouth, the short upper lip, the teeth like the neighbouring pearls of Ormuz, the round chin, polished as a statue, were in perfect harmony with the delicate ears, and the hands with nails shaped like almonds. She proves to be a jewess of Aral) breed, by name Eva, and of course the energetic advocate of those claims of the Caucasian race which Air. DISRAELI has preferred with so much perseverance. The destinies of the Jewish blood are, according to her, to become the predominant powver in all the world. Tancred is completely subdued by her charms and arguments, and avows himmelf a champion of the cause thus eloquently sustained. Among other absurdities she prevails upon him to make a pilgrimage to Sinai, in hop)e of a revelation. En route Tancred passes through tile valley where SOLOMON once held his court, and which suggests the following rhapsody:Here were his pleasure gardens; these slopes were covered 'with his fantastic terraces, and the high places glittered with his pavilions. The fountain that supplied these treasured waters was perhaps the " sealed fountain" to which he compared his bride; and here was the garden palace where the charming Queen of Sheba vainly expected to pose the wisdom of Israel, as she held at a distance, before the most dexterous of men, the two garlands of flowers, alike in form and colour, and asked the great king, before his trembling court, to decide which of the two wreanhs was the real one. They are gone, they are vanished-these deeds of beauty and these words of wit ! The bright and glorious gardens of the tiaraed poet and the royal sage, that once echoed with his lyric voice, or with the startling truths of his pregnant aphorisms, end in this wild and solitary valley, in which, with folded arms and musing eye of long abstraction, Tancred halts in his ardent pilgrimage, nor can refrain from asking himself, " Can it then be true that all is vanity ?" Why-what-is this desolation ? Why are there no more kings whose words are the treasured wisdom of countless ages, and the mention of whose name to this moment thrills the heart of the Oriental, from the waves of the midland ocean to the broad rivers of the farthest Ind ? Why are there no longer bright-witted queens to step out of their Arabian palaces and pay visits to the gorgeous " house of the forest of Lebanon," or to where Baalbec, or Tadmor in the wilderness, rose on those plains now strewn with the superb relics of their inimitable magnificence ? And yet some flat-nosed Frank, full of bustle and puffed up with self-conceit-a race spawned perhaps in the morasses of some northern forest hardly yet cleared -talks of progress ! Progress to what, and from whence ? Amid empires shrivelled into deserts, amid the wrecks of great cities, a single column or obelisk of which nations import for the prime ornament of their mud-built capitals-amid arts forgotten, commerce annihilated, fragmentary literatures and copulations destroyed, the European talks of progress, because, by an ingenious application of some scientific acquirements, he has establishcd a society which has mistaken comfort for Civilization. He is set upon and made captive by a tribe ot Bedouins, who carry him to their Sheik, with whom he contracts an especial friendship, and who shares many of his subsequent adventures. Two of his English servants have been captured with him, and in the desert is this scene supposed to be enacted. A DIALOGUE IN THE DESERT. At this moment there was some little disturbance without the tent, which it seems was occasioned by the arrival of Tancred's servants, Freeman and Trueman. These excellent young men persisted in addressing the Arabs in their native English, and, though we cannot for a moment believe that they fancied themselves understood, still, from a mixture of pride and perverseness peculiarly British, they continued their valuable discourse as if every word told, or if not appre. hended, was a striking proof of the sheer stupidity of their new companions. The noise became louder and louder, and at length Freeman and Truemnan entered. "rWell," said Tancred, "and how have you been getting on?" "Well, my lord, I don't know," said Freeman, with a sort of jolly sneer; "we have been dining with the savages." "They are not savages, Freeman." "W ell, my lord, they have not much more clothes, any how; and as for knives and forks, there is not such a thing known." " AS for that, there was not such a thing known as a fork in England little more than two hundred years ago, and we were not savages then ; for the best part of Montacute Castle was built long before that time." i' I wish we were there, my lord." " I dare say you do; however, we must make the best of present circumstances. I wanted to know, in the first place, whether you had food; as for lodging, 'Mr. Baroni, I dare say, will manage something for you; and if not, you had better quarter yourselves by the side of this tent. With your own cloaks and mine, you will manage, very well." " Thank you, my lord. We have brought your lordship's things with us. I don't know what I shall do to-morrow about your lordship's boots. The savages have got hold of the bottle of blacking, and have been drinking it like anything." "' Never mind my boots," said Tancred; "w ve have got other things to think of now." " I told them what it was," said Freeman, Ad but they went on just the same." i' Obstinat2 dogs! " said Tancred. " I think they took it for wine, my lord," said Trueman; " I never see such ignorant creatures." " You find now the ad. vantage of a good education, Trueman." " Yes, my lord, we do, and feel very grateful to your lordship's honoured mother for the same. When we came down out of the mountains and see those blazing fires, if I didn't think they were going to burn us alive, unless we changed our religion I I said the catechism as hard as I could the whole way, and felt as much like a blessed martyr as could be." " Well, well," said Tancred, " I dare say they will spare our lives. I can. not much assist you here; but if there be anything you par. ticularly want, I will try and see what can be done." Free. man and Trueman looked at each other, and their speaking faces held common consultation. At length the former, with some slight hesitation, said, "We don't like to be troublesome, my lord, but if your lordship would ask for some sugar for us-we cannot drink their coffee without sugar." Ile proceeds upon his journey-under parol, however, the lady being, in truth, at the bottom of the whole affair, and the instigator of the Sheik in his apparent violence. Then he is attacked by fever, and Eva attends him, and talks theology, as she administers some miraculous pills. Among other scenes of travel depicted is this of A FEAST IN CANOBIA. The kitchen of Canobia was on a grand scale, though simple as it was vast. It was formed for the occasion. About fifty square pits, some four feet in length, and about half as deep, had been dug on the table-land in the vicinity of the castle. At each corner of each pit was a stake, and the four supported a rustic gridiron of green wood, suspended over each pit, which was filled with charcoal, and which yielded an equal and continuous heat to the animal reposing on the gridiron: in some instances a wild boar, in others a sheep-occasionally a couple of gazelles. The sheep had been skinned, for there had been time for the operation; but the game had only been split open, cleared out, and laid on its back, with its feet tied to each of the stakes, so as to retain its position. Whibile this roasting was going on, they filled the stomachs of the animals with lemons gashed with their daggers, and bruised pome. granates, whose fragrant juice, uniting with the bubbling fat, produced an aromatic and rosy gravy. The huntsmen were the cooks, but the greatest order was preserved; and though the Emirs and the great Sheikhs, heads of houses, retiring again into their divans, occupieds themselves with their nargillins, many a Mookatadgi mixed with the servants and the slavs, and delighted in preparing this patriarchal banquet, which I indeed befitted a castle and a forest. Within the walls they prepared rice, which they piled on brazen and pewter dishes,1 boiled gallons of coffee, and stewed the liver of the wild boars and the gazelles in the golden wine of Lebanon. The way they dined was this. Fakredeen had his carpet spread on the marble floor of his principal saloon, and the two Caimacams, Tancred and Bishop Nicodemus, Said Djinblat, the heads of the houses of Djzebek, Talhook and Abdel Malek, Hamood Abuneked, and five NMarorite chieftains of equal consideration, the emirs of the house of Shehaab, the Habeish, and the Eldadah, were invited to sit with him. Round the chamber which opened to the air, other chieftains were invited to spread their carpets also; the centre was left clear. The rest of the Sheikhs and Mookatadgis established themselves in small parties, grouped in the same fashion, in the great court and under the arcades, taking care to leave free egress and regress to the fountain. The retainers feasted, when all was over, in the open air. Every man found his knife in his girdle, forks were unknown. Fakredeen prided himself on his French porcelain, which the Djinblats, the Talhooks, and the Abunekeds, glanced at very queerly. This European luxury was confined to his own carpet. There was, however, a considerable supply of Egyptian earthenware, and dishes of pewter and bran. The retainers, if they required a plate, found one in the large flat barley cake with which each was supplied. For the principal guests there was no want of coarse goblets of Bohemian glass: delicious water abounded in vases of porous pottery, which might be blended, if necessary, with the red or white wine of the mountain. The rice, which had been dressed with a savoury sauce, was eaten with wooden spoons by those who were supplied with these instruments; but in general the guests served themselves by handfuls. Ten men brought in a framework of oaken branches placed transversely, then covered with twigs, and over these, and concealing every thing, a bed, fully an inch thick, of mulberry leaves. Upon this fragrant bier reposed a wild boar, and on each side of him reclined a gazelle. Their bodies had closed the moment their feet had been loosened from the stakes, so that the gravy was contained within them. It required a most skilful carver not to waste the precious liquid. The chamber was filled with an invigorating odour as the practised hand of Habas of Deir el Kamar proceeded to the great performance. His instruments were a silver cup, a poniard, and a hand-jar. Making a small aperture in the side of the animal, he adroitly introduced the cup, and proportionately baled out the gravy to a group of plates that were extended to him then, plunging in the long poniard on which he rested, he made an incision with the keen edge and broad blade of the hand-jar, and sent forth slice after slice of white fat and ruby flesh. Then, accompanied hv the emir, lie starts off in some un(lescribed direction in search of some mysterious queen and a kingdom unknown to geographers. They Ednd her at length-the Queen of Anserey-by help of certain good-natured doves and eagles, who act as guides, and are at length introduce(d. But before we notice this singular adrenture, let us take a really clever picture of THE FEA5ST OF THI TrAPERNACLES. Picture to yourself the child of Israel in the dingy suburb or! the squalid quarter of some bleak northern town, where there is never a sun that can at any rate ripen grrapes. Yet he must celebrate the vintage of purple Palestine! The law hais told him, though a denizen in an icy clime, that he must dwell for s-ven days in a bower, and that he must build it of the boughs of thick trees; and the Rabbins have told him that these thick trees are the palm, the myrtle, and the weeping willow. Even Sarmatia may furnish a weeping willow. The law has told him that he must pluck the fruit of goodly trees, and the Rabbins have explained that goodly fruit on this occasion is confined to the citron. Perhaps, in his despair, be is obliged to fly for the candied delicacies of the grocer. His mercantile connexions will enable him, often at considerable cost, to procure some paln leaves from Canaan, which he may wave in his synagogue while he exclaims, as the crowd did when the divine descendant of David entered Jerusalem, " Hosannab in the highest!" * * * * Conceive a being born and bred in the Judenstrasse of Hamburg or Frankfort, or rather in the purlieus of our Houndsditch or Minories, born to hereditary insult, without any education, apparently without a circum. stance that can develop the slightest taste or cherish the least sentiment for the beautiful, living amid fogs and filth, never treated with kindness, seldom with justice, occupied with the meanest, if not the vilest, toil, bargaining for frippery, speculating in usury, existing for ever under the concurrent influence of degrading causes which would have worn out long ago any race that was not of the unmixed blood of Caucasus, and did not adhere to the law of Moses-conceive such a being an object to you of prejudice, dislike, disgust-perhaps hatred. The season arrives, and the mind and heart Of that being are filled with images and passions that have been ranked in all ages among the most beautiful and the most genial of human experience; filled with a subject the most vivid, the most graceful, the most joyous, and the most exuberant-a subject which has inspired poets and which has made gods-the harvest of the grape in the native regions of the Vine. He rises in the morning, goes early to some Whitechapel market, purchases some willow boughs for which he has previously given a commission, and which are brought probably from one of the neighbouring rivers of Essex, hastens home, cleans out the yard of his miserable tenement, builds his bower, decks it, even profusely, with the finest flowers and fruits that he can procure, the myrtle and the citron never forgotten, and hangs its roof with variegated lamps. After the service of his synagogue, he sups late with his wife and his children in the open air, as if he were in the pleasant villages of Galilee, beneath its sweet and starry sky. * * * * In the mean time, a burst of music ounds from the gardens of Besso of Damascus. He advances, and invites Tancred and the Emir to follow hu, and, without any order or courtesy to the softer sex, who on the contrary follow in the rear, the whole company step out of the Saracenic windows into the gardens. The mansion' of Besso, which was of great extent, appeared to be built in thel midst. No other roof or building was in any direction visible, yet the house wars truly in the middle of the city, and the um. brageous plane trees alone produced that illimitable air which is always so pleasing and effective. The house, though lofty for an eastern mansion, was only one story in height, yeS its front was covered with an external and double staircase. This, after a promenade in the garden, the guests approached and mounted. It led to the roof or terrace of the house, which was of great size, an oblong square, and which again was a garden. Myrtle trees of a considerable height, and fragrant with many flowers, were arranged in close order along the four sides of this roof, forming a barrier which no eye from the city beneath or any Ineighbouring, terrace could penetrate. This verdant bulwark, i however, opened at each corner of the roof, which was occupied by a projecting pavilion of white marble, a light cupola of chequered carving supported by wreathed columns. From these pavilions the most charming views might be obtained of the city and the surrounding country l)amascus itself, a varied mass of dark-green groves, white minarets, bright gardens, and hooded domes; to the south and east, at the exj tremity of its rich plain, the glare of the desert; to the west the ranges of the Lebanon; while the city was backed on the north by other mountain regions which Tancred had not yet penetrated. Inthecentre of the terrace was a temporary structure of a peculiar character. It was nearly forty feet long, half a many broad, anvd proportionately lofty. Twelve palm trees clustering with ripe fruit, and each of which seemed to spring from a flowering hedge of myrtles, supported a roof, formed, with much artifice, of the braided boughs of trees. These, however, only furnished an invisible framework, from which were suspended the most beautiful and delicious fruits, citron ! and pomegranate, orange, and fig, and banana, and melon, in such thickness and profusion that they formed, as it were, a carved ceiling of rich shades and glowing colours, like the Saracenic ceiling of the mansion, while enormous bunches of grapes every now and then descended like pendents from the main body of the roof. Tire spaces between the palm-trees were filled with a natural trellis-work of orange-trees in fruit and blossom, leaving at intervals arches of entrance, whose form was indicated by bunches of the sweetest and rarest flowers. Within was a banqueting table covered with thick white damask illk, with a border of gold about a foot in breadth, and before each guest was placed a napkin of the same fashion. The table, however, lacked none of the con- veniences and luxuries and even ornaments of Europe. What can withstand the united influence of taste, wealth, and commerce ? The choicest porcelain of France, golden goblets chiselled in Bond-street, and the prototypes of which had perhaps been won at Goodwood or Ascot, mingled with the rarest specimens of the glass of Bohemia, while the triumphant blades of Sheffield gashed in that very Syrian city whose skill in cutlery had once been a proverb. Around the table was a divan of amber-coloured satin, with many cushions, so arranged that the guests might follow either the Oriental or the European mode of seating themselves. Such was the bower or tabernacle of Besso of Damascus, prepared to celebrate the seventh day of his vintage feast. Queen Astarte also falls in love with Tancred, anrd then follow the jealousies and the little quarrels wvluich bring out the distinctive characters of all the parties in this extraordinary "situation," to use a phrase borrowed from the stage. Just as a denouement is expected by the half-scowling half-serious reader, Fancred's papa and mamma arrive post-haste to prevent unpleasant connections, and the curtain falls leaving us disagreeably mystified as to the ultimate fate of Tancred, and his Eastern friends. Such are the absurdities of this story. But they will be forgiven for the sake of the writing, which sparkles with wit, glows with eloquence, and abounds in satirical sketches of personages well known in the political world, d moving in fashionable circles. It is impossible e to regret so much misapl)lie(l ingenuity. It is painful to see genius, so various and great in its powvers, nid which might do good service to the present, wasting itself in dreamy aspirations after a buried past, indulging in the wildest phantasies that ever filled a sane head, seriously preaching to such a community as ours the claims of the Caucasian race to universal empire. exalting the mental and phyisical faculties of the Jews as more worthy of honour and imitation than those which belong to uts as our birthright, inherited from our Saxon ancestors, andi deliberately decrying the free institutions uinder which we have flourished, and advocating as better than they the despotisms that have prevailed throughout the Eastern world. 'I'liat such doctrines should not only be held but avowed by a prominent man among British senators in the nineteenth century, is a phenomenon which it might be no unworthy task of a philosopher to investigate. Assuredly there is a meaning in it beneath the surface. Mr. D'ISRAELI is not quite a solecism in his generation. The idea which he embodies in so eccentric a shape is not his alone; it is an idea of his age, and occupies many minds, though finding its expression in other forms less strange antl wild. But this is not a place for such an inquiry; the pages of a weekly journal have not space for it. We can only suggest it to the thoughtful as a theme for profitable rejection. Our business is rather with the book than with the man; and having freely expressed our opinion of it, wve take leave of it with only one more extract, in a very different strain from those which have preceded it. It is a truthful criticism on THE STREFTS OF LONDON. London is not grand. It possesses only one of the qualifications of a grand city-size; but it wants the equally important one-beauty. It is the union of these two qualities that produced the grand cities-the Romes, the Babylons, the hundred portals of the Pharaohs; multitudes and magnificence; the millions influenced by art. Grand cities are unknown since the beautiful has ceased to be the principle of invention. Paris, of modern capitals, has aspired to this character; but if Paris be a beautiful city, it certainly is not a grand one; its population is too limited, and, from the nature of their dwellings, they cover a comparatively small space. Constantinople is picturesque; nature has furnished a sublime site, but it has little architectural splendour, and you reach the environs with a fatal facility. London overpowers us with its vastness. Place a forum or an Acropolis in its centre, and the effect of the metropolitan mass, which now has neither head nor heart, instead of being stupirying, would be ennobling. Nothing more completely represents a nation than a public building. A member of Parliament only represents at the most the united constituencies: but the palace of the sovereign, a National Gallery, or a Museum baptised with the name of the country, -these are monuments to which all should be able to look up to with pride, and which should exercise an elevating influence upon the spirit of the humblest. 'What is their influence in London ? Let us not criticise what all condemn. But how remedy the evil ? What is wanted in architecture, as in so many things, is-a man. Shall we find a refuge in a Committee of Taste? Escape from the mediocrity of one to the mediocrity of many? We only multiply our feebleness and I aggravate our deficiencies. But one suggestion might be i made. No profession in England has done its duty until it has furnished its victim. The pure administration of justice dates from the deposition of 'Macclesfield. Even our boasted navy never achieved a great victory until we shot an admiral. Suppose an architect were hanged ? Terror has its inspiration } as well as competition. Though London is vast, it is very monotonous. All those new districts that have sprung up within the last half century, the creatures of our commercial and colonial wealth-it is impossible to conceive any thing more tame, more insipid, more uniform. Pancrds is like 'Mary-le-bone; sMary-le-bone is like Paddiugton: all the streets resemble each other: you must read the names of the squares before you venture to knock at a door. This amount of building capital ought to have nproduced a great city. What an opportunity for architecture suddenly summoned to furnish habitations for a population 'equal to those of the city of Bruxelles, and a population, too, |of great wealth. Mary-le.bone alone ought to have produced a revolution in our domestic architecture. It did nothing. It was built by Act of Parliament. Parliament prescribed even a fa~ade. It is Parliament to whom we are indebted for your | Gloucester-places, and Baker-streets, and Hlarley-streets, and Wimpole-streets, and all those flat, dull, spiritless streets, all resembling each other, like a large family of plain children, with Portland-place and Portman-square for their respectable parents. The influence of our parliamentary goverhiment upon the fine arts is a subject worth pursuing. The power that I produced Baker-street as a model for street architecture in its celebrated Building Act, is the power that prevented Whitehall from being completed, and which sold to foreigners all the pictures which the king of England had collected to civilise his people. In our own days we have witnessed the rapid creation of a new metropolitan quarter, built solely for the aristocracy by an aristocrat. The Belgrave district is as monotonous as Nlary-le-bone, and is so contrived as to be at the same time insipid and tawdry. Where London becomes more interesting is Charing Cross. Looking to Northum. berland House, and turning your back upon Trafalgar-square, the Strand is perhaps the finest street in Europe, blending the architecture of many periods; and its river ways are a peculiar feature and rich with associations. Fleet-street, with its Temple, is not unworthy of being contiguous to the Strand. The fire of London has deprived us of the delight of a real old quarter of the city; but some bits remain, and everywhere there is a stirring multitude, and a great crush and crash of carts and wains. The Inns of Court, and the quarters in the vicinity of the port, Thames-street, Tower-hill, Billingsgate, Wap. ping, Rotherhithe, are the best parts of London; they are full of character: the buildings bear a nearer relation to what the people are doing than in the more polished quarters. Tbe old merchants of the times of the first Georges were a fine race. They knew their position, and built up to it. While the territorial aristocracy, pulling down their family hotels, were raising vulgar streets and squares upon their site, and occupying themselves one of the new tenements, the old merchants filled the straggling lanes, which connected the Royal Exehange with the port of London, with mansions, which, if not exactly equal to the palaces of stately Venice, might at least vie with many of the hotels of old Paris. Some of these, though the great majority have been broken up into chambers and counting-houses, still remain intact.

Tales of My Landlord, Third Series, collected and arranged hy Jedediah Cleishhotham, Schoolmaster and Pariel Clerk ol'Candercleugh. JXtbitb) of pttto JSooU. 4 vols. Unio. Edin- burgh, 181[). Fkw works have obtained so much celebrity as the Tales of My Landlord, or few authors reaped so much fame, or so trolden a harvest as the unknown Jedediah Cleishbothani: we say unknown, as notwithstanding these tales are universally ascribed to a distinguished Scottish bard, yet he still eludes all certain discovery. The Scottish historical novels have, indeed, formed a new era in the history of this species of writing; they combine such a happy union of historical fact with the beauties of fiction and romance, and such a true picture of the manners and customs cd'the period to which they relate, and so admirable a description of the characters of individuals, that they could not fail of being popular : and what our author observes hypothetically has been realized ; they have been * praised by the judicious, and admired by the feeling, engrossing the young, and attracting even the old ; while the critic traced their name up to some name of literary celebrity, and the question when, and by whom, these tales were written, filled up the pause of conversation in a hundred circles and coteries.' The present series consists of two tales, * The Bride of Lammermoor,9 and *A Legend of Montrose:' the first, which only we shall at present notice, relates to un event in the private family history of Scotland, that occurred in the reign of Queen Anne; and, although the names are disguised, and several incidents added, yet the leading particulars are those of an * oicer-trnc tale.9 In the style of composition, these differ from their predecessors; they are more descriptive and less dramatic, containing more of narrative and less of dialogue ; and although we shall reserve our opinions of them until the conclusion, yet we cannot but think they are neither so well written, nor the subjects so interesting, aa the tales of* Old Mortality* and * The Heart of Mid-Lothian.' In an introductory chapter, our author states that the ideal Mr. Pattieson received the subject of the tale from a painting, and some loose scraps of writing of his friend, Dick Tinto, a painter, who furnished a lamentable proof of the great truth, that in the fine arts mediocrity is not permitted, and that he who cannot ascend to the very top of the ladder, will do well not to put his foot upon it at all; he then proceeds to the story to which we shall conduct our readers. The hero of the tale is the heir of the noble house of Ravenswood, whose ancestors were powerful and warlike barons, and w hose extensive castle, bearing their name, was situate in thc fertile,' plains of East Lothian; their lin.-catended toa remote anticpiity, and they had ne?t only m.irrieel with the best families of Scotland, hut the ir 1.i ?? ? i v was connected with the country itself, in whose ann.iU their feats are recorded. About the middle of the mamite enth century, this house rapidly declined in i's sph nelour, anel, tenvards the period of the revolution, the last proprietor of Ravenswood Castle was compelled le> p;ut with the ancient family seats, and te> remove to a hun ly sea-beaten tower on the bleak shores ed' the (Jennet Ocean, where a wild domain formed their only remaining property, lu the civil war of 10HJI, Lord kavenswe.oel espoused the sinking side*, anel was attaiuteel, and ins til lo abolished. This nobleman inherited all the* pride aud ten. bulence, though not the fortune, of his family, the declension of which he imputed te> a Sir William Ashton, a nm. liing lawyer, who, by fishing in the * trembled water* of a state divided b-' factions,* had obtained the office ed lord keeper, and become the proprietor of the estate ami cse J lc of Ravenswood, by means not the mord honourable. W nh this gentleman, Allan, Lord Ravenswood, waged an inc ll* etual war on varie>us points respecting the property* w hu h were successively determined in favour ed" his competitor, until, at length, ou receiving the news of the loss ed*a e au^ , the last which he had maintained, his health, which lied long been on tho decline, gave way during a lit ed' violent and impotent fury. His son, Edgar (lawnswood, thc hero of the tale, witnessed the dying agonies, and he.nd the curses winch he breathed against bis adversary, as if they bael conveyed to him a legacy of vengeance, wbult was still further exasperated at tlie funeral, whee the reading ofthe service by a priest of the English e'onmiuuion, (then illegal,) was interrupted by au officer ed f? e* lord keeper. Young Edgar, popularly called the ma-h r of Rave nswood, then twenty years of age, lireel at the insult, and clapped his hand on his sword, which was followed hy a hundred of his friends, to protect the bo?l\ nf their kinsman; the body was lowered into the chain il vault, and the company retired, whilst young Ra\enswood vowed vengeance on the man who had thus cl ireel hi disturb the obsequies. Sir William Ashton drew up au ae-count of these proceedings for the privy council, and would, perhaps, have made them fatd to the principal a?-ior in them, had he not trust his eye on the crest ofthe family of Ravenswood, carved in the ceding, a black bull's bead, with the legend, * I bide my time,* which mingled it vlf singularly and impressively with the subject of his precut reflections. A eiieumstance, however, soon occunvd which seemed to change the dispositions and the destinies of all parin*. Sir William had a daughter, Lucy Ashton, exquisitely beautiful aud of a soft ami timid, yet romantic, di-.po?.i* tion, foud of the old legendary tales of urdeut devotion and unalterable affection, chequered, as they often ire, with strange adventures and supernatural horrors. One day, when Sir William and his daughter were walking in the extensive park of Ravenswood Castle, they visited a blind old woman, Alice, the last retainer of the family of Ravenswood, and who had been provided for in the transfer of the estate to its new proprietor. This woman advised Sir William not to push matters too hard with a lieree house; for that, although Edgar was free, generous, and noble, yet, added she, * he is still a Ravenswood, and may bide his time. Remember the fate of Sir George Lockhart.' This gentleman, who was President of the Court of Session, was pistolled in \68<J, by a relation of tile Ravenswood family. Sir William Ashton"was too sensible of the injuries he hid done young Ravenswood to feel much at his ease; when, returning homeward, a bull of tjie ancient Scottish breed rushed impetuously towards them; his daughter sunk b\ his side; he interposed himself between her and the enraged animal, which was now within a few yards of thom, when a shot from the neighbouring thicket arrested ins progress and laid him dead at their feet: the person v ho lind thus opportunely saved them approached, and raising Lucy from the ground, conveyed her to a place of safety, near a fountain to which a legendary tale had attached peculiar veneration; and it was always considered, that to drink of the waters of this well or to approach its brink, was fatal to the Ravenswood family. Sir William cone up, and requested to know to whom he was indebted for so signal a deliverance: * Request nothing of MK, my lord,* said the stranaer, in a stern ami peremptory tone, * J am the master of Ravenswood ;' and, making a haughty hi'dination towards Lucy, turned away and left them, without waiting for the thanks of the astonished Sir William Ashlen, who despatched two foresters to induce him to return, hut he refused with the most haughty disdain. Young Ravenswood and Miss Ashton were mutually smitten with each other, and Sir William immediately despatched letters to the Privy Council, to exculpate the humer for his conduct at the funeral of his father. The ni;?>!? t of Ravenswood now formed an acquaintance with te o persons which might have been fatal to him, and one of v. hom afterwards had a considerable share in contributing to his misfortunes; these were a Captain Craigengelt, a dissolute fellow who, without any fortune himself, continued to live on that of others; and a Mr. Huyston, Ltd rd of Bucklaw, who was living in exj>ectatiou of the death of a rich relative: the former disgusted him in the cutset, and he had expressed himself very warmly towards them both, and left them, when Buck law followed him to demand satisfaction; they drew, Bucklaw was thrown, an ! owed his life to the generosity of his antagonist, whom he jtccoinpanied to the forlorn castle of Wolf's Crag, his only remaining habitation, and where two old domestics formed his whole retinue; one of these, Cab b Balderstone, is a very interesting personage iii this tale, from his faithful attachment to his master, and his anxiety for the honour of the family, to support which both his truth and ingenuity were often severely tortured. Caleb, well knowing the little accommodation that Wolf's Crag could furnish, detained them at the door while Mysie, his fellow servant, was making preparations within:? ' " 0, never mind the outside of thc house, my good friend," said Bucklaw ; " let's see the inside, and let our ho^es see the stable, that's all." ? tt o yes> sir?av, sir?unquestionably, sir,?my lord and onvof his honourable companions"--'"But our horses, my old friend?our horses; they wdt he dead-foundered hy standing here in the cold after riding hard, anel mine is too good to be spoiled; therefore, once more, our horses," exclaimed Bucklaw.. ' " True?ay?vour horses?yes?I will call the grooms;" and sturdily did Caleb roar till the old tower rung again,? " John? William?Saunders!? The lads are gane out, or sleeping," he observed, after pausing for an answer, which he knew that he had no human chance of receiving. " A' gaes wrang when the master's out bye ; but Til take care o' vour cattle mysell." 1 " I think you had better," said Ravenswood, " otherwise I see little chance of their being attended to at all." * " Whisht, my lord,?whisht, for God's sake," said Caleb, in an imploring tone, and apart to his master; " if ye dinna regard vour ain credit, think on mine ; we'll hae hard eneugh wark to make a decent night o't, wi' a' the lies I can tell." ' " Well, well, never mind," said his master; " go to the stable. There is hay anel corn, I trust ?"^ ' " Ou ay, plenty of hay and corn;" this was uttered boldly and aloud ;" and, iii' a lower tone, " there was some half fons o' aits, and some taits o' meadow-hay, left after the burial." i ? Very well," said Ravenswood, taking the lamp from his domestic's unwilling hand, " I will shew the stranger up stairs myself." "' " I canna think o' that, my lord ;?if ye wad but have five minutes, or ten minutes, or, at maist, a quarter of an hour's patience, anel look at the tine moonlight prospect ofthe Bass and North-Berwick Law, till I sort thc horses, I would marshal ye up, as reason is ye suld be marshalled, your lordship and your honourable visitor. And I hae lockit up the siller candlesticks, and the lamp is not fit"* " It will do very well in the meantime," said Ravenswood, " anel you will have no difficulty for want of light in the stable., for, if I recollect, half tlie roof is off." ' " Very true, my lord," replied the trusty adherent, and wdth ready wit instantly added, '** and the lazy sclater loons have never come to put it on a' this while, your lordship."' The * hinder end of a mutton ham' and the * heel of the ewe-milk kebbuck wi' a bit of .lice butter' was, however, all that Caleb could provide for supper, which he displayed with great formality; the next day's dinner was not niue h better, * four salted herrings,* which honest Caleb said he thought tiley might prefer, as it was St. Margaret's eve; but, however poor the meal, Caleb always rung the dinner bell * with the more sonorous grace, in proportion to the meagerness of the cheer which was provided.' In the bosom of the master of Ravenswood, there now existed two contradictory passions,?-a desire to revenge the death of his father, strangely qualified by admiration of his enemy's daughter, * and/in the struggle, he was determining to leave Scotland, when a circumstance decided his conduct very differently. Lord Bittlebrain's hounds were heard in the neighbourhood, when Bucklaw induced his host to join him in the sport, which the latter would rather have declined, as his steed was not likely to do hini much credit; A stranger in the chase observing, this, offered him his owu horse, but Bucklaw, seeing the steed rather unmanageable, took it himself, and gave his own to Ravenswood. The chace proceeded rapidly, the stag was at bay, when Bucklaw spran<* from his horse and brought him to the ground by a dexterous cut on the hind leg; when a fair female, on a white palfrey, was invited to do the honours of the chace, which, however, she refused: this was no other than Lucy Ashton, whose father had sent the horse to Ravenswood, and tv ho, coining up, entered into conversation with Ravenswood, v.iio was not familiar, when the young lady riding up, was introduced to him. A thunderstorm commenced, ind he found himself compelled to offer the shelter of Wolf's Crag, to the no small mortification of Caleb, who bid advised his master to dine out, and now found him approach in ??: with visitors; although he very dexterously contrived to exclude all followers, except one servant; and baying on ct? closed the gates of the castle, declared, * if the king on thc throne were at the gate, that his ten fiuirers should never open it, contrary to the established use and wont of the family of Ravenswood and his duty as their head servant:' even Bucklaw himself was excluded, end obliged to take slicker at the change-house of the village of Wolfshooe, where he unexpectedly met with ft ft v' Craigenfelt. The difficulty of the strangers avowing themselves being over, the master of Ravenswood possessed too much honour and a growing attachment to Miss Ashton, to let family feuds interfere with his hospitality. Sir William led his daughter towards Ravenswood, and bid her lay aside her mask, ami * let us,' says Ire, ' express our gratitude to the master openly and barefaced.' Our autlior's description of this scene is too interesting to be omitted:? * " If he will condescend to accept it/' was all that Lucy uttered, hut in a tone so sweetly modulated,and which seemed to imply at once, a feeling and a forgiving of the cold reception to which they were exposed, that, coming from a creature *o innocent and so beautiful, her words cut Ravenswood to the very heart for his harshness. He muttered something of surprise, something of confusion, and, ending with a warm and eager expression of his happiness, at being able to alford her shelter under his roof, he saluted her, as the ceremonial of the time enjoined upon such occasions. Their cheeks had touched and were withdrawn from each other?Ravenswood had not quitted the hand which he had taken in kindly courtesy?a hi ash which attached more consequence by far than was usual to such ceremony, still mantled on Lucy Ashton's beautiful cheek, when the apartment was suddenly illuminated by a llash of lightning, which seemed absolutely to swallow the darkness of the hall. Every object might have been, for an instant, seen distinctly. The slight and half-sinking form of Lucy Ashton, the well-proportioned and stately figure of Ravenswood, his dark features, and the fiery, yet irresolute expression of his eyes,?the old anns and scutcheons, which hung cn the walls of the apartment, were for an instant distinctly visible to the keeper, by a strong red brilliant glare of light. Its disappearance was almost instantly followed by a bui>t of thunder, for the storm cloud was very near the castle; and the peal was so sudden and dreadful, that the old tower rocked to its foundation, and every inmate concluded it was falling upon them. The soot, which had not been disturbed for centuries, showered down the huge tunnelled chimuies? line and dust flew in clouds from the wall ; and whether the lightning had actually struck the castle, or whether, through the violent concussion of the air, several heavy stones were hurled from the mouldering battlements, into the roaring sea beneath. It might seem, as if the ancient founder of the castle, were bestriding the thunder-storm, and proclaiming his displeasure at the reconciliation of his descendant with the enemy of his house.' Nothing could have been more fortunate for Caleb than this thunder storm, which he declared liad spoiled the best dinner that ever was dressed, beef, bacon, kid, lambs, venison, &c although his master knew as well as himself that nothing in the world had been provided ; he, however, contrived to go to the village and obtain, not very fcirly, we confess, possession of some wild fowl, which the cooper had roasting for the christc*nin<r; ami, ban* ? *??bl the quality ed'his guests, ami thrown out a hint ed the ??* ?vice lie might render him, in ed>tainiie; the <r<\ .????! of queen's cooper to the wife* ed* * the man ?.f t".!><b I ? was soon followed by a mun hearing two es?-\s o} b es... which he hainlcil to the* prince ed' major- elnmo, i bibb ' . . derstone, anel whispering in his car that * If ;s - t al).mt IVter Puncheon's place could be* :>;rv! ?????:?- - John (iireler would mike it better to tlc ma bs ol r - ven&wood than a pair of new ?;hives; and that h"w?d '?..-. blythe to spe'ak wi' Alaster Balderstom* e?:i rhs* la b .i he wad lind him as pliant as a he>op-wulo*v ni t* ?! ie could wish of him.' The Lord Keeper, with statesman-like- s: ill :vid b,! t e ease and fluency of a silver-tongued I i\w, r ,,f ih b ? -? order, was not long in persuading his ?_??? iktous :>?..? > suspecting host, that he was anxious tbat :? 5 p?s ?? .?? dispute between them should be settled on the n.o^t : .ral principle. There was sonic el ev; rc r of truth in t! the Lord Kee*per had not only feared tl ?? v"c" an< e ,,; Ravenswonel, but also fouml that his ie!tt!<>?;ship ?.. ; ,.?

In short, he consented to rete i ?? visit and accompany the Lord Kicper te> li s man spite of the intreaties of Caleb, who, with a cpi voice and a cheek pule with apprehension, faullethe following prophetic lines, which Thomas, the ii mc ?, had spoken ofthe family:? ' When the last Lord of Ravenswood to Ravenswood h \V ride, Anel wooe a dead maiden to he his bride, Ile shall stable his steed in the Kelpie's flow, And his name shall be lost for evermooe!' Caleb, finding he could not succeed, aud that hi* m^ter was leaving Wolf's Crag, run after him, with the moi M 1 e. \ ney which the Lord Keeper and Lucy had given him, and liegged him to accept it, to cir-ihle him to do a like civility at Ravenswood Castle; but this his master refused accepting. The party arrived at the Lord Keeper's; every thing was done to entertain their new-made friend in the most splendid manner, nor were opportunities w:iiitinir for Ravenswood and Lucy Ashton to cultivate their growing attachment. A day was appointed to visit the ancient and devoted servant of his house, old Alice, ami Lucy was to be his guide; her brother Henry, a boy about fifteen years of age, also accompanied them. The poor tdd woman, who was blind, had 1.0 sooner ascertained who were her visitors, and that they were really attached to each other, than she entreated young Ravenswood to avoid the match, declaring that she would rather see him * shrouded and coffined.' In vain did he assure her, and attempt to assure himself, that there was no danger of such mi occurrence, and leaving Alice, and hesitating what to do, he almost unconsciously joined Lucy and her brother, who had left him at the Meriiiaiden's Fountain; nor did the warning of Alice, or the recollection of others, that this place, was a fatal spot to the family, prevent him hom giving his faith to Lucy Ashton for ever, and receiving her troth in return, while their lips and their hands pledged the sincerity of their affection. An emblematic 1 ceremony of their troth-plight was observed ; they broke betwixt them a thin broad-piece of gold, which they each pledged themselves to retain until the other should ask for it. ior it. While young Ravenswood remained at this ancient mansion of his fathers, Sir William was informed of the intended visit of the Marquis of A-?, and was making every preparation to rec* ive him, particularly gratified that young Ravenswood was at his house, and that his own lady, who was a Douglas, and had all the pride and hauteur of the family, as well as a complete ascendancy ever lier husband, was absent. While they were thus going on at Ravenswood Castle, Craigcngelt and young Bucklaw, who had now come into possession of the property of his aunt, were planning how thc latter might obtain the hand of Miss Ashton, and recollecting that her mother was now on a visit at Lady Blenkinsop'.*, aunt of Rucklaw, in Northumberland, on her return from London, Craigcngelt was despatched to acquaint her how affairs were standing at home. The lady, fired at the idea of her daughter behn; married toa * bankrupt jacobite lord/ set off for Ravenswood Castle without loss of time, and happened to reach it on the same day, and nearly in thc Minc moment, that the Marquis of A-*s carriage v.ms driving up. This was a death blow to Sir William, v1 o, on seeing tho carriage of his lady drive up, had no ? liiiKV left but the possibility of an overturn, and that his I idv or \isitor might break their necks. The Marquis l;;?\ingbeen introduced to Ladv Ashton, in return presented hi* relative, the master o\' Ravenswood, at the same time assuring her, that his was a peace-making visit. But tl c Loni Keeper was not to escape thus, but was led, somewhat like a condemned criminal, into his lady's dressing-room, when, having locked the door, to prevent the possibility of a ictreat, she thus addressed her astounded husband :? ' " My lord, 1 am not greatly surprised at the connections }ou have been pleased to form during my absence?thev are futilely in conformity with *our birth and breeding; anti if I ilni expect any thing cbc, 1 heartily own my error, and that 1 merit, by having done so, the disappointment you had prepated for me." ' " My dear Lidy Ashton?my dear Eleanor," said the Lord Keeper, " listen to reason"for a moment, and I will convince you I have acted with all the regard due to the dig nity, as well as the interest of my family." * " To the interest of your family I conceive you perfectly capable of attending," returned the indignant lady, " and even to the dignity of your family also?But as mine happens to be inextricably involved with it, you will excuse me it I chuse to give mv own attention so far as that is concerned." * " What would you have, lady Ashton ?" said the husband ?" What is it that"displease* you ? Why is it, that on your return after so long an absence, 1 am arraigned in this manner r" * " Ask your own conscience, Sir William, what has prompted von to become a renegade to your political party and opinions, and led you, for what I know, to be on the point of marrying your only daughter to a beggarly jacobite bankrupt, the inveterate enemy of your family, to the boot." * " Whv, what, in the name of common sense and common civility, would you have me do, madam?" answered the husband?" Is it possible for me, with ordinary decency, to turn a young gentleman out of my house, who saved my daughter's lite and my own, but the other morning as it were r" ' " Saved your life! I have heard of that story," said the lady?" the Lord Keeper was scared by a dun cow. and he takes the young; fellow who killed her for Guy of Warwick? any butcher from Haddington may soon have an equal claim on your hospitality." ? " Lady Ashton," stammered the Keeper, " this is intolerable?and when I am desirous, too, to make you easy bv anv sacrifice ?if voil would but tell me what rou would be at." ' '* Go down to your guests," said the imperious dame, " and make your apology to Ravenswood, that the arrival or Captain Craigengelt and some other friends renders it impossible for you to offer him lodgings at the castle?1 expect young Mr. llayston, of lUicklaw." ' v.ir:n:. ci _i. * _ ? r_ i t i . i Sir William had the courage to refuse, and Lady Ashton wrote a note, which she sent bv a female servant to young Ravenswood. The Marquis of A > ?, fired at the insult thus ottered to his kinsman, remonstrated strongly with Sir William and Lady Ashton, while Ravenswood left the ancient seat ol Ins ancestors with emotions of indignation and regret which cannot be described. As he approached the fatal fountain, which was in his way, he saw a figure which heat first thought to be Lucy Ashton, but, on approaching it more nearly, he fancied he recognized the features of old blind Alice, but, as he advanced, the figure receded until it was lost in thc thicket; he then hastened to thc cottage, and found that .Mice was no more, her spirit having departed about the very moment that he had seen her spectre, and that, in her last moments, * she prayed powerfully that she might see her master's son once more, and renew her warning/ Voung Ravenswood could not suffer the body of this faithful adherent of his family to want a decent burial, aud he himself visited the sexton to settle for it. Thc old man, resting on his spade by the side of a half-made grave, opened the discourse in his own way :? ' " Ye will be a wedding customer, **>, I'se warrant." ' " What makes you think so, friend ?" replied the Master. ' " I live by twa trades, sir," replied the blythe old man ; " fiddle, sir, and spade; filling the world, and emptying of it; and 1 suki ken baith cast of customers by head-mark in thirty years practice." ' " ^ ou are mistaken, how ever, this morning," replied Ravenswood, ?"Ani I?" said the old man, looking keenly at him, ** troth, anel it may be; since, for as brent as your brow is, there is something sitting upon it this day, that is as near akin to death as to wedlock. Weel, weel, the pick and shovel are as i cady to your order as bow and fiddle." '*' Twisli you," said Ravenswood, " to look after the decent interment of an old woman, Alice Gray, who lived at the Cvaiijfoot, in Ravenswood Park." ?" Alice Gray ! blind Alice!" said the sexton; "anel i> *he cane at last ? that's another jow ofthe bell to bid me be ready. I mind when Ilabbie Gray brought her down to this land ; a likely lass she was then, and loe>kcMl ow er her southland nose at us a'. I trow her pride got a downcome. And is she* e'en gane ?"' This business settled ; young Ravenswood hastened to the Tod's hole, where he was to meet the Marquis of A?, who had remained at Ravenswood castle, in the hopes of serving his friend, but in vain. The Marquis endeavoured te> |>ersuade bim to think no more of Miss Ashton, assuring him that ho might do better, and at the same time offering himan important mission abroad, which be accepted, and agreed to return with the Marquis to Edinburgh. Ou their way, they stopped at Wolf's Crag, to the terror of Caleb Baldcrstone, who, having been apprised of the intended visit, and knowing his utter inability to accommodate them, set lire to some peat in the house, and when bis master, who was not in the secret, and the Marejuis approached, they- witnessed the mansion in flames, while Caleb was loudly regretting the loss of 'a' the tiuegraith, pictures, tapestries, needle-work, hangings, and other decorements,' and to prevent tbe possibility of bis feint being discovered bv the zealous interference of the nei"hbours, he declared that there were thirty barrels of gunpowder which might be expected to explode every minute; this, it may readily be imagined, kept all parties at a respectful distance. Caleb did not find much difficulty in obtaining the forgiveness of his master, whom he assured, that it was an excellent scheme, and would save him from telling many a falsehood, adding * 1 wael rather set fire to the tower in guele earnest, and burn it ower my ain head into the bargain, or I see the family dishonoured.* The Marquis and Ravenswood were well accommodated in the village, at the house of the Queen's Cooper, and the next day they set out for Edinburgh, where the master of Ravenswood took up his abode with his noble friend. In the meantime, the political crisis had taken place, and the Marquis obtained the ascendency he wished.?-Ravenswood obtained back some of bis property, and Sir William Ashton was menaced with a parliamentary reversal of the judicial sentences under which he held the Castle and Barony of Ravenswood, and displaced from his situation of lord keeper. The master of Ravenswood wrote to Sir W il liam, stating the engagement which existed between him and his daughter; he also wrote to Lady Ashton, deprecating any cause of displeasure which he might have given her, and by the same messenger he addressed a third letter to Lucy, containing the assurances of his inviolable attachment, and expressing hopes that their union might not be prevented. Lady Ashton sent au immediate answer, by the messenger, dee hiring that she would not listen to any proposal from him, or any of his house. Sir Winiam sent au answer by another conveyance, in which he endeavoured to parry the subject of restitution ; while Lucy, by an unknown hand, sent a short note, in which she declared she would be true to her word, but begged him not to write again till better times. The master of Ravenswood now departed on his mission to the continent, j where he remained twelve months, during which time the family affairs of Sir William Ashton had tnkeonsoinewh.it different turn : Bucklaw was introduced to Miss Ashton by her mother, whom she promised to obey, but upon our condition only, that of having the engagement she had made to Ravenswood restored to her, and letters wrre dispatched to him to thc continent to that effect. St. Jude's day was at length fixed by her mother as the time on which they must be ready to.wgn and seal. ?" lo sign and seal," echoed Lucy, in a muttering tone, ,h the door of the apartment closed,?** To sign and seal?to <!?? and die!" anil clasping her extenuated hands together, du* sunk back on the easy chair she occupied, in a state icm ntbling stupor." From this she was shortly after awakened by her boisterous brother, who clamorously reminded her of lui promise to give him some ribbon, which she did immediately. ' " Dinna shut the cabinet yet, " saiil Henry, "for I hum have some of your silver wire to fasten the bells to m\ haw kV jesses, and yet the new falcon's not worth them neither ; tor do you know, after all the plague we had to get lier from .rn every, all the way at l\>s>o, in Mannor Water, she's goim*. to prove, after all, nothing better than a ritter?she just wets \\c\singles in the blood ot the partridge, and then breaks aw av, and lets her fly ; and what good can the poor hird do alter th.tt, you know, except pine and die in the first heather-cow ot whin-hush she can crawl hitor" ' " Right, Henry?right, very right," said Lucy, mournfully, holding the boy fast by the hand, after giving him the wire he wanted ; " but there are more ritters in the woiid than your falcon, and more wounded birds that seek but io die in quiet, than can lind neither brake nor whimbush tolmie their heads in." ' No answer arrived from Ravenswood ; indeed, Lady Ashton contrived that none should reach Lucy, mid .1 report got abroad that he was 011 the point of nimmo:; a foreign lady of fortune and distinction. An edd hag, who trailed in the occult sciencis, and Mr. Bidc-thc-bcnt, the minister, were successively placed in constant attendance on Lucy, to endeavour to overcome her opposition to the match, when the fatal day arrived. The writings weir prepared, and Sir William signed the contract with legal solemnity aud precision ; his son with military non-chafance. Bucklaw next subscribed, and it was now Miss Ashton's turn to sign thc writings, which she first unconsciously attempted with a dry pen. Lady Ashton's vigilance supplied the deficiency, and her daughter wiote her name on each pugi*, with a tremulous irregularity. ' But fliest signature is incomplete, defaced, and blotted . for while her hand was employ ed in tracing it, th.* Jia?t\ tramp of a lior-e was heard at the gate, sue c ceded by a step m the outer gallery, and a voice, which in a command og tone, hore down the opposition of tin'menials. The pen diopped from Lucy's fingers, as she c x< humed, with a faint shriek, " Ile is come?he is come !" ' Hardly had Miss Ashton dropped the pen, when the door of the apartment flew open, and the Master of Ravenswood entered the apartment.' The consternation in which all parties were placed, may be more easily conceived than described, and all were silent for some minutes. At length, Lady Ashton demanded the cause of his intrusion, while Bucklaw and Col. Ashton declared, that it was their right to call hun to account for so unparalleled an affront on the family :? * Thc passions of the two young men thus counteracting each other, gave Ravenswood leisure to exclaim, in a stern and steady voice, " Silence'?let him yvho really *:eks > ifac-cr, take the lilting time when it is to be found; my mismai here will be? shoaly accomplished.?Is that, madam, vour j.uial!" he adoed in a softer tone, extending towards Miss Ad.lon he r Let letter. * A fanlirriiig " }ts*" seemed rather to escape from her Lp-, than to bN utt-Tedas a \oluntary answer. 4 '?

She* was silent; and he went on, with increasing vehemence? ** I am still that Eelgar Ravenswood, who, for your affection, renounced the clear ties hy which injured honour bound him to se ck vengeance. I am that Ravenswood, who, for your sake*, forgave, nay, clasped hands in friendship with the" oppressor and pillager of his house?the traducer and murderer of Iks father." ' ** My daughter," answered Lady Ashton, interrupting liim, has no occasion to dispute the identity of your person; t.'ic wnem ot your present language is sufficient to remind her, iii.it siie speaks with the mortal enemy of her father." ? '?

She attempted to take the corresponding half from her bosom, for there she still retained it, but failed, which Lady Ashton perceiving, cut the ribbon asunder, and returned it to Ravenswood, who now threw it and the paper into the fire, and having reminded Lady Ashton of her conduct in this business, rushed our of the apartment. The bridal day arrived, and Bncklaw received the reluctant hand of Miss Ashton: the day was spent in dancing and festivity, in which the wretched bride did not participate, but left the room, and was followed by Bucklaw. The instruments now played their loudest strains, and the dancers pursued their exercise with all the enthusiasm that youth and mirth could inspire, when a cry was heard, so shrill and piercing, as at once to arrest the dance and the music. Col. Ashton rushed to the bridal chamber, and, on entering, found Bucklaw laying bleeding on the threshold: he was conveyed, still breathmg, into another apartment. The bride was found couched like a hare in the corner of an edd fashioned chimney of tlie room * her head-gear dishevelled; her night clothes torn and dabbled with blood, her eyes glazed, and her features convulsed into a wild paroxysm of insanity.' When she saw herself discovered, she gibbered, made mouths, and pointed at them with the frantic gestures of an exulting demoniac; and, as the*'carried her over tie threshold, she looked down, and, with a sort of grinning exultation, articulated,* so you have ta'en np your bonnie bridegroom ?' On the morning, she fell into a state of insensibility, and the next evening convulsion followed convulsion, till they closed in death, without her being able to utter one word explanatory of the fatal scene. Bucklaw recovered, but would never give the least information on the subject, declaring that he had no story to tell, nor injuries to avenge. He dismissed Craigengelt from his society, with some provision, and went abroad, never returning to Scotland. The tale now draws rapidly to its close; Ravenswood, disguised as a mourner, attended the funeral of the unfortunate bride of Lammermoor, and was recognized by Co!. Ashton, who, calling him aside, gave him the length of his sword, aid appointed a meeting on the sea-shore, to thc cast of Wolfshope, at sun-rise on the morrow. Rut it was not the destiny of Ravenswood to perish by the sword, and, in riding to meet Colonel Ashton, the prophecy was accomplished, and he sunk into the Kelpie flow, never to rise again, having perished in the quicksand, and the only trace left of him being a sable feather which had been detached from his hat. Poor Caleb, whose intreaties could not restrain his master, witnessed his fate from the eastern battlement, and hepiued away withina year after the catastrophe. The family of Ashton did not long survive that of Ravenswood ?the colonel was slain in a duel in Flanders, and Henry died unmarried. 4 Lady Ashton lived to the verge of extreme old age, the only survivor of the group of unhappy persons, whose misfortunes were owing to her implacability.' Our remarks, and an account of the other tale, in th* series, ? A Legend of Montrose,' must be deferred to our next.

A Noble Purpose Nobly Won. An Old, Old Story. By " ? "*? m WT 1_ the Author of 'Mary Powell.' In Two Volumes. Hall, Virtue, and Co. Here is the story of Joan of Arc carefully studied and arranged into a light and easy narrative, with a few fanciful combinations and enough imaginary dialogue to give it for maids, boys, and young children the grace of a fiction. The author of ? Mary Powell" has a lively nineteenth century fancy, with which she decorates for the tea-table life and action of the past. To tho grave and mature student of the times she writes about, the very air of her sentences breathes of anachronism, and her antique dia?logue suggests only the clever blue stocking of to-day enlivened by her muffin. To the less critical her tales of the past are charming, and the more acceptable by reason of their fault. There is nothing for a child of eight to stumble at, there is a generous womanly heart at the bottom of all, everything is well and wisely meant, and for the happily uncritical there is not a dull page in all her books.

The Athenaeum  : 4012 378 - 379
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Rock Tombs of El Amarna.- -Part I. Thc Tomb of Meryra. By rs. de G. Davies. (Egypt Exploration Fund.)?Tel-el-Amarna is, says Mr. Davies, a misnomer, the whole district being named El Amarna, or the land of the Beni Amran, of whose villages Et Til is one. It was between this and Hagg Qandil, another Arab village, that Amenophis IV.?or Akhenaten, as Mr. Davies persists in calling him?built the capital of his new faith. The curse which the priests of Amen pronounced against the heretic seems to have stuck, for the excellent work that the French savant Nestor l'HOte and the English excavator Hay formerly did upon the site has remained unpublished, and, save for the work of Lepsius, Mr. Davies had, therefore, an almost virgin field before him. The present volume is confined to the largest tomb yet discovered at El Amarna, which was built hy the innovating king for the high priest of the sun-disc, but was for some unknown reason left unused by its intended occupant. It contains, as might be supposed, many scenes peculiar to the new worship, all these being executed in what Mr. Davies calls " sunk relief." A rectangular space was first cut in the stone, and the design roughly hewn in relief within it; the relief was then covered with plaster, and the plaster while soft was moulded into the shape required. The process, unfortunately, lent itself easily to the mutilation which came upon it when the triumphant priesthood decreed that all likenesses of the innovator should be hammered out, else we should now know more of the sun-disc heresy than we do. As it is, Mr. Davies is able to pronounce, with great show of reason, that the effect of it was to exalt the dignity and office of the Pharaoh to a greater height than was ever dreamed of before or after, the adoration which he is here shown as receiving surpassing all that we know even of Oriental prostrations. That the material sun, and no more shadowy or spiritual divinity, was the being actually worshipped there can be little doubt from the picture here given of the great altar filled with animal sacrifices, fruits, and (lowers in a court containing no statue or emblem, but exposed to the rays of the sun, which extends towards it rays terminating in hands as if about to clutch the offerings. Mr. Davies has also established that Khuenaten and his followers, instead of being naked, as was formerly thought, in these scenes, were clothed in transparent robes, of which many curious details are here supplied. A blind choir was also employed in the ceremonies, doubtless for the reason that only the king and his immediate following were thought to be sufficiently purified to look upon them. Of the "doctrine" itself, as it is called on the inscriptions, Mr. Davies shows clearly enough that the words used in the hymns have a mystical signification, and that the "love" of the Aten seems to signify the sun's heat, his "beauty" his colour-giving power, and his " beams " (Egypt, setut) his light. Altogether this is a very interesting memoir. Amon-Re. Af Wilhelm Schenke. (Christiania, Cammermeyer.)?Not unconnected in subject with the last book is this doctoral thesis, which seems to have been inspired by the "Babel und Bibel" controversy. Dr. Schenke's main position seems to be that the worship of Amen-Ra had a strong tendency towards monotheism, and that the innovation of Amenophis IV. was its logical outcome. But he thinks that there was opposed to this an equally strong tendency to pantheism, as shown in the curious ogdoad, or four pairs of gods worshipped at Hermopolis, and that this was made use of by the priests, who saw themselves dispossessed of their privileges by Khuenaten's heresy, to provoke a reaction against it. Dr. Schenke's thesis is well and carefully written, and is reproduced in autotype. It contains some useful tables. Urkunden des agyptischen Altertums. Herausgegeben von Georg Steindorff. ? Hieroglypliiachen Urkunden der griechischromischen Zeit. I. und II. Bearbeitet von Kurt Sethe. (Leipsic, Hinrichs.)?It is a little disappointing to find that Dr. Sethe, instead of continuing the Old Empire inscriptions begun by him in earlier volumes of this publication (see the Athenamm, No. 3991, April 23rd, 1904), has, so to speak, " switched " himself off to those of a much later date, the two concluding volumes of the Old Empire series being postponed for the present. The inscriptions in these volumes are all well and accurately copied, and include some hitherto unpublished, such as the fragment from the Berlin Museum, apparently dedicated to Ptolemy Soter, and an inscription on a statue in the Villa Albani, the Decree of Canopus being responsible for a great part of the second volume. Dr. Sethe's autographing of the hieroglyphs leaves nothing to be desired on the ground of accuracy, but, as we have before said, in the case of a doubtful sign, it ties us down to his reading of the original. We may also echo the complaint lately uttered by M. Maspero with regard to another publication of the kind, that the absence of any attempt at reproduction of the original monuments often makes it necessary to choose between a journey to Berlin and a painful search among other books where they havo been published. Apart from this, we have nothing but praise for the present volumes, which are certainly a marvel of cheapness.

After a very elabni.i'' am! candid investigation of the a.de of lin country, and thc- character of the people, he returned to England ; and the " Skttc/ns'"' which he has brought with him, furnish the materials ol a picture by no means alluring. In his laudable anxiety to procui e homely and ust lui information for his friends, lie has collected explicit statements concerning tin* value of every kind of pr??perty, nf r< tits, of the wages of labour, and n\ the prices of commodities. He has been particular in his inephries on the relative1 demand for artisans of every kind ; on the encouragement given to various manufactures, and on the most eligible channels for thc employment of capital. I ht se details tire, all of the utmost importance , anti in giving i-nforniatiiiu to his constituents concerning them, lu* hos furnished us with striking examples of tin comfort hssnt-ss, oppression, selfishness, venality, bigotiy, filthiness, political corruption, vanity, barbarity, faiiatici'sni, and various other attractions which are diffused over this boasted Land of Liberty. It shall be our business to place a few of these in their proper light, instead of following Mr. Fearon'* mule through the various places which he visited. The following are our Author's remraks concerning the city of New \ork ; they are rather brief, but perhaps they tell better tor their pithiness. " The capitalist may manage to obtain 7 per cent with good security. The lawyer and the doctor will not succeed. An orthodox minister would do so. liv the way, the worn-out. exposed impostor. Fi ey, who said he was converted from Judaism lu (Miristnmity, lins been attracting large audiences in New York. The proficient in the fine uris will receive little encouragement. The literary man must starve. Tlie tutor's posts are preoccupied. The shopkeeper may do as well, but not better than in London, unless he be a niau of superior talent and large capital ; for such icipiisites, I think, there isa fine opening The farmer Mr. Cobbclt says; must labour hard, ami be but scantily reiuunei itu!. The (derk and the shopman will gel bul little more than their board and longing. Mechanics, whose trades are of the first necessity, will do well ; those not such, or who understand only Ihe cotton, linen, woollen, glass, earthenware, silk and stocking manufactures, cannot obtain employment. Thc labouring man will do well, particularly if he have a wife and children, who are capable of contributinu: not merely to the consuming, but to the earning also of the common stock." " Upon the whole, a walk through New York will disappoint an Englishman ; there is, on the surface of society, a carelessness, a laziness, an unsocial indifference, which freezes the blood and disgusts the judgment." To Englishmen, who justly glory in the purity and impartiality of our courts of justice, the following obst rv..lions nu thc administration of justice, and on the Judges of the l-nited States, are not the most inviting in the world. ?'

Attention to this will stive time and unpleasant feeling's." Cruelty. At this same Inn, an instance of the shocking barbarity with which slaves are treated in the United States, of which this volume abounds with proofs afflicting to humanity, is related. " A few minutes before dinner, my at tent mn was excited by the piteous cries of a human voice, accompanied with the loud erm king of a whip. Following the sound, I found that it issued from a log barn, Hit* door of which was fastened. Peeping through the logs, I perceived the barkeeper, together with a stout man, more than six feet high, who was Colonel-, aili) a negro-boy about ll years of age, stript naked, receiving the lashes of these monsters, who relieved each other in the use of a horsewhip: thc poor boy fell down upon his knees several times, be*gging and pr,liing that they would not kill him, and that he would do any thing they liked ; thin produced no cessation in their exercise. At length Mr. Lawes arrived, told the valiant Colonel, aud his humane employer, the bar-keeper, to desist, and that the boy's refusal to cut wood, was in obedience to his (Mr L's- directions. Colonelsaid, that ' he did not know what thc ni?(??'tr had done, but that the bar-keeper requested his assistance to whip Ctesar; of course he lent him a hand, being no more than he should expect Mr. Lawes to do for lum limier similar circumstances." " Thc* whole company at dinner sanctioned this barbarous conduct, and the humane landlord was only angry because the ni<rtiar was not his own, " but left under his care by a friend, and he did not like to have a friend's property injured." Such treatment of their wretched slaves, the Author assures us, is common in Kentucky; while in the Eastern and older Stales the oppression of all persons of colour is intolerably grievous." Arrogance, ano Illiberality to ToHUONVHS. Converse with an American upon the condition of the world at large, its political situation and true interests, he is rarely clear-headed ; not from want of capacity, but the sources of his knowledge have been ?o jumbled, and his information in general is so ill arranged, that he is often, in tfie same breadth, au advocate for the extremes of liberty and of slavery. The nation at large dislike langland, and yet, both individually aud collectively, would be offended should a hint be expressed that they were of Irish or of Dutch, and not of English, descent. They contend for the superiority of their genius in taste, mechanical arts, and literature, anti yet they disregard fashions or books which are not imported from Great Britain. Notwithstanding this voluntary national dependence, then.' are, perhaps, no people, not even excepting the French, who are so vain as the Auk ricans; their self-estimation, and cool-headed bombast, when speaking of themselves or their country, are quite ludicrous. An anecdote is told by General Moreau, who, at the commencement of the late war with England, was in America;? A friend, addressing him, observed that his military talents would be of essential service to the Republic. Ile replied iu the negative ; adding that there was not a drummer in the American army who did not think himself equal to General Moreau. This fact will apply to all occupations with an equal degree of faithfulness. Every man here thinks he has arrived at the acme of perfection ; the meehan icm themselves possess Hie same feeling. When at Newark, I was informed that some choice designs in chair-japanning and coach plating were lately produced by two emigrants ; the natives turned upon their heels, ?' Av, they guessed them 'ere were fashions they had left off." Every American considers that it is impossible fora foreigner to teach him any thing, that his head contains a perfect Encyclopaedia. This excessive inflation of mind must be attended with many disadvantages; (hough when I look at the various causes which have combined to produce it, I am not much surprised at its existence. As a people, they feel that they have got to gain a character, aud like individuals under similar circumstances, are captious and conceited in proportion to their defects. They appear to aim at a standard of high reputation, without the laborious task of deserving it, and practise upon themselves the self deception of believing that they really are what they wish to be. This feeling has not been lessened by their successes in the late contest with Great Britain ; for, although in several engagements on our favourite element tlu-y iud ,111 ova rw helming siipei ito itv, yet there were instances when th il wa., not thc ?.ise: anti the -defeat of lin Engdish fri gatts, with evin anv disparity ol'foi cc, was too gnat an honour to be estimated exactly ns it merited. The boasting upon this sublet t is so extravagant that it burlesques the object of its praise, " America is now the ruler of the waves ;" and every song and joke, fact and falsehood, that wc have bestowed upon our tars, are transferred to thc " Slur spangled banner, and the brave sons of Columbia," with thc characteristic tidehtv of a national intellect, reutlcred barren fi om want of culture: ami even on inch an occasion has baldly produced un attempt at originality I Yet with all this boasting and conceit ?f their superior talents, it is withy of remark that the inhabitants nf the Tinted States have produced very f(,w original works of distinguished eminence. The American or;i;tho|"gv ol the late Mr. Wilson is iudu d au honour to any country, whither we lcgard the splendour of its typography <>r the extent of its rest areli. We, might intutmti a lew smaller productions which undoubtedly possess consul' rabin value ; but the great bulk of Ann tit in literature consists of reprints of standard English works in a neat nnd cheap form. There is one ttipic more, of considerable importance, on whn h we have not yet given Mr. Fearoit's sentiments,?that of Ri l,h.ion : aud sorrv are we to say that his report is unfavourable. " 1 feel," says he, i4 little hopes of conveying lo yon a faithful portraiture of this peop'e, In tin ir n hgious charaitcr* they differ essentially from the English Sectaries, in being more solemnly bigotbd, more intoleraul, and more ignorant of the Scriptures. I do not discover those distinctive marks which are called forth in England by Sectarianism. There is not the aristocracy of the Establishment, the sourness of the Presbyterian, or the sindified melancholy of the Methodist A cob! ni.donn bigotry seems to pervade aM parties; equally inaccessible to argument, opposed to investigation, and, 1 ft ir, iiiditl'crent about truth ; as it is, even tin pioutl Pharisaical Quaker appears under a .nore chilling and more fm /ing atmosphere in tins new v. orld." This is a severe picture, and we cannot help suspecting that Mr. Fearon's disappointment in all the objects to which his attention was directed, has caused hun to give it the soiubre louche*, by which it is c haracteii/.t cl. 1 he advantages and disadvantages of emigration, are thus briefly stated, towards the close of the work, in some strictures on Mr. Uirkbeck's letters : " lu going to America, I would say generally, thc emigrant must expect to find nut an economical or cleanly people, not a so. cial or generous people; not a people of enlarged ideas', not a people of liberal opum' ns, or towards whom you can express your thoughts "free as air;" nota people friendly to the advocates of liberty in lairope ; not a people who understand liberty from investigation and from principle ; not a people who comprehend the meaning oftbe words " honour," and ?? gi iicrosity." < in the other hand, he will find a country possessed of the most enlightened civil and political advantages ; a people reaping thc: reward of their own lahours, a people not paying tithes, and not subjected lei heavy taxation without representation , a people with a small national debt; a people without spies mid informer *? ; a people without an enormous standing army ; a people in possession of an exit ut of territory capable of sustaining au increase of millions and tenn of millions cf population ; and a people rapidly advancing towards national -wealth and greatness.'' We shall not prosecute these extracts any further, but refer our readers to >lr. l-'earon's instructive volume. The result ot his testimony (and it must be admitted that lu* is not too partial to his native country,) is, that England is the preferable country for Englishmen; that, in transporting themselves to the United Stutts, they must sink into the condition of enies, and submit to be so considered ; and that they must purchase the boasted exemption from taxes, and the extension of their civil rights, by the sacrifice of the many physical and moral blessings to which they have been accustomed, and which ought to be the fruit aud prize of liberty. Lastly, it may be inferred from Mr. Fearon'* statements that, if the question of puferemc were to be decided by the English residents in America, their votes would (with the exception of a few fortunate adventurers) be unreservedly i" favour of their native country. Eve-n Mr. Cobbett, much as he ha* railtd against Ihe F'-nglish government, has lately dee hired in Ins ??> Neat's Ile sill, lice in America," (which ihe prcsMire ol'other aitit'bs alone bis pre v atti! ik hain noticing)?"- i.myland t\ np/ i.'uuntii/, and lo england I shall return . / like it best, and shall at iv ays like it best." The public are greatly obliged to Mr. Fearon for the large mass of important, information which he has collected, and for the plain and manly way in which it is communicated. Though a very short tune only Ifs elapsed sinew the publication of his work, such is the interest it lias excited, that a second edition was announced while we were preparing the present article for the press.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE. 112,0IRS OF FEMALE PHILOSOPHERS. WU1ENS we rend the advertisement of this took in the newspap)ers, I% e imagined n% ith plea6ure, that a fund of invtructino and amuecinfnt was providel for u . If any species of hiography were amusing, that which *as here announced, we thought, innst prove particularlv to. For soime time past, the female sex have peculiarly distingul lied themelvc ! by the eccentricity of their philosoplhiical notion,' the zeal with which they have maintained them, and the enerev with Is hich they' have in some instanees reduced tlhenm to practice. A colltctiou of anec(lotes relative to the cntitinentl and transaltions of these remarkable heroines, could not have failed to have been very interesting to all classes of readers; and as the adverti~ement also informed us, that the uarrative twas to be written by a philosopher of the other sex ; that the lion Mas to he) painted by the man ; we really expected no little amuseinent. With these impressions we procured the book ; btlit to our inexpressil)le chagrin, we inimediately di-covered that we had been I hoI.rc(! W e had been fairly taken in by the skill of our dexterous male 1) hilosophers who, under the title of McmoiiS, had actually imposed upon us a Modern Natrc 1! Instead of any accouAbt of thnoe celebrated ladie;, about whose -ayings anti doings there is so much we were desirous to know, we here found an Allegrina, a Diania, an Imagini, a Cordlelia, who sat |down very calmly toc.ether, to talk over in i their ownu waner, fluuic'i La-av* on tbA: lour Plhilosophies. We cannot think that this was a ierv fair trick in the gentleman who stiles himself the Editor and Publisher, (words, it would seem, of ditlerent import in Lnglikh, though certainly all onie Iln the 6reek, and in the Latin too :) lie may Indeed replenish his pockets for this time, before the public perceive how they are duped, but let hiim hereafter heware of hanging out the false sign of Memoirs; tile hoax will not take a sclond(l time. But ai we are sorry that it should take at all, and that others should he duped as we oulrselc' lhave beeu ; we shall endceavour to gise some account of what the public will find in thlese nominal Memoirs of the Female Sex. Thln autior who, as we understand, has liever cro si d the English Channel, happened, as lie iifin rns us, to be detained some ears ago b% thie overflowing of the river (Carigliano, oil Ilii; return fromn Naples to Rome. lie wa; therefore compelled to remain for several days Iln thle celebrated town of M inturnoe, at an inn, so cold, dIrt', and supplied wvith such had .licer, that it would have been utterly unsuppiortable, had not a Russian Prinuc, ahd an Abbs, hlis parasite, been luckily detained there at the saIne timC. Our author immediately contrived to gain such credit %s ith the t'riiice as a profound politician,by merely making a few remarks on the power and projects of the august Catherine, that his IHigigness eagerly entreated him to point out to liin tile method of becotming a profound politician, wIthout perish. ing of ennui. But however sagacious our autliors reply might liave proved, it was cut short hy the rrench Abhtn, who informed the P'rinee, that he would certainlv efrect his object by reading the tragedies of (Corneille. The Alibb now began to recite some scernes from the ('inna of that author, during which tie Prince fell fast A.cp ; but the Frenchman soon hegan t,. wa* le an Italian air. in a voice so dreadfully stentorian, that his patron immediately started up, enqui ring if the siaters of the Garigliano hail forced their way into the rhamber; and calling for his horses, hastcned to retrace his romte to NapleF. Our author, has ing thus found a moment of l snure, took out hlis jourinal, and began to .; rite -inine renmarkl, no doubt verv excellent, :apon ' mauiL d ai d the fine atts ;'' but just ahe wa; set dowvn, he was, ti our inexpressible Io's, intelrnpted by the N nt'i( of Eouae females s1 ho had jout arrised at the inn, and were lstir in uo an apa rtment adjuining to his. 0Jly a er V Iih;n andll iniplmpcrt partition sepa*:ated tLe two rouni-, and our anther conld hear every word which was said, as distinctly as if lie had been in company with the ladies, IHere a tough struggle commienced between cu. riosity and honour; curiftsity invsiting upon the pleasures of listening, and honour urging the shaine of doing so. At length, curiosity triumpihed, aided by the information islibih lie hlad picked up from their discourse, that thev were strangers to each other, and consequently were not likely to disclose any family secrets. lie soon discovered that they tvere fout in number, and that each of them was a philoso. plier of a different sect: one an Epicurean, another a Platonist, a third a Stoie, and a fourth, not a Sceptic, hut a Christian. Theie four ladies, who had, by the best luck in the world, arrived at the very same nmonment at the inn on the baniks of the Garigliano, proeeded to order dinner; a transaction which e almost gave rise to a long philosophical discussion I but, with one consent, they agreed to defer it, till they had first enjoyed their *linner. Afier the dirty business of knives and trenchers isas over, the female philosophers proceeded tode. cide iy lot, the order in i* hiich their harangues should follow; and Signora Allegrina havin,, obtained the first place, began to talk very fluently in the style of Mr. flume's Epicurean. IPhilosophier. This lady proved to be a cele. lbrated Parisian opera dancer, nho had reduced to practice the Wshole theory of rWfined fensunl enjol)1ment. " Aly dancing," says this phillosopher in petticoats, "' is criticisled and " admired by the most fastidious and enlight, ened public in EIurope. I experience iNfi" nite Pleasure in the exercise of iny abilities. " What a charming idea of love is conveyed by a well-acted pantomime! What a field for the display of coquetry!

Ali ! hoss lively, how delightful the pleasurc I experience, is hen all eyes are fixed upon ine, all hearts affected; and when the ' general admiration which was suspended " from the dread of losing a single movement, hursts out is ith enthusiasm ; when, iith a " labt tlourish, I escape behind the scenes, and " listen to tIme bravo and repeated plaudits !" Signora Imagina next took up the discourse; and, as might be expected, was very full of her cele-tial joys and visions ; and not a mhit behiud the fortner speaker io the tcrrestritil patk ,ion of vanity. Moreover, she was exceedingly in love with a Blritish Member of Parliament, ..hom she had not seen for many years, and whom she never expected to see again. But distance or absence were ntu wile calculated to abate her passion ; her lose i as pure and etherial, as it was ardent: she knew that he %as animated by the replort or her fame, (for she informs us that she is a celebrated painter and poetes;,) while at the same time, she in her turn, was inspired by the consideration of his rnble patriotic efforts; for site, heavenly soul ! knew nothing of the outs and ins, the truckling for places to those in power, or bellowing with the opposition, 6hould these happen to be refused. Signora Diana, who had drawn the third lot, declared she understood nothing of the euthusinstic pleasures of Si,~nora I magina, but thought she herself had found out a much more certain road to happiness in constant activity and exertion. she uas one of those high-minded ladies, who thought that the male sex had encroached upon the right of the other, who had not suI)l)orted their own pretensions by any strenuous ell'orts. She was emancipated from all those timid fears which usually enervate her sex ; she had plunged %$ it unUt ajpprehaension into t he inlrigtei of a court, and having engaged in a successful conspiracy, Fucceeded in elevating a fasourite prince to a throne. She still contuumed to employ herself in the management of pulblic affairs, and she inas at this moment on her return fronm an embassy of great importance. Signora Corrnleia, the Christian l'hilosopher, now be,gan tQ declare her sentiments on the happiest condition of life. She was of a middling rank, the wife of a Leghorn merchant; she wvas of religious parents; her husband was a man of the same cast; she had lived from her Nouth among relations and acquaintances, by whom she wah beloved ; nor does it appear that she had ever stirred from borme, unleis during this remarkable jaunt to Naples and lback again, which she was allowed to perform without a single attendant relative. Cordelia dwelt wvith the most expressive eloquence on the happiness of a condition such as 1 her's, and concluded that it was as near to uerfectionu as any enjoyed on earth. " Ah "('rddlia ' ("ordelia !" exclaimed our author, forgetting, that he was onl- a li tener at the partition. At this unexpected sound, the ladivs started upl), exclaiuning that thle) Were hetra'ed ; an.1 Signora Allegrina tripping into his apartment, dragged the culprit intt the presinctie of the w hole coniV-a11 \^ ;V a pumtui 'huue t for his impertinent curiosity, he was commanded to decide upon their respective opinions vith regard to happiness; a decision which they imagined would hring downf upon him the wrath of at least three competitors. But our author ias too wily to be taken in this Irap: he declared that they were all in the right, for all of them had chosen that sort of happiness which best suited her conditionr and temper: in short, he decided that Allegrina was best fitted by nature and circumstances to he an Epicurean, Imagina to be a Platonist, Diana to be a Stoic, and Cordelia to be a Christian; and consequently neither of them could have been happier by pursuing any other mode of happiness than thai which they had chosen. Allegrina was no more suited to be a Christian philosopher than Cordelia to be an FEpicurian. These very accommodating principles made our author a very great favourite with all the ladies; he spent t%% o da) s is ith themit upon the haniks of the Garigliano ; and they all afterisards contrived to meet frequently together, though they lived in p)retty distant kingdoms of lEurope. In these happy interviews our author contrived to discover many secret particulars relative to the chlaracter and tranjactions of his fair companions; and these he now very kindly and confidentially cominunicates to the public. Those of our readers who choose may follow this author through his pictures of imagginary female philosophers: he vill find them exactl y in the st)le ofthe introductory story, equally elegantand equally interesting. Our antho 's ideas of his subject are so vagne, and the language lhe emplo3 s frequently so indistinct that it is scarceI) possibleto know w hat lie would be at. Allcgrina informs us, (vol. i. p. 21) " that her freedom from irresolution proceeds, perhaps, " from the volatility of her disposition." In page 33, nmomentary is, in defiance of )r. .Johnson, employed for niontlntuous; and, at lage 73, Cordelia is made to call her daughter and two boys " her beloved offsprings." Our author's consistency in dlepietiug his characters is exactly on a footing is il Ilihk skill ii the ln-lish language. The Stqical l)Dina icarried awa) by a wlhirlvind of anibition she is engaged in secfet conspiracies, in court intrigue,, in ever) thing that can procure her aIn ascendenicy in public aflairs.

Y tin niight at least have looked into ZMrs. Carter's trantlatiun of Lpi~tcluv, and thus lbase rN t, escaped the ridicule of utterly misrepresenting and hurlesquing the tencts of one of the best known sects of antiquity. Wc cannot concluide this review without adverting to the author's ideas concerning happinev.

VOYAGES AND TRAVELS. Trarels in the Panjab, Affyianistan, and Tarkistan, to Balk, Bokhara, and Herat, 6-c. Bmy Moi.AN L.tL,, Esq. Knight of the Persian Order of the Lion and; Sun, lately attached to the Mission at Kabul. London, 14 6. Allen and Co. MO1AN- LAL Was the son of a Persian of rank and fortune, who had attached himself to Mr. E LPIHINSTONE during his mission at Delhii, and acquired a taste fori English habits and literature. lie was among the mosti energetic supporters of an innovation introduced into: the Persian college at this city, having for its object the teaching of the English language; and his son, .MOIAN LAL, was one of six pupils who braved the first storm,! of popular prejudice. Of these six youths, four, as we ! are informed, have since attained to distinction, MOHAN LAL being one of the successful half-dozen. The particulars of his fortunes we need not follow; suffice it that in 1831 he was appointe(l to the office of Persian secretary to Sir ALEXANDER liURnEs, who was about: to undertake his famous journey into l3okliara. He accompanied the traveller in this enterprising tour, and I on his return undertook the post of agent at Cabul. ! When BVRN'ES was commissioned as envoy to DOST MAHOMNINIED, M101AN LAL'S services were again requested and readily given. Ile was, therefore, witness to the events that occurred in such rapid succession at Cabul, and it was with difficulty he escaped the death that was the fate of his friends. B3ut he was made prisoner, and tortured to extract information of moneyI which his captors believed to be concealed by the Eng- I lish. When peace was restored, he came to England, w: he re he now resides amid a large circle of friends, whom lie has conciliated by his pleasing manners and imte lligence. The purpose of this volume is to present a narrative t of the author's adventures from his first introduction to BURNES, and his observations of, and reflections upon, the various countries, scenery, people, and persons he has visited. He promises a distinct volume on Atfghanistan, and this portion of his career is therefore very briefly touched upon here. 'i'rae value of this work consists in the opportunities enjoyed by a Mohammedan and an Oriental for procuring ( access to persons and places which would have been w closed to a Frank, his Oriental birth and breeding b as enabling him to make more accurate notes of what he so saw than a stranger who is always liable to misunderstand DnI things of whose meaning he is ignorant. Its interest by lies mainly in the curiosity we feel to know what imis piression the civilization, arts, science, manners, and Is social organization of Europe, have produced upon an intelligent Eastern, to whom they must have been so in entirely novel. He writes English with the facility of a at native, so that it would be difficult to trace a foreign ve idiom; indeed, had we not known, we certainly should n- not have suspectedl that the author was not an English. in man. But in the composition he may possibly have had ill the aid of one of the hangers-on of literature who id advertise " to prepare manuscripts for the press." a- The journal of his visit to Boklhara has been already nt pl)ulishe(l at Calcutta, and its interest has been anticipated here by the narrative of Sir A. BURNES. We is will notice only such parts of it as contain some novelty, to as this description of n , THE TUERQUOIS NfINS OF MADAN. ic The people of Madan content themselves with searching to among the old fragments, rather than being at the trouble or or I expense of making new excavations, which might reward their of labour. We visited many other places, which hbl been dug 'for firozab, and at last arrived at a mine where the workmen were extracting the precious stone. The operations are very rude; many of the firozahs are broken and overlooked. Only fragments of the firozah, which in former times had been dug out by some enterprising miners, were found here, which, to after being brought out of the mine by the workmen were exI amined, and such as seemed to contain the stone were Ld separated and carried away on men's backs, or on mules, ! to a stream of water, and there washed, by being trodden upon; when, after some hours, the blue colour of | the firozah was visible, and the dross or rubbish being d turned over and over, all the pieces of the gem that were of value were picked out, and put into an old shoe. We did )r not observe any of much value; the produce altogether was St insignificant, but when extracted from the rock that contains :0 them, and polished a little, a large profit is realized on them. ie These mines are monopolized by the inhabitants of the village N- of Madan, who are jealous of strangers, and wish to keep all n the produce to themselves. Their working implements being ,e few and weak, the full value of the mines is not appreciated by them. Sometimes water flows out of the rock, and puts a stop to further progress. By the employment of gunpowder, it and skilful miners from Europe, a large revenue might be nderived from the Persian government; but the proprietors are t afraid to spend much money in making discoveries, lest the Ieavarice of the king or governors of Khorasan should lead them eto claim a part; and whenever a valuable firozah is found, itis I carried to some foreign country, for fear of its being seized; consequently, there are few good firozahs to be obtained in T Mashad. The miners, also, are acquainted with the value of s the stones, as their hue is so delicate, that it is affected by 8 changes in the weather, and a gem which looks beautiful one It day, loses its colour the next. When dipped in water, they h assume a fine, bright, blue tinge; this method is often adopted e! to deceive the unwary travellers. The gems are always sold y in parcels containing good and bad, and at times turn out a profitable speculation; at others, they are a loss to the purchasers. The proprietors of the mines are so jealous of ' foreigners, that they run away from their villages, when any one arrives who wishes to visit the place, as we experienced. The mode of cutting the firozah is very simple; it is done by means of a small wheel, which is turned by one hand while e the stone is applied by the other, till sufficiently polished. It D is then fixed to the end of a small piece of stick, with sealingway, and exposed for sale. e And this is his sketch of THE CITY OF BALK. This was formerly a very large and populous city, but at Ipresent nothing is to be seen except a mass of ruins and dust. r Orchards are scattered in every spot; their fruits are not l wholesome to strangers, who get sick by eating them. The bazar of Balk, though broad, is irregularly roofed with rafters, hay, and mud. The shopkeepers are all Mohammedans; the Hindus reside in saraes. The shops are always shut up, except on Tuesday, when they are open, and scarcely one lamp burning in the bazar causes it to have a dismal appear. ance at night. Without the city of Balk is an old mud fort, called Chihal Gazi, which, people say, in the night increases in its height. I wished to stop and verify the fact, but our caravan started at the very eve. Balk is said to be the mother of cities, and to have been peopled by Noah's son. The buildings in former days extended as far as Mazar, and their roofs were so near to each other, that a goat climbed up one of the roofs in Balk, and descended next day at Mazar, whither his master followed him also. This story tends to prove that Balk was one of the largest cities in Turkistan. The sufferings of the adventurous travellers in Turkistan were frightful, as witnessOur dress and manner of living shewed our poverty, and we never changed clothes until they disappeared under filth and vermin. On our route to Khulum, we were sometimes obliged to sleep in dark rooms, where the beds were made of the dung of horses and sheep; and often we passed several restless nights in an open field, fearing the attack of robbers. Our breakfast was made on horseback ; and it consisted of pieces of dry bread, baked six or seven days, and of a bit of meat and cheese. We drank water out of the leather bottle which hung against the saddle. Captain Burnes and 'Mr. Gerard used their fingers instead of knives and forks, and their hands for spoons; our towels were the sleeves of our shirts. We combed our hair with the nails of our fingers, and brushed our teeth with a piece of wood. Here is a picture of PRISONERS OF WAR IN PERSIA. We set out to visit the Turkmans of Sarakhs. No one was allowed to go inside the gaol; but, as we were high guests, the door was instantly opened to us. The dungeon was so narrow and small, that the unfortunate families sat on each other. The shrieks of the little children, along with those of their parents, caused by starvation, excited the pity of all. Some of them had a few pieces of carpet, cloth, and a few balls of silk, which they bartered with the Persian soldiers for bits of bread. This traffic continued a little time through the holes in the walls of the prison. Sometimes the poor prisoners were cruelly deceived, and got nothing from the people in return for their property. The cold wind and rain pierced their naked and sickly bodies. There were dead camels and horses lying on the ground, whose rotten flesh was eaten by the hungry Turkmans; who were covered with mud, and the blood of the dead animals. It was a very dreadful scene indeed. Though the Turkmans had attacked the Persians and made them slaves, yet still they treated them well, for fear of their falling into low spirits and sickness, which would have diminished their value. Undoubtedly their punishment exceeded their crime. He went with Dr. GERARD to Herat. The roofs of the Charsu bazars, which form straight lines op. posite to each other, are almost brought to the ground. The shops, which are open and large, presenta very dark appearance. No repairs are performed in Herat till the last extremity. The houses are generally two stories high, and have very small entrances; but when you step in you have a large and clear view. The lanes are dirty and narrow, and abound in holes. The buildings are of mud, without a single rafter, with many small windows, which, instead of glass, have white paper of Russia, through which they get light when it is snowing and all the doors are shut up on account of the cold. The Arg, or the residence of the king, is one of the most solid and ancient buildings in Herat. It is fortified and surrounded by a deep ditch. It is situate within the walls of the city, on steep ground, and is constructed of burnt bricks, stones, and mortar. The bastions have no guns, but the treasure of the Shah is deposited there. The ditch is crossed by a wooden bridge, which, after sunset, is dragged up by the doorkeepers inside of the Arg wall. The palace has so little of the character of a regal residence, that the gaols in British India are much superior to the palace of Kamran, not only in architectural beauty, but even in cleanliness. The most beautiful and beneficial edifice in Herat is the covered pond erected by Hasan Khan Shamila. It is nearly sixty feet square, and has a few arches inside, where the people put lamps for show. The water is thirty feet deep, and looks very clear and shining. It is situate in one of the bazars of Charu, and is always surrounded by water-bearers. The following Persian verse shews the date of its erection: " The most beautiful place of the buildings in Herat is the cistern." (925 Hijri.) Opposite to the above pond, or the IHaus Charsu, stands a miserable, dark, and damp place, which is called Bandikhanab, or the prison. It has a very small door, and no windows to admit air. In the centre of the room is excavated a hole, in which the prisoners are confined at night. No air is felt there, and the heat, in conjunction with the damp and the insects, torments the poor prisoners terribly, and generally causes their death. Neither law nor time can release the criminals, but only the pleasure of the king, or the chiefs who have influence at the court. The objects that seemed most to interest him in Eng. land were the electric telegraph, the railroad, and the court balls, and he was fortunate enough to receive invitations to the latter. A Persian's notes on these subjects will be read with curiosity, and we extract two of them. MOHAN LAL AT THE COURT BALL. March 5.-Mr. (now Sir Emerson) Tennent wrote a very kind note, stating that the Earl of Ripon, president of the India Board, had a high opinion of my humble services; but that as the result of my claims was pending upon the decision of the Court of Directors and his lordship, it would be advisable that I should be presented to her Majesty through some channel independent of government. It was therefore that the noble and benevolent Lord Ashley took me in his carriage. and presented me to her most gracious Majesty Queen Victoria. I was also invited to her Majesty's ball in Buckingham Palace. The court was very full, and the rooms exceedingly warm. All the ministers of state, the foreign ambassadors, and the nobility and gentry of England, in their different costumes, bowing and passing before her Majesty, exhibited a magnificent sight; but the rooms are not well adapted, nor sufficiently spacious. The drawing-rooms of her 'Majesty, where all the ladies are presented, exhibit a great profusion of beauty, of rich dresses and jewels. The royal balls are beyond any thing of the kind in the world. One who is as fortunate as myself to be invited, will see an assembly of noble ladies with charming countenances, and elegant robes covered with diamonds, joining in the dance, which, although dazzling, yet becomes brighter and more beautiful when her Majesty and her royal consort Prince Albert take part in the dance. In so large a company the Queen appeared to me the most graceful in the dance, smiling and looking now and then graciously towards her royal husband. I kept my humble eyes unweariedly fixed upon her Majesty and the Prince while they were dancing; and I read with inexpressible delight in their countenances that they have a deep attachment to each other.-I submitted to the Court of Directors a memorial of my services while employed by the supreme government of India, in Central Asia, and in various diplomatic missions and capacities. The chairman and court, in conjunction with the president of the Board of Control, took an impartial view of my statement, and granted me a reward for my services. The chairman added, that as I was yet a young person, I should have many other opportunities of establishing further claims by good services to the honourable company; and when I get old, or retire, the government would take all my services into reconsideration, and reward me accordingly. All the authorities at the India House and the Board of Control, after a full consideration of my case, treated me with marked kindness, and admitted me to an interview whenever I desired it. For these favours I beg to tender my humble and grateful thanks to these high authorities. Mr. George Clerk honoured me with his visit; and as he knew my services, he stated that " I fully deserved the reward government gave me." MOHLN LAL ON THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPl. I was then conducted to a small room in the galvanic telegraph office. It is a most wonderful thing, and no description can convey a proper idea of its extraordinary effect. I am, in fact, lost in wonder, and perplexed how to detail its forma- tioo. The only thing I can say, and it will astonish every one, is this: that Portsmouth is about one hundred miles from London; I asked the gentleman of the office to get for me information from London what kind of weather it was there, or whether the Indian mail had urived. By moving the needle gradually over the different letters, which appeared exactly hke a clock, the question was made on my part, and the answer returned in the same manner, and all this was completed in the course of fve seconds. And we conclude with his commentary on English society generally. THE PERSIAN ON ENGLAND. The manners, customs, life, and modes of society in England are of an elegant and refined style. No country takes such pains in cultivating knowledge, and no parents are so desirous of rendering their children accomplished, by expense and anxious care, as those of Britain. They ask and find out from a son his taste and wish, and educate him to meet the ! duties of the profession he chooses, whether in civil life, in the 4aw, navy, army, or whatever it may be; and then, using their best influence, will have him launched into the world. They never expect his support themselves ; the only thing wanted afterwards from the son ii, that he should prosper. The girls are brought up under the cAreful eyes of their mother ; and when they are accomplished in languages and manners, the parents spare no expense or fatigue to introduce them into society, where they have a difficult office to perform. The voung lady must have agreeable manners, and be able to sing, 1dance, and read, write, and speak French, if not other foreign languages. The parents give parties, and invite all their ! fashionable acquaintance, and feel proud if their daughter wins f the heart of a respectable person. But, alas! these accomplishments, added to miracles (,f beauty, are considered matters of secondary value; the lady must have money for her 1 husband, or have a prospect that he will have it when thei perents die! In all the Asiatic countries, if a woman remains c a unmarried after her proper age, she is looked upon and re- a spectel as a saint ; and this is very rare, too ; but England t will a-tonish Asiatics by producing thousands of saints, or un- c married ladies of mature age, bearing the name of " Miss," f and wearing the dress and ornaments of a young lady of fifteen years of age. When I first arrived in England, I felt my. n self in an awkward position, when addressing an old lady by a the name of" 1Miss," and using the same word to a yonnger rl one, who looked like the grand-daughter of the older lady. u When people talk of marriage, the first question is, " Has she a money ?" A gentleman will dance with and flatter many u ladies in parties; but he will prefer and marry the one who tl has or will have most money, even though she be ugly and not accomplished. In this case, the lady is sensible that she has no charms but those of her hank-notes; and yet the rule of society keeps all these things buried in the hearts of the newly. married, and their style of addressing and of writing to each w other will be just as if mutual love had wrought upon each ir other's mind. Age, also, is not considered a matter of conse-ti quence, if he or she be rich. Yet there are many instances of tf true affection, and of happy marriages. T ___________________ _ 01

London: Chatto ami I Windus. 4 What He Cost Her' is a very fair specimen of a j certain type of the modern novel, that type which appears to start off from the beginning with no definite purpose whatever, and only comes to an end when the requisite number of pages that form the three volumes demanded by Mudie are completed. The authors of novels of this kind have solved the problem which so puzzled the Israelite slaves?tbat of making their tale of bricks without straw. In such novels there is absolutely nothing whatever, for their story is slight and uninteresting, and the style claims no consideration?it is merely thc stuff that holds the whole together. But tbey are not the light airy trifles, pleasing and impalpable as soap-bubbles, suitable to lazy reading of a summer holiday, which, if they seek for no eternity of recollection, at least serve to gladden the passing moment. These have their mission, and a very delightful mission ; they amuse and only pretend to amuse ; but it is difficult to see any reason for the existence of such a novel as 4 What He Cost Her.' It is nothingness, like its lighter brethren, but it is heavy nothingness, tho very ponderosity of Nihilism. It is not interesting, it is not amusing, it is not appalling, it is not instructive, but, like Mr. Gilbert's Chrysos, it is hopeless to go on saying what it is not, for it would take too long. It certainly never is what a novel ought to be. Two young Woolwich cadets, Cecil Landon and Hugh Darrel, rescue at a fair two young ladies from a lot of roughs who are annoying them?a mode of making heroes and heroines acquainted tbat is not altogether unknown to fiction, and very familiar to the boards of transpontine theatres. The four fall in love in no time, and very shortly Cecil Landon marries the object of his admiration, Ella Mayne. It turns out, however, that for certain reasons she has married him under an assumed name, her real name being Juxon, as she is a descendant of the famous Bishop Juxon. This concealment naturally annoys Cecil, and being of a sensitive type of mind he retires to the country and marries there a charming young lady whom he has rescued from a railway accident. This in turn annoys wife number one when she comes to hear of it, and an action for bigamy is instituted, which, however, by an act of generosity on her part, ends in the acquittal of Cecil. Separation, considering that they were quite unable to hit it off during their married life, was just as well. Here is a quotation introducing a conversation that took place shortly after their marriage and before the disclosure of the feigned name. Now Ella was an " advanced thinker," though not exactly of the Manchester type, and, what was worse, she was an advanced speaker. What she thought she had no scruple about putting into words; and not a little had she fluttered the doves of Bayswater ?even the male ones?at various dinner-parties by so doing. 44 Upon my life, Landon, your wife is a?very remarkable woman," was a confidential observation that had been made to Cecil more than once, when his host had come to his end of the table at dessert, having previously had Ella on his right hand during tho repast; and the observation had not been taken as a compliment. She was so beautiful and so intelligent?for intelligence is comparative, and Bayswater dinner-parties are sometimes a little dull?that no man, except her husband, was annoyed by her peculiarities; but they offended the women, who resented them by pitying Cecil, and Cecil did not like to be pitied. 441 cannot think, Ella, where you get hold of such ideas," observed he, upon one occasion, when they were, for a wonder, passing the erening alone, and at home. 44 They are really not becoming; Lady Groen was quite shocked by what you said to her last night about the Bishops." 441 am sorry for that," said Ella, dryly. "Well, of course, you are; she is a person of position, and her good opinion is worth having." 44 Indeed, that is not my view of it. Why, / was sorry that I failed to convince her. Persons of intelligence I generally find agree with me, but if I could persuade the Lady Greens?that is the million?that would, indeed, bo a triumph." " I beg to state, Ella, so far as the matter in debate between you and her ladyship was concerned, that I also belong to the million." Ella took no notice of this declaration of faith, but remarked, quietly, " I wish you wouldn't say * her ladyship,' Cecil?it is a term only to be used by servants." 441 think I know how to express myself, thank you, "without any 1 Hints on Etiquette,'" answered Cecil, biting his lip. " The fact is you aro jealous of everyone in a position higher than your own." 44 Jealous of Lady Green?" inquired Ella, contemptuously. " Yes, becauso she goes down to dinner before you. There is no limit to the envy of some women." 44 There is to their patience," answered Ella, rising from her chair. " I will not listen to such words, Cecil." 44 You bring them on yourself, my dear," ho went on, in less antagonist ic tones. 44It is no pleasuro to me to speak them. But I can't help hearing?and feeling?what people say about you, and your opinions." 44 What people ? " "Well, very respectable people. It is all very well for a man of genius to set himself up in opposition to established notions?though even he is thought a fool for his pains?but in a woman it is not becoming. A woman ought to be-" 44 Pretty and plump," interrupted Ella ; il and to have no opinions of her own." 441 was not going to put it in that way, but you havo described a very nice sort of woman," said Cecil. *44 You may say, perhaps, that my father holds pretty much the same views as yourself." Now what is the use of a novel like this ? That there are in thc world weak young men and bad-tempered women is unfortunately a well-established fact; that people occasionally commit bigamy is made obvious by tho police reports of thc daily papers; but the question is whether it is necessary to write novels about such people merely because they are weak and bad tempered, and commit bigamy, and not for the sake of having anything new to say or show. It would be very unfair to object to having books about disagreeable people. This would indeed narrow the field of novel-writers terribly ; but at least the reading public have the right to demand that these disagreeable persons shall be so given as to make it worth while to read about them. If a novel be uninteresting it is unnecessary, and 4 What He Cost Her' is very uninteresting. Not because of its subject?though that is of the kind that novelists can never be in want of while the Police News exists?but because of that subject's treatment. The novelist has the right to take any theme whatever that may suit his fancy ; in this respect his actions arc almost wholly uncontrolled ; but for this nearly boundless liberty he has one tax to pay?his work must be interesting. Let him deal with kings or costermongers, saints or scoundrels, it matters not; bat his theme must be readable or it is valueless?must be interesting from some cause or another, whether as study of character or for beauty of style, subtilty of thought or fancy, or stirring plot, bnt interesting it must be; and interesting from any point of view 4 What He Cost Her' is not. When Arthur Pendennis brought out his first book, and received a?to him?large amount for it, his uncle, the Major, went into a calculation as to the sum Pendennis might make in a year, by turning off a novel once a month. There ought to be no difficulty in turning off such books as this once a month, or even sooner; anyone of average capacity might spin them off as fast as he could hold the pen. But it is annoying to find a really clever writer like Mr. Payn doing this. The author of 4 Lost Sir Massingberd ' and 4 A Beggar on Horseback' should not have written 4 What He Cost Her,' and it is to bc hoped that the next of Mr. Payn's novels will be more like his former work, and that he may take warning, and learn that a writer who made a name by being interesting may lose it by being dull.

The only road to the capital is a mere mulepath; and it ison mule-back that all the merchandise is carried. Mr. Montgomery secured two companions for the journey ?one aa Lnglishman, the other a Spaniard. The journey over the mountains proves rough and wild, bur not without attractions.

The liouso was :i large substantial building, with the usual court in tlie centre, surrounded by a corridor.

It is situated , about eight miles from the sea, and is the principal t part of Central America on the Pacific, being the nearest harbour for ships from Panama and Peru trading with (-tiateniala. The productions of the I ; neighbouring country, destined for Europe, owing to i the difficulty and expense attending iheir conveyance L> I over-land tn the Atlantic coast, are often shipped at r j this port, notwithstanding the long and circuitous '? ' voyage to be performed ; and, for the same reason, it c j is the port through which uro imported many of the '" i foreign manufactures intended for the south-western 0 [ coast of Central America." ' j The party, soon after leaving Sonsonate, arrive , i at au Indian village, where the author is struck, II j as he had been before, by tho fact, that? j ''The arts and usages ol' civilized life seemed to u i he utterly unknown.

At Aguachapa, the author finds himself in the midst of a volcanic region, and being detained hy bad weather, he visits the Moiling Lakes, of which there are several. " The largest is about a hundred yards in circumference. In this, its in all the others, the water, which was extremely turbid, and of a light brown cjloitr, wiis boiling furiously, anil rising in bubbles three or four feet high. The steam ascended in ii dense white cloud, and spread tor a considerable ]?' distance round, as 1 stood for some time on the bank ?? of this natural cauldron, gazing with awe upon its *-, tremendous voil ex.

Un thrusting ii f knife into the ground, the blade, when drawn out. h after a few s-'eoiuls, was so hot tts to burn the lingers." j: lletweeii this point and Guatemala, the tra- t vi'liers fall in with a party of Carrera's brigands, d who sheer oil", however, without- a conflict. The r next day brings them to the wide fertile plains ( which surround that showy city?(twenty-eight * tl;i\s from Izabal). This place has ii population ' of'about 'J.'),0()0.

The Maternity of Harriott Wiokbn. By Mrs. Henry E. Dudeney. This story, by the author of A Man with a Maid, is a study in heredity. Opening with a scene of death and drunkenness, it is gloomy and unpleasant throughout, yet it grips the reader, and he is fascinated by the character of the tortured Harriott Wioken. The notion is laid almost entirely in London, and the author has drawn Brixton society in no flattering way. (Heinemann. 6s.)

Kriegspiel: The WajsGame. By Francis Hindes Groome. (Ward, Lock & Bowden.) " But helpless Pieces of the Game He plays Upon this Chequer-board ot Nights and Days; Hither and thither moves, and mates, and slay b, And one by one back in the Cupboard lays." These words of Omar Khayyam's, which are quoted on tiie title-page, serve much better than the title itself to indicate the cha**acter of Mr. Groome's novel. Who the "pieces of the game " individually are can only be properly ascertained by reading the book. ut it may be said that, in addition to many subordinate figures, there is a young hero ?not specially heroic?and there is an elderly fiend who is far and away the real " hero." This is a certain Dr. Watson, the imaginary grandson?for there is every reason to doubt his historical existence?of a veritable Dr. Hobart Watson, probably unknown to the general reader, wno flourished about eighty or ninety years ago, and whose portrait, "painted at Borne in 1817 by Prof. Vogel von Yogelstein, and now in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh," is reproduced as a frontispiece. This Dr. Watson, the prototype, it seems, of Gashford in Barnaby Rudge, and actually secretary to Lord George Gordon in 1780, is said, in the novel at any rate, to have been a son of Prince Charles Edward by a Uurgeoise of Elgin; and, whatever his origin, his character was that of a subtle Machiavelli, who, if his grandson's word may be accepted, swayed half the Courts in Europe. And since, as the Watson of the novel profanely remarks, he and his grandfather are one, the real picture so ingeniously prefaced may be regarded as an actual portrait of Dr. Robert Watson's hypothetical grandson. As the latter first visibly appears in the pages of Kriegspiel, he is briefly described as " a small man, excessively bald, and dressed in black, his clothes good, but very old-fashioned "; his voice " soft, yet penetrating." But as the story progresses these outlines are gradually filled in, until one has an extremely real and living personality before one's mental vision. From almost the opening pages this dark and sinister figure dominates the book, and after his sudden and final disappearance the reader's interest palpably abates. One can only refer briefly to the many points of interest in the novel. There is a pretty and touching little scene near the beginning, where the hero, Lionel, then a boy of thirteen, first meets the father who until then had refused to see him, believing him, unjustly, as it turns out, to be no son of his. The boy has come into his father's bedroom on the morning following his arrival; and after a short interview, during which the father struggles to maintain an attitude of cold reserve, Lionel prepares to withdraw. "He lingered, though; and Glemham found himself asking, with a kindness, a tenderness even that surprised himself, 'What is it, Lionel?' And for answer the boy flung his arm 8 round his neck and kissed him, and Glemham kissed him back?he was wondering still at that kiss when he found himself alone. "The wonder lasted all the time he was dressing. He had intended to be so cool, to settle nothing rashly, to review his past conduct (it certainly had been hasty), and then, if he found that there was room for doubt, to try to be just, to make this boy what reparation was possible. ' This boy !' why, he had called him ' Lionel,' and had kissed him; nay, at this moment his brain was in a whirl, his blood coursing fiercely for joy, for very joy." The most powerful passage in the book is undoubtedly the description of the discovery of the murdered body of Sir Charles Glemham, in circumstances which reveal the devilish hate and cunning of his unknown murderers. This culminating horror is effectively foreshadowed in the three or four preceding chapters, from the time when Lady Glemham, sitting in the gathering dusk at her oriel window, watches her husband ride away from her down into the dark hollow, and then, straining her eyes, at length sees the mounted figure as it tops the opposite slope, visible for a moment against the streak of after-glow in the western sky. Other notable descriptions there are, from the opening scene in Germany to the mournful farewell among the Gypsy tents on the Welsh border. Throughout, there is considerable change of scene, and the reader is carried from Germany to Suffolk, thence to the south of Scotland, thereafter to Oxford, and once more to Scotland. Lionel's early experiences at Newark Peel, in Teviotdale, are delightful; and the picture of Marjory Avend is a charming one. Indeed, she is such a frank, bright girl, and she develops into such a lovable woman, that one deeply regrets her destiny, and resents the fact of the Gypsy's prophecy coming true. For, of course, there are Gypsies in the book, real flesh-and-blood Gypsies, such as those whom Mr. Groome introduced to us in the pages of In Gypsy Tents. It is an amazing reflection that of all the novelists who have written about Gypsies almost none were acquainted with the inner life and the language of the people they attempted to describe. Not Sir Walter Scott, not Bulwer Lytton, not Whyte Melville. Indeed, excluding the works of Borrow and Leland, and In Gypsy Tents, as not coming precisely within the category of "novels," the only previous work of fiction that represents English Gypsies as they really are is Mr. Arthur Way's "No. 747; being the Autobiography of a Gypsy," which appeared in 1890. But the reality of the Kriegspiel Gypsies, even if one did not know the name of the author, is apparent to anyone who has mixed with those people; and many of their sentences proclaim themselves, by their own peculiar characteristics, to be actual quotations, and not merely the outcome of the author's fancy. To some readers, the Gypsies may present themselves too frequently throughout the story; but that is a matter of taste. It is, however, questionable whether Lionel's abduction is altogether a happy idea. Moreover, it is a mistake to make the hero of a romance too much the victim of circumstances. During Lionel's captivity, one has a feeling of irritation similar to that which the reader of Redgauntlet feels when Darsie Latimer meekly submits to all his uncle's bullying. In each case, one is tempted to ask the captive why he does not act like a man and burst his bonds. To be sure, Lionel's experience was a much harder one than Darsie Latimer's. With a baldheaded Mephistopheles always at hand, ready to hypnotise or to administer narcotics, or to chain him hand and foot, he had certainly little chance of obtaining his freedom. Nevertheless, this incident, while containing nothing impossible, gives rise to questionings. Dr. Watson's complicated manoeuvres are hardly called for, and his reasons for abducting Lionel seem inadequate. At this juncture comes in Dr. Watson's narrative, and it is certainly one of the very best things in the book. It reads like a chapter out of Roderich Random ; and in the dialogues with Dean Beaumont and Mistress Fitzherbert the eighteenth-century tone is admirably reproduced. So good is this interlude altogether, that one is apt to wish that, instead of being embedded in a nineteenth-century tale, it had formed part of a complete novel assumed to be written in the eighteenth century. Nor is this the only portion of Kriegspiel that might have been omitted, and that without injury to the story itself. In the later chapters, especially, there is a tendency to obstruct the free current of the narrative by the introduction of what may be called extraneous matter. Prof. Seton-Hepburn, for example, with "his great scheme for the deodorisation of hetairism," could easily have been dispensed with. It is clever writing, but the story would have run all the easier without it. The book, in short, suffers somewhat from au embarras de richesse, and contains material enough for two good novels. Objections of a more trifling nature might also be raised. In the description of the walk across Minchmoor, for example, there is mention of certain " low pillars of stones, built at intervals to indicate the track in time of snow." Now, these " pillars " are certainly intended solely for the use of sportsmen in a grouse-drive. Again, Dr. Watson is made to say (p. 265) that his grandfather "might, had he chosen, have borne the royal arms with the bar sinister": a repetition of the inaccuracy that so often vexes the souls of heralds. Rend or baton sinister would have come in all right, or, in colloquial phrase, " bastard bar," but not " bar sinister." And, although Mr. Groome is known to possess a minute and accurate knowledge of matters relating to Scotland, he is surely at fault in speaking of " the wersh salty taste of blood" (p. 292). The Scotch adjective " wersh " is almost?perhaps quite ?synonymous with " insipid," and salt is the best and readiest corrective of " wershness " in food. It is easy, however, to find fault. The fact remains that this is a book to be read. One may criticise this part of it or that; but no one who has read it can fail to recognise its freshness and originality, the strength of many of its passages, aud the marked ability of its author.

The Ranger's Lodge; a Romance. By Rosa Mackenzie Kettle. (James Weir and Knight, London.)?Miss Kettle'* work is an idyll of life in the New Forest. We are at a loss to know why she calls it a romance, as all the characters and incidents are drawn entirely from every-day life, and it is the adherence to human nature, with all its perfections and the reverse, which gives to the book its chief charm. It is one of the happiest specimens of Miss Kettle's always interesting writings. The leading character of the book is Maud, whose childish feelings and after development into a charming woman are touchingly brought out. There is intense sympathy throughout the whole work, and its intellectual standard is of no mean order. The plot is well constructed, and worked out in a simple and natural way, without recourse to any extraneous aid. We hope Miss Kettle wTill soon give us another book equally well written, we will not say better, as we consider, of its kind, " The Ranger's Lodge " is hardly likely to be surpassed, and the authoress need only keep to her present thoroughly true style to ensure the success of any future work she undertakes.

We take leave of Mr. Thornley the Surrey emigrant, a respectable, if not yet venerable patriarch; his elder chIildren happily married and settled around him in peawe and plenty ; his wealth vastly increased, and with money in the bank at high interest; a rare circumstance, we presume, for an emigrant.

33a. WmoIWd without Smnos. By J. W. Cunningham, A. AVl. i car oj Harrowon-the-Hill. 12Xo1. pp. 165. Hatebard. TH~S is a religious treatise, in the thin transparency of a novel. From page 63 to page 71 inclusive, is filled up with a Sermon, published as such, bond fide, on the the text " Add to your faith, virtue." We cannot say that such flirnzy disguiscs altogether please our taste. They remind us of a coarse and clumsy deception well known to and put in practice by Essex shepherds. When an' ewe has lost a Iamb by premature death, these men strip the fleece off the carcase, and fasten it on the young of some other ewe, in order to induce the mourner to suckle the substitute. With the silly animal the imposture succeeds: Not so does it fare with man. We detect, we smile; we contemo, we are disgusted. The following is a fair sample of Mr. Cunningiham's dexterity in wield. ing the sharp two-edged sword of re. ligious ridicule. Eroad and ponder. ous as an old Scotch claymore, it ap. pears a truly tremendous weapong and is likely to prove dangerous in the hands of a weak or an unskilful cumbatant.-A contract is conceived to have taken place between a human soul and a human body I " It is stipulated on the part of the body: lst,That although the soul dwell in the body, it shall never interfere with it in any of its ett joyments; for instance, in eating, drinking, and licentiousness; or indolence.-Agreed.

The Reverend Author of this Trea. tise his unhappily brought the whole weight of his machine to play " wifth slowrly-swinging sweep and sway3" up on a great variety of foiblcs, follies, errors, mistakes, modes, fashions,. faults, vices, and crimes: For several of the former, it is too large, too cumbersome, and too heavy; for the latters ltter, it is, in our decided opinion, unsuited and lamentably inefficient. He pursues butterflies, cockchaffers, moths, hornets, and "1 fiery-flying scorpions," alike implacably, with an enormous Cossack's spear. He fatigues himself, and pains every goodhumoured spectator of his gambols, .with the violent aukwardness of his most laborious chace.

Other New Books. The Little Flowers of Saint Benet. By Paul Woodroffe. A presumed likeness to the famous Fioretti of Saint Francis of Assisi has clearly suggested the title of this book. It is a series of legends, largely miraculous, regarding St. Benedict of Nursia, extracted from the Dialogues of Pope Gregory the Great?famous in England as the utterer of the " Non Angli sed Angeli" epigram. Tho translation of the Dialogues which has been used is one of the seventeenth century, and has the delightful aroma which all style had in those days, and which is peculiarly appropriate to devout old childlike stories such as these. If they have not the invincible and fragrant sweetness of the Fioretti, they have yet an undeniable charm of simplicity. The drawings which illustrate them are very good indeed. Quotation is impossible unless ono could quote whole, for everything lies in the plain telling of a quaint tale, and extract would be but an minot able brick iiom the whole. The publication was worth the doing. (Kegan Paul. 5s. net.)

Tom Thornton j or, Last Resources, 3 Vols. Blackwood, Paternoster Row. Tom Thornton was an orphan, and a landed proprietor before he was fourteen years old. By his own account he had a warm heart, an enthusiastic imagination, and a temper impatient of restraint. With unlimited resources and ambitious tastes?being of course much flattered, caressed, and befooled?he became a boy voluptuary. Tom has an uncle and an aunt. Sir Harold, the uncle, is a benevolent country baronet, whose doings throughout these three volumes thew how utterly ignorant the author is of all the relations of rural life in England. Tom, after receiving much sage advice from his respected relatives, starts for Oxford for his first term. There he meets the son of Sir Jephson Jewel. Young Jewel is in his second term at Christ Church when Thornton goes up to Magdalen. Here we have, of course, the . old story of reckless undergraduates and seductive Oxford tradesmen. Sir Harold loved not Mr. Jewel, seeing that the latter was " one who wore satin socks and patent-leather boots of a morning, and never looked you straight in the face." The young gentlemen were, however, of course sworn friends in twenty-four hours. Jewel introduces his greener friend to Mr. Omnium, that indefatigable prince of caterers who appears in every novel, and, if he really walks in the flesh, ought to have been discommonsed many years ago. The tempting bait of three years' credit was gorged j the day of payment was far off; but it did come, and a dismal day it was. From Oxford, Tom proceeds to London, and to the den of Mr. Theophilus Shark the moneylender. This functionary is sketched in a manner indicating some acquaintance with the habits of the bill-discounting fraternitv. Once set agoing in good earnest by Shark on the road to ruin, it was all down hill with Thornton, with no obstacle?no obstruction. Abandoned at length to the tender mercies of Shark? overwhelmed with liabilities?debt on debt, and mortgage on mortgage; after drawing on the finances of Sir Harold and the aunt?after spurning the attachment of Henrietta Hamilton, the wealthy ward of his aunt;?after all this, and more, on the morning of his threatened arrest he fled into strange places, among aliens and outcasts. By degrees, Thornton becomes familiarized with his furnished lodgings at Boulogne. The fine chairs in old chintz?sofa to correspond? little ricketty round table with marble top just big enough to put your hat on?the antique walnut-tree chiffonier?long narrow chimneyglass, too high for mortal man under six feet ?even to see himself in?the couple of white and gold vases stuffed with wax flowers]?and the muslin blinds?might, our author thinks, make the heart to ache of a gentleman who had never seen worse than what the Albany or Brook Street could afford. But even in a Boulogne appdrtement habit wonderfully reconciles us. Thornton was relieved from any pecuniary anxieties in the mean time by the considerate generosity of Henrietta, who pressed a Eacket into his hand when he fled from the old all upon being watched and pursued by bailiffs; and men of his furn of mina and training, so long as there is no material deficiency of present supplies, do not take the trials and troubles of life so much to heart as others of a more serious and sanguine mood. The world judges by appearances : so (says Thornton) " I was resolved to put the best face on it?snapped my fingers . at care?and sought those means within reach best calculated to induce oblivion of the past, and give zest to the enjoyment of the present." At Boulogne our hero finds congenial spirits; but refugees, whether pecuniary or political, are an uncertain set, and soon get tiresome. Boulogne became irksome, although no one there cut a better figure, gave snugger little dinners, and was consequently in higher repute than " honest Tom Thornton." He abdicated, however, in favour of other aspirants, threw down his sceptre, and set out full of fresh hopes and enthusiasm for Paris. Passing over the preliminary burst of high-flown and exaggerated admiration on his introduction into thc society of that city, and some odds and ends respecting diet, climate, and so forth, we como to the most important point of the hero's career ?that great event which broke his uncle's heart, estranged the friendship of aunt Lucy, and alienated the affection of Henrietta. Tom committed matrimony. THE FIRST MEETING. I was wandering one day towards evening in the Pere la Chaise, in that half-musing half-melancholy tone of mind which a French cemetery always inspires in me, increased, as it happened, by a long serious letter I had received that morning from Henrietta, recalling past days and hopes and joys for ever blasted, and which had thrown a gloom over my thoughts which I could not dispel, and was leaning despondingly on the railings which enclosed a beautiful monument to the memory of a countrywoman, once the idol of every heart and every tongue, and thinking of the vanity and mutability of all worldly things, when I distinctly heard a deep groan uttered ju from the anguish of a wounded heart near me. Starting, for the moment awe-stricken [from the'spot where I stood, and turning hastily into the next alley, I saw an old man, evidently, by his appearance, of superior rank, and a young woman, his child, as I supposed, kneeling side by side before a tomb, absorbed in deep and earnest prayer. His hair was snow-white, and fell waving over his shoulders, as with his bare head thrown back, and his eyes fixed on heaven, he held his hands clasped together before his breast, in the intensity of deep de- votion. His features were eminently handsome; but there was an expression of settled sorrow in them which threw a eloud over their beauty, and touched me with emotion as I gazed on them. His companion was abo engaged in prayer, but, from the anxious glances she continually cast towards the old man, it was evident how much he occupied her thoughts, and that she was solicitous, in some way, on his account. Fearing to appear an intruder on their privacy, after heaving a parting sigh, as the thought crossed me that I had probably looked for the last time on the realization of all my fondest dreams, I was about to retrace my steps, when another groan, still deeper and more spirit-broken, arrested me: the next moment the old man had sunk senseless on the earth. A slight shriek from his companion brought me in an instant to her side. 44 Help, help, in God's name'." she cried, in an agony of terror. "My dear uncle! my poor uncle! he has fainted. Oh, do not leave me!" 44 Fear not," said I; " he will be better soon: see, he is recovering." 44 Thank God!" ejaculated she. taking his hand between hers, and bending anxiously over him, aa he lay supported in my anns. " Yes, he breathes, he breathes? God be praised! These visits are too great a trial." 44 The remains of a beloved one repose beneath that tomb," said I; '4 a dearly-beloved relative?perhaps a lamented friend?" 44 Yea, a beloved wife, the mother of his only child, the companion, the comfort of his old age." As she spoke, he unclosed his eyes, and, seeing himself in the arms of a stranger, made an effort to raise himself. 44 Nay, be not afraid, dear uncle," said his niece affectionately, and kissing his cold cheek; " but for the kind assistance of this gentleman, you would not have been now smiling on me. He will assist us to the carriage when you are able to walk; nay, you must rest a moment longer. Ah, now you are quite well again! Let us come then. Monsieur will have the kindness to let you lean on his arm." 44 Sir, we cannot sufficiently thank yon for your kindnew," said the uncle, as we walked to his carriage. 44 Blanche, my love, I trust you have expressed your acknowledgments to Monsieur, aud that he will accept our best thanks." 441 was indeed amply rewarded," replied I, venturing a glance at the beautiful face which now smiled on me with a language more convincing than a thousand words. 44 May i know," inquired the uncle, " to whom we are so much indebted ? Ah!" said he, taking my card, " I have heard this name before: you are a friend, I think, of my old friend and fellow-comrade, General Poignac: good! I am delighted to have the opportunity to make your acquaintance. Mr. Thornton, and trust, sir, we may often meet." We had now reached the entrance to the cemetery. Grasping my hand warmly, as he got into his carriage? 44 Farewell!' said the colonel; <4 we shall see each other soon again, I trust." 441 hope so," responded Blanche. Our eyes mei. The consequence of their "eyes meeting" was, of course, that neither of them slept that night; and all that followed was likewise a matter of course. Thornton forgot Henrietta, and even her ample means, on which, by the way, he was living. With his usual precipitancy, he " deolared" himself to Blanche at a ball at the Countess of Mansfeldt's?(n.'a Lola Montes); but, while the declaration seems to have been highly agreeable to the young lady, Thornton did not carry off his prise easily. It appears that the old colonel never suspected any attachment of the sort; and his son, Eugene Dupree (the cousin of Blanche), marked her, with her mother's small jointure of 5000 francs, for his own. These obstacles, however, were set at nought in the customary fashion. Tom Thornton fled with Blanche to Vienna; they were there privately married; and (as he said), " in the delirious enjoyment of present happiness, he had not a thought for the past nor the future." A clue, however, had been found to their flight and retreat: they were followed by Eugene, who, not knowing or admitting their private marriage, accosted Thornton on the Prater?" Villain, you shall dearly pay for the dishonour you have dared to bring upon my family. I have found you at last: you shall not escape me twice." In the conflict that im. mediately and hastily ensued, Eugene fell; and Thornton and his Blanche were again eonstrained to fly. Whither could they go ? The bounty of his aunt, by this time, had so far discharged Thornton's debts as to permit his return to England; and France being shut against him on account of abduction and suspected murder, to England, by a circuitous route, he determined to go. But his exploits and extravagance in France and Austria travelled fast enough to reach the old hall at home; and his aunt, observing his approach from her window with his supposed mistress? his French lady, and furious with rage, ordered the servants to refuse him admittance. Not even Henrietta made her appearance; and next day Tom Thornton quitted England for ever. After visiting in turn all the most reputed resorts of domiciliation for English exiles la Belgium and Germany?after being forgiven by Eugene, who lived long enough to do him some measure of justice?Thornton at last returned to Boulogne. For some time he and his wife continued to live on the original contents of Henrietta's package (it must have been enormous) and Blanche's little all! These, at last, became exhausted, and poverty stared them in the face. What was to be done now? Remorse dictated to Mr. Thornton a penitential letter to his good aunt; which, after some delay, brought him an answer, frigid though it might be, as good as he deserved?to wit, giving him a quarterly credit at Adams's bank for a thousand francs for one year, to give him time to repent; and if he continued longer than that to be a disgrace to his family, she. abandoned him to his fate. Well: did he repent? Not till it was too late. In his renewed society at Boulogne he unfortunately (and innocently) became mixed up in certain irregular debts and gambling transactions with a couple of sharpers yclept O'Hara and Plumley. The sequel need not in be detailed. In due course, Thornton was tv lodged in the prison of Boulogne, and a great ?! proportion of these volumes consists of a journal w kept by him during his imprisonment. p For months, struck down and overwhelmed, ?* he lingered in confinement; and when at length, ?' by the interposition of his relatives in England, S( he was released, it was as a shattered man, p broken, not only in health but in spirit. It is b but j ustice at th e same ti me to observe, that, i n all s: his distresses, he found a good wife in Blanche. This unfortunate pair at last found shelter in an ii obscure lodging in the Rue d'Ambois; and here * poor Blanche died in child-birth. This was d the last and most afflicting blow to Thornton, * With a sad and broken heart, low and sinking, g his only ray of consolation and hope was in J alternately lingering near the grave of Blanche, \ or sitting by the cot of his child, gazing on ? its face, and anticipating the day when aunt j Lucy might be induced to extend her love and t protection to it. Tom, however, was not to see ' that event. His fast declining and dying days j were, however, soothed by the friendship of a ( college companion, John Hartley, who became 1 his chief mourner and executor. ' The infant Blanche, consigned to Hartley's ] care, was presented by him, on his immediate , return to England, to aunt Lucy j and whether 1 it was the irresistible force of his appeal, or the i beauty and helplessness of the orphan child, or the necessity of the author to get the child off his own hands, certain it is that aunt Lucy's heart was taken by storm; and as she clasped "poor Tom's babe" to her breast, and, with Henrietta, wept over it, it was not difficult to see and understand who would henceforth reign supreme in their affections. Finally, young Blanche Thornton is at this moment supposed to be the affianced partner of young Frank Hartley; and the family estates being represented as ample, and adjoining one another in Devonshire, it is to be hoped that they will be very comfortable, and that their tenants will pay their rents, and not ask for reductions of ten, fifteen, or twenty per cent, Probably the reader, if he or she be a steady novel reader, has read this plot at least a hundred times. What merit there is in the book consists In the sketches it contains of" fast life." We will give an extract which may enable the reader to judge for himself whether he will cultivate any more extended acquaintance with Tom Thornton. THE rORTOVATB PEISOKBR. 441 will tell you a story, and a true ono it is, of a poor prisoner, and a very poor and wretched one he was, whose cage was neither gilded nor his plumage gay; yet, though he never sung nor was ever sulky, did he contrive to interest one eye and heart in his behalf, and at last to break through the iron bars of his captivity. It was the custom, you know, in certain of the metropolitan prisons, for the most destitute of the debtors to solicit alms in a hole in the wall from passers by: it was Ambrose's turn to hold the box. Many a weary hour had ho filled that unhappy post, and, but with one exception, had never known a glance of sympathy or pity to be bestowed on him. But he could not be mistaken that there was one who, in addition to dropping her gifts of charity into the box, never failed to regard him with marked interest and commiseration. It was a solace to him to receive the congratulations of his companions for the good fortune he always brought them, but a far greater to reflect upon the invariable look of sympathy and concern which accompanied the gifts of his unknown friend. 44 One day it was Ambrose's turn again to take his station in the wall, when the same angelic form that had so often seemed to be hovering, the harbinger of good, near that dismal spot, approached nearer, and lingered longer than she had ever done before, and, having deposited her gift, as usual, in the box, dropped a scrap of paper within tho grating, and disappeared. With a throbbing heart did Ambrose, as you may suppose, pick up the paper, and hope once more wau awakened in his breast, as he read, almost doubting the evidence of his senses, these words? 4 Despair not?there is one has tbe will as well as the power to befriend you!' The more poor Ambrose thought the more he was puzzled to conceive who his unknown friend could be, or what merit of his could have interested one so young, and, no doubt, lovely, in his favour. Long since had his friends, one by one. deserted him, and his conscience told him he had tried their patience to the utmost. Could he be deceived??was it meant only as a cruel hoax, or to deride his misery ? Oh, no, it was impossible ! an ungenerous, an unkind thought could not be harboured in a form so lovely, with looks' so tender and compassionate, with acts so noble, so disinterested. Ambrose was not mistaken. Who shall account for woman's sympathies ? The fair hand that had dropped so often its gifts into the debtors' box, had already signed and delivered the necessary deed, in the shape of a banker's draft payable at sight, for the amount of his debts. In less than three davsne was a free, a happy, and a grateful man. Of gentle lineage and with bright prospects, Ambrose ought to have done well in the world: no man could set out in life under better auspices; but extravaSnce and dissipation soon plunged him into difficulties; e consequences soon followed?loans at ruinous interest, accommodation bills, mortgages, annuities, post obits, &c, till, his patrimony squandered, bis friends wearied and disgusted, down be went from bad to worse, till, all else failing, be was fain to take his turn, and solicit alms like a beggar from the passing crowd. 44 Still, in spite of all, his errors were rather of the head than heart, and there were some who knew bis history, among whom was the lovely stranger, who had taken so deep an interest in his behalf?who believed that he was not without his redeeming points, and that, if restored to society, he might become an ornament to it, and a credit to his name and family. Nature had dealt bountifully with him, but sorrow and privation had sadly defaced tho beauty of her work; but enough, it seemed, remained to rivet the attention and renew the admiration of Kate Mitford, as she one day passed the prison accidentally. ? Since that moment, the image of him, for whom in hapI pier days past her heart, unknown to any but herself, had acknowledged many a tender throb of interest, never 1 left her thoughts; and whether the world, so sapient on all points, chooses to call it love, or caprice, or folly, or infatuation, certain it is that the effect of her repeated visits to the same spot was only to confirm her first impression, r that Ambrose was so handsome, so unfortunate, and e doubtless so deserving of compassion. These feelings, li coupled with the consciousness of ample means at cornit maud, grew, of course, stronger the mers they were hill dulged m, and a look of unmistakable admiration and r, gratitude from Ambrose, on her last visit to the prison, which, in spite of the disguise she had endeavoured to preserve, had recognised, she thought, his old friend and favourite, determined her not only to dream of his freedom and restoration to tho world, but to set about the necessary means to realize such a delightful state of things with ail possible despatch. What her other hopes might have been of a more selfish nature must be left to conjecture; suffice it to say, that Ambrose, restored to liberty and happiness, breathed only the language of adoration and gratitude; and often has Kate been heard to declare, with what truth we can't determine, that even had he been indifferent to her passion for him, and made another his bride, she never should have grudged her contributions to the debtors' box; and Ambrose has blessed his stars a thousand times that exchanged him from an iron into his present golden cage, wherein he hopes, he says, to remain till death a captive."

IN SILK ATTIRM.. THE three first chapters of this story, which form a sort of prologue, introduce us to Annie Napier, a distinguished actress, who, while in the height of her fame, is wooed and won and married by Harry Ormond, Marquis of Knottingley, who carries his wife to Switzerland, dreading to introduce her to his family lest they should decline to recognise her, or otherwise make her life miserable. After living with his wife several years on the shore of a Swiss lake, during which time a child is born to them, Harry Ormond takes a longing to revisit England, which he does, leaving behind him both wife and child, whom he never again sees. Arriving in England, he thinks it better, or is induced by the influence of relatives to think it better, not to return to his wife any more, but to live apart from her, the grounds of his conduct being the alleged impossibility of introducing to a family so exclusive as his own one who had been an actress, though she is now his wife and therefore the lawful Marchioness of Knottingley. Declining a separate maintenance which he offers her, the marchioness retires to New York, where, under the name of Brunel, she once more goes upon the stage, to which she also trains her daughter, Annie Brunel, whose histrionic genius excels that of her mother. At the death of the marquis, ten years after, his will discloses the fact that he had made what reparation was then possible by ! acknowledging the claims of his wife as sole heiress to his whole property. Of this, however, she refuses to avail herself, choosing rather to live by her profession; and she arranges with the English lawyers that even her daughter, who knows nothing of her real rank, shall only apply to them in a certain eventuality, when she may learn her position and claims. Thus far the prologue. The story then follows the fortunes of Annie Brunel, the young American actress, who has captivated the heart of London by the brilliancy of her genius. We get the first glimpse of her at a little supper after the play-the party consisting of Mr. Melton, the manager; Miss Brunel, with several other members of the company; a number of critics; aparvenu count, the Graf von Slchonstein; Will Anerley, a friend of the count; and others, who figure in the tale. This is among the first glimpses we get of Annie Brunel:"Slight in figure, and somewhat pale and dark, there was nevertheless a certain calm dignity about her features, and a stateliness in her gestures, which gave an almost massive grandeur to her appearanoe. Then her magnificent black hair lay around her clear calm fiae, which was rendered the more iutensly spiritual by large eyes of a deep tender grey. They were eyes, under those long eyelashes, capable of a great sadness, and yet they were not sad. There seemed to play around the beautiful, intellectual face a bright, superficial, unoonsciou activity; and she herself appeared to take a quite infantine interest in the cheerful trivialities around her. For the rest, she was dressed in a gleaming white vtoird, with tight sleeves that came down to her tiny wrists, and there ended in a faint line of blue; and through the great braided masses of her black hair there was wound a thick cord of twisted silver, which also had a thread of blue cunningly interwoven with it. The artistic possibilities of her fine face and complexion were made the most of; for she wams an arIst, one of the few true artist who have been seen upon our modern stage..... . For once unanimity prevailed among all the critics who were worth attention, and they said that the new actress was a woman of genius. Who could doubt it that had witnessed the utter melt-abandonment of her impersonations P On the stage she was no longer mistress of herself. Her eyes deepened until they were almost black; her face was stirred with the white light of pEasion; and her words were instinct with the tenderness which thrills a theatre to its ore. When the sudden intensity died down, when she resumed her ordinary speech and dres, she seemed to have come out of a trance. Not a trace remained of that Ore and those intonations, which were the result of uncomsious cration;$ her eyes resumed their serene, happy indifference, her face its pleased, child-like expression. Swif, bive, dexterous she was, full of all sorts of genial, marry activities; that kindling of the eye and tremour of the voios belonged to the dream-life she led elsewhere." This is Annie Brunel, the actress, and, unknown to herself, Marchionese of Knottingley, holding in herself many poesibilitits of romance, some of which soon force themselves into fact. For it is hardly possible that the secret of such a grand prize could remain closed for ever. The story of her parentage is known to Count von Schonstein, who has it from his brother, a member of the firm which is the depository of the Knottingley-Brunel romance; and that is the reason why the count is present at the supper after the play. Having met Mis Brunel before in Ia SIn Atty. A NoveL. B Wilim Bla&, Author of "I Love or Mariage?" Thm vols Losdom : Tiniey i: America, he renews his acquaintance with her in England, and, with the knowledge of her parentage, resolves to marry her if he can, expecting by that means to get into aristocratic circles, which he finds to be impossible with hit purchased patent of nobility. One can feel, of course, that the count cannot be the man, and, as the result proves, in spite of the bold though not altogether honourable push he makes, he fails. But the count does not fail wholly through personal unfitness, but because a better man is bound to succeed, and that man, as the prophetic instinct perceives, can be nobody but Will Anerley. Yet one is puzzled at this; for several apparent impossibilities bar the way of such a consummation. In the first place, there seems no necessity for it. Then, although, as Annie Brunel and Will become acquainted, they grow to like each other, liking is not exactly loving. Besides, she has been taught by her mother neither to marry nor expect to find happiness outside her profession; while he is practically engaged to marry a young lady, a distant relation of his own, Dove Anerley, who has been brought up in his own family down at St. Mary-Kirby, in pleasant Kent. In spite, however, of these apparently insurmountable reasons to the contrary, tho one thing that grows and looms clearer and larger through the obscurity is the fact that, somehow, the destinies of Will Anerley and Annie Brunel are steadily converging towards each other, and will finally become one. In the mean time there remains the difficulty of Dove Anerley, whose portrait is thus suggested "It was one of those rare faoes which tantalize you in the eryact of admiring them. There was nothing in it of that mature, vigorous, definite beauty of form and complexion whioh a man may calmly observe and criticise in the faoe of a woman; but a tender uncertainty, a half-suggested and shrinking loveliness whioh made one vaguely conscious that this frail and beautiful smile of nature might suddenly vanish from the fine features. It was not that the girl sAmed unwell, or in any degree fragile; but simply that one, in looking at her face, could not help regretting that her loveliness was not les delicate and more pronounced, that there was not more life and less sensitiveness in her large violet eyes." This is the lady who has been the companion of Will Anerley's youth, whom he loves, and to whom he has been spiritually, if not formally, affianced long before he encounters Annie Brunel. But that encounter is the beginning of a subtle change. In physical and mental structure, Will, who is the son of a country gentleman, is a thorough Englishman, and is above treachery and deception. He does not deceive and desert Dove Anerley-be does not even cease to love her; but his love for her is slowly and unconsciously overshadowed by a passion more intense and profound, inspired by the young actress, who is capable of reaching depths in the human heart unknown to the gentle-minded Dove. It all seems natural and inevitable-and as inevitable, too, that Annie Brunel should fall in love with Will Anerley. The two are thrown much together during a trip to Count Schdnstein's residence in the Black Forest in Germany; and on Will's return to England Dove notices the change in manner, and her prophetic heart attributes it to the right cause. Yet, as if foreboding what the end is to be, she hardly resents the change in her lover. A change also comes over Annie Brunel. Remembering the teaching of her mother, she conceals her passion for Will, feeling that she ought not to think of loving any one outside the circle of her profession; and even when their mutual affection is confesed, they agree and endeavour to suppress it for the sake of Dove Anerley, whom WiM is bound in honour to marry. The impossible game of suppression goes on for some time, when a deep feeling of repugnance to her profession comes over the actress. The power of genius seems to die within her. In the light of her strong passion, the idea of a higher life dawns upon her; she sees and feels that the stage is no longer the place for her, and leaves it, almost penniless, if not friendless. At this time, too, the Anerleys me ruined by the collapsing of the bank in which their fortune is lodged-an event which Will and his philosophic father take almost with a jest. Worse than this, to them, is the fact that Dove, having somehow been smitten with cold, is now dying of consumption. Suddenly, in the midst of their well-borne distress, fortune shines upon them from an unknown place. This is the cause of it:-Miss Brunel, having at length been reduced to her last shilling, and remembeing the injunction of her mother that in some such event she is to apply to a cdtain lawyer, does so, and there and then discovers that she is the daughterand ole heiressoftheMarquisotKnottingley. Although for a time quite stunned by the revelation, Annie Brumnel soon masters the situation, and she is the source of the sunshine which is secretly poured upon the Anerleys. But Dove is dying-end from death there is no escape, and she knows it. But she sewe eager to get mrried to Will before. she d joA to have the honour and feel the rapture of being his wife. For this purpose she gets Will to buy a wedding ring, and to write a sort of betrothal contract in these words:--" We two, loving each other very dearly, write our names underneath in token that we have become husband and wife, and as a pledge of our constant love." This, however, remains qnsigned, and, meanwhile, Dove, getting gradually worse, desires to see Annie Brunel, whom Will finds in her poor lodging, attired in a simple black dress, for her great secret is still undivulged:" I was going to me Dove,' she said, 'when I heard she had sent for me. But-is there an) thing the matter ? ' " ' Dove is ill,' he said abruptly. ' I-I cannot tell you. But she wants you to come and-play a piece of musio for her.' " Neither of them spoke a word all the way to the house. When Annie Brunel, puee, and oalm, and beautiful, went to the girl, and took up her white hand, and kissed her, there was a pleased expression on Dav'sn fae. " ' Why didn't they tell me you were ill ? she said. " I should have been here before.' ' I know that,' said Dove in a whisper,' for-for you have always been kind to me. But you have come in time-but I am too weak to t4H you-ask Will-the betrothal.' " The brief explanation was speedily given; and then Dove said," ' I am very tired. Will you go into the next room and play me the "Goulin; " and when you come back- ' ' She went to Dove's piano, and found there the air which she knew mo well. And as she played it so softly that it sounded like some bibisr, sd leave-taking that the sea had heard and murmured over, Dove lay and listened with a strange look on herface. Will's hand was in hers, and she drew him down to her, and whispered,"'I could have been so happy with you, Will; so very happy, I think. But I had no right to be. Where is the-the paper I was to "e bOuWM t it aMd put it on the table beside her bed; and Miss DA}1 Om"e hto the room, and went over to Dove. " ' T is the paper I must sign, said the girl. ' Bat how can I P Will YOU-Will you do it for me ? But come closer to me and listen, fr I boles oswo I' " When Annie Brunel bent down her head to listen, Dove drew the Wedding uing off her fiOgr, kiwed it tenderly, and put it on her companion's hand; and then she said, looking Annie in the fare with a faint smile in the peaceful violet eyes, ' It is your own name you must sign. "At the Same mosent she lay back exhausted, and to Mr. Anerley, who bad hurriedly stepped forward to take her hand, she sighed Wearily, ' I am so tired I shall rest.' And presently a beautiful, happy light stole over the girlish features; and he heard her murmur indistnotly-si if th words were addressed to him from the other world -9he old bmhfla'r line, ' Neghily, meghily shall, I sleep now.' " The were Ah lat words that Dove uttered; and they were the Om" Of the last smile that wa on her sweet owe." Such, as near as we can give it, is an epitome of the story of " In Silk Attire." By way of criticism, we shall only say that Mr. Black seems a little too fond of airing his German, and that the result is not alwvays intelligible. " Getchen mir, deuke ran " fvol. ii., p. 64), is either an anagram or a conundrum. If a conundrum, we give it up; if an anagram, transposition might render it "Denke an mir, Gretchen "whiih, however, would be ungrammatical, unless the Black Foresters adopt the vulgarisms of the Berliners.

The deirof celebrity was in him so strong as even to become the ruling pabsion. lie listened to flattery w,,ith v isibl1lc'sure, and in the company of his intimate friends was accustomed to express himself, with regard to ljiS own merits, in a manntr whici bordJred ou wvtakncss.

T1hc pleasure with whiclh Dr Blair contemplated his litetary succes was at the same time accompanied with a singular degree ut modesty. Thouglh extremely capable of givirig advice, he niever ubtrudIedl, nor was lhe very forward to give it even) when asked. He took a very strong and decided part in the busihiess of the church, yet hle never spoke in its courts, but colitented himself witlh giving his p-ivate .advice and support to the pc rty of whose measurcs he approved. Iii an(I ogy for tlis silence lhe alledged lhis i'l-orance vf forms, yet as this could easily lhave bLen remedied, and didl not at all ap)pear in his private coniversations, the catuse, it is plobab bic, may be traccd to the natural ti. ilidity of his character, and his unwillingncs3 to mingle iii the active scenes of life. He is sai(d indeed to have bcen a bettcr judge of measures thi.n of suen ; his n;itural bencvo. leace often led him to think too fa. voOurably of the latter, and to trust too much1 to outward appearances. but t!ougih thus apt to err in judg. in of iUdiidiclal character, lie had, as appears by his wvritings, studicd t!ceply huuniaa nature ill general. 1Il Couscquliice of at his profcssion and liabits, his intcrcoule With the world was net very exttusive ; but his fa. Vourit;c studiws were of that natu'rc wh1isch tenided tulost to improve him in this branch of knowledge.

I rNairr tiv o .J ourney in the Interior of I (hll7*, &,c. 1B Clarke Abel. Loudol 1818. 4k,. pp).4t20. HIavin-( in our last conl(lelnsed the occurrences and observations of the journey throglh China, in this publication, we shall at once transport our readers to Manilla on their return liomeiwar(d. Here the 'Mulatto ladies are much addicted to smoking immense cigars, seven or eight in(hes long and an inch and a half in diameter. These rolls, though they fill their mouths, are seldoom out of theiji; and( w heln they are fully lighted, and pouring forth volitmes of smoke, their fair, or rather dark, smnokers reseimble -walking chimneys. The marmfacture of eigurs affords employment to a great number of native women, and exhibits to the stranger an interesting example of local customs. It is carried on in a spacious gallery of a square form. Upwavrds of two thousand females of all ages are seated at low tables, at which they make cigars by rolling the leaves of the tobacco plant oft each other. 'the most scrupulous precaution is taken to prevent their smuggling it in any form. Superintendanrts walk round the table and collect the cigars as they are made, and examine the persofs of the workers at the close of their laboars. Thirty women, for the mnost part elderly, and thought particularly trust-worthy, seat themselves, excepting one, roinmd a circular landing-place, without the entranee to the gallery. One only stands at the door of the gallery with a rattan in her hand, ind allows thirty girls to enter, counting them off as they c; e in. When the thirty have lassed, they go up to their respective examiners, and having frcee their bog black hair, hold it in their hands at armys length; and then shake their handlker-' chiefs, and loosen the other parts of their dress, and stiffer the examiners to pAss theirlhands over their bodies, to ascertain if any tobacco be concealed close to their persons. In this manner successive prties are searched, till all the girls have undergose the examninatioul. The examiners then rise, and in the same vay examine eh other. The government monopolizes the sale 6f tobacco. The execution of criminals in this part of the world is peculiar and frightful:A frame-work, furnished with a number of iron collars, at the height of the neck of a man of ordinary stature, when sitting, is placed in the most public square ill thes subijrbs, having in its front a number of stools of variable elevation, like the music stools of this country, to raise or depress the culprit. When the unfortunate wretch is brought to the requisite height, the collar, always much too small, is pitt round his neck, and byascrew behind is tightened with su(lden violence. The execution usually takes place in the morning soon after sun-rise, but the bodies are not removed till sun-set. As we have still a long and entertaining extract to make from this volume, we shall nowv finish our remarks with stating, that in its instructive Appendix it Contains many papers of considerable interest, meteorological tables, Chinese edicts, and descriptions of a new genus and two new species of plants. The plates are ably executed by Mr. Fielding from Well-chosen subjects, and one of the most prmninent of them a Portrait of the very rare ORANG-OUTANG, or Wl'ildman, from Borneo, brought to this country by Mr. Abel, and of whose habits and exploits the following is that gentleinan's account:Froin his heel to the crosin of his head, he is two feet seven inches. The hair of the Orang-Otitaerg is of a brownish red colour, and covers his bacc, arms, legs, and outside 6f his hands and feet. On the back it is in some places six inches long, and on his arms five. It is thinly scattered over the back of his hands and feet, and is very short. It is directed dowvnwvards on the back, nepper arn and legs, and upwards on the fore-armn. It is directed from behind forwards on the head,. and inwards on the inside of the thighs. The face has no hair exce~pt on its sides, somewhat in the manner of whiskers, and a very thin beard. The middle of the breast and WeHIv wms naked oh his arrival in England, but hs since beedir% hafirv. The shoulders, elhows, and kaees, haive fewer hairs than other parts of the irnhs And legs. The palms of the hands antd feet are quite naked. Thre prevailing colotr of the animal's skin, wheft naked or seen through the heir, is a bluish gray. TMe eyelids and margin of the mouth are of a light co Pier cotour. The inside of his hands and feet are of A deep copper co1tir. Two copper-eoloured stripes pass fromn tlre armpits down each side of the bely as lowr AS the navel. Thte hlead viewed in front, is pear-shaftd, expolnding froih the chin upwards, the craniuxm being mnoh the larger end. The eyes are close together, of an oval form, and dark brown colour. The eyelids are fringed with lashes, and the lovwet ones are saccular and swrinkled. The nose is confluent with the face, except at the nostrils, which are but little elevated: their openings are narrow and ob)lique. The mouth is very projecting, and of a roundish mammillary formn. Its opening is large, but when closed is marked by littlC more than a narrow seam. The lips are very narrow, and scarce erceptible when the mhouth is shut. TAC chin projeets less thun the mouth: below it, a pendulous mcembrane gives the appearance of a double chin, and swells out when the animal is angry or much pleased. EA6h of the jaws contains twelve teeth, namely, four incisive teeth, the two middle ones of the upper javv being twice the width of the lateral; t'o caime, and six double teeth. The cars are smalli closely resemble the human ear, and have their loWer niArgini in the same line Wvith the extetnal angles of the eyes. The chest is widle compared with the pelvis: the belly is very protuberant. The arms are long inl proportion to the height of the animal, their span measuring full four feet seven inches and a half. The legs are short compared with the armsn. The hands are long compared with their wvidth, and with the human hand. The fingers are small and tapering: the thumb is very short, scarcely reaching the first joint of the fore-finger. AU the fingers have very perfect nails, of a blackish colour and oval nobl hdc~y crnmintil g wltbi tyie c trcinitibs of the fingers. The feet ate 16mr. resefnble hands in the paltns, afid in Havf fingers rather than toes, hut hhvE keels resoinbling the lhinan. The grcSt roes # very short, arc set onl a-t riHt dnfleS to Ii? feet close to the heel, aad arc etitirely wittiout nails The Orang-Outang of orttieo 1i uttc'r incapable of v~alking in a pertcty etecat posture. Ile betrays this i his whole dtierior conformation, and never fiaky at. tempts to counteract its tendelicy. The Orang-Oixtang, on his arrivd in Java from Batavia, was allowed to be entire ly it liberty till within a day or two of being put on board the Caesar to he conveyed toEngland; and, whilst at large, made no at. tempt to escape; but became violent when put into a large railcd bamboo cage for the purpose of being coi.veyed from the island. On board ship an attempt being made to secure him by a cheini tied to a strqlg stple, lie instantly unfastened it, and ran off with the chain dragging behind; but And. ing himself embarrassed by its length, he coiled it once or twice, and threw it over his shoulder. This feat lie often repeated. and wvhen lie found thatt it would not remain on his shoulder, lie took it into hij mouth. After several abortive attempts to secure uim more effectually, he was allowed to wvander freely about the ship, and soon became familiar with the sailors, and surpassed them in agility. They often chasedc hint about the !igging', and gave him frequent opportunitics of displayig his adroitness in managing an escape. IOn first startinj, he would endeavour to outstrip his pursuers by mere speed, but when much presed elude them by SeiZing a loose rope, asd swvinging out of their reach. At other timei he lvould patiently wait on the shrouds or at the mast-head till his pursuers almost touched him, and then suddenly lower himself to the deck by any rope thlat wms near him, or bound along the main-stay frotm one mast to the otier, Svinging by his hands, and moving them one over the other. The men would often shake the ropes by which he clungW vith so much violence as make me fear is li in, but I goon found that tihe power of Wa muscles could 4ot be easily overcome. When in a piyfVl hu. mour, he wvould often swing WLthin arm's length of his pursuer, and having stital him with his hand, throw himseli4 rrom hin. Whilst in Java, he lodiged in a hrge ta. marind-tree near my dwvelling; and (orme' a bed by intertwining the small brancheq and covering them with leaves. turing the day, he would lie with his h!ad projecting beyond his nest, watching whoever might pass under, and wvhen he saw any one 'vitli fruit, would descend to obtain a. share of it. lie always retired for the night at sun-set, or sooner if he had been weil fed; and rose with the sun, and visited those from wihom he habitually received food. On board ship he commonly slept at the mast-head, after wrapping himself in a sail. In making his bed, hle Usel the greatest pains to remove every thing out of his wav that might render tile surface onl which hle intended to lie uneven; and having satisfied himself with this part of his arrangement, spreadl out the sail, an1(d1 lying dotwn upon it on his back, drewv it over his bodv. Sometimes I preoccupied his bed, and tcased him by refusing to give it up. On these occasions he would endeavour to pull the sail from under me or to forte me from it, and would not rest till I had resigned it. If it was large enough for both, be WoUld quietly lie by my side. If all the sails halppened to be set, he vould hunt about tor some other covering, and either steal one of the sailor's jackets or shirts that happened to be dlrying, or empty a hammock of its blankets. Offthe C,'ape of (;ood Hope he suffered muclh from a lowtemperature, especially early in the morinlg, when he would descend from the mIast, shudderinr with cold, an(l running up) to any one of his friends, climb into their arms, an(d clasping themii closely, derive warmth from their persons, screaming violently at aniv attempt to remove hiin. His food in Java was chiefly fruit, especially mnangobtans, of which lie Was excessively fond. He also sucked egs Mwith voracity, and often employed himself in seeking them. On board ship llhis diet was of no deUinite kind. lie ate readily of 1l1 kinds of mneat, aiiit esp)ecially raw ileat ; vas very fond of breaI, but alwvays preferred fruits when he could obtainm them. I His beverage in.lava was wa.lter: on board ship, it vas as diversified as his food. lie preferred eoflfee and tea, but would reattily take wine, and exemnplified his attachimenft to spirits by stealing the Captain's brandybottle: since his arrival in London, lie has preferred beer and milk to unv thining else, but drinks %vine and other himi;ors. In his attemitts to obtlin food, lie afforded us many opportuInxities of judging of his sagacity anld disposition lie wals always very impatient to seize it when held out to him, and became palssiomlate wheni it was not soon given tlp); and would chase a person all over the ship to obtain it. I seldomn came on dleck *without sweetineats or fruit in my pocket, and could never escape his vigilant eve. Sometimes I endeavoured to evade him by ascending to the mant-head, but was always overtaken or intercepted in my progress. When lie came up with ine on the shirouds, he would secure himself Ihv one foot to the rattling, and comftinie y Nleg's with the other, and on^ of his hands, wvhiist he rifled my pock Iets. If he found it impossible to overtake me, lie would climb to a considerable height on the loose riginZg, and then drop suddenly utipon ne. Oir if, perceiving his intention, I attempted to detcend, he would Slide down a rope and meet me at the bottom of the shrouds. Sometimes I fastened an orange to the end of a rope, and lowered it to the deck from the mnast-head ; and as soon as he attempted to seize it, drew it rapidly up. After being several times foiled in eudea- vouring to obtain it by direct means, he altere his plan. Appearing to care little about it, he would reinove to some distance, and ascend the rigging very leisurely for some time, and then bv a suddlen spring catch the rope which held it. If defeated again by my suddenly jerking the rope, he woul(d at first seem quite in despair, relinquish his effort, and ruash about the rigging, screaming violentlv. But lie would always return, and again seizing the rope, disregard the jerk, and allow it to run through his hand till within reach of the orange; but if again foiled, would come to mv sidle, and taking me b)y the arm, confine it;,whilst he hauled the orange up. This animial neither practises the grimace and antics of other monkeys, nor possesses their perpetual proneness to mischief. Gravity approaching to ncelatncholy, and mildness, ivere sometimes strongly expressed in. his countenance, aiid seCInI to be the characteristics of his disposition. When he first caine amongst strangers, lhe wvould sit for hours vith his hanud poll his head, looking pensively at all around himi ; or w nhen uch, incommnodedl by their examination, wvould hide himself beneath any covering that was at hand. His mildness *vas evinced by his forbearance under injuries, which wvere grievous before he was excited to revenge ; but lie alwavs avoided those vho often teased him. Ile soon becamiC strongly attached to those who kindlv used him. By their side hie was fond of sittinfr aiid, getting as close as jpossible to their persons, would take their hands between his lips, and fly to theim for protection. Irom thme boats~vain of the Alceste, who shared his mneals with him, and vas his c hief favourite, lthhougli lie sometimes purloined the grog and the biscuit of his beinetactor, h1 learned to cat with a spoon and might le oftell seeni sitting at his cabin-door elijoviig his Coffee, luite Intentbarrassed bv those who observed him, and wvithi a grotesquc and sol)er air that seemned a burlesque on human nature. Next to the l)oatswain, I was perhaps his most iltimate acquaintance. He wvould always follow nie to the mast-head, whither I often %vent for the sake of reading apart from the noise of the ship ; and having satisfied himself thsit my pockets contained no eatables, would lie (Iow, by my side, and pulling a topsail entirely over himnl, p)eep froi it occasionally to watch my iliovelleits. His ftvotirite amusemnent in .Java was in smvinging from the branches of trees, in passing from one tree to another, and in climbing over the roofs of houses; on board, in hanging by his arms from the ropes, anud in romping with the bovs of the ship. He would entice theni into play by striking tlinm %vith his hand as they passed, and bounding from them, but ullowving them to overtake hlimn and engage in a mock scuffle, iill Wich he used his hands, feet, andi mouth.- If aIv conjecture could be formed fronm these frolics of his mode of attacking an adversary, it would appear to be his first object to throw hiin down, then to secure him with his hands and feet, and then wound him with his teeth. Of some small monkeys on board, from Java, he took little notice, vhilst under the observation of the persons of the ship. Once indeed he openly attempted to throw a small cage, containing three of them, overboard; because, probably, he had seen them receive food, of which lie could oh. tain no part. But although he held so little intercourse with them when under our in. spection, I had reason to suspect that he was less indifferent to their society when free from our observation ; and was one day summoned to the top-gallant yard of the mizen-mast, to overlook him playing with a young mnale monkey. Lying on his back, partially covered with the sail, he for some time contemplated, with great gravity, the gambols of the monkey which bounded over hli; bl)t at length caught him by the tail, and tried to envelope him in his covering. The monkey seemed to dislike the confinement, and broke from, hihn but again renCzve(l its gambols, and although frequently caught, always escaped. The intercourse however (id not seem to be that of equals, for the Orang-Outang never con(lesended to romp with the monkey as he did with the boys of the ship. Yet the monkeys had evidently a great predilection for his companv; for whenever they broke loose, they took their wvay to his restingplace, and were often seei lurking about it, or creeping clandestinely towards him. There appeared to be no gradation in their intimnacy; as they appeared as confidently familiar with him when first observed as at the close of their acquaintance. But although so gentle when not exceedingly irritated, the Orang-Outang could be excited to violent rage, which he expressed by opening his mouth, showing his teeth, seizing and biting those vho were near him. Sometimes indeed he seemed to be almost driven to desperation ; andl on twvo or three occasions committed an act, which, in a rational being, would have been caUed the threatening of suicide. If repeatedly refused an orange when he attemnped to take it, lie would shriek violently an d sving furiously about the ropes ; then return and endeavour to obtain it ; if again refused, he wvould roll for some time like an angry child upon the deck, uttering the most piercing screams ; and then suddenly starts ing up, rush furiously over the side of the ship, and disappear. On first witnessing this act, we thought that he had thrown himself into the sea ; bMt on a search being made, found him concealed under the chains. I have seen him exhibit violent alarm on two occasions only, when lie appeared to seek for safety in gaining as high an elevation as possible. On seeing eight large turtle brought on board, whilst the Caesar was off the Island of Ascension, lie climbed with all possible speed to a higher part of the ship tian he had ever before reached; and looking down upon them, projected his long lips inito the form of a hog's snout, uttering at the same time a sound which might be described as between the croaking of a frog and the grunting of a pig. After some time he ventured to descend, but with great caution, peeping continually at the turtle, but could not be induced to approach within many yards of them. He ran to the same height and uttered the same sounds on seeing some men bathing and splashing in the sea ; and since his arrival in England, has shownI nearly the same degree of fear at the sight of a live tortoise. Such wvere the actions of this animal, as far as they fell uinder my notice during our voyage from Java ; and they seenm to include most of those which have been related of the Orang-Outang by other observers.

PJqWd, in closing his seond act of Charlotte Curday, repr.tnts t heroine nerving herself for her enterprise by lianin to the voiaea of her books; the Bible, and the great writers through whom also God speaks. Her Ist thout is of the (inna of Corneille, yhose portrait hawg in her room. Corneille, mon sieu1, tu sras content.-Place, Emilie et Cinn* I je suis de votre race. M1U. Brette, Cosal, and Karcher open their budget of mndern French Plays, carefully selected and edited, with iPonqard'e Charlotte Corday, most thorouhhly edited by Professor Cawal for the use of students. The Clarendon Press at the same time issues two specimens of the elder French Drama, edited for students by M. Gustave Masson, and the first of the Plays given is Corawille's Cinua There may be some little significance in such an accident. There are two centuries between Caina and Charlotte Corday, but there is a spirit common to them both which in this year 1867 lives for every educated Frenchman. There was nothing in Cinna to shock Mezirin or Anne ot Austria, who were supreme when it came into vogue. Its climax is the Clemency of Augustus, which stays the hand I of conspiracy by making it the happiness of Rome that he should reign. Mazarin himself could play, on occasion, the Clemency of Augustus; as when Claude Qpillet went out t of the way to attack him in his Callipedia, a poem upon the uirt of getting beautiful children, by a digression into misnlliances of States and the ill-fruit that couws of them, t witness th9 ills Wori to France of her gift of sovereign I power to a Sicilian adventurer, c Triacziij devecdu ab orus advena. I Ifazarin had a talk with Quillet, after the fashion of the I dialogue between Augustus &ad Cinna, the result being that ths) intL, ware expunged from a new edition of the J p)ein, puOi d imediely in Paris and dediot to the a ( irdiu#J, by 1W poet who hsd not ouly beeu sooed sad $ flattsed. but promted Jao v use Abi ayede 404 pistoles.' Clemeny of Augusu was, to a erain point, a ts fashion among rulers; but what Cimeilio had in his wMin4 unid weigbed hs verswitk was a vlIrWs, ot14 a Aahwin. T'he ozPressiou, however, i in Corneille %We soeewhb a itidefinite by enfeeblesent of Cimw'. moves in the later part of the play, whan it is inteaded to me~r lz b intere to Cesar. Thoughts of a time of revolutiov,,9 though in ohatened form, pad spoken as they may be b hctard i Wdies' schools, play with a freer life in M. Pons:ird's Ckorlote Corday than in Corwlle's Cua; aAd the a py haws, like the others ia the co&leotion to wbich iti to, lunjs* oA9 advantage over Corneillo for thwe w*o are! luarniog Frec, that it is wrtten in t Yeuca of our o *" n day. Tr'ue there is nothing in Cariotite Corday equal i in po% er to the Wag speeo4 of Ciuma, which descrLbes the pirrcriptions &ad the turnig of tiae lwts of Lowaus to: ctnspiracy against the cruelties of the Triumvirate;i but Wuap Uww its little or nowo of the iafited style that Wu 4*aaz*d of the poet in ibe paloy days of the Freo:b AmWW43.

Once fairly become expert in crrent Frnch by help of books like these, the student will find help to his reaaing of tbe wrriters of two centuries ao in M. Gustave Masson's volume, which, like that df the Tha4're F^rqnis Moderne, is Vol. I. of a series to cope. It is ; series that will form admirable steppiug-stoues to the full pnd and wide enjoyment of the best literature of Fra4 as it has bop. The same editor r produces for all reders a Pettj vollrnQf liFrench lyrics, not eXclI44ing even Frvas YVilloz from representation, but giving little that ji e1lier t. Valberbe, Voiture, and Racan. Malhurbe, indeed, was called the founder of 1 French poetry before men's oars were open to the music of an elder time. Now even Academicians turn their faces to the dawu that was so musical with ' blades, roundels, virelais.' We must go back to the volume of Uodern French Plays to observe thst altbogzgh two 9f the three in this first issue are ezauples of the revived classipal school, which owred its recovqy of life to the genius of R4chl, the editor of oA* Fri like as impartial man of letters with eyes fr tbe merit in wha ver form good thonght can take, and 4aq, if 4ot * pefqreoee for the romantic over the , classical, yeSt wrtainly * Varm admiration of the genius of 1 Victor hugo, who is for Fr4nce the chief of the romantic school. Professor Cassal writes of Ponsard's Lucr#ce, 1 brought out in 1842: This tragedy of Lmcrece, which was well receivei by the publice, and crowned by the " Acadrmie Frangaise," forms an epoch in the history of the modern French Drama. Ponsard was, in spite of him- i self, set up as the chief of a new schooJ, in opposition to that of Victor Hugo. The good sense 9f the public, as well as sound criticisip, have decided in favour of both poets: whilst continuing to pay the deserved tribute of admiration to the great exile of Guernsey, they have assigned to Ponsard a distingnished place between the old C and the new masters, as to one wbo has wrought ; happy alliance E between the pure taste of th, ancient s*chool and the ideas and c tendencies of our own age. t M. Karoher writes of Emile Angier: c T1W srecireu3 given of Augier's poetry will at one glance show a that he is not precisely endqwed with & lighly oetic or passionate b vein. He is a rseful singer, an exquisite delineator of hIulmant character, and that is sufficient for his glory. As a poet, it would be unf'ir even to attevopt a comparisop between hiin and the great, bold, ' subliqpe master of the JRow ii, Schovl. The sano may be said of c hlim as a dramatic writer. t Both Vicoe~ lgo anu 1raile Apgser trtqd tbeir gsnius at tha a sombre but grazid figure, CArbiusJ Rioee ieo.

Didier is executed; Diane's brother is spared, and tbe brave girl aves hbr l9vcr wijliout even hoping tbkt he will ever 8 know it. t lIntgo's wretched beroine is tragical ; Augier's honest girl is only t and purely humau.

lill'. llEVIF.WI'.R.?Xo. IX Salmagundi; or the Whim Whams and Opinions oj Lancelot Lamest af, Esquire, and athen. Reprinted from the American Edition, with aa intro duelory Essay, and explanatory Yo/cs lo/ John Lambert. London. 'Richardson, Candid/,-2 vols, \-luit. Tin: present is the only collection of American essays that we have read without feelings of surprise at their tameness or disgust at their vulgarity. Grossness is the peculiar characteristic of American wit, and insipidity the usual accompaniment of transatlantic elegance. When an essayist of the new world is told that his diction is coarse, and his stile ungraceful, he endeavours to improve it by the repression of those very exuberances that alone contributed to his excellence, and by which exclusively his productions were rendered worthy the trouble of correction. The great body, therefore*, of Mr. Lang-tad's brethren may be? divided into the two distinct classes of the dull anel tin vuhar; of those who are too stupid to Le read by the community, and those who cannot be real by the critic vd thou l exciting less pleasure than disgust. That Mr. Lambert's opinions of American literature are more favourable than ours, will appear iron: the subjoined explanation of bia sentiments. His munni clo ry essay, indeed, is devoted U> a favourable: de!mention jflhe moral political character of the Americans, and to tiie obviation of those prejmTicer which he supposes to prevail against them among his countrymen. Wo has e ondweted the discussion with greaUernpcr anel ingenuity, and if thc reader do not inn fiejm its perusal with a firm conviction that the Americans are a great, anel virtuous, and happy people, it will not be owing to the deficiencies of their advocate.

WZCTZOUU. I Savindroog ; or, the Queen of the Junyle. By Captain RAFTER, late of the 95th Regt. London, 1847. Longrnan and Co. IT is strange that the East Indies should have produced so few novels. The materials for fiction abound, and although we have a whole library of reports of travellers, we really possess very little of that personal knowledge of the people which can only be vividly conveyed in the pages of a romance, just as we learn a great deal more of the soul of history from Sir WALTER SCOTT'S fictions, than from all the formal histories that ever were written. Cap. tain RAFTER appears to be faithful, and even minute, in his portraiture of persons and places. But we cannot equally compliment him upon his capacities for the construction of a plot, and the creation of characters. Although whatever in Eastern manners and scenery is splendid or hideous have been freely pressed into the service, he fails to excite any very deep interest in the story, and we read on rather for the information we glean as to realities, than from regard for the tale. His (ialogues, too, are very undramatic and strained, and he has adopted the odious contrivance of " looking learned," by the interlarding of the native language so thickly as to be an absolute nuisance. These mosaic compositions are in very bad taste, for if one sentence be conveyc(l in Englishi, why not another ? If the author desires to prove that he knonvs Hindustanee, he should write a book wholly in that language, not perplex his English readers in .u11 Ennglish book with words they cannot uinderstand. As the best parts of this novel are the descriptions of realities, we take two TlU. JUO(GLER. Having desired one of his attendants to bring him a branch from a noble mango-tree which grew at a short distance, Ilallojee took it in his hand and held it forth, all green and blossomless as it was, uttering certain incantations, and making a variety of grimaces, indicative of the internal workings (if a powerfully agitated spirit. Gradually, to the astonished eyes of the spectators, one blossom appeared sprouting forth; then another, and another, till the amputated branch was nearly covered. Wonderful, however, as this feat appeared, it was totally eclipsed by that which followed, for, as the juggler still held the branch extended in his hand, and continued his incantations, the blossoms fell off, one by one, and in the place of each appeared an incipient mango, which gradually swelled out to the largest size of that delicious fruit. These having been gathered by the juggler's attendants, were presented in a golden salver to the Ranee and her party; but none could be prevailed on to taste a fruit which they verily believed to be the production of magic alone. Tremendous applause and a royal largess followed this extraordinary.feat, and Ballojee once more addressed himself to his singular exhibition. Taking in his hand a coil of rope which lay on the stage, he flung it up with considerable force in the air, when, strange to say, one end remained fixed above, the other falling down upon the stage of the mountebank. Seizing hold of this, he kept it firmly extended in a sloping di- rection from the summit, when, wonder upon won. dens a tiger appeared at the top, in the act of descending the rope, which he actually did with great caution and precision, while many of the spectators fled screaming from the claws of the monster. Their panic, however, was very much increased when they beheld a lion following the tiger down the rope; and then a buffalo, an elephant, and sundry other animals, which were fortunately taken possession of by the attendants of the juggler, and conveyed behind the scenes, without causing any other mischief than the needless fright their first appearance had occasioned. These extraordinary performances prepared the spectators to witness other wonders, for only one opinion seemed now to prevail throughout the assembly, that the powers of the exhibitor were more than human, and that he could be nothing more or less than an incarnation of one of the deities; perhaps the awful Mahadeo himself, come down upon the earth to grace the birth-day festival of the Maharajah. It therefore excited but little astonishment when the juggler declared his ability to decipher the most hidden and secret thoughts of any of the spectators pre. sent. This was a disclosure, however, which few were desirous of subjecting themselves to, for all had thoughts more or less unsuited to the public car. THE MIRAGE. At length, on reaching the summit of a gentle eminence, to her inexpressible delight, a broad expanse of water gratified her longing eyes in the distance; its glassy surface sparkling in the solar beam with an intensity that made it almost painful to look upon. As they approached this crystal lake, it presented a most lovely and picturesque appearance; the trees that grew on its margin being reflected in all their flowery pride in the limpid stream, while numerous fairy islets, crowned with verdure, floated on its tranquil bosom. "Jey Sri Lachema !" exclaimed the Begum, invigorated by the cheering sight, and apostrophising her guardian goddess; " behold at length, my Kistna, a happy termination of our dreadful sufferings." "I see indeed an extensive lake before us," replied Kistna, looking anxiously and somewhat doubtfully in the direction indicated ; " and I fully share your joy at the prospect of speedy refreshment ; but-" " Nay, my Kistna," returned the Begum reproach. fully, "why damp my pleasure at so delightful a prospect with your ominous but I Do you know that the view of this beautiful lake seems rather to increase than diminish my burning thirst, and I die with impatience to plunge into its crystal current." Anticipating the delight she should experience from the refreshing contact, the Begum patted the neck of her panting steed, and urged him forward to bathe his limbs in the cool and placid wave, which now appeared at a short distance before them; while the lengthened shadows of the cocoa-nut-trees that were thinly scattered on its banks'gave a happy indication that the fiery noon was passed and cooler hours Cwere coming on. There was, however, a gloom on the brow of the Rajapoot, that seemed unaccountable to the Begum; but, supposing it to arise from the difficulty he anticipated in crossing the lake, she gaily exclaimed-" Nay, now, my Kistna, you despond without cause, and think this beautiful lake may prove 'an obstacle in our path: but yonder I see a boat with 'gallant streamers, and crowded with people linding on the verdant shore." " My adored Lachema," said the Rajapoot, " I clearly see the object you refer to; and it does, I confess, singularly resemble what you describe it to be." "Resemble !' eiclaimned the Begum, astonished at the apathy of her" lover. "Why, it is reality, if ever anything was real. Nay, farther on I can see other boa'ts sailing amongst the lovely islands that spread their umbrageous foliage down to the water's edge: hobw beautifully they reflect their tall masts and; sndwv-*liite sails in the transparent fluid!" "Tile illision is truly wonderful !" responded Kist ra, who did not seem at all to partakc of her enthusiusm 1 -4*. 0 (.

Ay Johni Turtibul . Second Edition, 4to,pp. 524. Ch;.pple. THIS Volage, which has been out of' print for live years, has at length made ils appearance ill ani elegant and hasdsome torm. The Autlhor evidently wislies io place Ihi work upou the same sh. 1I wilh Cook, King, Vancouvre, &e. anud with other Historians of' the. Smiliuerna Ocean; and this object he in all probabiiity will obtain, having brought up the history uf of the Southern Islands to the present period. The volume before us presents delightful entertainment concerning nations and countries with which we were previously but imperfectly acquainted; and the information which it communicates is detailed with much acuteness, perspicuity, and judgment. The Author appears to have enlarged this edition, by many important obsersations and suggestions, highly interesting to the country at the present moment. In his first edition he took only a transient glance at the island of Madeira; " but, since its occupation by the British troop*, it has excited a new interest, which it had never before possessed ;" he has therefore considerably enlarged that part of his work.-The emigration of the Court of Lisbon to the Brazils, has led Mr. Turnbull considerably to increase his remarks upon that country. He has fully demonstrated the superior advantages which Great Britainmight derive from her friendly intercourse with the Portuguese Government. It is delightful to contemplate, that, notwithstanding all the strurgles which Great Britain has endured during the revolutionary crisis of public affairs, and the numerous means which have heen employed by the Tyrant of France to diminish our resources and destroy our trade, she still holds a most decided pre-eminence. As her old resources dry up, new channels are opening-affording increasing confidence in that Providence which watches so carefully over the inLerests of the British Nation.-The materials which ourAuthor has collected concerning-Botany Bay are no less worthy of serious attention. He appears to have stated his sentiments freely, and without any restraint, respecting the causes "6 which have retarded the proeress of that infant colony." Many tuings are snggested, which display a mind pregnant with good sense, close thinking, and a sound understanding, with a generous ad ardent desire to promote the amelioration of the hunman species.The Author spent much of his time between the Tropics; and has therefore paid great attention to the Society and Sandwich Islands, those yery places which Cook explored, and whose account of the simple manners of the inhabitants had excited much tender interest. The rapid advance which the Sandwich islanders are making towards civilization is surprising. "' These islanders have taken a leap, as it were, into civilization; and if their progress keep any pace with the vigour of their first start, they will not be long considered as savages." We subjoin an interesting anecdote concerning the effects which the death of Capt. Cook produced upon the minds of these islanders. " In a conversation with Mr. Young, respecting the melancholy fate of Capt. Cook, I asked him how the Sandwich islanders felt after the first transports of anger had abated respecting this great man. His answer was, that as they at first considered him as, immortal, according to some of their rude notions of a superior being, they most fully expected that be would, in some shape or other, re-appear amongst them; and that they retained this idea for some years. Afterwards, being given to understand that his sons were chiefs of high power in England, they conceived a great alarm, lest one or other of them should return to the Sandwich islands with a large force, and wreak a merited vengeance on them by some terrible example." The account of the Missionaries in Otaheite is very fairly and candidly stated, and the Author appears very friendly to their designs. " We cannot omit in this place to do justice to the amiable manners and truly Christian deportment of the;ewen, who, like the Apostles of old, foregoing all the comforts of civilized life, and a life at least of tranquillity in their native land, have performed a voyage equal to the circumnavigation of the globe; and, like the dove of the ark, carried the Christian olive over the world of waters. Their life is a life of contest, hardship, and disappointment: like their holy Master, they have to preach to the deaf, and exhibit their works to the blind." From Mr. Turnbull's statement, it should seem that little good has been produced by their labours. He recommends the London Missionary Society to turn their attention to the Sandwich islanders; and, with such facts before them, we are rather astonished, that they should neglect a spot, which appears so promiuin . 4 and fertile, for one that is so ill suited to their labours. The detail of the Voyage of the Geographe and Naturalisme, the two French ships sent out on discovery by Buonaparte, is no less deserving attention, because it developes some of the views, objects, and plans, of that astonishing nan. U pon the whole, we have been much gratified with the perusal of this volume, which is replete with useful and valuable informtation, and displays the state of these countries to great advantage.-The first edition of this work has been, we understand, translated by the Freueii Minister of Marine at Marseilles.

Science and Philosophy. Life and Letters of Faraday.- -By Dr. Bence Tones. 2 valc Rvn I Longmans, x869. UNDERTAKEN and executed in a reverent and loving spirit, this work makes Faraday the virtual writer of his own life; his letters, lectures, and the extracts from his journals, being arranged and united so as to form a repertory of exceeding interest and importance, by Dr. Bence Jones. Everybody now knows the story of Faraday's birth: that his father was a smith; that he was born at Newington Butts in 1791; that he slid along the London pavements, a bright-eyed errand boy, with a load of brown curls upon his head and a packet of newspapers. under his arm; that the lad's master was a bookseller and bookbinder,-a kindly man, who became attached to the little fellow and in due time made him his apprentice without fee; that during his apprenticeship he found his appetite for knowledge provoked and strengthened by the books he stitched and covered. Thus he grew in wisdom and stature to his year of legal manhood, when he appears in the volumes before us as a writer of letters, which reveal his occupation, acquirements, and tone of mind. His correspondent was a Mr. Abbott, a member of the Society of Friends, who, with a forecast of his friend's greatness, preserved his letters and produced them at the proper time. In later years Faraday always carried in his pocket a blank card on which he jotted down in pencil his thoughts and memoranda. He made his notes in the laboratory, in the theatre, and in the streets. This distrust of his memory reveals itself in his first letter to Abbott. To a proposition that no new inquiry should be started between them before the old one had been exhaustively discussed, Faraday objects. " Your notion," he says, " I can hardly allow, for the following reason: ideas and thoughts spring up in my mind which are irrevocably lost for want of noting at the time." Gentle as he seemed, he wished to have his own way, and he had it throughout his life. Differences of opinion sometimes arise between the two friends, and then they resolutely face each other. "I accept your offer to fight it out with joy, and shall in the battle of experience cause not pain, but, I hope, pleasure." Faraday notes. his own impetuosity, and incessantly checks it. There is at times something mechanical in his self-restraint. In another nature it would have hardened into mere "correctness " of conduct; but his overflowing affections prevented this in his. case. The habit became a second nature to him at last, and lent serenity to his later years. In October I812 he was engaged by a Mr. De la Roche as a journeyman bookbinder; but the situation did not suit him. His master appears to have been an austere and passionate man, and Faraday was to the last degree sensitive. All his life he continued so. He suffered at times from dejection; and a certain grimness, too, pervaded his moods. "At present," he writes to Abbott, "I am as serious as you can be, and would not scruple to speak a truth to any human being, whatever repugnance it might give rise to. Being in this state of mind I should have refrained from writing to you, did I not conceive from the general tenor of your letters that your mind is, at proper times, occupied upon serious subjects to the exclusion of those that are frivolous." Plainly he had fallen into that stern puritan mood, which not only crucifies the flesh, affections, and lusts of him who harbours it, but is often a cause of disturbed digestion to his friends. About three months after his engagement with De la Roche, Faraday quitted him and bookbinding together. He had heard Davy, copied his lectures, and written to him entreating to be released from Trade which he hated and enabled to pursue Science. Davy recognised the merit of his correspondent, kept his eye upon him, and, when occasion offered, drove to his door and sent in a letter offering him the post of assistant in the laboratory of the Royal Institution. He was engaged upon the ist of March, x8I2, and on the 8th we find him extracting the sugar from beetroot. He joined the City Philosophical Society, which had been founded by Mr. Tatum in i8o8. " The discipline was very sturdy, the remarks very plain, and the results most valuable." Faraday derived great profit from this little association. In the laboratory he had a discipline sturdier still. Both Davy and himself were at this time cut and bruised by explosions of chloride of nitrogen. One explosion was so rapid " as to blow my hand open, tear away a part of one nail, and make my fingers so sore that I cannot use them easily." In another experiment "the tube and receiver were blown to pieces, I got a cut on the head, and Sir Humphrey a bruise on his hand." And again speaking of the same substance, he says, " when put in the pump and exhausted, it stood for a moment, and then exploded with a fearful noise. Both Sir H. and I had masks on, but I escaped this time the best. Sir H. had his face cut in two~ places about the chin, and a violent blow on the forehead struck through a considerable thickness of silk and leather." It was this same substance that blew out the eye of Dulong. Over and over again, even at this early date, we can discern the quality which, compounded with his rare intellectual power, made him a great experimental philosopher. This was his desire to see facts, and not to rest contented with the descriptions of them. He frequently pits the eye against the ear, and affirms the enormous superiority of the organ of vision. Late in life I have heard him say that he could never fully understand an experiment unless he had seen it. But he did not confine himself to experiment. He is seriously considering the most effective methods of scientific exposition. " A lecturer," he observes, " should appear easy and collected, undaunted and unconcerned;" still " his w^'hole behaviour should evince respect for his audience." These recommendations were afterwards in great part embodied by himself. I doubt his unconcern, but his fearlessness was often manifested. It used to rise within him as a wave, which carried both him and his audience along with it. On rare occasions also, when he felt himself and his subject hopelessly unintelligible, he suddenly evoked a certain recklessness of thought, and without halting to extricate his bewildered followers, he would dash alone through the jungle into which he had unwittingly led them; thus saving them from ennui by the exhibition of a vigour, which, for the time being, they could neither share nor comprehend. In October, I813, he quitted England with Sir Humphrey and Lady Davy. During his absence he kept a journal, from which copious and interesting extracts have been made by Dr. Bence Jones. Davy was considerate, preferring at times to be his own servant rather than impose on Faraday duties which he disliked. But Lady Davy was the reverse. She treated him as an underling; he chafed under the treatment, and was often on the point of returning home. They halted at Geneva. De la Rive the elder had known Davy in 1799, and by his writings in the Bib/iotfhtque Britannique had been the first to make the English chemist's labours known abroad. He welcomed Davy to his country residence in i814. Bothl were sportsmen, and they often went out shooting together. On these occasions Faraday charged Davy's gun; while De la Rive charged his own. Once the Genevese philosopher found himself by the side of Faraday, and in his frank and genial way entered into conversation with the young man. It was evident that a person possessing such a charm of manner and such high intelligence could be no mere servant. On inquiry De la Rive was somewhat shocked to find that the soi-disant domestli4ue was really preparateur in the laboratory of the Royal Institution; and he immediately proposed that Faraday thenceforth should join the masters instead of the servants at their meals. To this Davy, probably out of weak deference to his wife, objected; but an arrangement was come to that Faraday thenceforvard should have his food in his own room. Rumour states that a dinner in honour of Faraday was given by De la Rive. This is a delusion; there was no such banquet; but Faraday never forgot the kindness of the friend who saw his merit when he was a mere garron de laboratoire.: Faraday returned in I 815 to the Royal Institution. Here 'be helped Davy for years; he worked also for himself, and * While confined last autumn at Geneva by the effects of a fall in the Alps, my friends, with a kindness I can never forget, did all that friendship could suggest to render my captivity pleasant to me. Al. de la Rive then wrote out for me the full account, of which the foregoing is a condensed abstract. It was at the desire of Dr. Bence Jones that I asked him to do so. The rumour of a banquet at Geneva illustrates the tendency to substitute for the youth of 1814 the Faraday of later years. lectured frequently at the City Philosophical Society. He took lessons in elocution, happily without d(amage to his natural force, earnestness, and grace of delivery. He was never pledged to theory, and he changed in opinion as knowledge advanced. With him life was growth. In those early lectures we hear him say, " In knowledge, that man only is to be contemned and despised who is not in a state of transition." And again-" Nothing is more difficult and requires more caution than philosophical deduction, nor is there anything more adverse to its accuracy than fixity of opinion." Not that he was wafted about by every wind of doctrine; but that he united flexibility with his strength. In strong contrast with this intellectual expansiveness is his fixity in religion, but this is a subject which cannot be discussed here. Of all the letters published in these volumes none possess a greater charm than those of Faraday to his wife. Here, as Dr. Bence Jones truly remarks, "he laid open all his mind and the whole of his character, and what can be made known can scarcely fail to charm every one by its loveliness, its truthfulness, and its earnestness." Abbott and he sometimes swerved into word-play about love; but up to 1820, or thereabouts, the passion was potential merely. Faraday's journal indeed contains entries which sliev that he took pleasure in the assertion of his contempt for love; but these very entries became links in his destiny. It was through them that he became acquainted with one who inspired him with a feeling which only ended with his life. His biographer has given us the means of tracing the varying moods which preceded his acceptance. They reveal more than the common alternations of light and gloom; at one moment he wishes that his flesh might melt and he become nothing; at another he is intoxicated with hope. The impetuosity of his character was then unchastened by the discipline to which it wvas subjected in after years. The very strength of his passion proved for a time a bar to its advance, suggesting as it did to the conscientious mind of Miss Barnard doubts of her capability to return it with adequate force. But they met again and again, and at each successive meeting he found his heaven clearer, until at length he was able to say, "Not a moment's alloy of this evening's happiness occurred. Everything was delightful to the last moment of my stay with my companion, because she was so." The turbulence of doubt subsided, and a calm and elevating confidence took its place. "\What can I call myself," he writes to her in a subsequent letter, " to convey most perfectly my affection and love for you? Can I or can truth say more than that for this world I am yours ?" Assuredly he made his profession good, and no fairer light falls upon his character than that which reveals his relations to his wife. Never, I believe, existed a manlier, purer, steadier love. Like a burning diamond, it continued to shed, for six-and-forty years, its white and smokeless glow. Faraday was married on the 12th of June, i821 ; and up to this date Davy appears throughout as his friend. Soon afterwards, however, disunion occurred between them which, while it lasted, must have given Faraday intense pain. It is impossible to doubt the honesty of conviction with which this subject has been treated by Dr. Bence Jones, and there may be facts known to him, but not appearing in these volumes, which justify his opinion that Davy in those days had become jealous of Faraday. This, which is the prevalent belief, is also reproduced in an excellent article in the March number of Fraser's Mfaga-zine. But the best analysis I can make of the data fails to present Davy in this light to me. The facts, as 1 regard them, are briefly these. In x820, Oersted of Copenhagen made the celebrated discovery which connects electricity with magnetism, and immediately afterwards the acute mind of Wollaston perceived that a wire carrying a current ought to rotate round its own axis under the influence of a magnetic pole. In 182I he tried, but failed, to realise this result in the laboratory of the Royal Institution. Faraday was not present at the moment, but he came in immediately afterwards, and heard the conversation of Wollaston and Davy about the experiment. He had also heard a rumour of a wager that Dr. Wollaston would eventually succeed. This was in April. In the autumn of the same year Faraday wrote a history of electromagnetism, and repeated for himself the experiments which he described. It was while thus instructing himself that he succeeded in causing a wire carrying an electric current to rotate round a magnetic pole. This was not the result sought by Wollaston, but it was closely related to it. The strong tendency of Faraday's mind to look upon the reciprocal actions of natural forces gave birth to his greatest discoveries; and we, who know this, should be justified in concluding that, even had Wollaston not preceded him, the result would have been the same. But in judging Davy we ought to transport ourselves to his time, and carefully exclude from our thoughts and feelings that noble subsequent life which would render simply impossible the ascription to Faraday of anything unfair. It would be unjust to Davy to put our knowledge in the place of his, or to credit him with data which he could not have possessed. Rumour and fact had connected the name of WVollaston with these supposed interactions between magnets and currents. When, therefore, Faraday, in October, published his successful experiment without any allusion to Wollaston, general, though really ungrounded, criticism followed. I say ungrounded because Faraday had actually called upon Nollaston, and not finding him at home (lid naot feel himself authorised to mention him. It should be remembered that W~ollaston had Britain nothing which could be referred to publicly, and that Faraday's experiment was really different from his. In December he published a second paper on the same subject, from which, through a misapprehension, the name of Wollaston was also omitted. Warburton and others thereupon affirmed that Wollaston's ideas had been approl)riated without acknowledgment, and it is plain that Wollaston himself, though cautious in his utterance, was also hurt. Censure grew till it became intolerable. "I hear," writes Faraday to his friend Stodart, " every day more and more of these sounds, which, though only whispers to me, are, I suspect, spoken aloud among scientific men." He might have written explanations and defences, but he went straighter to the point. He wished to see the principals face to face-to plead his cause before them personally. There is a certain vehemence in his desire to do this. He saw Wollaston, he saw Davy, he saw Warburton; and I am inclined to think that it was the irresistible candour and truth of character which these vivid voce defences revealed, as much as the defences themselves, that disarmed resentment at the time. As regards Davy, another cause of dissension arose in 1823. In the spring of that )ear Faraday analysed the hydrate of chlorine, a substance once believed to be the element chlorine, but proved by Davy to be a compound of that element and water. The analysis was looked over by Davy, who then and there suggested to Faraday to heat the hydrate in a closed glass tube. This was done, the substance was decomposed, and one of the products of decomposition was proved by Faraday to be chlorine liquefied by its own pressure. On the day of its discovery he communicated this result to Dr. Paris. Davy, on being informed of it, instantly liquefied another gas in the same way. Had he a right to strike thus into Faraday's enquiry? I think not. Having done so, ought he not to have left the matter in Faraday's hands? I think he ought. But Davy, I submit, may be excused for thinking differently. A father is not always wise enough to see that his son has ceased to be a boy, and estrangement on this account is not rare; nor was Davy wise enough to discern that Faraday had passed the mere assistant stage and become a discoverer. It is now hard to avoid magnifying this error. But had Faraday died or ceased to work at this time, or had his subsequent life been devoted to money-getting instead of to research, would anybody now dream of ascribing jealousy to Davy? I think not. Why should he be jealous? His reputation at this time was almost without a parallel; his glory was without a cloud. He had added to his other discoveries that of Faraday, and after having been his teacher for seven years, his language to him was this " It gives me great pleasure to hear that you are comfortable at the Royal Institution, and I trust that you will not only do something good and honourable for yourself, but also for science." This is not the language of jealousy, potential or actual. But the chlorine business introduced irritation and anger, to which, and. not to any ignobler motive, Davy's opposition to the election of Faraday to the Royal Society is, I am persuaded, to be ascribed. Even from this point of view I agree with Dr. Bence Jones in thinking the affair a sad one. These matters are touched upon with perfect candour and becoming consideration in the volumes of Dr. Bence Jones; but in "society" they are not always so handled. Here a name of noble intellectual associations is surrounded by injurious rumours which I would willingly scatter for ever.. The pupil's magnitude and the splendour of his position are too great and absolute to need as a foil the humiliation of his master. Brothers in intellect, Davy and Faraday, however, could never have become brothers in feeling; their characters were too unlike. Davy loved the pomp and circumstance of fame; Faraday the inner consciousness that he had fairly won renown. They were both proud men. But with Davy pride projected itself into the outer world; while with Faraday it became a steadying and dignifying inward force. In one great particular they agreed. Each of them. could have turned his science to immense commercial profit, but neither of them did so. The noble excitement of research, and the delight of discovery, constituted their reward.. I commend them to the reverence which great gifts greatly exercised ought to inspire. They were both ours; and through the coming centuries England will be able to point with just pride to the possession of such men. The 29th of December i827 marks an epoch in the history of the Royal Institution; for on that day Faraday delivered " the first of a course of six lectures adapted to a juvenile audience." Nowhere was the philosopher more at home than in the presence of the children. I have already written of him thus:-" To his range of character he owed his fascination. He was a sage among the sages and a youth among the young. In his juvenile lectures he did not descend to his audience by an act of voluntary condescension. Inspiration, rather than volition, was his motive power. He saw himself surrounded by joyous, hopeful, eager listeners, who acted upon him as one of his own magnets on a body susceptible of ' influence.' That portion. of his large nature which belonged to boyhood was roused to sympathy, and out of the abundance of his heart his mouth spoke." The first lecture I ever heard Faraday give was one of those "juveniles." It was full of beauty both of intellect and soul. Sir Roderick Murchison once gave me a vivid account of his first lecture in the laboratory of the Institution. It was delivered without preparation, but with enthusiastic applause. In' April 1827 Faraday began his afternoon courses in the theatre of the Institution, where, to use the words of Dr. Bence Jones, he continued to lecture, as nobody else could lecture, for nearly thirty years. This brings us to the end of the first volume of a truly invaluable worK. 1 qua- Y __. , .. -II JOHN TYNDALL. I 0l obe continueet.) I

The History and Antiquities of Boston, and th* Villagisoftfkirlnck, Fishtuft, Fixistou,Butkrtvicl;Benington,Leverton,Ltethe, and Wrangle, comprising tin Hundred vf SLirbeck, iu th-e County of Lincoln, <??<?. Illustrated with One Hundred Engravings. By Pishey Thompson. (Longman & Co.) According to a popular local tradition, St, Botolph, the guardian saint ol' mariners, erected a monastery near or at tho old Icanhoe of thc kingdom of Meroin. This monastery, orecred in the seventh cen tiny, and destroyed by the Danes in the ninth, g. inod for the place the name of Botolph's Town,?-a name which has been abbreviated into that of Bonton. Whether this tradition bo tho correct one or not,?and it has its opponents,- ono thing is certain, that in the district and its vicinity tbe Roman bas left more substantial witness of his presence than tbe saint. It is the district of dykes, and the Car Dyke, which some persons, misled by the first word, have boon inclined to attribute to a British primo, is the work of the Romans, who by this dyke, drain, or canal, between the Welland and the Withani, rendered more accessible tho fons or ears of the marshy locality. Tho importance of Boston under the Norman dominion is proved by a simple circumstance. When the tax of a fifteenth was laid on all lands and goods at tho various seaports, Boston contributed tho next greatest sum after that collected in tho port of Loudon. The latter locality gave to the royal treasury tho sum of H3UA, and Boston was only ''(il. behind the capital. Tho position nf tho town at the mouth of tho Withani was tho cause of its ancient prosperity, hs trade was extensive ; foreign merchants made it their home: and though it ?was oft(;n visited by devastating tire, and swept by destruct ive inundations, "Buttolphe'sTown" continued to flourish, in tho middle of the fourteenth century, when some fourscore towns wore assessed for a supply of ships and mon for the invasion of Brittany-, Boston ranked twelfth among tho fourscore in tho amount of ships and mon thus supplied. Tho decay of tlie town dates from the closing years of tim fifteenth centuiy, when local dissensions and riots, not unattended by bloodshed, drove tho foreign merchants from the locality. A century later, the glory of Boston was spoken of as a thing that had been; a matter belonging to history,? its trade gone, and therewith all spirit, enterprise, and hope of veeoveiy. Tho dissolution of the monasteries was almost as disastrous to the place as the withdrawal of tho foreign merchants; and the municipal rights and privileges granted to the then duly incorporated, free and chartered borough, failed to restore it to the fullness of its ancient prosperity. Pestilence and other terrible visitations combined with equally adverse influences to obstruct the efforts of the people to totter their condition. During the sixteenth and two following centuries we often come upon the record, that " the port continued to decline,"?" thc commerce of Boston continued to decline." Boston Stump, as the tower of the grand cathedral church is called, Ls now almost the sole boast of a town where merchants formerly occupied their palaces; and Carmelites, Dominicans, Franciscans and Augustans inhabited priories as rich as palaces, founded trading as well as religious guilds, and aided generally in the maintenance of the prosperity of the town. When one of our kings, in angry mood, menacingly intimated to tlie Lord Mayor that he would fix his capital in an inland locality, the great municipal officer expressed his conviction that his fellow citizens would survive the catastrophe, inasmuch as His Majestywould, probably, not take with him the river Thames. L'p this river argosies still ascend from the ocean, and into the lap of London the world still pours its wealth. The Witham has been less propitious to the old town of St. Botolph. In the piping times of tliat town's greatness, ships of heavy burden could land their stores at its wharfs; and the authorities were active in removing all obstructions to navigation. With decay of trade came neglect of the stream by which, it had access to the town, and a century ago a vessel of fifty tons could hardly get up the Witham to Boston, even with a spring-tide to help her. Things had, in fact, then fallen into that condition of " the worst" at which they arc supposed, generally, to mend. The Bostonians seem, at all events, to have been aroused to exertion. Without the Witham they would, inevitably, have become as dead as any fish. They looked at the stream almost in despair, and then, convinced that to despair was about the silliest remedy they could devise for thc desired improvement, they addressed themselves to their work like men. Parliament came to their succour, and now the masts of vessels of 300 tons may be seen among the chimney-pots of the streets of St. Botolph. Hemp, iron, timbeT, tar, and other commodities, are imported from the Baltic, and large exports of corn, particularly of oats, aro made to London. Improvements in the port continue to be effected; but Boston, though it has recovered the Witham, has an obstruction to its exclusive prosperity as a port, in the iron-roads, by which the products and manufactures of the district can be more readily conveyed away than coastwise or by the numerous canals with which it is connected. Nevertheless, there is every prospect that the town ol' Boston will continue to increase in Wealth. The drainage of the Fens has extended the trade in corn and cattle, the chief products of the wide agricultural district of which Boston is the centre, and the transport of these may >>e well divided between port and rail, giving occupation to the shipping of the one and the goods-trains of the other. This combination was not dreamed of when the Earls of Riohmond kept state and watch near Boston Deeps, and the lordly Husseys looked over the town from the tower which bears their name. The history and antiquities of this locality, Mj*. Thompson ha* treated largely and elaborately. Hi? volume includes histories of the fons, rivers, and celebrated personages of the district. The geology, natural history, botany and agriculture of the locality are incidentally dealt with; and ample notices are made of the archaisms, provincial words, dialect, phrases, proverbs, and superstitious of the place and its vicinity. In electing our extracts from this volume, we have in view the general reader rather than the antiquary and the student of topography,?all of whom, indeed, will find attractive matter in Mr. Thompson's pages. Thus, as an instance, we find the subject of Deodands illustrated:? " From the early part of the reign of Edward I. (circa 127b') to 1300, many instances of murder and other crimes occur in this neighbourhood, in which tho offenders fled from sanctuary to a church, and refused to attend the inquisition of the coroner-; and in several cases they escaped by irregular verdicts and other lapses of tlie law. Some fled fn >m justice, and there is no record of their capture. In cases of drowning by falling from a boat in the river, a fine was levied on the boat. Richard, the son of Elye, was hung for stealing bread. William Wyeth de Gernon and Nicholas de Mundhain were lieheaded at Lincoln for slaying Peter de Martel in the field of St. Botolph. Two females fell into tubs of hot liquor (verjuice), and wore scalded to death, and fines were levied upon the vessels. William de Freneys fell from his home into the river at St. Botolph's, and both man and horse were drowned ; a fine was levied on Hie horse's skin, value lld." The following says something of tlie first lottery in England, and the notnblo luck of the Boston sages who took tickets :? '" The first lottery in England upon record was brought forward in 1567 by the Queen's authority. In the proposals it was called * a rich lotterie general, without any blanks, the prizes being in money, plate, and various kinds of merchandise.' Tlie highest prize was 5,OOO/.,?consisting of 3,000/. in money, 7001. in plate, 'gilt and white,' and the rest in 'good tajiestry and linen cloth.' The second prize was 3,500/., in about the same proportion. Then succeeded 2i?/Jl?S other prizes, gradually reducing in valuo from 2,000/. to 14b. ; then followed 370,000 prizes of 2s. Gd. each. The tickets 400,(100, were sold at 10s. each, raising 200,000/. j whilst the whole amount of prizes and estimated charges amounted to 100,000?., thus leaving a balance of 100,000/. for the government,?a very large amount at that time, which was to be spent 'in the restoration of havens, and strengthening of the realm, and towards such good public works.' The scheme did not, however, take well with the public, and the drawing was deferred for a time. In the meanwhile pa?>ers were sent to tho principal gentlemen in tho different counties, accompanied with a letter under the Queen's sign-manual, urging them to 'arrange and exert themselves, to dispose of the unsold tickets.' Ono of those royal circulars was received by Mr. William Derby, an alderman of Boston, who laid it before the Corporation. The result was, that the Corporation took thirty tickets, and various inhabitants thirty-three more, the whole costs being "1/. 10a. The lottery was drawn in 15C9 ; and the Boston adventurers received, in 1570, for their 31/. 10s.,?'inpart recompence for their money,'?1/. 18s. Od." In the same reign, the mayor (in a letter) praises God for the plentifulness of grain, and for the cheapness of barley and beans, " not above 9s. or 10s. the quarter," and in a postscript he alfords us the subjoined insight into the corn-trade of the period.? "Mr. Dunstayne Anyes, the Queen's Majesty's grocer, wished to have the privilege of exporting 1,000 of the above-mentioned 8,000 quarters of grain, great part of it in beans, winch could best be sjiared, and to transport tho same to tho town of Bayona in Gallicia ; for which he could give his bond to return the same in l-eiils of plate into her Majesty's Mint, aud hi other commodities of Portugal." Tlie merchants must have been better off than the "parsons." We perceive (1650) that a reverend gentleman, named Nayler, was appointed to preach in Boston every third Thursday throughout the year, " and to have for his labour ana pains, one chaldron of coals." If he died, and the corporation were invited to his funeral, there was some jollity for an hour before the ceremony,?according to the following law of 1654 :? "Ordered, that from henceforth when there shall be any funerals within this borough to which the Mayor, aldermen, and common council, shall be invited, that the householders where such funeral shall happen to be, shall so order the same, that the corpse may not fail to be at the grave, or on the way there, within two hours next after the time appointed for the company to meet; and that this order may be the better observed, one of the office*, is to set an hour-glass at the beginning of the said two hours ; and when tlie hour-glass is outrun, or sooner if the occasion be, they Bhall begin to serve the company. And whenever any room is once fully served, and the servers gone out of the room, they are not to return to it, to serve any ono that may come afterwards, thereby prolonging the time. But when tho second hour is ended, then forthwith the Mayor, aldermen, and common council then present, arc to come away, that so the re.;t of the company may do the like. The officer aforesaid having given notice to them of the house to bring away the corjwe, this order to be published throughout the town." Tlie notices of branding-irons, pillory, and" pillory-pit* aro suggestive of fretpient ofleaces or of harshness of punishment. But these will inspire loss horror than will be felt by an anti-' qnary on perusing the following paragraph?in reference to the Market Plaee. ? , ? ' " ' ' " In the wall of one of these last-mentioned houses, was a stone with an antique head upon it, and tbe inscription ' Antkpiariatt Coff_e-ho_.e;' Thia place was formerly occupied by a per_on of whom Mr. Johnson of Spalding, when, writing to Mr, Gale, under date the 3rd April, 1741, respecting a copper coin of Otho, says, ' it belongs to poor diaries Little of Boston, au illiterate coffee-house keeper, who has begged aud bought up as strange a farrago of a collection as ever was beheld.'" What a contemptuous epithet is that of "poor," and how ill applied is the term "farrago" to the collection of a inun who had *n " Otho" in his possession ! It was less thought of than the bag, bullets, and key of Vie theatre presented to the mayor at the installation of his worship, who gave to his cook the same salary that was awarded to the recorder, and who resembled other great men of the placed who seem to have felt more honoured by presents of fish, flesh, fowl, and West Folley hains, than if an offer had been made them of a badge of knighthood. Fat capons formed a sort of legal tender of rent to the corporation by its tenants,?as, in older times, they who told of the king paid " one soaring hawk as customarv rout," annually, for their laud. ? It was a land, by the way, from wliich Mr. Thompson has drawn an illustration of an old legend, which is new to us.? "It was remarked tiiat immediately after the drainage of the Fens comuienced, there was a greater prevalence of aguish complaints among the inliabitants of the surrounding district than before; but since it has been completed, agues, and all that class of diseases, have almost entirely disappeared. When the wet muddy surface was first left bare, malaria arose from it; but, as the moisture exhaled, the malaria ceased.- Perhaps there are in no part of England so many legends about dragons and dragon-slayers as in lincolnshire. This title was formerly given to persons who by skill and industry, perfected works of drainage, and thereby removfed the cause of sickness and disease, typified in anoient times ivs dragons or destroyers. Instances of traditions or dragon-slayers occur at Ludford, Middle Raisin, Walmsgate, Bu-lingthorpe, &c. We know of none in this hume Aiate neighbourhood; and the reason is obvious, for the dragons were pot Slain until the days of tradition and fable had cea_ed. John Rennie was the great dragon-slayer ir* th. Fens of Lincolnshire." Tlie list of local provincialisms contains many words and phrases that are as tr*je cockney a3 Bostonian. The following are more common between the Wash and the Humber :? " Abrald.?To rise on the stomach with nausea. Ager, or Alger.?The first wave of the title in the Trent, Ouse, or Witham. 'It ls nothing more than the name of the Northern God of the Sea, applied like Neptune to the Sea itself.'?See Sir C. Anderson's ' Eight Weeks in Norway, and Nares'' Glossary,' under Agar and Uigre; in one or other of these mode* of spelling it Li used by Dryden, Drayton, Chatterton, William of Malmesbury, kc. Aud farrand.? Old fashioned. A child with the manners of an old person; or clever beyond his years. Used by Ray, 1674. Danish, Er j tren. fJaggerment.?Nonsense; worthless talk. Barked.?Dirt dried on the skin, and hard to be removed. Bishopped.?When the milk ls burnt to tbe bottom of the vessel in boiling, it is said to be bishopped. ' The Bishop has put liis foot in lt.* Brock.?' I sweat like a brock ;' the insect found ou green leaves surrounded by a white froth, tho Cicada spumaria. t'onoy fogle.?To cheat by bewildering. Eau.?A drain. A.H., Scandinavian, or Danish. Originally Aa, pronounced 0. Go look!?An impertinent reply to any question, implying rudeness and indifference, and always denying information. Goodying.?Begging at Christmas time. Last of oats ta'.?Twenty-one sacks of four bushels each. Linell (to;.?' I'll Hitch him myself,' teat him. Mumper.?A beggar on St. Thomas's Day. Pag-rag-day.? The day when servants change their places, at May-day, or Martinmas; in Yorkshire, tmck.rag day. In both places, a contemptuous aud unseemly expression] Very not well.?Very unwell." The belief in the evil eye, it would seem, had not expired in this district so recently as last year ; and Mr. Thompson tells us that? "There is a curious superstition relative to a place in the parish of Frelston, called Spittal Hill (from a hospital which was formerly there), that a hobgoblin, or sprite, frequents the spot at midnight, in the shape of a small rough horse. This sprite has been named the 'Spitted Hill tut,' and sometimes the 'shag-foal.' It is said to have frequently followed a traveller, mounted his horse behind him, and almost hugged him to death with its fore-legs. It accompanies him a certain distance and then vanishes. Different causes are assigned for this appearance by tliose who believe in it. One is, that a murder was committed near the spot where the * shag-foal' appears. Another, that a treasure is secreted there, and that this hobgoblin is appointed to watch over and protect it. This latter seems to be the most consistent theory; for this ' Spittal Hill tut' would not chase persons away from the place, if it was designed that a murder which had been committed there should be discovered." We must not conclude without a word of praise to Mr. Thompson for the industry and patience, the zeal and the research, which a work like the one before us shows him to possess. Tlie notices of the old families of the district arc among the most valuable features of the volume. They are full and numerous,? Cottons, Kymes, Husseys, Wrangles, Gilberts, and very many more. In his next edition, Mr. Thompson may add to his account of Butterwick, that it is the last place in the county in which the Gilberts held land. It is not half-adozen years since the land at Butterwick, formerly held by the Gilberts (who claimed to be of the family of St. Gilbert of Sempringhani), was sold by tho last holder's representative,? a well-known writer of the present day.

illemoirs of the Empress Josephine. (Constable's Miscel- IFA t '. f ve-e L lany, XVol. LXXII.) By John S. iIemes, LL.D. Edinburgh: Constable and Co. London: Hurst, Chance, and Co. 1831. (Concluding Notice.) WE have already expressed our admiration of this book, in terms more strong than wve are wont to use, and do not think it necessary, although we have dissented from Dr Menies's opinions inore than. once, to remind the reader of this fact wvitb a serious face. We proceed to select, from the elegant picture.gallery with which the author has furnished uis, such situations as inay of themselves tell the story of Josephine. We left lber kneeling in the triumph of completed hope, tempered with all the delicacy and gentleness of her nature: we re-produce her in the daily routine of grandeur _unchanged, unspoiled: " We may well conceive the vexations, occasioned by this host of petty observances, to those sturdy veterans, who wvere more conversant with the battle-field than the boudoir. Doubtless, however, the ridicule which has attached to the mianners of Napoleon's court has been greatly exaggerated, and from evident design, in writings published by renegade courtiers since the restoration. We bave Josephine's own authority, whose judgment and taste are indisputable, that the emperor himself, from the first, observed with ease the habitudes of his rank. 'M ost ccrtainly,' such are her own words when conversing in the little circle of her own exiled court, ' most truly do I regard the emperor as a man who has no equal. In camps, at the council board, they find him extraordinary, but in the interior of his palace he ever appeared to me still more remarkable. I contess that, notwithstanding my experience of the world and its usages, the commencement of the imperial forms embarrassed me. The emperor, on the contrary, made a sport, a pleasure of them, and in all the palace lie alone, beyond contradiction, best understood their observances. Lannes, who enjoyed full license of speech, made mockery of what he termed " the hypocrisies of political worship ;" but, estimatint such things at their real value, the emperor regam'ds them under relations more elevated, and conceives that, in the eyes of the people, they conduce to restore to powrer the majesty and .ascendency which so many years of anarchy had destroyed. He grants, in truth, that their principal influenice springs from the personal qlulities of those invested with the supreme rule; but he maintains that, without equalling or superseding these qualities, ceremonial institutions may supply their place with advantage. In supporting sluch a system, Napoleon shows himself at least veery disintereste(d, for wvho can stamid less in need of appliances to impose tipon men than one who seems born to govern ? In proof of his argument, he adduces the example of a crowd of princes who have reigned, so to speak, rather seated or lying than standing upright, but whose couch, glrken by the barriers of etiquette, has been respected like al sanr tnarv.'__ " ' Of these views,' added Josephine, ' I did not altogether approve, but submitted to them ;' and indeed her whole czonduct showed, that whatever tended to substittite torm for sentiment, or ilace restraint upon intercourse 'vitli those arounl her, gave her pain. i-eI eleva. tizn so far tended to her unhappiness, that it placed in solitary greatness, above the kindly glow of equal alfections, a heart 'w hose first desire was to be loved.' In this sense bhe migTht hiae said, ' Never (lid subject long to he a queen As I (10 long and wish to lie a subject.' At the commencement of the empire, the etiquette of Which she chiefly complained was that which obliged her to remain seated while she received those who had lately been her equals, or even her superiors, in raulk. Nothizg could be more amiable than her reception of those ladies who came to take the oaths of fidelity on receiving ap. pointments inl the imperial household. She took care to remove all ostentatious ceremony-was usually accompanied only by her first lady of honour-talked to the neophyte, who was often an old acquaintance, of their former intimacy, or on such topics as might render less sensible the difference between their present station, and make the whole pass as an agreement between two friends to love each other. This condescension extended even to her humble domestics, yet never degenerated into undignified familiarity or absence of self-possession, as the following little incident testifies :-On the very first occasion of her leaving St Cloud for a distant excursion as empress, Josephine traversed a whole suite of apartments, though pressed for time, to give directions to a very subaltern person of her household. On returning, the grand steward remonstrated very respectfully on thus compromising the dignity of the crown, and that her majesty should give orders through him. The empress upon this gaily replied,-' You are quite right, my good sir, and such neglect of etiquette might be altogether inexcusable in a princess born to a throne, and trained to the restraints which it imposes; but have the goodness to recollect that I have enjoyed the felicity of living so many years as a private individual, and do not take it amiss if I sometimes venture to speak kindly to my servants without an interpreter."' There is something excessively winning In that lurk. ing, childishness, which sometimes breaks out so fascina. tingly in woman, and nowhere have we seen a more charming exemplification of the remark, than in this little anecdote: "No wonder, then, setting apart her affection, that Josephine on all occasions evinced so strong a desire to be permitted to accompany her husband. On his part, Napoleon loved to indulge this wish; and they differed only as to its being always possible. On one occasion, however, after promising to take the empress, something having occurred to alter his intention, and to require speed, he resolved on departing privately, without his companion. Fixing, accor'dinigly, one o'clock in the morning, the hour wheel she was most likely to be asleep, for the timne of setting out, he was just about to step into the carriage, whene Josephine, in most piteous plight, threw herself into his, arms. By some means, she had obtained itiformation of vhat was going forward, and called her wom en; but, impatient of any delay, had got up without waitingt for them, and throwing about her the first drapery she could lay hands upon, had r'ushed down stairs, in slippers, without stockings, ' wveeping,' as our authority, an eye-witness, expresses it, ' like a little girl, when the hzolidlays are over.' A moment later, and, Napoleon would have been off like lightning, bit he could rarely withstand the tears of his wife, so, placing her along the bottomr of the carriage, he covered her with his travelling pelisse, giving orders himselftabout tile clothes antd proper attendants of the empress." But we nust have a peep at her domestic privacy, and that was elegrant andl refihied, as her public appearances were remote from, hollow pretemisioni. " From about mid-day, till half-past two or three o'clock, was passed by the empress in her apartments, working, conversing, and reading with her ladies. We have already mnentionedl, how beautifully Josephine embroidered, anrd this accomplishment continuied to be her chief amusement, much of the most sllendid furniture ill the various palaces beingo covered witli Piecers executed by her* own hand, with the a3ssistane of her ladies. The following billet is a curious melange of orders pertaining to these labours, while it shows how kindly Josephine addressed even her Inferior attendwatts; "' To Aubert, Femine (le C/ambzce to I/ec Empren-css. "'My dear Miss Aubert,-I beg you will call in at Bennais' on returning, and see if he really intends to bring my rouge boxes. I have not a single one, as you know. Enquire also whether the frames which I ordered of him are ready; my ladies remain with folded arms, and I myself have nothing at all to do. Take at the same time in your way the Pare de Familke, and get there, on myX account, a complete assortment of worsteds, with some dozens of English needles.lIere is a lot of commissions for you all at once; not to forget them, think of me. I am quite sure you will acquit yourself well, and return quickly.' " While the rest were at work, one of the ladies, permanently appointed to the office of reader, read aloud at such times as conversation was not preferred. When any literary production gave more than usual pleasure, it was immediately begun from the commencement, and perused a second time. The volumes selected were interesting but useful books, from the standard writers, arid all new publications of repute. Works of taste and imagination constituted, of course, a large portion of these public readings; novels, however, unless in particular instances, were excluded. Napoleon, indeed, disliked to see novels anywhere about his palaces; anti, traversing the antechambers, if he found any of his attendants reading, he seldom failed to examine the book, and,if a novel, condemned it to the flames without mercy. The individual, too, was sure of a lecture, which usually began with the question,-' So, you could find no better reading than that ?'-While the empress and her ladies were engaged as described, the emperor was in the habit of looking in upon the fair party at intervals throughout the morning. On these occasions, he is described as being extremely amiable, amusing, and iii high spirits; for he rarely visited the saloon in the morning, unless when in good humour, or, in his own phrase, 'w hen things wvent well.' Josephine, too, though more rarely, would venture into his cabinet, but when he required her presence for any conference of importance, Napoleon knocked at the little door of private communication. The empress joyfully obeyed the signal; and these interviews, generally taking place in the evening, were often continued so long that on returning she found all her ladies asleep." The masquerading adventures of the imperial pair, are highly characteristic: " The winter of 1808, was one of the gayest which Paris had yet Witnessed under the empire. MIaskel balls were especial favourites; and those of the ambassador for the new kingdom of Italy were particular-ly (listitiguished for their splendour. Napoleon, contrlary to his usual nre~judice against such disguisements, resolviiig to be present, arid to dance at one of these, ordered ten different dresses to be carried into the apartment allotted to him. These were ill succession assumed, and ten different timies 1 the wearer was detected. At supper, the same evening, after his return, the emperor was relafting to Blerthier, i Mortier, Duroc, a.tned other officers presenit, the history of i Lis tinfortutiate inasqueradings, at the same time laugh- I illq very hIearctily at his want of success iii urflJ/ayiilg I& I Emperor. 'Do you know, gentlcineie,' coatinued Na- i poleon, ' that 1 was regularly discovered by a Xoung glady t UjcuIc dlla), who seemed an accomipl ished ilntr'iguer ; anid yet,-would you believe it ?-I could iiever recognise i the lirt.' Here the empress could no loniger restrain f herself. It was Josephmirie herself who had at once de- I tected her spouse, anid piqued his curiosity. During the a carnival of the same winter, masked(l balls at the opera 1X were described as v-ery anrushimm ; anid thne empreI'ss en- I1 treated Napole.mn to take her to sCe otJie; but meceived t i positive deniial. ' Well, I bshall go ithout you, 7non utme' I. - ' As you pleabc,' saill the jecpror, as lie rose froin the a breakfast table. Ait the appointed houir, Jobep)liiie kept I he r word; but no woneuli had sest off for the ball, thla I F - Napoleon, sendigi- tfr one oC her femines d1e clhaib.e, t informed himself exactly of the empress's costume, ntil followed. This time every precaU.tion was taken aguillnt discovery. The emperor, with D)uroc, another officer, MO k his own favourite valet, all in dominnos, entered a plain carriag e, and, arma its armi, made their appearance in the ballroom. It had also been agreed, that they shouldl add res, r each other by fictitious uames-Napoleon was Attystc, Duroc, Francoi.s, and so on. They traversed the whole l apartments undiscovered, examined the personages present; but could find no one in the slightest degree re sembling the empress. Napoleon, greatly alarmed, was on the point of quitting the place, wheo a mask approach. ing, began to address him with a liveliness and wit, that t left him little chance in a reply. Perceiving the impe rial embarrassment, the unknown redoubled exertionlli: r repartee followed close upon repartee; one portrait succeeded to another, as the origrinals passed, while a state secret, of no importance in itself, though startling in its repetition, occasionally whispered in. his ear, made NapoleoI1 exclaim, ' Coimnsent, diable ! Who are you, ?" The mask would laugh, anid recommence. After thus tormenting him for some half hour's space, the unknown suddenly disappeared in the crowd. The emnperor's curiosity was very strongly excited; but lie had had enough, and left the place iI no good hitumour. On arriving at the palace, he found the Empress hald retired for the night. Next morning, upon seeing Josephiine,'Well,' said lie, ' so you ,were miot at the ball last i ght 2, -' Yes, indeed.'-' Now, Josephine- !'-' I assure you T& was there. And you, mon andi' enquired the empress, with a half suppressed smile, 'what were you doingr all the evening ?'-' I was tat work in my cabinet,' said Napoleon, quite coolly. ' Oh, zluguste!' anMiswered the empress, with an arch gesture; and the whole secret was divulged. Napoleon enjoyed greatly this practical joke, which had so completely turned the tables against his owit contrivance. It appeared that the empress, disliking her first choice, had changed her costume, and despite all his precautions, recognised Napoleon by his foot and boot." A favourite amusement of Josephine and Napoleon wats a game called " l)1isoiners"-tbe same as what our schoolboys call " French and Euglisl," or " Deals." There is somethinig very striking in the account of the last opportunity they had of indulging in this relaxation: Time interval between the lath of August and the 27th of September, when the interview at Erfurtlh took place, was passed chiefly at St Cloud, and might nearly be called the last of josephine's happiness in Napoleon's society. Onlv a few days before his depart tire, Josejml1Inc and Napoleon, With their usual familiars, played a finial gamne at the favourite amusement of' plrisonters.' it was dark night before the party finished, and footmen with torches were in attendance, to give light to thme plaLyers. The effect could not have beenh without interest ; the blaze of the torches now throwing bold broad anid rich illumination upon the illustrious group as they asseinbled in front of the chateau, previous to each run, again tfilling scattere(l and flickering lights upon the lawmn, tile trees, liowe'rs, atiid rich drlesss of the ladies, as the torchbean'ers dispersed, following irregularly time course of tile runners. How closely resembling the lives of soiIe o1 the nnoblest therc,-thmis crossing, comininghligi {apl)Ca1l ing, sometimes in light, auon. in darkncss ; here, al l starting away amid brighlitness and expectation -thle1', aL figure outstripping all others, only to be lobt in gloon! But theme was then no nmoralizing ; all were joyous, and for the nmomnenit, artless, as if it had not beent a coit't. Napoleon as usual frll, though only omiec, as lie wvas runtning for .Jioselihine.

Thus ended the lat JTpetition of youthful bports." It is painful to turn to the end of this happy union, but wye cannot avoid it: " But ' the fatal day' was not to be averted. The 30th ,f November arrived, which Napoleou ;appears to have ilestined for declaring his final determination to Josephine. She had wept all day; they were to dine together as usual, and, to conceal her tears, the empress wvore a large rwhite hat, fastened under the chiii, which, wvith its deep front, shaded the whole of the utpper part of the face. Napoleon, also, had shown marks of the strongest agitationi; he scarcely spoke to any one, but, with arms folded, continued at intervals to pace his library alone; from time to time a convulsive movement, attended with a hectic flush, passed for an instant across his features, and at table, when he raised his eye, it was only to look by stealth upont the empress, with an expression of the deepest regret. The dinner was removed untouchednieither tasted a morsel, and the only use to which Napoleon turned his knife was to strike mechanically upon the edge of his glass, which. lie appeared to dlo unconsciously, and like one whose thoughts were painfully lIreoccupied. Every thing during this sad repast seemed to presage the impending catastrophe. The officers of the court, even, who were in attendance, stood in motionless expectancy, like men who look upon a sight they feel portends evil, though what they kuow not; not a sound was heard beyoiid the noise of placing and removing the untasted viands, and the monotonous tiiikling already noticed ; for the emperor spoke only once to ask at question, without giving any attention to the reply. ' We dined together as usual,' says Josephine; ' I struggled with my tear's, which, notwithstanding every effort, overflowed from iny eyes; I uttered not a single word during that -sorrowful mneal, and he broke silence but once to ask an attendamit allbout the weather. MIy sunshine, I saw, had passed away; the sitorm, burst quickly. Directly after coffee, Bonaparte dismissed every one, and I remained alone with him.' We have already described the manmier of Napoleon's taking coffee after dinner; the change which on this day first took place seemed to indicate to Josephiue that her cares were no longer indispensable to the happiness of her husband. She had risen as usual from table with Napoleon, whom she slowly followed into the saloon, and with a haiidkei'chief p>ressed tipon her mouth, to restrain the sobbing which, though inaudible, shook her whole frame. Recovering, by an effort, her self-command, Josephinte pi'epar'ed to ptour out the coffee, when. Napoleon, advancing to the paige, performed the office for himself, casting upon her a iregrarl, remarked eveni by the attcndants, aund which seeined to fall witi stunniing import, for she remained as. if stupified. The E',mperor having dr'ank, returned the cup to the page, and, by a sign, indicated his wish to be alonw, Shuttilln, with his owni hand, the door of the saloon. Iii the dininuz-roonm, 1(,aIratedl by this door, thjere remnaiucd Only the Count dle Beaumont, chief chamberlain, who colltintuid to valk anhbout itn silence, andl the fnavoalite personlal attendant of the Emperor, both expectinig sonic terrible event,-an aplprehension which was but too spocedily confirined by loud screams froin the saloon. " W\e know, from Joseph ine's owlt wor1s, ovhalt passed tluring this secret interview. ' I watchied inl tle chamiging ex-lression of his countenance, that -;truftvrl rwhic h was in his soul.

I thought reasoII had fled-I became unconscious of every thing, and on returning to my senses, found I had beei carried to my diamber.' When J osephine tI us fainted, Napoleon hastily opened the (loor of the saloon, and called to the two individuals who remained in the dining-room. The opening of the door allowed them to see the lEmpress on the tloor', insensible, yet still speaking in brokeii murmurs' Oh, no! you cannot surely do it !-you ivould not kill mc!' M\T. de Beaumont entered on a sign from his master, and lifted in his arms the hapless Josephine, now perfectly unconscious of all that was passing. The Emperor himself, taking a taper from the chimnueypiece, lighted the vay through a dark passage, whence there was a private stair to the Empress's sleepingroom. At first he had merely said, that she had had ai nervous attack, but in his increasing agitation allowed some expressions to escape whenice the Count first clearly perceived the nature of Josephine's calamity. When they had thus attained the private staircase, it appeared too steep and narrow for iAI. de Beaumont, unassisted, to attemlpt to bear the Empress downi withl safety. Napoleon thena called the keeper of the portfolio, whose (luty it was to be in constant attendance at the door of the cabinet, which also opened upon the corridor. 6;iving the taper to this attendant, and directing lhimn to precede, the Emperor himself supported Josephinie's limnbs, and descending last, the party thus attained the door of her bedroomn. Here Napoleon dismissed both his compaantions, and, laying the Empress on the bed, rang for her women, who, on entering, found him hangingr over her 'with. an expression of the deepest anxiety." Josephine comumands our admiration yet more after hier' return to private life, thantii u11o01n the thr'one. She attriliuted to her lokd-and justly-.a yet bigher degree of morIal thuta ot'ph)lysical courage. But if ever thle power of grentle, mirepin ing enduratice-that characteristic in lwhich the partial -superiority of the feniale over the inale is mriost deeply felt-were evinced with true sublimity, it was inl her owiv case. e I enceforwardl Josephine's life was passed alternately at .Malinaison m141il Navarr'e, and glidini g away il an equal tenor of benevolent exei'tion aIId lega iat eImploymeneIt, offers but f'ew iicidleidts. A description ol one dayt is the accoumit of fil. The vill L of MahltnaisoiI, to whichl she first retiiC(l, fromn its vicinity to Paris, might be regarded as hter residence of ceremony. Here she received the visit~i, almost the homge,-(, td the memnber's of the court of N-apoleoii and Alaria Louisa ; for it was quickly discovered, that however unpleasarnt they inight beI to her ntew rival], sIuch visiti wVere, ieconmendations to tile nijeior'Os favour. A little utter nine these receptionis took place, and Ifrom the visitors of the mlolr1i'if wCeI' IetiIeId, 01r psreviously invited, :some ten or twelve giests, to break. fast at eleven. From tlce persona;ges prlesenjt being always among the most distiniguished in Parisian -society, and appearing only in uif'ornm or official costumne, these morninai lpalrtics were equallly agreeable and brillimit. A.fter breakfast, thC cmpr ess adJoutmied to time saloon, wvhmere she coumversed for about an hour, or walked inj the delighitlul gallery cadjoitiin, which. contained many of the mnasterpieces of painting and sculpture. Of these, a few wvere mncient, but the greater lUmber were the wvorks oflivinjg artists, the most distinguished of whom were not without obligatiotis to the patronage of Josephi;ie; and Ihile i I o.1, G im'odet, G ttrinl, with their pencils, Spontilli, Mehul, I'.tr, Boieldieu, witih thmeir voice o1r Iye, JlFitalies, ArminaIt, A Idrieu, LemeIrcier', wVith. theirl pen 01 coniIVersatwiol, amld Caiiova with bis chisel, adorned tile gallery or the parties oif Mdlaison, they ranked aIolinge the persoijal fricndlt of the miztrmus of the rctreat. The ar rival of tho A carriages was the signal for the departure of the morning visitors; and after a drive of a couple of hours in the park, the empress and her suite retired to dress for dinner, to which never less than from twelve to fifteen strangers sat down. The evening passed in amusement, conversation, aud music, and was always very gay, owving to the number of visitors from Paris. At eleven, tea, ices, and sweetmeats, there served, and at midnight the empress retired. The apartments in which these reunions took place were elegant and spacious, the furniture being covered with needlework, on a ground of white silk, wrought by the empress and her ladies; but the residence altogether was small, an inconvenience still farther increased through Josephine's veneration of every thing that had been Napoleon's. The apartment which he had occupied remained exactly as he had left it; she would not suffer even a chair to be moved, and indeed very rarely permitted any one to enter, keeping the key herself, and dusting the articles with her own hands. On the table was a volume of history, with the page doubled down. where he had finished reading; beside it lay a pen, with the ink dried on the point, and a map of the world, on which he was accustomed to point out his plans to those in his confidence, and which still showed on its surface many marks of his impatience ;.these Josephine would not allow to be touched on any account. By the wall stood Napoleon's camp-bed, without curtains; and above continued to bang such of his arms as he had placed there. On different pieces of furniture were flung various portions of apparel, just as he had used them last, for among his other extraordinary ways, he had a practice, on retiring to rest, of flinging, rather than taking off his clothes, casting down a coat here, a vest there, usually pitching his watch into the bed, and his hat and shoes into the farthest corner of the apartment." Last scene of all: " All these grievances preyed upon Josephine's spirits, but without producing any appearance of disease, till the 4th of May, when she dined at St Leu Faith Hortense, Eugene, and the Emperor of Russia. On returning to M almaison, she felt a general uneasiness, which, however, yielded to some gentle medicine, and the empress resumed her ordinary occupations, though evidently without the usual enjoyment. Some days after, Lord Beverley, with his two sons, breakfasted at Malmaison, and to this nobleman Josephine expressed herself warmly on the generosity of the English, who at that time, she said, alone spoke of Napoleon in a becoming manner. She complained bitterly of the ingratitude of those who, not satisfied with abandoning his falling fortunes, overwhelmed his memory with calumny. On the 10th, Alexander, with several distinguished foreigners, dined at Malmaison. Josephine, despite a headach and cold shiverings, which she laboured to conceal, did the honours of the table, and in the evening attempted even to take a part in a game of ' prisoners!' on the beautiful lawun in front of her residence. How many painful associations must have connected themselves with this amusement! Both mind and body unfitted her for such exercise, and she wvas con. strained to become a spectator, but with such an altered appearance as to excite the alarm of her guests. To these anxious enquiries, however, she continued to reply with a faint smile, which belied the assurance ' that she was only fatigued, and would be well to-morrow.' To-morrowv came, but Josephine wvas evidently worse; and for fourteen days her complaint, without assuming any definite form, or rendering absolute confinement necessary, was frequently attended at night with fainting, aind sometimes a wandering of the' mind, more from anxiety than delirium. On'the 24th, the empress had a slight attack of sore throat, but otherwise rallied so much, as to insist on receiving the Emperor of Russia amld the King) of Prussia. woho were engaged to dine with her on th ,\at . SIA,,{ it dc.Cordtsvivy t1' ', butt X forced to retire, and Hortense, who never left Malmaisoi during her mother's illness, took her place at table. Thenceforward the disease assumed a most alarming cha. racter of gangrenous quinsy, and its progress became fearfully rapid. On the morning of the 25th, Alexander returned, and], filled with anxiety at the alteration in Josephine's appearance, requested permission to send his owvn physician. This the empress declined; but from that day she was attended by her own, and the two physicians attached to the households of her sotl anal daughter. On the night of the 26-27th, a blister was applied between the shoulders, and sinapisms to the feet; but though these gave some relief from pain, they effected no impression on the disease. Still Josephine, with the same angelic swveetness which had marked her whole life, endeavoured, by concealing her suffering, to soothe the anxiety of her surrounding friends. From the morning of the 26th, she appears to have been perfectly sensible of her danger; for looking then steadily upon the phy. sician, and perceiving his alarm, she silently pressed his hand in token of consciousness and acquiescence. She even took an interest in her former occupations and on the 27th, when informed that the celebrated flower-painter Redoubt6 had come to draw two fiavourite plants in flower, she sent for him, extended her hand, then pushed him gently away, saying, ' You must not catch my sore throat, for next week' (this -was on Wednesday) ' I hope to see you advanced with a fresh masterpiece.' The preceding night had passed in a lethargic sleep, and at ten in the morning of the 28th, the physicians, after consulting, deemed it proper to prepare Eugene and IIHitense for the final change. From those two cherished beings, whom she had loved so truly, Josephine heard a communication which thus lost all its I bitterness. With pious resignation, she received the last [ rites of the itomish faith fiom the ministration of her grandchildren's preceptor, for the parish clergyman of Ruel happened to be absent. Late on the same day, the Emperor Alexander arrived, and was shown into the chamber of the sufferer, now evidently approaching the goal of all her sorrows. By the bed of their mother knelt Eugene and IHortense, too deeply moved to address the emperor; but at sight of a monarch whom she regarded with gratitude, Josephine seemed to acquire renewed strength, made a sign for all to approach, and said,-' At least I shall (lie regretted; I have always desired the happiness of France; I did all in my power to contribute to it; and I can say with truth to all of you now present at my last moments, that the first wife of Napoleon never caused a single tear to flow.' These were her last words, for she fell immediately after into a slumber, which continued, interrupted by a scarcely audible sigh, till halfpast eleven on the morning of the 29th of MIay, wvhen her gemitle spirit calmly passed to a world of love and peace." We began with some notion that we would attempt a profound and critical appreciation of Josephine's real merit. Her fascinations have been too much for uswe could as soon attempt to criticise the woman we love.

Princess Napraxine. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. By Ouida. 3 vols. (Chatto & Windus.) Through Lusty Corners. By the Author of 'Churns: a Tale of the Queen's Navy.' 3 vols. (Tinsley Brothers.) Under the Lilies and Roses. By Florence Marryat. 3 vols. (White & Co.) Giordano Bruno. By C. E. Plumptre. 2 vols. (Chapman & Hall.) A continual dropping will wear away a rock, and persistent criticism seems to be really producing some effect upon Ouida. Her notion of a nice sort of story to tell is still a little peculiar, and she seems still to have a certain contempt for love that does not involve adultery. But, at any rate, if she brings a loving husband and a faithful wife to untimely ends in the interest of the more "romantic" hero and heroine, she does offer some little meed of rather supercilious approbation to the good qualities of the victims. The poor ignorant Russian noble ? faithful after his own fashion to the shallow and, under a mask of coldness, sensual wife who despises him, and for whom, knowing that she has no love for him, he lays down his life rather than permit the least slur on her reputation?is a sufficiently touching figure; and there is nature about the Baron Friederich Othmar, the hardened old financier, whose heart, after a life of intriguing and moneymaking, opens for the first time before the innocence of the girl whom his nephew has married not because he really loves her, but to spite another woman. So far we may compliment Ouida upon a slight improvement in her characters. Also she has paid attention to smaller matters. French phrases are more sparingly used, and with unwonted correctness, though she sometimes avoids them only by means of literal rendering into English, with such odd results as " rose - laurels" for "rhododendrons," and "fulminant apoplexy." Whence she gets such an odd form as "tube-rose" she herself may know; not, we should suppose, from tubereuse. She retains her partiality for the letter Ic, writing "Krimea" and "Kossack"; and evinces her contempt for the pedantries of history and geography by stating incidentally that " the young Louis Napoleon " was " killed at Isandula," and talking of " a kingdom the size of Morocco or Montenegro," as if they were much the same thing. But on the whole she has chastened her style. ' Through Dusty Corners ' is not an easy book to describe. It is written by some one who knows his way about the world?probably, as it purports, by a naval captain " in the forties "; but, if so, the author can navigate a ship better than he can tell a love story. Jack ashore is not always so clumsy as Capt. Norris seems to have been by his own account. The sailor in actual life makes the most of his opportunities because he never knows whether his next voyage may not be his last, whereas Capt. Norris knew very well that he had three volumes at his service, and that he might safely spin a long yarn before the last chapter was reached. The yarn has many vicissitudes, which are told with much spirit, and the interest aroused by them is greater than the author contrived to infuse into his " Tale of the Queen's Navy." In that tale, if the memory of the present writer serves, there was more action than interest; but here the two are well combined. The narrative is better worth reading, and some passages are both touching and dramatic. The stiffness wears off as the plot is developed, and though this story cannot be ranked high as a work of art it is still in many respects a readable and satisfactory novel. If Mrs. Lean is to be believed, we may meet with very repulsive secrets under " the lilies and roses " of society. The superficial arrangement of flowers is very shallow in the present case, and on the whole a coarse subject has been coarsely treated. The young lady who falls in love with the married admirer of another man's wife is, of course, represented as all that is maidenly and healthy of spirit?a lily in fact; but Ruthven is certainly no flower of purity. While on terms of intimacy with Lady Swansdown, perhaps the father of some of her children, and being further burdened with a wife, he makes hot love to Viola Rayne, and, when that young lady has sufficient self-respect to reject his advances, plunges into promiscuous dissipation to revenge himself upon her. This chivalrous character is the hero of the book, and, on the death of the drunken drab his wife, is rewarded with the hand of the affectionate and forgiving heroine. There is plenty of vigour in the narration of this touching story; the blunt brutality of the ladies of fashion is quite in accordance with the subject-matter. How vivid the portrait of an elderly beauty as "an old ewe dressed lamb-fashion "! how naive the compliment paid by " Lady Pat" to the men: " How nice you look ! I should like to eat you." But we nc ed not multiply instances. The days are, it is to be feared, gone by when an historical personage could be made the hero of a novel. Even when the world was ignorant and the historical novel was in its primo, it was more usual to make the interest of the story centre in an imaginary hero, whose fate could not be foreseen from the first, and Mr. Besant in his new novel has in a large measure followed this plan. Now that everybody knows all about everybody that ever lived, a writer who attempts to make a novel out of the fortunes of some real man who once walked the earth is terribly handicapped. Nothing, indeed, can save him, unless it be a very effective style or a gift of vivifying the past so as to show the kinship of human nature in all ages. These qualifications the author of ' Giordano Bruno' does not possess. The style would be bald in a guide-book or a history of philosophy. Indeed, there are passages which tempt the reader to believe that the author began by writing a paper on Bruno, and that the fictitious form was due to an afterthought. Tako, for example, such a sentence as this:? "Notwithstanding the warm, enthusiastic manner in which he speaks of Elizabeth and her Court, and his evident gratitude for the kindness he received there, / cannot but think that his visita were very infrequent." If the book is a novel, the author should at least make a semblance of certainty as to the hero's doings. For this very reason, the opening chapters, describing Bruno's boyhood, which are avowedly pure imagination, and the account of his end, as to which the documents give plenty of information, are the best parts of the book. Where scanty facts have to be eked out by conjecture, the process is too evident to allow of either an attractive novel or a satisfactory biography. It would have been far better had the author boldly taken the latter course. Bruno is a sufficiently interesting figure to make his life worth recording in a popular form, though readers of the ' Candelaio' may be permitted to doubt whether he was altogether the pure-minded, almost saintly enthusiast of science who is here represented. As it is, the author is probably right in thinking that " the story will find more readers amongst those who are interested in the life and times of Bruno, than with ordinary novel-readers "; and such are few and far between, nor, we fear, will the present attempt do much to increase their number. Digressions, such as occur frequently, on all conceivable subjects?the Broad Church clergy, the effect of marriage on intellectual development, and the like? are equally out of place in novel or biography. Careful readers will also be deterred by repeated slips in accuracy, which extend even to the quotations of tho titles of Bruno's works. ' De Imaginum ' and 4 Delle Sette Arti Libretti' are combinations of words which would be impossible to any one who was really familiar with either of the languages in which ho wrote; and they can hardly be due to the printer.

The SWr of Baum. By Katharine Tynan. (Smith, Elder & Co.)7 'THEz STORY OF BAWN' is in Mrs. Hinkson'sjfamiliar Irish vein, pleasant, easy, flowing over the surface of life. There is the " nice " girl, who on this occasion is her own chronicler, and records the lovemakings that seem so easily to beset these heroines. The trusty hound and the faithful Irish servants are also portrayed with the usual touches of kindness and knowledge. We notice that the use of " shall " and " will " is still a difficulty, if not with the author, at least with her characters. But this on Irish soil is to be expected. Troubles, some rather of a trifling sort, crop up in the course of the tale, but only to be swept away. The story closes with three weddings and a comfortable progress down the hill of life for the much tried and attached old pair, the grandparents of " Bawn " herself.

The Youzm Franc-Tireurs and their Adventures in the Eranco- Prussian War. Bv Gi. A. IiENTY, special correspuilutllL of the Standard. London: Griffith and Yarran, corner o0 St. Paul's Churchyard. 1872. Mr. Henty in this neat volume has turned to good account his experiences as a special correspondent during the late war. His story deals with the marvellous adventures of two English lads resident in France at the time that war broke out, and who enrolled themselves as privates in a small company of Franc-Tireurs raised at Dijon; after some slight skirmishes with the Uhlans they first distinguish themselves by going as spies to Saverne, where their knowledge of English enables them to gain information as to the plans of the German commanders, which they in consequence are able to frustrate. They subsequently join the corps under General Cambriels, are taken prisoners, escape from Mayence in a somewhat doubtful mnnner, and are finally selected by Gambetta to carry despatches through the German lines to Paris. In order to effect this, they disguise themselves as German Jews, and succeeded in entering the besiegers' camp, on pretence of purchasing or conveying to Germany the various spoils of war "saved" by the Prussian officers; eventually swim across the Seine on a snowy night, and are picked up by a French gunboat, just as they are on the point of perishing from the intense cold. Arrived in Paris they'receive the cross of the legion of honour from General Trochu, and leave again in a balloon, in order to be present at the expected advance of General D'Aurelles from Orleans. The balloon is nearly blown into. the Atlantic, but the boys eventually get down safely and are in time to join in the gallant series of actions which General Chanzy fought to stay the advance of the Duke of Mecklenburg, and which culminated in the final catastrophe at Le Mans. It will be seen from the above rhsurn that the adventures are of the most startling kind, though Mr. Henty, in his preface, says that many of them were described to him by those who took part in them, and that nearly every fact and circumstanceactuallyoccurred according tohis own knowledge. We mayhowever, fairly doubt whether two lads under sixteen could have gone through all the hardships described or whether such extraordinary feats could have been performed by the same individuals. The events described, too, are so fresh in our memories, that the interest of the story somewhat suffers, especially as the Franc-Tireurs, as a rule, showed themselves in no very estiniable light. Mr. Henty, however, writes vigorously, and with considerable graphic power, though his soldiers and peasants lack the local colour such as MM. Erckmann-Chatrian suc- ceed so well in imparting, andhis sketches of the more prominent leaders are very slight. The book is nicely illustrated by Mr. Landells, of the Illustrated London News. We notice, by the way, that the sketch of the " Fight in the Wood," at p. 145, moreproperlybelongs to an earlier chapter; and a thaleris stated to be worth two shillings only, instead of three.

- iterare lRebidr. Mfnoirs of the Late Mrs. Robinson, 'written by her- self, (witb some' Posthumogs Pieces. In four volumes. Hurst. l. iS. i T HIS, though a very dear, yet may be -proT nounced an entertaining work. The subject of the Memoirs was on various accounts a cele. brated character. Her personal beauty, and her extraordinary talents, were well known and admired. Her misfortunes also, and her connection with a certain great personage, served to heighten her celebrity. She is now, however, gone to that " bourne whence no traveller returns." Peace be to her departed spirit. This singular woman passed through a variety of, stripge scenes-hence her memoir interests our sensibility, and, holds forth many lessons of instruction to the female world. Neither talents nor charms can, without prudence, ensure our felicity. The ist volume, with a few pages of the second, contains the Menioirs of Mrs.-Robitison, drawn up; by herself-in the remaining part of the second the life is finished by another hand, probably that of her daughter's. The 3d includes her prose piecu viz. the Sylphid and Jasper, together with the Savage of Aveyron, in poetry. . The last volume is made up of poetical pieces, particularly, the Progress of Liberty, in two books-and, Tributary Lines, addressed to her by different friends. Such are the contents of the work. They certainly might have been compiied in a much smaller compass--. but there were ends to answ.Ner-and care, -e apprehend, has been taken that these ends should be answered. We must,' however, confess that our curickity has been gratified. Mrs. Robinson was born in l759, at Bristolher father, an eminent merchant there, was unsuccessful in . trade-she was married before sixteenher busband, by profession an attorney, wasunfortunate, and she lived with him for some time in prison-she had recourse to the stage for subsist-: ence, andt wonderfully succeeded-here the Prince. of Wales became enamoured of her, but with him she lived little more than a year; he allowed her 5ool. a year for life, and a moiety to the daughter -she afterwards lived. for sixteen years with General Tarleton; with him, and on his account, she caught a cold, that took away the use of her limbs, which she never recovered-she died on the 26th of December, -Soo, of a dropsy in her chest, and was buried in the churchyard of old Windsor, agreeable to her own xequest. A monument is in contemplation, and poetical tributes of respect have been paid to her mnemnory I Her character was certainly mixed -but her temptations were great and numerous. Her matrimonial connection was in the first place upfortu-nate, and paved- the way to her subsequent deviations from the path of rectitude. Of this circumstance she appears fully apprised, and sincerely re-. grets. Personal beauty is a snare-and often leads to an extreme degree of distress. From this biographical sketch, however, the superior advantages of virtue are evinced-it is the on-dy sure parent of a rational peace, and of a pure felicity.

Tvelve Years a Slave. Narrative of Solomon Northup, a Citizen of New York, Kidnapped in Washington City in 1841, and Rescued in 1853 from a Cotton Plantation near the Red River in Louisiana. Low & Co. This work is called by its writer another Key to the prose Iliad of Negro life in the United States,?but it is less a key than a commentary. We find little of the spirit of Uncle Tom in Solomon Northup,?the uncomplaining patience and the forgiveness of enemies so prominent in the character of his romantic model. His wrath and his impatience under wrong rather suggest the sturdier nature of the Saxon than the mild temper of the African. By his own confession, nothing save the certainty that it would end in defeat prevented him from heading an insurrection against the whites. After describing one such failure, nnd its terrible consequences to the coloured people, he says:? 44 Dating tbe Mexican war 1 well remember the extravagant hopes that were excited. The news of victoiy filled the great house with rejoicing, but produced only sorrow and disappointment in the cabin. In my opinion?and 1 have had opportunity to know something of the feeling of which I speakthere are not fifty slaves on the shores of Bayou Bceuf, but would hail with unmeasured delight the approach of an invading army. They are deceived who flatter themselves that the ignorant and debased slave has no conception of the magnitude of hw wrongs. They are deceived who imagine that he arises from his knees, with back lacerated and bleeding, cherishing only a spirit of meekness and forgiveness. A day may come?it will come, if his prayer is heard?ii teriihle day of vengeance, when the master in hb turn will cry in vain for mercy." ?This kind of threat, though wc cannot say it is unnatural under all the circumstances of the case, is mischievous and unwise. What provocation the writer had received, our readers shall hear in his own words. We need only premise that he was born a free man,?his father having received his freedom at the death of an old master. Mr. Northup was walking about the streets of Saratoga, the fashionable watering-place for New York pleasure seekers : " On the corner of Congress street and Broadway, I was met by two gentlemen of respectable appearance, both of whom were entirely unknown to me. I have the impression that they were introduced to me by some one of my acquaintances, but who, I have in vain endeavoured to recall, with the remark that I was an expert player on the violin. At any rate, they immediately entered into conversation on that subject, making numerous enquiries touching my proficiency in that respect. My responses being to all appearances satisfactory, they proposed to engage my services for a short period, stilting, at the same time, I was just such a person as their business required. Their names, as they afterwards gave them to me, were Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton. * * They were connected, as they informed me, with a circus company, then in the city of Washington; that they were on their way thither to rejoin it, having left it for a short time to make an excursion northward, for the purpose of seeing the country, and were paying their expenses hy an occasional exhibition. They also remarked that they had found much difficulty in procuring music for their entertainments, and that if I would accompany them as far as New York, they would give me one dollar for each day's services, and three dollars in addition for every night I played at their performances,besides sufficient to ray the expenses of my return from New York to Saratoga. I at once accepted the tempting offer, both for the reward it promised, and from a desire to visit the metropolis. They were anxious to leave immediately. Thinking my absence would be brief, I did not deem it necessary to write to Anne whither I had gone; in fact supposing that .my return, pethaps, would be as soon as hers. So inking a change of linen and my violin, I was ready ?ito depart. The carriage was brought round?a covered one, drawn hy a pair of noble bays, altogether forming an elegant establishment. Their baggage, consisting of three large trunks, was fast tened on the rack, and mounting to the driver's Seat^ while they took their places in the rear, I drove away from Saratoga on the road to Albany, elated with my new position, and happy as I had ever been, on any day in all my life. * * They hurried forward, and in due course of time, we reached New York, taking lodgings at a house on the west side ofthe city, in a street running from Broadway to the river. 1 supposed my journey was at an end, and expected in a day or two at least, to return to my friends and family at Saratoga. Brown and Hamilton, however, began to importune me to continue with them in Washington. They alleged that immediately on their arrival, now that the summer season was approaching, thc circus would set out for the north. They promised me a situation and high wages if I would accompany them. Largely did they expatiate on the advantage; that would result to me, and Buch wcrethe flattering representations they mode, that I finally concluded to accept the offer. * * The next d?y after our arrival in New York, we crossed the ferry to Jersey City, and took the road to Philadelphia. Here we remained one night, continuing our journey towards Baltimore early in the morning. In due time, we arrived in the latter city, and stopped at a hotel near the railroad depot, either kept by a Mr. Rathbone, or known as the Rathbone House. All the way from New York, their anxiety to reach the circus seemed to grow more and more intense. Wc left the carriage at Baltimore, and entering the curs, proceeded to Washington, at which place we ari ived just at nightfall, the evening previous to the funeral of General Harrison, and stopped at Pennsylvania Avenue. After supper they called me to their apartments, and paid me forty-three dollars, a sum greater than my wages amounted to, which act of generosity was in consequence, they said, of their not having exhibited as often as they had given me to anticipate, during our trip from Saratoga. * * The next day there was a great pageant in Washington. * * My friends, several times during the afternoon, entered drinking saloons, and called for liquor. They were by no means in the habit, however, so far as I knew them, of indulging to execs?. On these occasions, after serving themselves, they would pour out a glass and hand it to me. I did not become intoxicated, as may be inferred from what subsequently occurred. Towards evening, and soon after partaking of one of these potations, I began to experience most unpleasant sensations. 1 felt extremely ill. My head commenced aching?a dull, heavy pain, inexpressibly disagreeable. At the supper table, I was without appetite; the sight and flavour of food were nauseous. About dark the same servant conducted me to the room I had occupied the previous night. Brown and Hamilton advised me to retire, commiserating me kindly, and expressing hopes that I would be better in the morning. Divesting myself of coat and boots merely, I threw myself upon the bed. It was impossible to sleep. The pain in my head continued to increase, until it became almost unbearable. In a short time I became thirsty. My lips were parched. I could think of nothing but water?of lakes and flowing rivers, of brooks where I had stopped to drink, and of the dripping bucket, rising with its cool and overflowing nectar, from the bottom of the well. Towards midnight, as near as I could judge, I arose, unable longer to bear such intensity of thirst. I was a stranger in the house, and knew nothing of its apartments. There was no one up, as I could observe. Groping about at random, 1 knew not where, I found the way at last to a kitchen in the basement. Two or three coloured servants were moving through it, one of whom, a woman, gave me two glasses of water. It afforded momentary relief, but by the time I bad nav lied my room again, the same burning desire of drink, the same tormenting thirst, had again returned, lt was even more torturing than before, as was nlso the wild pain in my head, if such a thing could be. I was in pore distress?in most excruciating agony! I teemed to j stand on the brink of madness! Thc memory of that night of horrible suffering will follow me to the grave. In the course of an hour or more after my return from the kitchen, I was conscious of some one entering my roof). There seemed to be several?a mingling of various voices,?but how many, or who they were, I cannot tell. Whether Brown and Hamilton were among them, is a mere matter of j. conjecture. I only remember, with any degree of l distinctness, that 1 was told it was necessary to go to a physician and procure medicine, and that pulfing j on my boots, without coat or hat, I followed them through a long passage-way, or alley, into the open street. It ran out at right angles from Pennsylvania Avenue. On the oppesite side there was a light burning in a window. My impression is there were then three persons with me, but it is altogether indefinite and vague, and like the memory of a painful dream. Going towards the light, which I imagined proceeded from a physician's office, and which seemed to recede as I advanced, is the last glimmering recollection I can now recall. From that moment I was insensible. How long I remained in that condition?whether only that night, or many days and nights?I do not know; but when consciousness returned, I found myself alone, in utter darkness, and in chains." That a machinery for the kidnapping of free and innocent men should exist in the midst of railways and electric telegraphs, is one of those anomalies of civilization in the nineteenth century which it will puzzle future generations to understand. On the whole, this book of adventures is well written:?but how far the skill displayed is to be credited to the Negro, how far to the sensible and humane editor, we have no means of ascertaining.

REVIEW OF NEW BOOKSO Travels through the interior Province of Caf-I hambi 1. By COL. J. P. IIA'MILTON , latea Chief Commissioner from his Britannic Majesty to the Republic of Columbia 2 vols. 8vo. pp. 588. London, 1 827. Murray. N\E nev er feel more, as citizens of the world, than when looking for tidintzs from South America Tile idea of distance is annihilated in the deep and fervent interest we take in her strugfgles from slavery to independence, and from independence to constitutional security. Interesting in every point of view, for her immense wealth and the rank which nature has given her among the nations of the world, we look on this quarter of the globe as the mighty cradle of humarn energy, and the nursery of powers that shall one day subdue and possess the earth. We unite in our imaginations, when thinking of her future destinies, the pomp of old Assyria. and the fairy wvonders of Arabia, with the highest achievements and triumphs of emancipated humanity. That there will be a long and fearful struzgle before liberty can free herself from the slough of birotry.-that many years must pass away before the nations of the south will be independent in themselves as wvell as of their masters,-and that the genius and devotedness of many successive patriots must be employed before their triumph will he complete, not a doubt can be induloed. Nations, by one bold and desperate effort, may free themselves fromi slavery; but it is only the progression of free opinion that can make them feel and understand what independence is. South America, if she prosper in establishing her liberty, must, in her succeeding destinies, influence the destiny of the world; and we look on the revolutions in her governments as the prelude to a new order of thin gs,-as the preparation of a change in the policy, the condition, and relation, of European as well as transatlantic nations Nothing is more wonderful in the history of mankind than the past condition of South America. That centuries should have elapsed before she felt her power,-that generations of men should have passed away, before her people awoke in their bondage,-and that when she did arise, and her children shook off their burden, that both she herself and other countries should have appeared to doubt whether she might be free or not; that such should have been the case with a country Possessing such prodigious wealth and so many other advantages as South America, is a strange and fearful demonstration of the truth, that nature is fallen and palsied in her energies, and must slumber, whatever be her giant strength, till the omnipotent voice of Providence wake her into action. After the work of M1. (le Humboldt, succeeding writers have little niew to say regarding the internal state or resources of the South American nations. We expect, however, from every traveller something more than the gossip of the passage or descriptions CF scenery; and althoulgh Colonel I lamilton's book contains much that is interesting, both to the naturalist and general reader, we are compelled to say that the style of his hook, its levity, and careless arrangement, are More characteristic of a fortnight's tourist in Paris, than of a traveller among the infant republics of America. Wre shall endeavour to give our readers the passages -which have struck us as the most interestingr, amioncg which is the following account of BIolivar:'Durino' my residence in Colombia, the President Bolivar was in Peru, commanding the independent army composed of Columbian and Peruvian troops opposed to the Spanish army under the command of the Viceroy La Cerne and General Canteiac. I regretted exceedingly not having had the good fortune to be personally acquainted with IBolivar, who is, at this titne, without any disparagement to other highly gifted men in America, the greatest man and most extraordinary character which the New Wsv 'orld lhas ever produced. Bolivar is descended from one of the oldest Spanish £~niiies in Caraccas termed " Miantuanoes," to show that they are linieally descenldled from the Sp)anish %warriors who accompanied Cortes, Pizarro, Gonsalvo de Ximines, and other chiefs, in their conquest of TMexico, Peru, Columbia, Chili, &c. Bolivar is about forty-one years of age. I have been told that he looks considerably older, from the great fattigues and various privations he has undergone in his numerous campai(rns in South America. In person, Bolivar is small but muscular, and well made, ancd able to go throucrh astonishin(g fatigues, which I have heard confirmed by one his aides-de-camp and Colonel Santa Maria, who, with others of Bolivar's staff, had frequently been left behind by their chief, in his long and tedious journeys over the mountains and vast plains of Columbia and Pertu. The eyes of Blolivar are very dark, large, full ofI fire and penetration, and denote energy of mind and greatness of soul; his nose is aquiline and wvell formed, his face rather long and prematurely furrowed by care and anxiety; his complexion sallow. In society, B3olivar is lively in his inanner, fu.ll of anecdote and conversation ; he possesses the happy knack, like Bonaparte, of rea(ling at once a man's character, and placing him in a situationl where his talents and abilities will prove most useful to the country. One great and rare virtue belonging to the character of Bolivar is his thorough disinterestedness, and the little regard hie pays to himself under the most severe privations, always anxious to share what lhe has with his companions in arms, even to his last shirt. To confirm this, it will not be amiss to relate an anecdote of him, told me by another of his aides-de-camp. ' Soon after his entry into lBogota'. after the defeat of the Spaniards at lBojaca, he gave a grand entertainment to many of the first families of the place; and just before dinner, an English colonel arrived. Bolivar looking at him, said, "1 my good and brave colonel, what a dirty shirt you have on for this grand dinner; how happens it?" The colonel replied, " he was really very sorry, but to confess the truth, it was the only shirt he had."' On hearing which Bolivar laughed, and senC{ ing for his major-domo, desired him to give the colonel one of his Shirts; the man hesitated, and remained lookilg at the general; when lie again said rather impatiently, "why don't you go as I desire you, the dinner will soon be on the table." The major-domo stammered out, " your excellency has but two Shirts, one is on your back, the other in the wash." This made Bo ivar and the colonel laugh heartily; the former renarking, jokingly, "the Spaniards retreated so quickly from us, my dear colonel, that I have been obliged to leave rly heavy baggage in the rear." It is a well known, fact that B3olivar is. at this time, a poorer man than when first the civil war broke out. Ile had then some of the finest estates in the neighbourhood of Caraccas, cultivated by slaves, producing excellent cocoa, tobacco, indigo, &c. lie gave Iliberty to almost all his slaves, making only ione condition, that they should not serve Iagainst the cause of independence. AMost of the Negroes entered into the Columbian service, and proved excellentsoldiers. 'I3olivar's determined perseverance under the most disheartening circumstances; his skill, ability, anld dexterity in amalgamating the different materials which now form tie state of Columbia; his courage and coolness in action, and his prudence and foresight la seizing instantaneously all the advantages to be derived from victory, cannot be too much admired; and leave the great Bolivar supere~nrnent over all others in the Temple of lFamne. No main ever yet existed, how great soever the qualities of his mind, who had not somne foibles to throw a certain degree of shade over the more brilitant parts of his character. B3olivar is rather h.rtv in his temper, and frequentlv, on these occasions, makes use of intemperate expressions, for which he i afterwards extremely sorry, and anxious to make atonement to the person %-lhose feelings may ha e een woundt( in these tinguarded momeonts.

D)ancirn is one(, of hlis favourite amusements whilh ei? j)erflirms gracefully; and onl tlhee oecasillls, I am told, the hero reaps a plentiful harvest of sniles from the Anmericaln beautiets. The liberator, as he is called, is a man of gallantry, an(l has the credit of being very Successf 1. Bolivar is a widower, wvithout Ch)ildren; he was married at Aladrid wIhen young, to a dau-lgter of the MA.Larquis of U-lsuturon. ITe speaks French an1d Italian w aell, havino residled in those countries; also a little F n'lish, in which lhe has imlproved of late years, by having always had on his personal staff one or two English oflicers and an EDnglish medical mzan. ' Bolivar has escaped assassination on several occasions in quite a miraculous manner. During his residence at Kingston, in Jamaica, he changed his lodoing for one in a cooler situation, to which he intended to remove his bed the next day, but alteiing Ills pan, lie remained there that night, leaving his hammock suspended in his former abode. This his secretary took possession of, and was stabbed to the heart in the Bigrht. The assassin was apprehended, and proved to be a young black, whom Bolivar had dismissed from Ills service. The wretch was hanged for the offence, b)ut remainsed firm and obstinate in refusinc, to disclose the names of the persons who had instigated him to the conmmnission of the crime ; but it was gernerally supposed at the time that some of the Spanish agents were at the bottom of this nefarious act. 'On another occasion, in one of his campaigns near St. Jose, a Columbian colonel deserted to the enemy, and offered, the same night, to conduct a party of Spaniards to Holivar's tent discruised as Creole troops, with the object of either shooting himin or takino him prisoner. The offer was accepte(l by Alurillo, and the detachment reached the head-quarters without difficulty. Colonel Lopez, the deserter, had the countersign for the nigh1t of the Columbian army, and he stated to one of the president's staff thwat lie had somclurmg of importance to communicate to him resjpectinc an intended movement of the enemy, wvhich lie had just obtained from a deserter. The officer replied, that lie would immediately go to Ceneral lBolivar's tent amid acquaint hilm % ith the circunmssance: on which Colonel Lopez and his party rushed on, and when within a few yards of the tent, fired a volley through it, took to flioht, and esc-Tped under cover of the darkness of thlle ialt. Providentially Bolivar had quitted his tent twvo or tli:ee Illin.uteS previously, and was a I few yards in the rear when the firing took place. This caumsed a general alhaerr and nmuich confusion for the nmonenrt, the troops *(Yt untder ati is, si ip)osingl it w;as a night attac'K of t1he Spaniards : ad( oil examination of Bolivar's cot, it was fourid that three or four holes h1ad perforated it, so that lhe munist hlaive been inevitably killed or severely i wo (ili i]A( 1:had ihe [ee there. Bolivar's last e>cape from a;sl;rasination was at lji m1at, in Peru, dutring, the witinter of 1' (1 2 4 A Pcruvian coloni-1 w%-as found mur(leedl in the street at tijujita n.1d the mnianc!lette (or long klnife) buriced to thie hilt in his body. The kniif' was brouLght to B3olivar the I next (lJay, wvho observed, on examinifng it closely, thait it h.al been recently sharpened. ()1 rei narkihg tl,, lie gave an order that all the cuitlers should be brouLght to his quarters as quickly as possible. On being(T examnlled separate!y, oWle cuLtler stated that a black had been to his shop the preceding (lay to get two long knives sharpened, and that he should certainly know the man if hie saw him agal in. (;eneral Bolivar then directed small military vatroles to paradle the streets, and take upl) all the blacks as recruits for some of the corps, and when these were shovwni to the cutler, lie soon recogllzed the Negro wh-io had been at his shop to have the knives sharpened. The black acknowledgred that he had stabbed the colonel, and thaltt the other knife h ad been sharpened for General Bolivar's major-domo to assassinate his master, an-d that it would be found concealed in the sleeve of the stewvard's coat. This proved to be the case, but the major-domo's resolution had failed him when about to commit the horrid act. This was the story as related at Hogoift., and it as ad1ded that the parties hald been instigated to this diabolical treachery by some of thie royalists. ' I trust that Bolivar's risks and dancgers are now nearly over : the Spaniards no longer possess an inch of groulndl in all South Armerica, excepting Callao, wlich has beezi nobly defended by their genrcnal, Rodit; but want of )roviSionS must oblige this place to surrender at last. The Sjpaniards had not a single rnan-of-wvar in the 1l'cific, and were under great apprehensions at this time of an attack on the islands of Cuba and PortoRico, from the comibined forces of Mlexico an(l (olumbia. About this timne, Bolivar, proveed to the world his disinterestedness by refusing a git of twso millions of dollars, which had been voted himn by the general congress of Peru, in return for the services lhe had rendered to the country of the Incas.' We shall continue our extracts next number.

The Age. A Poem, in Eight Books. THE AGE. A POEM. Fsc. 8vo., pp. 2M. Hurst and Co. London, 1829. Tue author of this poem remarks, in speaking of the pride of authors, that * Oft it lies Concealed amidst a rcprehensive strain Against his felloxvs, he, poor man ! forgetting That all these faults are centred in himself.' We very much fear that this is sometimes the case; that long poems may be xvritten to denounce thc spirit of the age ; to show boxy essentially its ' besetting sin' and * ruling passion' is pride ; to trace this pride through all its manifestations ; in the church, in the bar, in the senate, in the army ; among doctors, at school, at college, among Anti-Catholics, among Liberals; in reviewers, in editors of nexvspapers, in the frequenters of theatres, balls, and bible meetings; and that, after all, that very spirit, that very pride, may be the presiding genius, the inspiring muse, of the xvhole book. .Mich may be, such has been, the case ; and it behoves every xvriter who proclaims a high rule of virtue, who is rightly dissatisfied with the mere conformity of actions to his strict law, but who looks, also, that the current of the feelings should be regulated in accordance with it,?it behoves, xve say, such a man lo examine, most keenly and anxiously, that he may ascertain whether the evil he is attacking may not have struck their roots into the soul of the censor. We will not rashly take upon ourselves the office of determining, in any case, whether a man who sets himself up to scourge the Age, is prompted to undertake his high mission by a spirit of' hatred, envy, and uncharitableness,'or by tlie ' spirit of power, of love, and of a sound mind ;' xvhelher he belongs to the herd of bilious satirists, men to xvhoni all (tod's beautiful creation is hateful, either because there is a native core of bitterness in their hearts, or because they are the xx-eak slaves of a bad digestion; or xvhether he claims kindred xvith such beings as Milton, xvho were impatient of every jarring note in that mighty harmony to xvhich their own spirits xvere attuned. This only xve will say, that, when we sec writer! svho intitate, or profess to imitate, great men in one of their marked characteristics, we like also that they should form themselves upon the entire model. Give us a little of Milton's other qualities -. aud trust us, sve will not quarrel svith you for mimicking him in his vituperation. Give us but one of his prayers, and you shall be free to copy his invectives as long as you will. Be able, tis he was, to lay your hands on your hearts and say,?' 1 am pure in svord, and deed, and thought;' pure, not from coldness, not from education, but from a spirit within, svhich svould not stoop to crime, and turned every thing svhich it touched into good : be able to say this, and you shall denounce other men's vices so long "as you have breath to rave with. In short, shosv that, like him, ou have something svithin yourselves that is not of the age, but above it; und'then curse and rail at it to your heart's content. Till then, besvare ! And this sve must say further, though the application may seem personal to the author of thin volume, as svell as to his acknowledged prototype, Mr. Pollok, that nearly all the men from whom they can drasv any precedent for their osvn vituperative propensities, and Milton mort* remarkably than any of them, however vehement thev may have been in that prose dialect, which they adopted that they might svrestle svith flesh and blood upon its osvn level, the moment they began to speak their native language, gave utterance to no thoughts hut such as belonged to a region of purity and love. Wc will give some extracts from the work hefore us. Of thc feeling in which it is svritten we shall, for the reason we have mentioned, express no opinion: on the quality of its poetry, we will be equally silent. We have read some lectures to the religious public upon the grossness of its tastes ; and svith these sve shall bc content. Lifieravimus animus nostras; aud henceforth, let it feed upon svhat garbage it svill, sve shall trust its cure to the sickness svhich must infallibly ensue from such foul gluttony : ' Open the college gates, and enter in Kath room, each heart, and scan the inmost depths. Here, many learning seek,?thc most, as sought The schoolboy, that they may obtain applause From mortals : but another kind of pride In others now arises, or shoots forth Branches more vigorous ;?a pride of name, Of family, and rank. And they will feel No small degree of rapture, that their house,?Beyond memorial infamous,?has stood So many generations,?that their vaults Contain the relics of so many gone ;? Gone svhither ??Precious legacies are they. These worthies scarce to look svill condescend. Upon their tutor, if of plebeian birth ;? Much less to listen to him, and less still To follow his example, and be wise. ' Some make a boast of horses, dogs, and guns, And horrible! of harlots !?Some delight, They say, in Christianising nil their dress,?Infernal blasphemy, that seems to beg Heav'n's thunders to descend and crush the wretch!? And name each article of foppery After themselves,?that sill may know them fools. ' Would that the echoes of my harp could reach The youth of Britain ;?reach them and awake From slumber,?worse than slumber,?drunkenness With sin, their never-dying souls. Howlong Will God have patience and forbear to strike ? Souls made for holiness, for heav'n and bliss, Thus to run riotous in ruthless scorn Of holiness, of heav'n, of bliss, of God !-? To seek their glory on the mountain top Of the bleak Alps, or in a harlot's arms, Or on the race-course, or the checquer'd board, Or in thc gaudy look of their own selves, In wanton lust, intemperance, the death Of those they ruined,?or the latter fame Of him, the suicide !-To such pursuits To dedicate their lives, their souls, their powers'. All given to promote the glory, praise, And majesty, of Him they scorn, their God ; Of Him, whom they defy, their King, their Judge ! Such souls, such powers, immortal, boundless, vast Beyond all vastness, infinite beyond All space,?to none but Heaven inferior,? Such souls, such powers to prostitute, to plunge In infamy and pride, to damn to hell. God of all mercy, still withhold thine arm '. Hold back thy thunders ; let not vengeance slip And blast them in a moment!?spare, still spare, And shower mercy on an Agc of Pride '. Return once more to earth.?The love of wealth Which, tho' denied by all, each class pervades, Shall be the theme : but tho' denied by all, 'Tis universal; scarce a heart but feels The golden passion, infamous as wide Extended, brutish, devilish, as base. Some say that wealth is power; and alas '. 1 fear it is so ; their immortal souls, Vast, mighty, boundless things, it sinks to bell, To deep destruction -.?pride of wealth is power. * Senseless, infatuated, purse-proud man! How can he feel a pride for xvhat requires Such days of labour, and such nights of pain And watching, and anxiety to manage ? His real weight of care who begs his bread From door to door, compared to this man's, seems Am nothing, calmness, happiness serene. To spend is trouble,?to preserve, is more. The very joys wealth promises, arrived,? The joys, I mean, of sense, the vain delight And nonsense pleasures of ii carnal xvorld,? Arrived, are found deceitful; xvith a sting, A venom'd sting embosomed in the honey ; And yet,?it nearly passes all tho bounds Of credence,-?will the di.apointed man Form more, more schemes, whose nature is the same'. ' To spend is trouble,?to preserve, is more. Bear xvitness all ye shutters, bolts, and bars, Ye nightly watch and dogs ferocious, traps, And unseen guns, the robber to destroy;? Your testimony bring, what heartfelt care And trouble wealth's security demands. is not all this sufficient to convince That pride of wealth is folly ??I can bring Reasons still stronger, arguments more high, That none can gainsay or dispute ;?of wealth Th' uncertainty,?of his, the miser's heart,-? Victim despicable! the dreadful sight. Tbese cannot be subverted ;?ev'ry day Is pregnant with example,?of the wings Invisible of gold,-?the anxious care, Moody, suspicious, brooding jealousy, The thought distracted, and the appetite Craving for more, and never, never cloy'd.? That tear the miser'-, canker'd, loathsome heart.'

A Commonplace Booh of Thoughts, Memories, and Fancies, Original and Selected. LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1854. REVIEWS By Mrs. Jameson. With Illustrations and Etchings. Longman & Co. The graceful and highly-finished writer of the ' Characteristics of Women' mentions in the Preface to this book, that out of the gradual accumulations of notes, which it has been her habit to make, more than one of her works has taken form, if not been originally suggested ;? and that the collection now put forth by her is, in some degree, the residuary matter of what had found its way into her note-books, and which she feels unwilling to throw away. Nevertheless, miscellaneous as is the character of these passages, they can be grouped in two divisions,?the one devoted to * Ethics and Character,' the other to ? Literature and Art.' Little more than such an announcement is required by way of criticism on this ' Commonplace Book' as a whole; since Mrs. Jameson's value in authorship has not now to be adjudged; and she is one who respects herself in respecting her public :?one who never slights the labour in hand, nor does less than her best. In some paragraphs, Mrs. Jameson registers her dissent against, orreply to, what" Carlyle" has said (not written) on this or the other question. We must stop to ask if this be fair and modest? Is conversation so squared and methodized a relaxation that \tmay?that it should?be preached from in print? It is now-a-days sufficiently hard for simple folk to feel unconstrained and natural in society ; so systematically is society worked for the purposes of gain and advancement. The pre-occupied author who?betwixt the first and the second courses?drops a hint of what his fifth act or his third volume may be, runs no visionary risk of finding his tragedy or his tale forestalled by some nimble nearer, dining out " in search of situations." Poor statesmen at soirhs are wedged up into corners that the screw of curiosity may be put on them?regarding their views on any given question, crisis, or combination ? since Bos- I ivells are " out," who keep ponderous diaries of such dialogues (the power of checking which, of course, does not exist), and who put down all that the screwed statesman has yielded up, under these terrible circumstances, to be copied, read, and circulated. ? If a "LatterDay Pamphlet" were to begin with " Said Mrs. Jameson to me"?and if the Lady were there to find some saying which she had idly uttered descanted on by way of text ? would she not complain ? Privacy is a public good so unspeakable?so intimately connected with all that is surest in confidence?with all that is most reviving in intercourse?that we would willingly sacrifice our share in certain great thoughts, for the assurance that there was no note-book in the neighbourhood, where the sense, or nonsense, of the hour was recorded, as the listener's sympathy or antipathy dictated. Is Mrs. Jameson sure how far O. G. (whose initials it is not hard to unriddle) meant her ingenious plea for suicide (p. 34) to figure in print??and the Kemble sisters wished to encounter what thc one may have said concerning Mozart, and the other apropos of " the tune of Imogen"? We hold that such things are not Mrs. Jameson's own, precisely to use as she will,?any more than would be a secret captured by an involuntary listener; and it is for the good both of recorders and of those recorded to have attention called to the principle by protest. Let us now take a few passages which are Mrs. Jameson's own; and better than most of her borrowings from other persons. Among these we may number the following picture.? " This present Sunday I set off with the others to walk to church, but it was late ; I could not keep up with the pedestrians, and, not to delay them, turned back. I wandered down the hill path to the river brink, and crossed the little bridge and strolled along, pensive, but with no definite or continuous subject of thought. How beautiful it was?how tranquil! not a cloud in the blue sky, not a breath of air ! ' And where the dead leaf fell there did it rest;1 but so still it was that scarce a single leaf did flutter or fall, though the narrow pathway along the water's edge was already encumbered with heaps of decaying foliage. Everywhere around, the autumnal tints prevailed, except in one sheltered place under the towering cliff, where a bingle tree, a magnificent lime, still flourished in summer luxuriance, with not a leaf turned or shed. I stood still oppo>ite, looking on it quietly for a long time. It stemed to me a happy tree, so fresh and fair and grand, as if its guardian Dryad would not surfer it to be defaced. Then I turned, for close beside me sounded the soft, interrupted, half-suppressed warble of a bird, sitting on a leafless spray, which seemed to bend with its tiny weight. Some lines which I used to love in my childhood came into my mind, blending softly with the presences around nie.? Tlie little bird now to salute the morn Upon the naked branches sets her foot, The leaves still lying at the mossy root, And there a Billy chirruping doth keep, As if site fain would sing, yet fain would weep ; Praising fair summer that too soon is gone, And sad for winter too soon coming on.' The river, where I stood, taking an abrupt turn, ran wimpling by; not as I had seen it but a few days before,?rolling tumultuously, the dead leaves whirling in its eddies, swollen and turbid with the mountain torrents, making one think of the kelpies, tho water wraiths, and mich uncanny things,?but gentle, transparent, and flashing in the low sunlight; even the barberries, drooping with rich crimson clusters over the little pools near the bank, and reflected in them as in a mirror, I remember vividly as a part of the exquisite loveliness which seemed to melt into my life. For such moments we are grateful: we feel then what God can do for us, and what man can not.?Carolside, November oth, 1843." The next passage comprehends a true distinction, gracefully phrased.? "There are few things more striking, more interesting to a thoughtful mind, than to trace through all the poetry, literature, and art of the Middle Ages, that broad ever-present distinction between the practical and the contemplative life. This was, no doubt, suggested and kept in view by the one grand division of the whole social community into those who were devoted to the religious profession (an immense proportion of both sexes) and those who were not. All through Dante, all through the productions of mediaeval art, we find this pervading idea; and we must understand it well and keep it in mind, or we shall never be able to apprehend the entire beauty and meaning of certain religious groups in sculpture and painting, and the significance of the characters introduced. Thus, in subjects from the Old Testament, Leah always represents the practical, Rachel, the contemplative life. In the New Testament, Martha and Mary figure in the same allegorical sense; and among the saints we always find St. Catherine and St. Clara patronising the religious and contemplative life, while St. Barbara and St. Ursula preside over the military or secular existence. It was a part, and a very important part, of that beautiful and expressive symbolism through which art in all its forms spoke to the popular mind." Here is a recollection, the force of which attests its reality.? " There was in my childish mind another cause of suffering besides those I have mentioned, less acute, but more permanent, and always unacknowledged. It was fear?fear of darkness and supernatural influences. As long as I can remember anything, I remember these horrors of my infancy. How they had been awakened I do not know; they were never revealed. I had heard other children ridiculed for such fears, and held my peace. At first these haunting, thrilling, stifling terrors were vague; afterwards the form varied ; but one of the most permanent was the ghost in Hamlet. There was a volume of Shakspeare lying about, in which was an engraving 1 have not seen since, but it remains distinct in my mind as a picture. On one side stood Hamlet with his hair on end, literally Mike quills upon the fretful porcupine,' and one hand with all the fingers outspread. On the other etrided thc ghost, encased in armour with nodding plumes; one ringer pointing forwards, and all surrounded with a supernatural light. O that spectre! for three years it followed nie up and down the dark staircase, or stood by my bed : only the blessed light had power to exorcise it. How it was that I knew, while I trembled and quaked, that it was unreal, never cried out, never expostulated, never confessed, I do not know. The figure of A polly on looming over Christian, which I had found in an old edition of the * Pilgrim's Progress,' was also a great torment. But worse, perhaps, were certain phantasms without shape,_ things like the vision in Job?'A spirit passed before my face; it stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof:'?and if not intelligible voices, there were strange unaccountable sounds filling the air around with a sort of mysterious life. In daylight I was not only fearless, but audacious, inclined to defy all power and brave all danger,_that is, all danger I could see. I remember volunteering to lead the way through a herd of cattle (among which was a dangerous bull, the terror of the neighbourhood) armed only with a little stick ; but first I said the Lord's Pra\er fervently. In the ghastly night I never prayed; terror stifled prayer. These visionary sufferings, in some form or other, pursued me till I was nearly twelve years old. If I had not possessed a strong constitution and a strong understanding, which rejected and contemned my own fears, even while they shook me, I had been destroyed. How much weaker children suffer in this way, I have since known; aud have known how to bring them help and strength, through sympathy and knowledge, thesunpathy that soothes and does not encourage ?the knowledge that dispels, and does not suggest, the evil." As a critic of Art, Mrs. Jameson is generally sensible and suggestive. Many may be curious to see how the author of ? The Loves of the Poets' handles the female creations of the Lecturer on " the Humourists," and will be amused with the sentimental exaggeration of a sound judgment passed by her on Mr. Thackeray's heroines.? " No woman resents his Rebecca ? inimitable Becky !_no woman but feels and acknowledges with a shiver the completeness of that wonderful and finished artistic creation; but every woman resents the selfish inane Amelia, and would be inclined to quote and to apply the author's own words when speaking of' Tom Jones':?' I can't say that I think Amelia a virtuous character. I can't say but I think Mr. Thackeray's evident liking and admiration for his Amelia shows that the great humourist's moral sense was blunted by his life, and that here in art and ethics there is a great error. If it be right to have a heroine whom we tire to admire, let us take care at least that she is admirable.' Laura, in ' Pendennis,1 is a yet more fatal mistake. She is drawn with every generous feeling, every good gift. We do not complain that she loves that poor mature Pendennis, for she loved him in her childhood. She I grew up with that love in her heart; it came between her and the perception of his faults; it is a necessity indivisible from her nature. Hallowed, through its constancy, therein alone would lie its best excuse, its beauty and its truth. But Laura faithless to that first affection; Laura, waked up to the appreciation of a far more manly and noble nature, in love with Warrington, and then going back to Pendennis, and marrying him/ Such infirmity might be true of some women, but not of such a woman as Laura; we resent the inconsistency, the indelicacy of the portrait. And then Lady Castlewood,?so evidently a favourite of the author, what shall we say of her ? The virtuous woman, par excellence, who ' never sins a and never forgiv-vs,' who never resents, nor relents, j t nor repents; the mother, who is the rival of her | daughter; the mother, who for years is the confidante . of a man's delirious passion for her own child, and 1: then consoles him by marrying him herself! O Mr. c Thackeray! thia will never do! such women may > exist; but to hold them np as examples of ex* ellence, s and fit objects of our best sympathies, is a fault, and s proves a low standard in ethics and in art. When r an author presents to us a heroine whom we are j t called upon to admire, let him at least take care that ? she is admirable." t To every line of the following criticism we < can subscribe ? with one question. Is there ! 1 not some confusion as to facts, when Mdlle. ' < Rachel is spoken of as having personated 11 Athalie?? 1 "Every one who remembers what Madlle. Rachel i ' was seven or eight years ago, and who s^es her now ? ] (1853), will allow that she has made no progress | 1 in any of the essential excellencies of her art. A , I certain proof that she is not a great artist in the true : ( sense of the word. She is a tini?hed actress, but she . , is nothing more, and nothing better; not enough the , artist ever to forget or conceal her art, consequently j j there is a want somewhere, which a mind highly toned, and of quick percepti n*>, feels from begin- j mag to end. The parts in which she once excelled ?the Phedre and the Hermione, for instance ? have become formalized and hard, like studies cast in bronze; and when she plays a new part it has no freshness. I always go to see her whenever I j can. I admire her as whit she is?the Parisian , actress, practised in every trick of her mitier. I , admire what she does, I think how well it is all dont, and am inclined to clap and applaud her drapery, perfect and ostentatiously studied in every fold, just with the same feeling that I applaud herself. As to the last scene of Adrienne Lecouvrcur (which those who are av ides de sensation, athirst for painful emotion, go to see hs they would drink a dram, and critics laud as a miracle ot art; it is altogether a mistake and a failure), it is beyond the just limits of terror and pity ? beyond the legitimate sphere of art. It reminds us of the story of Gcntil Bellini and the Sultan. The Sultan much admited his picture of the decollation of John the Baptisr, but informed him that it was inaccurate?surreal Iv?for the tendons and muscles ought to shrink win re divided; and then calling for one of his ala vis, he drew his scimitar, and striking off the head of tho wretch, gave the horror-struck artist a lesson in practical anatomy. So we might possibly karn from Rachel's imitative representation (studied in an hospital, as they say), how poison acts on tin* frame, and how the limbs and features writhe into death ; but if she were a great moral artist she would feel that what is allowed to be true in painting, is true in Art generally; that mere imitation, such ns the vulgar delight.in, and hold up their hands to see, is the vulgarest and easiest aim of the imitative arts, and that between the true interpretation of poetry in art and such base mechanical means to the lowest ends, there lies an immeasurable distance. I am disposed to think that Rachel has not genius, but talent, and that her talent, from what 1 see year after year, has a downward tendency,?there is not sufficient moral seasoning to save it from corruption. I remember that when I fir.->t saw her in Hermione she reminded me of a serpent, and the same impression continues. The long meagre form with its graceful undulating movements, the long narrow face and features, the contracted jaw, thc hij-h brow, the brilliant supernatural eyes which seem to glance every way at once; the sinister smile; the painted red lips, which look as though they had hipped, or could lap, blood; all these bring before me, the idea of a Lamia, the serpent nature in the woman's form. In Lydia, and in Athalie, she touches the extremes of vice and , wickedness with such a masterly lightness and precision, that I am full of wondering admiration for the actress. There is not a turn of her figure, not an expression in her face, not a fold in her gorgeous drapery, that is not a study; but withal such a consciousness of her art, and such an ostentation of the means she employs, that the power remains always extraneous, as it were, and exciting only to the senses and the intellect." With regard to another art, Mrs. Jameson is a sayer of pleasant things, rather than a collector of facts to be relied on by the uninformed. This Art is music. Fancy, for in- ". stance, her offering a parallel betwixt Mozart T and Chopin;?as two men "in both whose! minds the artistic element wholly dominated . over the social and practical." What does J, "the social element" mean? The fact was,' r that Chopin, one of the most delicately spiritual' n converser* whom we ever met, was the delight of j " 1 perhaps the most super-subtle and intellectual ( T 1 coterie in Paris. He answered no letters, it is , | true;?he gave lessons (save to ladies whom he j liked) very reluctantly;?and his infirm health made him languid, unready, and oftentimes capricious, iu performing the duties and attending j to the courtesies of life. But he was as willing I to discuss French politics or Polish nationality,? , j to anatomize the new poem or novel,?as to r | dream at the piano;?in this being totally unlike J i Mozart, who only seems willingly to have ex- J a | changed his spirituality (which was music) for j | reckless, animal dissipation.?Unlike Mozart, ! a too, Chopin had a reason to give for everything c which he did in his art, and was thus some- j t times, as a musician, affected in his delicacies, ! t and elaborately grotesque in his avoidance of 1 common-place.?Curiously enough, in stating a * difference betwixt Mozart and Chopin, Mrs. 11 Jameson falls into an error of criticism as re- j* markable as the error of fact, just corrected.? I " When called upon to describe his method of j t composing, what Mozart said of himself was very j i striking from its naivets and truth. * I do not,' he said, 'aim at originality. I do not know in what ; 1 my originality consists. Why my productions take j ] from my hand that particular form or style which makes them Mozartvm, and different from the works of other composers, is probably owing to thc same cause which makes my nose this or that particular nhape; makes it, in short, Mozart's nose, and different from other people's.' Yet, a9 a composer, Mozart was as objective, as dramatic, as Shakspeare and Raphael; Chopin, in comparison, was wholly subjective,?the Byron of Music." Mozart as dramatic as Shakspeare!?This is news to those who feel with us. Mozart is everywhere in his works,?always tender and gentle, rarely lively,?affluent in melody,? wondrous in science,?but. vague as a characterpainter : in his Masses as gay as in his Operas, in his Operas as solemn as in his Masses,?one who sentimentalized even the ' Figaro' of Beaumarchais, and flung so much of his own melancholy, mysticism, and musical science over a common Vienna extravaganza (for such is the book of ' Die Zauberflbte') ? that the transcendentalists, deceived by the exquisite beauty and individuality of the composer, have absolutely wasted time and speculation in burrowing to find the bottom of that which, like Bottom's dream, " had no bottom." Perhaps no man's name, example, genius, story, have been put to such hard duty, have been so overinterpreted, as those of Mozart. Mrs. Jameson, in the above, merely repeats the old fallacies, which mean little, because they do not touch the truth The fragments on Sculpture, which close this elegant volume, are better. In taking leave of them and of the book, we cannot but ask Mrs Jameson why, when speaking poetically and artistically of Helen, she had not a word for r Canova's bust of the enchantress, and Lord * Byron's graceful and epigrammatic eight lines on "the Helen of the heart"? a ?f s

At the Sign of the Peacock. By K. C. Ryves. (Unwin, 6s.) This book belongs to the First Novel Library, and its merit, therefore, deserves double emphasis. It is a clever study oi an unusual character, and the circumstances chosen to develop this character are both interesting and natural. The other persons are incisive sketches?it is a book full of real people. The style is terse and amusing, and there are no meaningless interpolations of well-worn adjectives and phrases. The central figure, the cold girl who takes an austere pleasure in sensuous beauties, and is only saved from being " a cat" by a certain aloofness, is well traced through the changes that result from her horrified discovery that she has a heart after all, and has given it away like any other girl.

ART. V. Vovazes dans l'Inde, &c.; i.e. Travels in the Western Peninsula of India and the Island of Ceylon. By M. JACOB HAAFNER. Translated from the Dutch by M. J. 8vo. 2 Vols. pp. 886. Paris. i8i i. Imported by De Boffe. Price 11. 4S. r HIS work is professedly a translation from the Dutch; and, in order to silence the suspicions of those who might be doubtful of its having existed in any other form than the present, an allusion is made in the preface to observations on the original, in a critical journal. The translator farther says that he has presumedto abridge certain passages of the Dutch publication. We speak thus cautiously of the existence of an original, because every thing about the book is calculated to engender distrust. The writer is represented as having passed many years in the Dutch and the English settlements in India, and as having returned to Amsterdam, where he died a few years ago, after having favoured the public with some literary pro. ductions of which this is the chief. Attractions of all kinds are studiously sought out and thrown together, to give interest to these Travels. Delineation of local manners, personal adventures, tales of love, and effusions of indignation at British tyranny in the East, are all made to join in harmonious assemblage. The coast of Coromandel furnishes the first (and a con. siderable) part of the scene: but, by way of variety, the untra. vlled province of Orissa becomes the object of peregrination, and the the island of Ceylon is also pressed into the cause. The pretended season of the chief occurrences is from 1781 to 1785 ; a period sufficiently recent to be interesting, and sufficiently remote to afford, in consequenceof the death of most of the parties accused, an escape from contradiction and detection. The whole is ushered in by a preface in the plausible style which is common to French publications; and a biographical sketch of the author is made to follow. Names and places are given with every appearance of precision; yet it so happens that nobody comes forwards to answer for the book. The translator is anonymous, the biographical sketch of M. HAAFNER is unauthenticated, and HAAFNER himself is represented as stepping off this stage of frail mortality soon after the appearance of his narrative. -We proceed to give our readers some insight into its mysterious contents, beginning with the particulars of the author's early career. M. HAAFNER is said to have been born in 1755, at the town ,of Halle, and to have been descended from a medical man; who, having received an appointment at Batavia, set out on the voyage thither, with his son, at that time in his eleventh year. The father fell a victim, on the passage, to a malignant fever; and the boy, on landing at Batavia, found himself destitute of friends and of employment. Thus situated, he went, to sea, tnd passed twelve years in a course of Indian navigation. At the end of that time, circumstances led to his being employed as a clerk in the service of the Dutch East-India Company, in which he is said to have attained a considerable rank: but the war between the Dutch and the English in 1781 is represented as having deranged the tranquil course of his occupations, and led to a variety of travels and adventures: i I had passed,' he says, (p.40. ) ' two years at the small Dutch settlement of Sadras, not far from Madras, when in 178 I, Hyder-Ali, being at war with the English, ravaged the country in our neighbourhood. We were under great fear of a visit from this formidable chieftain, until one of his Vakeels appeared, and assured us that we had nothing to dread, provided that we observed a strict neutrality, This proposition was faithfully maintained on both sides: but our tranquillity was of short duration. An enemy, equally cruel and vindictive with Hyder-Ali, and much more treacherous, came to take us by surprise. It wason the i7thJune 178I, at fourin the afternoon, when we were all dining at the house of the chief of the settlement, that a serjeant of the guard entered the room, and told our landlord that an English officer, holding a white handkerchief at the end of his cane, was desirous of speaking to him. "Let him come in," said our Chief, "and drink with us to the prosperity of Sadras." A young officer then entered, and told our host that he had the painful task 9f bringing him bad news, and of delivering, moreover, a disagreeable messages mesage. " War," said he, 4" is this day proclaimed between the English and the Dutch settlements; and Captain George Mackay, Commandant of Chingle-put, is encamped with his detachment at a mile distance. He has ordered me to summon you to surrender your settlement at discretion." How great was our astonishment on learn. ing this intelligence! As soon *-s we had recovered our surprise, we burst out into vio!'nt effusions against the perfidy of the English: but what could this avail us? -we were unable to make any resistance, and it would have been folly to attempt it. We determined, therefore, to surrender, but on conditions, and by no means at discretion, which would in other words have been an abandonment of our property to the English. We prepared accordingly a capitulation sufficiently short and explicit; for it consisted of no more than two articles: i I. The private property of the inhabitants of Sadras, of whatever nation, shall be respected and protected. t 2. The garrison and Company's servants shall be treated as pri. soners of war, until a peace or an exchange. ' With these offers, another gentleman and I repaired, in the even. ing, to the position of the English detachment. It was situated in a wood at a distance from the road: and Captain Mackay received us with an air of fierceness, as if he meant to extinguish us by his look. I put into his hands the conditions of capitulation, which he read, and threw back to me, saying, " Tell your Chief, that I will listen to no conditions; if he refuses to surrender at discretion, I know how to comnpell him to it. I have with me cannon and scaling ladders." " Captain," I replied, " you treat us like banditti; we are the subjects of a respectable nation; we will not surrender at discretion." "a In two hours hence," he answered, " we will teach vou to hold a diferent language." I then arose, and said to him with anger, " I know that you are responsible for all the blood which is about to be shed; we are determined to be cut to pieces before we will undergo such a humiliation." Like all other overbearing people, CaptaiR Mackay softened his tone when opposed with firmness, put his name to the capitulation, and handed it to me without saying a syllable. .He then gave orders to his men to march towards the town, which they reached and entered that night. Though we had stipulated for the preservation of our property, Captain Mackay soon shewed that, in one way or another, he had. every thing in his power. Having sent us round as prisoners to Madras, he burst open the warehouse in which we had deposited our private effects, and conveyed every thing of value to his own station of Chinglemput.' This is a specimen of the nature of the tales which fill these volumes. A plausible story is contrived, by the introduction of real names, and by an affectation of accuracy as to dates, though the points chiefly maintained exist only in the malignant imagination of the writer. The truth is that hostilities were commenced against the Dutch as soon as official intelligence of the war was received at Madras from England : but it hap. fns most unluckily for M. HAANER'S veracity, that the arrival of of that intelligence did not take place till four days after the date assigned by him to the dinner-scene and the, angry interview with Mackay. This point once ascertained, our readers. can be at no loss as to the opinion which they should form respecting the charge against that officer, of breaking the capi. tulation, and seizing private property. Serious as that charge is, it is a trifle to others brought by this indefatigable writer against our countrymen: 4 The death of Hyder-Ali,' he. says, (p. 35.) ' relieved the Engs lish from the worst enemy which they had in India. There is every reason to suspect that they contrived to have him secretly carried of bV poison; for that is quite customary with the*.; and I could name several Indian Princes whom they have thus put`o~t of the way, iw order that they might get possession of their territories.' P. 211 . 'Pondicerry was at one time the finest city in India. The English have more than once obtained possession of it, and have, committed, at each time, but particularly at first, horrible excesses, demolishing not only the fort but the Governor's palace, and the other fine buildings which formed the ornament of the town.' Vol. II. p. iSS. ' Benares is a large city, with a numb-r of god buildings and magnificent ruins. It is the sacred city of the Hin'oos, and was the residence of their principal philosophers, -and doctors of law, until the English became masters of the whole province. Since that time, arts, sciences, and trade have disappeared from this. city.' P. 420. 'Cheit-Sing was Rajah of Benares, and was driven froax, his throne by Mr. Hastings on the most improbable pretexts, Hastings had long coveted the riches of this Prince and the posses sion of his territory, a robbery which he executed i4 1781. It was in vain that Burke and others accused him of not fewer than forty. seven criminal charges, some of them of so atrocious a nature that the ladies fainted on hearing them read. But who ever heard of the English punishing an India-Governor? The crying injustice of that reprobate Lord Clive, and of the whole list of his execrable success sors, remains to this day unrequited. When property passes into the hands of Englishmen,,adieu to restitution. Mr. Hastings knew how to get rid o the charges against him, and to obtain an acquittal. What is more, he had the good fortune to be raised to the ran; of a British Peer. And why should we wonder at this? Mr. Hastiags was worth several millions of money, and had found means to make himself friends in various ways.' M. HAAFNER, like other fabricating gentlemen, is apt to forget where to stop, and, by going a few steps too far, unwarily discovers the cloven foot. The possession of millions b.y Mr. Hastings, though a monstrous misrepresentation, (that gentleman's fortune being, we believe, very-moderate,) might have obtained currency for a time: but the assertion of his being advanced to the House of Lords is too gross a falsehood even for French French credulity. To do HAAFNER justice, however, he setw down all Europeans in India (Vol. ii. p. 428.) as nearly on a level, and declares that it is chiefly want of opportunity that prevents the subjects of other nations from being as harsh and as overbearing as our countrymen, 'We must confess,' he says, ' with the amiable Rousseau, that French, Germans, Spa-6 niards, and English have similar passions and similar morals; all will call themselves pure, and will act as knaves; all will speak of the public advantage, and will think only of themselves; all will praise mediocrity of circumstances, and yet strive by the foulest means to acquire opulence.' It is amusing to find with what complacency this rigid censor of others can speak of himself; though various transactions in these volumes argue a character of at least doubtful morality. Not to enlarge on his treatment of the female sex, we find him in one part (Vol. i. p. 197.) opening without scruple a private letter; and at another (p. 97.) consenting to falsify entries in the Comr. pany's books. Yet, in spite of all this, he invariably takes credit for being a man of the first-rate honour and humanity. * I have always,' lhe says, ' detested injustice and cruelty; and I look on all men, of whatever colour or whatever religion, as my brothers. Let not those who think differently open the pages of my book. My object is to destroy the prejudices so strongly rooted against the Indians, and to extricate that degraded people from the contempt which overwhelms them.' By way of affecting the praise of impartiality, he chuses to say (Vol. ii. p. 8.) that the Dutch in India are almost as bad as the English: but he has a salvo for the odium which this might bring on him, in talking of the good which he expects from the ' recent change in the government of his country.' Let us observe in what way he speaks of Bonaparte, whose name has become detested in Holland since he bereft the Dutch of their independance: ' The adored monarch, who now governs us, will not fail to take these people (the Hindoos) under his powerful protection. His acknowleged justice and humanity will not allow them to continue under that tyranny to which they are at present subjected. He will put an end to oppression of all kinds; and his paternal goodness will be extended over his Indian subjects, with the same zeal that he shews to restore Europe to peace and tranquillity.' After a panegyric so sincere as this, we need not be surprised that the author of this performance asserts in confident terms his rigid adherence to truth. ' As to my personal adventures,' says M. HAAFNER, ' I can certify that, however strange they appear, there is nothing in them at variance with the strictest veracity. I might, were it necessary, adduce irrefragable gable proofs, which would put all doubt on this respect out of the question.! Sufficient, we believe, has been stated to take away on the part of our readers any wish for a farther acquaintance with these suspicious volumes. We should account it a prostitution of our pages, to make them a vehicle for the repetition of slanders against Lord Macartney and other British officers in India; and we shall merely mention, in order to give an idea of the contents of the work, that part of it is appropriated to a description of the dreadful famine at Madras in I 782 ; part is occupied with a detail of the author's attachment to a young girl, of whom he becomes passionately enamoured; while a farther part, more especially in the second volume, is given to a delineation of HinAoo manners. Of the last, we had translated some passages for insertion: but our disgust at the general tone of the book has deterred us from bringing forwards examples of this part, though it is less exceptionable than the rest. The name of a Dutchman is evidently assumed to obtain credit for the narrative, in consequence of the extensive settlements of that nation in India: but the imposture is not difficult of detection. M. HAAFNER cannot keep up his feigned character. He represents the Dutch in 178 I as calling temselves (Vol. i. p. 47.) the subjects of a respectable nation; a term which these republicans in their better days never adopted. His birth-place also is said to be Halle, a name evidently introduced because it applies to several places; and especial care is taken not to tell us whether it is Halle in Flanders, in Saxony, or in Suabia. We are somewhat at a loss to account for the motives of the extraordinary violence which is manifested against our countrymen. Bonaparte can have, at present, no particular designs against India; and with the French public at large, who are to be the readers and purchasers of these travels, there is reason to believe that the English character is not unpopular. We are disposed, therefore, to seek no farther for the motive of the calumnies against us, than in a wish to make an ostentatious display of attachment to the interests of France, and to give a feature of decision to the performance. The author, whoever he be, is a man of reading, and acquainted with Indian customs: but it is that kind of acquaintance which may be obtained in a garret at Paris, being unaccompanied by any evidence of actual residence in India.

By Frederick Warren. 2 vols. (Remington & Co.) The BadicaVs Daughter. By a Peer's Son. (Longmans & Co.) Douglas Archdale: a Tale of Lucknow. By C. M. K. Phipps. (London Literary Society.) ' Mitre Court ' is a very good specimen of Mrs. Riddell's work. It is brighter than some of her later novels have been, and the interest of the story is maintained without the help of any ghastly incidents. It is rather too long, but this defect is balanced by the fact that the second volume is, contrary to custom, the best of the three. The scene is, of course, laid in the City, and the chief picturesque interest is centred about an old house in Botolph Lane, Aldgate, the Mitre Court which gives its name to the book not being that by the Temple, and, in fact, not having any special importance in the story. The old house, supposed to have been Wren's, is described in Mrs. Riddell's charming manner, and a whole chapter is devoted to a lament over the destruction which is rapidly removing everything venerable in the City. She may be pardoned for the digression, especially as after delivering herself of her angry sorrow she does not again interrupt the course of her story. She has introduced many varieties of character, and has described them all well. Although there is little but praise to be spoken of what she has done, it is possible to regret that the story never takes the reader out into the open country which she can draw so well, and which she has at times?and notably, of course, in 'George Geith'?used so effectively as a contrast to her pictures of City courts and alleys. ' Green Pleasure and Grey Grief' is what many of its readers will be inclined to call a sweetly pretty story. There is no question as to its sweetness and prettiness, for it is full of delightful love-making, and is told with dainty tenderness by one who understands both idyllic love and the art of romantic writing. The author is never tired of describing the happy intercourse of fresh young hearts, and follows with evident zest the fortunes of three pairs of lovers through the chequered course of their mutual passion. Perhaps her story would have been better described by an inversion of the title, for the grey grief is not allowed to overwhelm the pleasure of any character who figures in its pages. No doubt there is grief enough to make an effective contrast, and to justify the many quotations from Mr. Swinburne, which would otherwise fall rather flat. It was Mr. Swinburne who christened the principal heroine Dolores. She is made to live up to her name through a certain number of chapters; but all comes right for her in the end. The greenness of her life, and of the lives of her equally fortunate friends, is almost too vivid to be natural?a fault which the majority of readers will easily forgive. ' Dedham Park' stands out from the ordinary run of novels in virtue of a rather happy combination of social description with an inoffensive moral purpose. Apart from some pretty love-making between Dudley Braidword, eldest son of an old Tory baronet, and Winifred Jardine, daughter of a Radical manufacturer, and a counterplot of the same kind the parties to which are Frank Denison, High Church rector from St. Ingulphus of Privy Council fame, and Nora, the charming daughter of the baronet, the story is mostly concerned with the modification of the rectors views and their enlargement to a liberal catholicity. He learns by experience not to despise either the aid of an old blind basket-maker who is fighting irregularly, but with more effect than himself, against vice and ignorance, or the predilection of the village worthies,' Mr. Puttock (who farms his own land), Mr. Pender, and Mr. Bennett, for the church ceremonies of their youth, wherein their respective violins and flutes took an honoured part. The book shows an intimate acquaintance with English country life, and whenever somewhat larger questions present themselves to the numerous interlocutors in the discussions that arise the author indicates considerable powers of taking a broad and temperate view of modern problems. The characters are sufficiently individualized, and the dialogue is natural. Some solecisms occur; for instance, "like" in the sense of "as" with a verb, a mistake frequently repeated. Mrs. Banks has made the life of William Hutton, the Birmingham bookseller, the groundwork of her novel. Her careful acquisition of facts in regard to the appearance of the Midland towns in the last century, and her successful reproduction of such matters as the unlovely Midland dialect, will make her book acceptable to local readers, while the story of Hutton's life is in many ways interesting. Its interest is hardly derived, however, from his own personality, for a more typical presentment of the meaner side of the qualities usually attributed to his sect it would be difficult to find. The story interwoven with Hutton's biography is well told. One cannot but feel sympathy with the sturdy elder sister, whose love for the family (i.e., her brothers, her husband having been ruthlessly excluded from that circle) is really the source of William's fortune ; with the hapless Susannah Prince, whose tender heart is far too good to be shared with William's money-bags; with slow and steady Thomas Hutton, a better man than his brother; and with the West family, above all with "Viii" and high-spirited Cordelia Carew. Poachers and highwaymen, old-fashioned race meetings, stately manners and rough, glimpses of old Charnwood and Sherwood, and of the life of Nottingham, Derby, and Birmingham in the eighteenth century, render the volumes both picturesque and instructive. A mariage de convenance and its consequences in the case of a man who is at once handsome, amiable, and weak?these are the materials which Wanderer has worked up into three somewhat long-drawn volumes. But if the plot in its outlines is modelled closely upon that of nineteen out of every twenty French novels or plays, there is nothing in the treatment of it calculated to affront the most prudish reader. The fact is that ' Glamour' is a fair sample of the respectable mediocrity attained by some hundreds of novels every year, and sorely tests the ingenuity of the critic to find words other than negative wherewith to pass a verdict. The characters are conventional in the extreme, and a great deal too much space is devoted to chronicling the peculiarities of an excessively tiresome class of Ojty people. By far the best portions of the story aro those in which the traits of English and Italian character are illustrated by their contact in the society of an Italian j " health resort." In style and sentiment Mr. Warren's story is in such absolute contrast with tho work of contemporary novelists, that it might well have been written at the period which it endeavours to describe?the palmy days of the East India Company. Unfortunately the characterization is not equal to this consistency, and the longwindedness of narrative and dialogue only increases the insipidity | of the whole. When the hero smokes a cigar in tho porch of a farmhouse, it is said that " tho rich aroma of the Cuban leaf detracted nothing from the fragrance of the atmosphere." The vigour and familiarity with which Mr. Warren treats of nautical matters would seom to indicate that he is capable of writing a good old-fashioned story of sea life. But a novelist who adopts the diction of Rasselas starts with a serious disadvantage in tho race for popularity, and, with no special novelty to offer in plot or episode, can hardly expect to find a numerous circle of readers. ' The Radical's Daughtor' is a clevor, amusing, and opportune novelette, and forms a sort of pendant to that brilliant, but bitter sketch of American democracy which appeared anonymously a few seasons back. The new writer, whose assumed name is perhaps the only instance of bad taste in his pages, has turned to excellent account a close observation of tho cleavage wrought by modern politics in the society of the Midland and Northern counties. We do not suppose that Manchester or Birmingham people will relish all his remarks, but he refrains from hackneyed charges against parvenu households, and rightly insists on many points usually overlooked, as, for example, the cultivation and attractiveness so frequently observable in the wives and daughters of self-made men. The dialogue is mainly political, varied by some amusing love passages, but is usually fresh and vigorous. Amongst other good things is an admirable description of a Northern political meeting. But even apart from politics there is much to divert the reader in ? The Radical's Daughter.' ' Douglas Archdale' would not be a bad story if tho author knew anything about military matters and Anglo-Indian life and ideas. It is surprising to learn that in October, 1856, it was tho practice of Calcutta bankers to cool the atmosphere of the library by means of " tiny fountains of perfumed water." The particular banker referred to is represented as waiting calmly in his library for the arrival by steam from Eng- land of his only daughter, y$t we are given to understand that he is most desirous to have her with him. The young lady can hardly have believed in the affection of a father who contented himself with sending his carriage for her to " the quay ": we may observe that there was no " quay " then in existence. The girl after a quarter of an hour's drive in a comfortable carriage from a P. and 0. steamer needed a visit to her room "to remove the stains of water." The bhistis, evidently confounded with the mehters, are spoken of as "a very low lot altogether." The wife of the commissioner of Shahjehanpur passes the hot part of the day in a hammock in the sitting room. It is somewhat strange and unusual, to say tho least of it, that a clergyman of the Church of England and his wife should, on arriving at Calcutta during the Mutiny, have been lodged *by a Hindoo merchant. But we need not give any further instances of improbabilities; the book is full of them, but those readers who are not Anglo-Indians will be in happy ignorance of the author's disqualifications for writing a story about India.

A HERO'S WORK.* IN " A Casual Acquaintance " Mrs. Duffus Hardy committed the mistake, not an uncommon one, of supposing that because a horrible circumstance has occurred in real life, it is a fitting subject for a novel. In her present work she draws upon sources of interest which lie within the range of ordinary experience, and which, if they are not startling in point of effect, have the advantage of not being so in point of improbability. Why should writers of novels so often go out of their wvay for *A Hero's Work. By Mrs. Du fu Hardy, Author of " A CamaAiquintance." Three vols. London: Hurst & Blackett. strange incidents when there is ready to their hands, in the simplest events of life, so much that is of undying interest ? There is an excuse for the sensational when it is well done. No one can regret that fir. Wilkie Collins wrote the "W Woman in White," that wasterpiece of sensational writing for which its own author has toiled in vain to produce a rival. Still, notwithstanding the power of construction displayed in that novel, and the wonderful creation of Count Fosco, we do not recur to it with the same sense of pleasure with which we look back on such a wtork as M11rs. Gaskell's " Wives and Daughters." If we descend lower in the sensational school to such writers as Mtiss Braddon, with all their undoubted cleverness, we have to add to the fever heat of the narrative, and the improbability of the incidents, nmuch that on more important grounds than the art of novel-writitng is objectionable. And when all is done, the very result for which nature has been outraged and propriety too often shocked, namely, the creation of an interest which will hold the reader's attention, is not so well attained as it is by the painting of men and women as they really are. As they affect us in life either by repulsion or attraction, they will affect us in a novel, if the mirror is held up to nature. Our interests, indeed, will be awakened by them more easily in the latter case than in the former. We are not always enthusiastic about the heroes of real life; and the sayings and doings of lovers, which are so charming in three volumes, are generally voted dull work to lookers on, in the flesh. But it is not every writer who can hold the mirror as it should be held. Mr. Thackeray tells you the end of his story in the first chapter. This hero is to come into such an estate; that pair of lovers are to be married. You need have no anxiety about them, and one would think that your interest in the result would vanish with your suspense about it. But it is not so. He holds you by the strength of your emotions and his power over them. In the same way his gifted daughter has no need of striking incidents to call her readers round her and make them listen to her story. She enchains them by the sympathy she awakens in their breasts for the humanity of her characters. They are not puppets dressed up and put in this or that attitude to help the development of a plot; they are living men and women, feeling as we have felt, suffering or rejoicing as we have rejoiced and suffered. And by this magic link of sympathy we are made almost to forget that we are readers. We step down from our seat in the auditorium and mingle with the players. We, too, have a part in the performance. And when it is all over, when we have closed the book and put it by, do we look back on the characters as on the creatures of fancy ? Do we not rather regard them as beings that have lived, that are living still, in this or the next street, warm with our own lifeblood? How many Elizabeths are therethis dayin England? how many lonely little Catherines ? Has Cousin Phillis died with Mrs. Gaskell ? or are there no more Molly Gibsons in the world than she whom Roger Hamley married? It is to Mrs. Hardy's credit that she has in her present novel aimed at the higher sources of interest from which such characters were drawn. Nothing can be simpler than her story, -nothing more unaffectedly told. When we ask ourselves what it is that has carried us through a thousand pages of print, we do not recall a single instance of meretricious effort to keep alive our attention. Nor can the interest be said to depend much upon the plot. There is plenty of action, but it is not so built up as to create suspense or awaken curiosity; nor is the treatment of that dramatic kind which would supply the want -of an ingeniously-constructed story. Mrs. Hardy has evidently relied upon the development of character for her hold upon the reader, and her trust has not been vain. There is always a charm about rectory beauties and dashing young officers, and a stepmother like Mrs. Carlton cannot fail to please, if only for the generosity of a portraiture so opposite to the conventional type. A scapegrace son who nobly redeems his reputation is ,one of the most lifelike portraitures in the book; and though we cannot agree with Mrs. Hardy in thinking that a youth who forges his father's name to a bill of exchange, and breaks open his desk to get the money to meet it with, has fallen solely because he and his father never thoroughly understood each other, she yet asserts a golden truth when she shows the influence for good which a fine nature may exert over a corrupted one, if it will enter into its weakness and temptations, and respect it, fallen as it is. This is done with happy effect by Mrs. Carlton, and one of the most striking scenes in the novel is that in which she detects her stepson rifling his father's desk. Indeed, Mrs. Carlton is the second Providence of the story, and is only defective inasmuch as she is too good, and too ready to fly to the post of danger wherever it is to be found. One is apt to fear that the worthy rector, her husband, had a hard time of it with her reotless benevolence, and must often have wished that there had been a ninth beatitude in favour of wives who mind their own business. A similar tendency to excess is seen in the character of Madame de Fontaine. Was there ever such a wanton, purposeless old tyrant ? How much more effective would her daughter Adrienne's character have been had the foil come a little more within the range of nature! There are young women like Adrienne, but we have no belif in such an old woman as her mother; so powerful and petty, throwing away so much grand dominance of will on such miserable results, and out of a spirit of Christianity driving her daughter visiblyto destruction. Natural as Adrienne is, and interesting with all her waywvardness, she has an impossible look about her because she has not come to be what she is by a natural development. Indeed, the whole inner life of the family at the Manor House is an exaggeration, and we are puzzled to account for the apparent mystery which covers them in the beginning of the story, and the readiness with which they at once throw open the closet and exhibit the skeleton when Mrs. Carlton visits them. All this is the more to be regretted inasmuch as a more truthful conception of the French mother would have heightened the effect of the most skilfully developed character in the book, that of Adrienne, and would have added to the pathos of a catastrophe which is finely imagined and touchingly described. But notwithstanding these faults there is a freshness of feeling, a wholesomeness of moral atmosphere in this novel, and, above all, a sympathy with what is good and noble in human conduct which deserve the highest praise. We could wish that our lady writers would follow the example it sets of a reliance upon the best of our emotions, instead of pandering to the depraved taste which likes to gloat over some of the worst. No woman need blush to read it; nor will it be found dull, though the heroine is neither a bigamist nor a murderess. Its interest is drawn from the well of natural emotion undefiled, and it is fairly entitled to take rank amongst the most earnest and successful novels of the season.

A recent interesting Writer j has drawn an elegant comparison betwece the French and English, as they respectively exhibit the ebullitions of popular fury. He observes, that the French, though a courteous undrieking people, are yet so irreligious and immoral, that, under anger, they do not hesitate at any atrocities whatever. We think that pride, if it be * "Douglas's Reports, vol. 11. p. 658.' 1 "44 Geo. 111. ch. 77."

An Act of the 48tb of the King, cap. 127, (precisely similar to that of the 44th of the King) has legalised all Marrige soemnized in newly-erected Churches or Chqpels before the 23d August 1808" Mr. Seott, in 'Paul's Letter' p.4W u " isprin- unprincipled, assimilates, where it has power, the brutal instincts.

Where we think that this explanation is satisfactory, we shall hereafter mention; but it requires additions to be con plete. It was said (whether true or false we know not) that the Duke of Welling. too, when last at Cheltenhrm, honsoured a sparring-match with his pre sence, and observed, that " the custom oF boxing prevented assassination." Without approving a practice, unnecessary, as never common but in drunken frolicks, in tendency subversive of heighbourly and donestic relations, as well as various Cbristian virtnes, it certainly has the negative good ascrilbed to it by our illustrious General. The real cause, however, does not originate in the supposed principles of virtuous and religious forbearance, as impressed in modern times, and entorced by the customary abhorrence of murder.

Senators, mostly with impuniy, because none of them can be Tyrants, nor of course be universally detested;i and they disregard it, from feeing no important consequences: but of the Court of King's Bench there does not exist even a caricature. Whom only do Englishmen fear? Lawyers of all kinds. We think it, therefore, no impeachment to the national good sense, if a laudable fear of being hanged restricts an English mob from parading heads upon pikes. We have no opinion of the morals of mobs; all is pasuon. Under the influence of Revolt,tionary fury, the French political system may be assimilated to a volcano, and the natives to mad. dogs The burning lava of the for3ner desolated the neighbouring conun. tries; and the latter, to accompany its progress, rushed out in full disease, to envenoin the unfortunate inhabitants. Could we believe that such an Anarchy as that of France existed even in the lnfernil Re. gions, we should call the work now under consideration (inlrudcisve as it is) a chronicle of that liingdom of cvil; but, as we cannot correctly do this, it can only be sy led a Chancery Registration of pateut essential dou. bhe-distilled cruelly. A whole Nation appears to have adppted, upon prin. ciplles of choice, st uid, and profession, the manners and habits of lVilice-aif. ficers and executioners. This new office the) exercised with such bru. tality, that even Christianity, in its utmost perfection of pity, is coin. pelled, concerning the Russian and Waterloo disasters, to identify them with Robesipierrc; tmi say, in the words of his Epitaph, " Laument thenit notl for, if they had been living, thou wouldst have been dead." We have in English a ludicrous hook, called " The Ait of Torment. ing." That of the serious kind is a merit belonging to our Continenatal neighbours, as unrivaled as their cooker) and dancing. The extracts we shall soon give are superb specimens; and we can proudly contrast theni with the English treatment of the lallen Arch-fiend, %ho once led those inferior demnous, io divinejudg. ment, amrd biller mockery, lo tempo. rary victory. We use not too harsh language. The spider-killing gaoler io the old Story was a pitying saint to them. The education of Sovereigns should be consigimed to excellent Bishops, skilful Generals, and profound Law),ers, jointly, because their leading duties respectively bear upon each of the sciences which these persons profess; but Louis XVI. by the common error of considering book-instrqctiom and morals as sufficient, even where busines-alents are of the first moment, was filter for a Prelate than a Continental Military Sovereign. He trusted to virtue in a Nation wbere it had been long regarded a a superannuated quality. His holy claustral unek- mseekness su6wred the Revolution to ripeo and seed itself; in short, he had oot (in the military phrase) Devil enough for a situation which required the craft and vigilance of Fouche, and the energy of Buonaparte. Even Cesar could not succeed by opposing, Clemency to Treason; nor is it wise, unless the Nation has been previously disgusted by a Civil War, and the miseries of Revolutionary Anarchy are unpopular. Dethroned Sovereigns are, indeed, mostly murdered by way of preventing future trouble by adherents; hqt tbere was not the smallest political necessity, not " the Tyrant's plea," for lorturing- this unfortunate Martyr to Government upon paternal princililes. It was a base method to confound in vulgar opinion simple Royally with Tyranny, where veugeance would be fair; but they have lonbeen gluttons in misery and war. For the next century, they ought to be governed (were it possible) by Quakers only. We recommend to their priests, at an excelleuut penance, the Injunction of wearing the broadbrimmed hat, and coats without capes, in mortification of their gaudy costumes; and an obligation to act upon the principlesof thisphilanthropicand picific sect, in punishment of their sanguinary propensities. We now give the Extracts; and will they prove the pretensions of a great hation to extraordinary illumination, even to the unquestionable Ritghs of Ma,., rights of humanity, of fellow-beings? No;-uhey show only the school-boy pinning cock-chafers; tormenting helpless animals from mischief. The Extracts all refer to the period when the Royal Family were imprisoned in the Temple; and all their power was gone. For some nigbts," says the Valet, " was obliged to make the Dauphin's bed, with sheets that bad holes in many places." P. 120. " Papers w-re left in the sight of the King. and the walis chalked, ' Trembe, TY rant; the gullotline is perusauat."' P. 124. " We were scarcely seated, when a head, on the point of a pike, was held to the window. Tisoa's wife gave a violent serean, which the murderers su1pposed to have proceeded fronm the QUeen, and we heard the savages laugh- ing immoderately. JmagWinff that her MAjesty was still at dinner, they placed their victim in such a mauner, that it could not escape her sight. The head was the Princesi de Lamballe's." P. 153. " One Simon, a shoe-maker, and mw nicipal officer, would frequently say to the Valet, so near as to be heard by him, ' Clery, ask Capet if he wants any thing, that I mayn't have the trouble of coming up twice."' P. 166. " A door-keeper, named Roches, when the Royal Family went out into the garden for exercise, ran down before them, and fixing himself on one side of the last door, with a long pipe in his mouth, puffed the fumes of his tobacco at each of the Royal Family as they went out, and most at the Queen and Princess. Some National guards, who were amused with these indignities, burst into fits of laughter at every put of smoke, and used the grossest language. While the family were walking, the engineers assembled to dance and sing: their sonwere always revolutionary; sometimes also obscene. Thus was the short airing allowed to the family turned into torture." Pp. 168, 169. "Tue abolition of Royalty was proclaimed with sound of trumpets under the tower. Some municipal officers at the time were sitting near the door, and stared the King in the face with a malicious grin. The Monarch perbeived it; but, having a book in his band, continued to read, without suffering the smallest alteration to appear upon his countenance. The Queen displayed equal resolution; not a word, not a gesture, escaped either of them, to increase the malignant enjoyment of those men." P. 172. " From the hour of the Queen's being brought to the Temple, they had seen her devoting her life to the care of her son; and in his gratitude and caresses finding some alleviation to her wretchedness: they took him from her, and that without any previous notice. -Her affliction was extreme." P. 188. " The daily papers were restored to the Royal Family, that they might see the execrations against the King." 1'. 191. "They took away the King's razors, and his beard had been very troublesome to him. He was obliged to oatbe his face in cold water several timesa very day. 'I 1, Clery, took the libierty of suggesting that, if he would appear, as he was, at the assembly, the people would at least see with what barbarity the Council-general had acted towards him.' 'It does not become me,' said the King, to take steps to excite commiseratiol"' Pop. 231, %32 When " When the King was on the scatold, he pronouneed distinctly, in a loud voice, ths memorable words, 'I die iue e qf all the crimes laid go my cArrge: I p rd she- . then w h have occaimned my &WA; and Iprsy to God, Mt the blood y.. -gegetked asy never be ofuitd on France."' P. 294. How fearfully has Providence avenged him on the wretched Reoluti~onary dupes! " When they carried the Queen to the Conciergerie, 'they put her into the dirtiest, dampest, and most unwholesome room in the house. Girts tied together in several places with ropes, on a paltry frame, a decayed paillasse, a ragged mattress, and an olit worn-out dirty blnket, composed the bed of the Queen of France." P. 312. " But the treatment of the Dauphin, a child of exlg dgAt yeers old, exceeds all. He was shut top alone. He lay in a bed that had not been made for more than six months, and be had not strength to do it for himself. It was covered with ea and bug, and his linen and person were full of them. They had not changed his shirt or stockings for more than a year. His excrements remained In his chamber, and had never been carried away during all that time. His window, fstened with bars and padlocks, was never opened; and it was impassible to remain in his chamber, from the poisonous air." P. 329. To this affecting Narrative is prefixed a good engraving of the poor Xiu I and a vignette of his last interview with bis family.

178   5141110   An Address to the Right Hon. Lord Byron; with an Opinion on some of his Writings.
Nov 20, 1819  ENGLISH LITERATURE - History and Criticism - 19th Century
The Literary chronicle and weekly review, May 22, 1819-Dec. 28, 1822 1 : 27 421 - 421
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I An Address to the Right Hon. Lord Byron; with an Opi- 1 nion on some of his Writings, By F. H. B. Sonnets and Odes, Elegies, Ballads, and Sketches, chiefly Descriptive. By William Linley, Esq. and the late Mr. diaries Leftley. 12mo. pp. 199. London, 181 J). In this little work there are, as the title expresses, the poetical productions of three persons. First comes F. H. B. with au admonitory address to Lord Byron, in which he regrets his lordship's desolation of heart, aud that his pen, so powerful, is not oftener employed in thc cause of virtue, since, as the author observes in one of his notes, such a genius, united to such powers of persuasion, would, in a good cause, give an influence almost irresistible, and of which the poet and his admirers might be equally proud. The poem itself, which is very short, is evidently written with the best intentions towards his lordship, and with a strong admiration of his talents; and it is by no means without poetical merit. The poems by Mr. Leftley, consist of sonnets, odes, &c. This gentleman was parliamentary reporter to the Times Newspaper, aud died in 1797* in the twenty-seventh year of his age. He was the school-mate of Mr. Linley, who has given his effusions to the public with a brief memoir ofthe author. In speaking of these productions, we do not forget the hint given in the prologue to the Fisherman's Hut, which it was attempted to fasten on poor Tobin;? ' Though living merit well may critics dread, Yet sure their candour will protect the dead, And envy's self permit the flow'r to bloom, That only sheds its fragrance on the tomb.' Mr. Linley, with the partiality of friendship, has eulogised Mr. Leftley's poems very highly; and, although we cannot agree with him in assigning him4 a place in the first rank of modern poets,' yet we will admit that there is considerable strength of language, and an originality of conception in ? many of his pieces, and that his allusions are generally classical, and frequently instructive. There is much beauty and delicacy in the following:? ? SONNET. Pardon that absence, mistress, which ortended, And think what fears to servitude belong ; Indeed, indeed, my love, I meant no wrong,? My thoughts, at least, upon your least attended ; But had 1 come the merry guests among, Though by your smiles and cheering care behiei icJ, How sadly would my sighs* and tears ha\e blended With their wild mirth and Bacchanalian song! Hard was the task, and painful to forbear, When every social charm at once invited ; And sad the contrast of such social fare, To sit alone in the miners gloom benighted ; But, lo ! you weep; nay, if my griefs you share, By such compassion 1 am well requited.9 We now come to Mr. Linley, who apologises for placing his trifles by the side of Left ley's superior productions. These trifles, as the author so modestly calls them, are principally descriptive sketches, written during a residence in India, or when on thc voyage. Thc author is, we believe, brother of the once celebrated singer, Miss Linley, who married the not less deservedly celebrated Mr. Sheridan. He is, we believe, the composer of several excellent pieces of music, and it is a subject which might be likely to inspire his muse with peculiar energy ; wi* select, as a specimen, one of his monthly sketches, which is on that subject :? < MARCH. MUSIC. Friend of my youth, soother of every care That crossed its flowery path ; O ! may'st thou lo ig, With all thy tenderest eloquence of song, Beguile life's sorrows ; from my bosom tear Each stormy passion that its rest invades. Lull'd by thy strain, a sad remembrance steals Into my thoughts, and tor a moment fades Hope's fairy prospect from my longing sight; For then my mind a mournful impulse feels To dwell on days, long lost, ot past deli-ht, When by my father's side I bent mine ear To sweet instruction in thy winning art. And shall I check the sigh, suppress the tear That Hows from filial love, and stills my throbbing heart > Ah ! no ; for ever let me turn to thee, Delightful power of harmony, And, from thy ever varying measure, Snatch the purest sweets ot pleasure, In strains that bid grief's wilder tumults cease, That warm to piety, and soothe to peace.' As a whole, this a very pleasing little volume, and many of the pieces possess considerable spirit and poetical beauty.

I\ Vb' We ask, again, whether it is possible to suppose 1\1r. Canning absurd enough to uwrite the letter ascribed to him, through any provocation contained in the sulpl)ressed(l pamlhl)lelt?

Can Mr'. Cantning's amil)ition be so mean, thatWhile list:cnitv senates hung on ,ll lie sp)okc, The club niust hail hinii master of a jole ? The thlinlg is absolutely impossible; and for this reasoni, in addition to the former oic, " Mr. CanilI(g':s Letter" is A FOO 1c rit.

Otmt was " rittell' widl cl.alh, i. thu vi;4, jc But it is that alone, which we have extracted above, which can explain the use of the word " assassin," in the pretended letter of Mr. Canning; and the reader should be told, that in the perfect copy, this passage is immediately subjoined to the paragraph ending with the word s -, to push this petricious mockery ." We have intimated, that with respect to the more innocent parts of the " Suppressed Letter," they contain nothing, but a piece of violent scolding and abuse of Mr. Canning, dealt out to hinm bv a " Countryinman. Between the two, the public nmust choose. Mr. Canning has spoken a speech which his " Countryman" disapproves; and, on this account, his " Countryman" has written a letter, which the public may or may riot disapprove in its turn. Mr. Canning,'s " Countryman" assumes, that " the general tone of the discourse was intolerable in the apologist and defender of depravity." Now, here, a principle is obviously begged. Mr. Canning's speech was a speech in defence of " (lepravity," or it was not. How far his " Countryman" is a competent judtge, of what is and what is not depravity, the reader, after listeninr to that "^ Countryman's" thoughts on AsAsrss-NATIoN, may believe, that hie is well entitled to determine for himself. The doctrine of assassination muist I)e oeneral; it cannot apply to particitlar stations nor pl'rsoits onliv. The orarl lSSA:SSl' I will douhtlessly tell u1s, that the act has its laws and (qualificatiolis: lie will tell us, probablv, that assassinat ion is nevcr to be committed wrongfully,v-never upon an innocent persol,---l)but always ini the sole case, that a scinse of' wrongr is first enttrtamled: hut the sens;e of wrong' is entertajlteti uponi all soits of occasions; there are all sorts of wrongrs,-wron~s public-wrongs private--N.rons political-wrongs civil-wrongs domestic -- wrons from our rulers-wrongrs fromn OaiFr neilhbours-wrongs from those nearest to us in iul) Id, froin those drl( is t to ui s in a'fectioul : but the sense (f' any of these wrongrs-wroags sustainedl in any of these rclcationsmust ie\ us the irigt to 1)he a sias ins. It follows, that the pract ice is not liitited to the eaxset of u and their ininisters, 1bt,1. must. 1.; ctjimillv lawful as atItlw' tiL *fitis and lid !.Ihoulrs, all r I broblri ;l i '''4"t II '"I 1 (I Ic II dren, husbauids and wi' 1 1astcZI. and servan i its, -a s si-ssi i a t o i i s br all ; and VtIg -L4) -t I;ett -t' J,|jjoj, -( : - - .i-ir "I t'' R-t.i i th I THr0 .S, I m Its I & I A i I' )II, Svc , II O\ TY1 , I II'.IIt one scene of blood and violence may rightfully " uproar the universal world." Such is the moral systern of this declaimer against depravity! Such is the moral worth of this chastiser of Mr. Cannin"'! Suich are the well-digested notions of the mian, who, in the " Suppressed Letter," dares to uplift the rod of moral criticism! Such, too, are the doctrines that are spread abroad by the retailers of politics for the people; and yet these fellows, called, by themselves, philanthropists and patriots, turn round, and reproach us with the increase of crimes! They break up the fountains of the great deep, and then wonder at the deluge which succeeds! It is thus that we are enabled to weigchr in the balance the pretensions of Mlr. Canning's " Countryman," and the I)retensions of all that school of politics, of inorals, in which hie has been bred, and which now extults in its pupil! For the rest, the Speech and the Letter are equally in the possession of the readers of the literary Journal, and equally open to their judgment. The British public is often called a thinking public. and an enemy to all frivolity, and it is our wish to treat it accor(lintlv. It' it go up to the original sources of ihitormation for itself; and let it never be frivolous enough to rest conitented witli the partial statenients, (1' ijidividual opinions, of ally w-riter of any political persuasion.

To correct this propensity he fell on tlie following scheme : He made out Xi will; bequeathing to her all thc china winch should be found in his possession at his death. The lady was immediately cured of her passion for china ; and indeed we do not re collect healing of a more delicate and ingenious mode of reproof. in I7d>l, Mr Home published b.ia 44 le .-a vs on the Piinciplcs of Moralit- -md Natural Religion."

Whatever in&tituliotis were formed for the piomotiou e>f letter?, of thc art*, or of pubic improvement, bc appears always as a leading member. So extensive was his patronage of liteiature, that Smith, many years afterwards, when pi tlie height (if hi> reputation, is aid to have expressed himielf thus, " We innot every one of us acknowledge Kaimcs for our master.'' Ile wm one of the nu st active member.; in the select Society, instituted in I Tot, ol which an account is given by l\lr Stewart in his life of Robertson ; and where he was accustomed to np-pce frtcpient extempore speeches.

Amid ail his other business, he was constantly accessible to the meanest of tnu.e persons who had any petition to present to that board: and his lobby in the morning v.as generally thronged by them. Ile promoted agriculture not by his encouragement ?'nly, but by his example ; and, by ?-:nt of philosophical observation, attained such skill in it as to be able to write thc best book on thc subject wdiich was extant at the time.

Beyond the Gates. Bv Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. (Chatto & Windus.) It was inevitable that The Little Pilgrim should invite imitation on both sides ot' the Atlantic ; it was almost equally inevitable that the imitations should fall far short of the original. Miss Phelps's failure?for such it is?may act as a wholesome warning to others to refrain from a subject which requires for its treatment a delicacy of touch, a refinement of thought, and a chastened imagination which few possess. If the book does this, it will not have been written iu vain. That it can serve any other good purpose we venture to doubt. Mr. Matthew Arnold has just been telling us that " the materialistic future state, the materialistic kingdom of God, of our popular religion, will dissolve like ' some insubstantial pageant faded;' " but Beyond the Gates opens to our view only an extension of our present world, differenced by some of the features of a theatrical fairy-land. Discussions, it seems, will go on (on this point Milton and Miss Phelps concur), the phraseology of religion will survive, and even lovemaking will be conducted according to the old mundane models. Here is a scene in the far-off land:? " Lifting up my eyes, I saw him whom I remembered close beside me. We two were alone in the wide, bright field. All Heaven seemed to have withdrawn to leave us to ourselves for this one moment. I had known that I might have loved him all my life. I had never loved any other man. I had not seen him for almost twenty years. As our eyes met, our souls challenged one another in silence and in strength. I was the first to speak. * Where is she ?'?* Not with me.' * When did you die ?' ?' Years ago.' ? I had lost all trace of you.'? ' It was better so for all concerned.' * Is she? is she?'?' She is on earth, and of it: fhe has found comfort long since; another fills my place. I do not grieve to yield it. Come!' 'But I have thought?for all these years?it was not right?I put the thought away?I do not understand? ' ' Oh, come! I, too, have waited twenty years.' . . . 4 For how long?am I to come ?'?' Are we not in Eternity ? I claim you as I have loved you, without limit and without end. Soul of my immortal soul! Life of my eternal life! Ah, come!'" If Miss Phelps's spirit when "beyond the Gates " held converse such as this with her lost love, was it worth while to repeat it? The same sort of thing is to be found in half the novels published outside those Gates. The truth is that, in her anxiety to invest our future selves with something more than that " kind of nebulosity " which surrounds them jn the popular imagination, she has but peopled the other world with very commonplace mortals, and vulgarised scenes which those who have visited them have forborne to describe. " Where wert thou, brother, those four days ? He told it not; or something seal'd Tho lips of that Evangelist." There are, of course, many pious thoughts and familiar texts of Scripture scattered over the pages of Miss Phelps's book, but, as the following passage shows, the authoress is not more of a theologian than she is of a metaphysician :? *'When I felt the spiritual flesh, when I used the strange muscle, when I heard the new heart-beat of my heavenly identity, I remembered certain words, with a sting of mortification, that I had known all my life, and paid so cool a heed to them: * There is a terrestrial body, and there is a celestial body.' The glory of the terrestrial was one. Behold, the glory of the celestial was another. St. Paul had set this tremendous assertion revolving in the sky of the human mind like a star, whioh we had not brought into our astronomy." Now it is hardly necessary to say that if St. Paul had used the words which are here put into his mouth there would have been no great difficulty in understanding them. What the apostle does say is something very different?viz., that the body assumed?not after death, but after resurrection?shall be "a spiritual body." And on this paradox the writer's experiences " beyond the Gates " have no bearing and throw no light. It will, we fear, shock some of the pious people who read this little book to hear that the Gates are not so strictly kept as to exclude either Loyola the Jesuit or Darwin the agnostic. Nay, it is even suggested that in the world of shadows the creatures of imagination may perhaps have a place, and that one of the pleasures of eternity may consist in making personal acquaintance with Faust and Juliet, Don Quixote and Dinah Morris, Col. Newcome and Sam Weller. Who can dogmatise upon such an important point? Miss Phelps knows as much as we do about it or?as little. Charles J. Robinson.

College Girls. By Abbe Carter Goodloe. Illus- trated by Charles Dana Gibson. (Downey & Co.) ?These studies of life in an American ladies' college are full of vigour and fun, and the author is evidently determined to be thoroughly modern. Some of the slang is new to ordinary English readers?"got the cinch on the rest of us," 44 there was an awful muss." It seems quite fitting that the author's name should raise a doubt whether one should speak of him or her. He or she will, perhaps, like to know that the Langham Hotel is in the western postal district of London, not the west central, and that 44Dr. Bernardo " should be Dr. Barnardo. That girls in American colleges work hard and learn a great deal English readers know very well, and they will be delighted to hear further that the girls have plenty of amusement and are keen about athletic sports. The author gives an engaging picture of the whole thing, and the illustrator adds to the reader's pleasure by his cleverly drawn sketches, though his girls would be more attractive if their heads were smaller and their legs longer.

REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. Harold the Exile. London, 1810. 12mo. 3 vols. The mysteries of books of poetry, romance, or fiction, whilom assigned to their stories, are now, it seems, (a rising fashion,) transferred to their title-pages. Don Juan, a blushing profligate, steps into the world without a name; and Harold the Exile, as if equally reprobate, appears without the Christian formality of Sponsor Publishers to undertake for the offspring of Father Author. Are the guilty parents of these bantlings really ashamed of their offences, or are these but tricks of pretended modesty, like those which the confirmed prostitute or hoary pander annme to attract the idle and deceive the unwary? Be that as it may, Harold the Exile has no need of the veil which waa, however thinly, thrown over, thc origin pf Juan, lt is not immoral, nor indecent, nor profane: but it is insinuated to have more truth in relation to actual circumstances, than is usual with novels (to which class it belongs), and the writer, perhaps, felt, that though he was unprincipled enough to betray the confidence of private life, he was not bold enough to outface his infamy. We are, indeed, incompetent to say whether there ia any ground for this rumoured reality or not; whether Harold has any genuine resemblance to Lord Byron, or Lady Marchmont to the Countess of O-; whether what we read is truth embellished with fiction, or the latter alone, pretending to the garb of truth: the tale must lose its picquancy in our review, for we can neither point the scandal nor vouch for the facts. It may be that the whole is an attempt to delineate character, and that all the fable is suppositions; or it may be that life has produced something like foundations for the errors, loves, intrigues, and adventures ascribed in this work to the celebrated individual, whose writings and whose conduct seem destined at once to delight and to disgust the world; whose picture, in our minds' eye, is like that figure of print-shop notoriety, of which one half is woman iii the bloom of char ms and splendour of decoration, and the other half skeleton?even so with the noble lord whose god like genius is combined with second foul moiety, so ghastly in its corruption, and so abhorrent to humanity, that we shrink at the contrast, and loath while we admire.* * With regard to his latest sin against morality it is curious to note, that it may have been suggested by the following Jeu d'Esprit, which appeared in the Morning Chronicle about two years ago. DON JUAN. Don Juan was a Libertine, And lived in tbe city of Cadiz; When he went out to dine, be dreit very fine, And when he had stow'd away plenty of wine, A courting he went to the ladies. Don Juan, whom nothing could tame, His amours they were so many, So out of pure shame, he at length chang'd his name, But his vices continned precisely tbe same, Though committed by Don Giovanni. One night, when 'twas dark as pitch, He heard a soft-sigh from a window, If from poor or rich, he did not care which, For the moment he heard it he felt the same itch, Beginning to burn like tinder. " Is it my loved Honore?" Said Isabel, sighing above, I Quoth he, " Yes?sigh no more, but open tlie door, I've been waiting below for these two hours and more, So pray let rae now come in, love." She screamed, and, to combat her foes, Papa came in the foremost; Dom Juan arose, but ere out he goes He dealt her poor father a couple of blows, Which laid him as dead as a door-post. Don Juan felt no remorse At the murder'd Don Benedict's doora, While a mighty concourse, on foot and on horse, Assembled to follow the princely corse, And a Statue was plac'd o'er his tomb. Here often fair Isabel came, Sure sorrow could never be truer, Till a sight of the dame once more raised a flame, And Don Giovanni astonished the dame, By boldly attempting to woo her. He smother'd her cries with kisses, Albeit the damsel forbade him, Quoth he, my dear mistress, what happiness this is,1 To meet once again, what adelicate bliss is? When tlie Statue began to upbraid bim. When we express our dislike to books of the description of this Harold, we believe that we are only assenting to the opinions of all the virtuous and wise. That they can do no good is obvious, and that they cannot do much harm is only a palliation. They certainly administer to the basest passions of the little vulgar and the great; and their extensive popularity is to be traced to the paltry motive of silly curiosity, or the less innocent taste for slander. We do not mean to assert that this novel inculcates immorality; on the contrary, it is sentimentally obstreperous on the opposite side; but we fear that rectitude has no great chance of having its cause advanced " Don Juan," it said, " be civil, Thou art a sad profligate sinner, Your soul is so evil, you'll go to the Devil"? Says lie," my old Buck, I'll give you a revel, If you'll but accept of a dinner." " I accept your offer"?the Spectre said,. " (And Satan shall be my proxy.") Juan called up Ned, ere he went to bed, And bespoke a dinner, a guinea a-head, And then went away to his doxy. To the dinner room Don Juan goes, And with him led his priest in: There the Spanish Beaux, all as hungry as crows, Were assembled together in Sunday clothes, Impatient for the feasting. Don Juan waited for one guest moie, And while they stood debating Thc clock struck four, when rushed open the door? " Ah ha!" says Don Juan, "you shall pay your score, For you've kept us prettily waiting." " Peace," said the Spectre,?an odious smell Pervaded thc room in a minute, The guests all fell, but no one could tell, What was the cause of the shocking smell, But 'twas terribly bad to stay in it. " Thou Don Giovanni,?Don Juan, On the brink of a precipice sporting? Of fathers you slew one?brought their daughters to ruin, And every evening have found out a new one, But now there's an end of your courting." Don Juan he touched with his dart, His eyes goggled out of their sockets, His nerves sorely smart, and asunder they part, And the skin and the bones and the skele. ton's heart Went to hell in a bundle of rockets. by the jnere words of an advocate whose whole design is a violation of propriety. Harold is introduced by some letters signecM/tcia,and the framework of the piece consists of this person and a Lady Gmeeting, near the Lake of Geneva, a dving recluse of the name of Delamere, whom they carry to their cottage, and nurse into health. Alicia is a sympathizing soul, and gets so far into the Inroguito's good graces that he tells her his story, which she tells to her friend, and thus we learn that the impassioned, melancholy, wanderer is no other than the famous Lord Harold, who has exiled himself from his wife in consequence of an amour with the Countess of Marchmont. The principal features of the hero's life arc, that he is the son of an ancient and noble race, whose father 13 dead, and his mother as indulgent and affectionate as she is amiable and intelligent. At Oxford, he is seduced into licentiousness by a companion called Berrington, who is represented as a calculating, cold-blooded, vicious scoundrel, nulla virtute redemptum. \ The orphan daughter of an old friend, j Gabrielle Montgomery, oft the death ot her another conte9 to reside with lady Harold, and Harold falls in love with her. This first love is mutual, and bids fair to be happy, but Tho coarse of true love never did run smooth: . . Berrington by his artifices (one of which, the exhibition of his victim walking with two* harlots in the park, is rather a coarse one) breaks up the match, and carries his ^deceived friend off to Sicily. Here he stib/ nits him to the fascinations of a female . profligate as unprincipled as himself, and what with misrepresentations,-bruin fevers, the non-delivery of letters (a lesson to every br.e to send these sort of things by the regular post-office, instead of biiking'the revenue and trusting to their friends), accidents, and the well-known machinery of a i ovel, Harold falls a prey to the arl* of Lady Marchmont, and Berrington marries Gabrielle. * " Let u3 all be unhappy together", might .serve as a motto for the sequel. Berrington'* infamy becomes known to his wife, who dies of a deep decline, attended by Harold in her last moments, and anticipating a renewal of their ill-fated affection in Heaven, if he can steer clear of the fascinatidns'ofLady M. Berrington i-s killed in a dael by the brother of a girl he had seduced. Harold marries Lady Emily Desmond, but circumstances, and those sure ingredients of romance, the resolution of heroes and Leroines never-to be explicit, never to tell what they are about, never to justify themselves however shrewdly anei reasonably suspected, and to act precisely as no other beings would act, involve matters so capitally that Harold suspects his wife of infidelity, she is convinced of his intriguing with Lady i?I-, he shoots Fitzalbin her fancied admirer, and she resolves to be separated from so unprincipled a person. I He goes to France?she to Ireland. He is cast for 10,0001. damages for crim. con. and she resolves never to sec him more. One would suppose that our higher circles were so virtuous that no man durst show his front after seducing his neighbour's wile; for the author makes Lord Harold so odious and so alive to the detestation which he feels to be attached to him, that he Hies like a despairing monster, and haunts all sorts of deserts and woods to hide himself from the scorn of man-andwoman-kind. This, we are sorry to say, is violating probability. The novel is in many parts spiritedly written, though superabundant in modern sensibilities miscalled sentiment. Elsewhere it is deformed with illiterate blunders. We have "to retributc errors," " who still laid insensible," " scarcely less injerior," &c.; faults which the writer ought assuredly to have been aware of aud avoided. A few extracts will afford our readers au opportunity of judging for themselves of the author's general qualities: The death of Gabrielle. After a slight repast, the ladies withdrew to the chamber prepared for them, and about midnight, when the storm abated, Colonel Leslie likewise retired; hut Harold, who was not disposed to sleep, continued in the library,and lost in reflection,listened to the receding thunder as it rolled awfully away, till all was hushed in silence, when Hinging himself upon a sofa he gradually sunk into a slumber. His sleep, however, was of that broken! and unquiet kind in which realities and chimeras are confounded together; and the crude disjointed images which occupy the imagination take their colouring from recent events or actual objects, that operate upon the senses without dissipating repose. The scenes of the preceding day again! passed before Harold, attended with all! those incongruous and inconsistent circumstances, which frequently accompany the dreams of uneasy slumber. Suddenly, the visionary objects of his sleeping fancy assumed a more regular and decided form, and supposing himself in the situation in which he actually then was, he fancied thc door which lcd from the library into the gardens, was gently opened, and a figure clad in white and Ho wing robes, resembling Gabrielle, entered the apartment; who, on beholding him, seemed to start with surprise; then softly approaching the sofa where he lay, remained for some time in an attitude of fixed and earnest < onteniplaliun. He attempted to risc and address her, but the powers of speech and motion seemed suspended; and he continued, he thought, silently to survey the form of Gabrielle, for such he was now convinced it was; when, after gazing upon him foran interval, whose continuance he was unable to inter- rupt by any perceptible mark of recognition, he beheld her kneel beside the couch* while with folded hands she appeared to murmur a prayer, of which he could not perfectly distinguish the purport; then suddenly rising, she bent over him as he lay, and he distinctly felt the soft pressure of her lip upon his own. The touch awoke him, ami starting up, he perceived by the dim light of an half-extinguished lamp which was burning in the chimney, the form of his visionary slumbers standing a few paces from the sofa; but ere recovered recollection enabled him to frame a mode of address it had disappeared; and, but for the sound of the closing door, and the waving of a white robe as it passed rapidly along, ne would have believed himself still under the influence of his supposed dream. For some moments after the departure of his mysterious visitant, a thrilling sensation ot superstitious awe deprived Harold of all power of exertion; hut reason soon dispelled the transitory emotion,and snatch* ing up the expiring lamp he hastened in pursuit of the figure, of whose actual appearance he no longer entertained a doubt. In crossing the hall, he again caught a glimpse of it ascending the stairs, and with quickened step proceeded forward; but ere he reached the top, his light was extinguished, and he hesitated whether or not to relinquish his design: an emotion compounded of something more than mete curiosity compelled him to proceed; and guided by the glimmering light which was partially admitted through its high arched windows, he entered one of those long corridors common in Italian mansions, where various passages branching off in different directions are calculated to embarrass and mislead a stranger, as Harold might with propriety be termed ; since, though be had been so frequent a guest during the residence of the Marchmont family at the villa, he knew nothing of the building, which was extensive, beyond that portion of it appropriated to visitors in general. He now stood uncertain which way to pursue, when the sound of a closing door caught his ear, and hastening forward in the direction from whence it seemed to come, he proceeded down a long and winding passage, at tbe termination of which was a door, which he found fastened, apparently by a spring within. Every effort to open it was ineffectual; and relinquishing his adventure in despair, Harold slowly turned away, and attempted to regain the stair-case, with an intention of again proceeding to the library. But unacquainted with the intricacies of the different passages, he soon became completely bewildered; and having at length, bj groping along the walls, discoverea an entrance into a large apartment, he flujg himself upon a seat, determined to remain there till the increasing light should enable him lo retrace back the way he had come. More than an hour had beeB passed by Harold in this situation, when the moon breaking through the dark clouds which had hitherto obscured its lustre, shone fm into the apartment, and by discovering to I him a door opposite the spot where he was1 sitting again revived the hope of being ex-j tricated from his present unpleasant di-: Hastily unclosing it, he found himself in j an oratory, anil as he snatched a transient' glance within, every other consideration was absorbed, when, extended upon the! floor, her head resting upon the step of the : altar, and habited in the same dress as that in which he had recently fancied he i beheld her, the form of Gabrielle met his! astonished gaze. A book of devotion re-' mained open on the altar, near which a taper was still huming, and the moon-; beams fell strongly upon her countenance,' as, with arms folded on her bosom, she lay, apparently in a profound sleep; and, but for the drapery, which enveloped her figure, and the dark luxuriant ringlets which had escaped from thc confinement of her head-dress, she might have been' taken fora statue, so perfect was the delu- i sion her appearance created, thc silvery [ rays which gleamed upon her face andi hands, giving them an exact resemblance1 to the purest Parian marble. J Petrified with surprise, Harold surveyed j her for some moments, when, fearful of the j consequences which might ensue to Ga-' bridle in her present delicate state of| health, from a longer continuance in her | present Situation, he endeavoured, by aj movement which occasioned a slight degree of noise, to awaken her from her dangerous slumber. Alarmed at finding the attempt > ineffectual, he then ventured to address j her; but Gabrielle still continued motion- j less, and believing she had fainted, Harold ' hastily approached and took her hand. Its' cold and death-like touch seemed to con-: geal the tide which circulated in his veins,' and, seized with a sudden and involuntary terror, he called aloud for assistance, while , he remained rooted to the spot where he j stood, as immoveable, though not as void of perception, as tho form before him. \ His cries soon awakened thc colonel, and J Miss Berrington, who rushed half dressed into the apartment, followed by Xannetta and her daughter, whose repose they had likewise dispelled. A few words from Harold"explained the meerie before them; and on conveying the inanimate form of Gabrielle to the next room, it was too soon Perceptible that the pure spirit which it had once enshrined, was Hed for ever. The anguished exclamations of those around first conveyed to Harold an idea of the went, and an enquiry of " Is she dead ?" burst from his trembling lips, as Colonel Leslie again entered the oratory, where delicacy had retained the former while the usual remedies were applying to effect the recovery of Gabrielle. Colonel Leslie was usable to reply, but he mournfully shook hw head, in token that all was over. "She is not dead ! she cannot be dead !" ? jjWically exclaimed Harold ; and breaking from"the hold of the colonel, who inetl'ec. July sought to detain him, bc rushed norn tlie oratory into thc adjoining apart- 1 ment, where the remains of the lovely Ga1 bridle had been placed upon a bed, with j Charlotte and Nannetta seated weeping beI side them. j Convinced beyond the possibility of a : doubt, that she was indeed gone for ever, ( Harold gave way to an agony of despair. | The marriage of Harold and the ', death of his mother is also powerfully painted. i It was not till the evening that the bridal ! party assembled in the old chapelof thecas' tie of Hani var, for the performance of the marriage ceremony,and the scene presented ; within its hallowed walls, was atonce pleasing and affecting. The building itself was , ancient, and the fantastic wreaths of ivy that entwined the lofty windows but partially admitted the beams of the setting sun upon the groups beneath them, The hack part was occupied by the tenants and ' domestics of Lady Harold, all habited in i their best attire, and decorated with the [ gayest dowers of the season. In the centre I were the young girls who had boen edu1 catedby her ladyj-hip'sbencvolence, dressed | in white, each with a nosegay in her hand, j to present to the bride; who, simply robed . in muslin, spotless as the snowy breast it j shaded, and graced with no ornaments but those of modesty and beauty, stood by the | altar, between Lord Temora and Lady Bar? bara. On the other side was Harold, ac1 companied by his mother and Everard I Desmond; and the intermediate space was ! filled up by the friends who had been inj vited on thc occasion. A profound silence reigned around; and ' while the venerable pastor of Llanivar, in ' an impressive tone, read the sacred office, : which unites two beings in pure and indis' soluble bonds, and sanctifies the law of nature by religious rites, the tears of deep , emotion stole down the changing cheek of j Lady Emily, and thrilled the soul of Harold with a secret and indefinable: awe. But, ! even at this eventful moment, the memory i of the past obtruded itself upon him, and, ' for an instant, disturbed his tranquillity. Directly opposite the spot where; he stood was a private: door, through which l^ady Harold and Miss Montgomery had been accustomed to enter, when they came to perform their devotions on Sundays or festivals. To this door Harold, unconsciously, directed his eyes; and, on beholding it cautiously unclosed by one of the bystanders, to admit the air, the idea of Gabrielle was immediately associated with thc object before him, and so strongly was his imagination impressed by this trivial circumstance,that. heal most fancied he beheld her advancing through the aperture to forbid those vows he hud once hoped to have pledged to her alone. Thc raininess he iiad hitherto maintained now deserted him. His recollection became bewildered?his gaze imperfect; the igures around him j-cemed to recede from his view, and thc priest had twice deI maiided ;-n assen!, to the short hm important iciitcuiT-ui.icl. ('?:..!??! !-i* ',f'?Hiv m. Lady Emily's, before he could articulate a reply. A penetrating glance from Lord Temora recalled his fleeting faculties, which were completely restored by observing the agitation impressed upon the pale countenance of his intended bride: and, as ho placed the nuptial symbol on her trembling hand, his heart fervently vowed to fulfil all the duties of which he had now given her the sacred pledge. (Jn leaving the chapel, the youthful maidens, who had received from the bounty of Lady Harold the benefits of a religious and useful education, pressed around Lady Emily with their vernal offerings, which were received with a condescending smile, and an expression of thanks. Scarcely, however, had the youthful pair returned to the Castle, and received the congratulations of their assembled friends, when an incident took place which converted the scene of festivity into one of distress and lamentation ; so frail and uncertain is the tenure of all sublunary enjoyment, even at the moment when its possession appears the most assured. With her arm entwined in hers, Lady Harold was standing by a window, cheerfully conversing with her lovely daughter, when suddenly her countenance changed, and staggering backwards a few paces, she sank from tlie feeble grasp of the terrified Lady Emily upon the floor. The scene which ensued needs no description; every means were used to effect her recovery. and signs of returning life again animated her languid frame ; but thc opinion of the medical gentlemen, who had been summoned to her assistance, confirmed the secret apprehension entertained by Harold, of his mother having experienced a second paralytic attack, of a far more serious and alarming nature than the former, which seemed to affect in an equal degree her corporeal and mental faculties. It is scarcely possible to conceive a change more striking and sudden than the one which took place at the Castle of Llanivar; where a view of the splendid preparations for the bridal festivities, rendered the distressing reverse still more awful and afflicting. The sumptuous ban3uet was removed untouched, the rustic ance of the tenantry upon the lawu abruptly broken up, and the guests who had been invited to grace the nuptials, gradually withdrew from a scene where each one felt his presence was now an intrusion ; Lady Barbara, secluded in the apartment of Lady Harold, was engrossed solely by her attendance on her suffering friend, and every countenance in the little group assembled in the so lately thronged and brilliant drawing-room was expressive of every feeling but that of joy. Terrified and depressed by the recent event, which came -.Uh an additional shock upon her feelings, at the moment when the consummation of her heart's dearest wishes had overwhelmed her with unexpected felicity; Lady Emily, silent and pale, clung to Harold tor that support which he required himself; and which Lord To- mora and Desmond, shocked and confounded by this unexpected incident, were equally unable to bestow. All was sad and silent throughout thc spacious mansion; where, a few hours before, everything wore the aspect of mirth and gladness; and the horror-struck domestics, as they glided with noiseless steps through the deserted apartments, seemed like so many pale spectres re-visiting the scene of former joys. "And this is my wedding-day!" mentally exclaimed Harold, as he passed through thc splendidly decorated ball-room, in his way to his own apartment, and felt the sense of his present singular situation increased by a view of the scene around him, where splendour (as if in mockery,) reigned amidst loneliness and silence. " This, he repeated, " is my wedding-day, and the images of dismay and death which now environ me, may, perhaps, only prove the melancholy omens of my future years. Heaven grant, lovely Emily, that the malignant star which rules the destiny of Harold, may not extend its fatal influence to thee." Thus passed the bridal eve of the young heir of Llanivar, and the fair Lady Emily Desmond; nor did the succeeding day bring with it brighter prospects; for though Lady Harold had regained, in some measure, the powers ot speech and recollection, no hopes of a permanent recovery could be entertained ; and the idea that she might continue for some time in her present state of joyless existence, was not calculated to convey comfort to the bosoms of her sorrowful friends. These passages must suffice; and more would be unnecessary, as we (iud that this publication is floating on the full tide, and, quickly as we try to have our reports heard after every sufficient explosion, it is likely that a great majority of our readers will be familiar with Harold the Exile, before they are acquainted with our observations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FAR FROM THE MADDLNG CROWD. Far From the Madding Crowd. By Thomas Hardy, Author of ' A Pair of Blue Eyes.' Smith, Elder, and Co. Without making minute comparisons between Mr. Hardy and any of his contemporary novelists, let it suffice to say that this last work of his at once lifts his name above the crowd, and gives him a position among the eminent few which it rests with himself to confirm or to diminish. Mr. Hardy is not a novelist to whom the exercise of his art is a bywork or a recreation; it is clear that he has given his best energies to its service, and has worked with faithful and patient zeal for his reward. It is pleasing to meet with work that is so obviously the outcome of high aims: and one should not be grudging in expressing one's conviction of the artist's thorough success. 'Far From the Madding Crowd' is not Mr. Hardy's first novel, but it is so much more mature and powerful in every way than his earlier efforts that in them he seems rather to have been exercising himself with a view to obtaining a command of his materials. This is particularly true of 'Under the Greenwood Tree,' published some two years ago, which the author called "' A rural painting of the Dutch School," and in which he depicted rural life in an English county with the most loving minuteness and intimate fidelity of detail. ' A Pair of Blue Eyes,' Mr. Hardy's next effort, was not so exclusively pictorial; it was a study of a more tragic kind, with more complex characters and a more stirring plot; but the evolution was none the less deliberate, and every situation was worked out with the same painstaking and searching method. Both 'Under the Greenwood Tree' and 'A Pair of Blue Eyes' are very remarkable novels, which no one could read without admiring the close and penetrating observation, and pictorial and narrative power of the writer. But 'Far From the Madding Crowd' is not only an advance upon them in freedom and firmness of handling, but it excels them also in concentration of interest, and in spacious breadth and solid truth of proportion. When the first chapters of ' Far From the Madding Crowd' appeared in the Cornthill Magazbine, a supposition was started that this must be a new novel by George Eliot, and the point was very generally discussed. Indeed, if those chapters stood by themselves as a fragment of unknown authorship, no conjecture could be more plausible: they deal with the kind of life that George Eliot has more than once chosen to describe, to which, in fact. she has almost acquired a prescriptive right, and the opening description of Farmer Oak is a portrait very much in her manner. If the critic cared to go into minute corroborations of such distinguished parentage, he would find them in the incidents of Bathsheba's unpacking the mirror and taking a survey of her beauty while waiting on the top of the cart, and her higgling over twopence with the toll-keeper: these little incidents have a delicate spice of malicious truth to nature which one often finds in George Eliot's pictures. At the same time, if we had read 'Mr. Hardy's previous novels, we need have had no difficulty in tracing the authorship of ' Far From the Madding Crowd,' for Mr. Hardy's style is his own and sufficiently distinctive to be easily recognised. One might mistake a detached portion of his work for George Eliot's, but when it is viewed as a whole it has a good many striking points of difference. Mr. Hardy is not such a master of language as George Eliot: his style has not the same freshness, nor the same eloquence and momentum. And this difference of style goes along with a more deeply-seated difference of matter: Mr. Hardy is much less of a preacher than George Eliot; his interests are more exclusively dramatic, he is absorbed in delineating character and tracing the workings of passion by minute touches, and does not withdraw from his dramatic work to deliver his soul of pent-up reflections. With all George Eliot's impartiality towards her creations, and her desire to represent each one's life truly as it is, nothing extenuating nor setting down aught in malice, the heart of the preacher is to be detected in her choice of subjects: her characters derive a large part of their interest from their opinions and views of life. Now the drama in Mr. Hardy's novels is in no sense a warfare of opinions or ideas: it is a warfare of persons, persons moved by the primeval motives of love and jealousy. Far From the Madding Crowd' is concerned with no deeper mysteries than women's hearts, and how they are lost and won: its story lies in country fields and farmhouses, and occupies itself solely with the secular and social life of the inhabitants. Whether we regard this as a merit or a defect or a matter of indifference depends entirely on our conceptions of art and its functions: but if we hold no dogma concern - ing the functions of art, and approach Mr. Hardy's novel simply as a drama, willing to believe that it need not be frivolous because it has no great lesson to teach, it is impossible not to recognise the novelist's power. The plot of 'Far From the Madding Crowd' is of the simplest kind. Mr. Hardy's art does not lie in the multiplication and complication of incidents, but in the searching and complete way in which he traces the effect of each incident upon the thoughts and feelings of his personages. The central figure all through is Bathsheba Everdene-a marvellously well-drawn and difficult heroine, who unites +'ha iunlits of her Biblical namesake to an inner nature - Is ' ,- - _ I_ Ius Maut VL inne fak curiously compounded of shrewdness, strong-mined IranKness and courage, and decorous, imperious, wayward womanliness. The two little incidents that occur on her first introduction to us -her satisfied self-inspection in the mirror, and her obstinate refusal to give the toil-keeper what he asked-at once give us the clue to two sides of her character. The novel may be viewed as a history of a struggle between impulsive womanliness and worldly good sense, all Bathsheba's troubles coming from her beauty and consequent waywardness and vanity, and the rectification coming from the homelier side. When we first see her, she is on her way to live with an aunt, in whose neighbourhood lives a shepherd farmer named Gabriel Oak. Oak was a sturdy, capable fellow, neither ugly nor particularly well-looking, who had raised himself by thrift, sobriety, and superior knowledge of his work, from being a common shepherd to having a farm of his own. He naturallv fell in love with Bathsheba, and the account of h1i; dre'in before going througlh the momentous ceremony of making a formiial proposal for her hand. will give an il1ca of the diflicultv the novelist undertook when lhe proposod to show how this uncouth farmer did ultimately succeed in winniwg the beautiful heroine: Ho had watle a toilet of a nicely adjusted kind-of a nature U etwveen the ( :trefully neat and the careles.ly ornate-of a degree between tine-market-day and wet-Sunday selection. Ile thoroughly cleaned his silver waweh-ehain with whiting, put new lacing straps to his bouts, lookedl to the brass eyelet-holes, went to the inmost bheart of the p'.antalii n for a new walking-stick, and trimmed it vi-orously on his way back ; took a new handkerchief from the Lottoul of hi~s clotj&s-hoX, put on the light waistcoat patterned all over with sprig-i of an elegant flower uniting the beauties of both rose andl lIlj without the defects of either, and used all the hair-oil LI [OS3CSSiCd upon his usually (Irv, sandy and inextricably curly hair, tii1 he hadi deerened it to a splen(lidll novel colour, between that of Zuano an(l Romnlan cement, making it stick to his head like mace round a nutweg. or wet seaweed round a boulier after the ebb. How Bathshloba. with her rare b)eauty, could be brought to rost hier affectiol.is onl this lionest, uncouth fellow is the Eliticult prob1)leui that Mr. Hardy has applied himself to ;olve. andl has :solved satisfactorilv, without investing the poor shepherd with any more lheroic qualities than the -?onstanec and lbusiness capability of Jacob. There is not i1wch bieyond the interest of paradox in the problem itself but the p.1th to it lies through regions of tragic perturbation-Batlhshe )ba's mnind is tamned and cleared b)v means of pity and terror. And it is in following the dark ways of tragic passion that Mr. Hardy's power makes itself most unquestionably felt. Bathsheba is conquered by one Ser,reant Trov. a soldier. who brings to bear upon her womanly weakness mucnh subtler clharims than the romantic fascinations of scarlet and steel, though these also were ingredients in the spell. With their union the tragedy begins-a story of the simplest kind. hut told with wonderful power. The -broken-hearted (leatli of Trov's other mistress ; the frantic despair of another lovser of Bathsheba's: her discovery of her husband's duplicity, and the revulsion of her feelings. form scenes which are wrought out with a sure knowledge of the uttermost depths of passion. The strength of the (Ioadly conflict shines out all the more luridly from the quiet of the rural background. Behind all the tumult and agony, and walking through the midst of it unscathed, we see Gabriel Oak steadilv pursuing his honest. faithful course. by slie-r fi(lelity and capability commending himself to the more sober instincts of Bathsheba. and building a harbour of tranquil attachluent in which she findsx shelter when she o'eapes from the storm into which her vanity and waywardneps had tempted her. In these limits it is not easy t.) follow Mr. Iarld's delineation of character and passion in suflicient detail. anwl thuzs givo an adequate idea of its s;ubttlety andI foreo. His dsecriptions of natural phenomena llbo want spocial conSitleration. But perhaps enough has t)beell sid to show thlat Far From the 'Maddio Crowd ' is no orilinary novel.

From the Heart of the Rose. By Helen Milman (Mrs. Caldwell Crofton). We hesitate to say that anything which Mrs. Crofton writes is superfluous, yet there are chapters in this book to which no other word would so well apply. The sub-title reads : " Letters on Things Natural, Things Serious, Things Frivolous." These letters range over a variety of subjects, from Matthew Arnold's poems to Mr. G. F. Watts and Magazine Clubs. Many of them were letters received by the author, and included in this collection because, no doubt, they appeared to her to have intrinsic interest. Some of them have, notably one from Mrs. Ritchie, which gives certain particulars about Thackeray's method of writing; others have not. Why " Monica's Tea Party " was included we cannot conjecture; the chapter consists merely of a foolish piece of dictation, which, we are told, was set at the tea-party. But there are things in the book which are quite pleasant, and occasionally delightful. The garden chapters are nearly all good, though we seem to detect a lack of the freshness and friendliness which were conspicuous in In the Garden of Peace. The fact is, that too much is being written about gardens; the subject is too elusive to give any steadiness of inspiration; hence* we are nowadays getting book after book which talks of flowers without giving us any of their exquisite suggestion. Now, Mrs. Crofton does sometimes give us that suggestion ; and it is because she does that we wish to see her more careful of her delicate talent. (Lane. 5s. net.)

ST'. RONAN'S WELL. nY THIE AUTHOR OF "' WAVERLEY," &C. Tiiis novel is, in most points, the Antipodes to its predecessor. Compared with Quentin D)urward, it is evening after the brilliancy of noon, -a simple melody after the clangor of martial inusic,-a quiet tale of fami.liar life after the mnagniflcence of a foreign pageant. It seeks no aid from historical association, from the remembrance of great names or heroic deeds, from the pomp and circum. stance of chivalry, or even the majesty of nature. It is a domestic tragedy, appealing to the heart from the narrow theatre of a deserted village, surrounded only by the scenery of pastoral life, and pictures of loneli. ness and decay. Its incidents are neither numerous nor uncommon; its range of character is rather limited, and the personages of the story, with the exception of the principal, are of that uninteresting cs, that come like shadows, and eepmart without exeitiar any wish for their stay, or any an#icty for their return. And yet this retired and insulated scene is 80 chequered with the lights and sliadows of a poetical imagination,-this domestic story so diversified with scenes of humour or tenderness, and occasionally with darker pictures of impassioned and tragic eloquence, that, even when we are disposed to regret the absence of the brilliancy of effect to which we have been accustomed, we must express our special wonder at that creative alchymy of genius, which, from these simple and unpromising elements, can extract a compound of so much interest and beauty. Still, however, to confess the truth, wve are disposed to regret that the author should have quitted the high ground of historical romance, to (lescend into die humbler arena of novel writing. Every one must have felt that it was there he stood alone; iWitated, et inimitable. It was this tha calle 'feoth rtbat singular coMiatitz of power. which charactirizeM the Author of Waverley. The novelist can' bend 'his characters fid incidents to hiS ownV peculiar habits of thought, and tilge his work with the colouring of that one master-feeling in which he feels his own SUpI'riority: but he who adventures on the field of historical delineation, and looks on the varying passions and strange anomaliesof this world as they really exist, has need of powers, subtle, yet comprehensive as those of Nature herself; andl here it is that the immeasurable superiority of this author to his rivals is most visible. In the possession of some one qualification, in the delineation of some one solitary feeling or passion, he has been often equalled, sometimes excelled. In humour, he must yield to Sinollet and Fielding; in stern painting of mnisery and mental desolation, to Go~dwin; and in deep feeling, to the author of Anastasius: but who, since Shakespeare, has blended, in one bar. mnonious whole, so many varied powers aud scattered excellencies-such acute and unwearied observationsuch profound antiquarian knowledge-so deep a sympathy with all that is generous and noble-such powers of mingled pathos and humour-of splendid painting an(l picturesque description ? Beneath his touch, forgotten generations live again. He breathes on the dry bones, and animates the skeletons of history. Every scene, which he has touched on, is so much ground redeemed from the waters of oblivion a Point d'arpui, to which we can refer, with ihe confidence of acquainttance, amidst the dimness of historical recollection. Philip de Comines may slumber in peace, for his occupation is gone; the monastic tyrant of France has found a greater annalist. Can all the lore of Rymer or Gervase place before our eyes the state of England, under the LionHeart, with the graphic fidelity of Ivanhoe ? The foibles of the Maiden Queen-the learned folly of Jamesthe versatility of Buckingham-the bonommie of Charles--are they not inseparal4y associated with Kenilworth, and Nigel, and Peveril ? Shakespeare and the. tnknown are the true historaus of England; and we cannot willingly consent that the latter should abandon his high and undepsate4 prerogative, to occupy a field, where, if he cannot intct with a superior, he must at least cxpect to find a rival. But to coie, to tlit' point, (for really we have no time for digression,)- St. Ronan's lVell, -we must say, has, in soine measure, disappointed us. Something of this migIt. be owingl to the discovery that this romantic title refers only to the hxinours of a watering-place, aikd somethingn more, perhaps, to that taste for splendour and courtly inagnitbcence which the author hinisel'f has fostered, and which inay have par. tially impaire(d our relish for Tile common tlh- 1iits of mnother carth, 11er simplest mirthl alnd tears ;" but still, for the credit of our own taste, we must hold that the construction of the plot is rather uiisatisfactory-ftlat tdh coterie at the Well arc a tiresome set-an(l that even the hero and heroine of the pite-c are by no means very striking or iiiterestiing portraits. Our iin pressioim certainly is, that the wholc dramnatis personte, with the exception of the old lan(llady and the traveller, are but sketches ;-sketchle., no doubt, of masterly power arid freedoom, ara(d as superior to the finished conipositions of ordinary lvriters, as an outline of Raphael or Michel Angelo to the most elaborate effort of weaker heads or feebler hands, but still sketches, in relation to that standard by which no author can in justice refuse to be tried-his former works. Wire have always held it bad po. licy for all parties, to attempt any analysis of the plot of a popular novel: it is mortitying to the reviewer, who knows that his precis is not looked at by one in twenty,-and tantalizing to the reader, who ac. quires about as correct an idea of the spirit of the book from such a diFeut, as an intended purchaser might nave done of the house of the pedant, in Hierocles, from the specimen brck which the proprietor carried in his pocket. e sh all therefore take the liberty of assuming, what we dare say is pretty near the truth, that the majority o! our readers are as well acquainted with the plot as ourselves, and comprebs, into a few a. tenc, all tle information with Whic& ,,we think it llnibc .sair to pretace the specimen We intel)(1 to quote. Be it known, thenr, that the little village of St. Ronan's is sitLuate(l about thirty miles fromn tlEw I)lish frontier; that in consequence of dlie erection of some fashionable buildings round the mineral well in tle neighbourhood, and the increasi n celebrity of the waterin?..-place, it had sunk into a gradual andl complete decay; the old residence of the Mowbray family, the Lords' of the Manor, having dwindled into an imn, graced by the effigy of St. Rtoinan catching hold of the devil's leg with his episcopal crook, and dignified, from that circumstance, with the title of the Cleikum of Aulton. This tenement is inhabited by Martha lDods, a fiery old landlady, whose peculiarities of temper, blended with real goodness of heart, are brought oult, a little too fully, perhaps, but certainly with great spirit and effect, and whose principal characteristic is a most unbounded conten)Jpt and. dislike to the whole rival establishment of the Well., and. the strangers within its gates. Among the occasional visitors at the WVell are the two last members of the "house of Alowbray, with whose fortunes, or rather misfortunes, the whole web of the story is connected. Johln, the brother, is a ruined gambler, rash, rude, and obstinate, with scarcely a redeeming feature about his character, save some touch of brotherly love and kindness for the unrepining companion of his misfortunes, his sister, Clara Mlowbray, round whom some early sorrows have tihrown a mysterious interest. What those incidents were which had tihus blighted her prospects, we could hardly hope to render intelligible in any outline which we could afford to give : suffice it to say, that, through the treachery of a friend, the lady badl committed an error personwe, and married one brother, when she intended to marry another; and that her distresses are caused by the total wreck of her early hopes, and the oevival of those clahims which her Pretended husband had at the time been compelUed to abandon. The 1ifacult a aracter of the heroine 'is touched 'with great delicacy. The slight tinge of insanity which shades her mind, -her apparent gaiety, when forced b)v the officious kindness of her brother int6 the giddy circle at the lrell, -her hopeless, silent melancholy at lhome, and her tender attachment to her brother, are finely confcived and executed. 'Throughout the whole, it is on the scenes between the brother and sister that the deep interest of the story rests; and We doubt if the author, in his happiest moods, has ever written any thing su. per or to the one we are about to quote. Lady IPenfeather, the Priestess of the Spring, by the incautious disclosures of an absent clergyman, who had celebrated the marriage between Clara and the pretended Tyrrel, beCORICS ac quainted with some particu. lars of the story, and drops some hints on the subject in the ball-room at St. IRonan's, which reach the ears of John 'Mowbray, just as his passions lhad heen unusually excited by the loss of his whole remaining property at play. In a state approachil)g to dldirium. he returns, with the speed of lightning, to his residence at Shaw's Castle, to interrogate his sister. He prefaces the inquiry by announcing that he is a ruined man, and that the last hope he had entertained of bettering his fortune, by an alliance with Lord Etberington, had been extinguished by her obstinacy. " I am glad of it, with all my spirit," said Clara; " may it take with it all that we can quarrel about I-But till this in. stant, I thought it was for this very point that this long voyage was bound, and that you were endeavouring to persuade me of the reality of the danger of the storm, in order to reconcile ine to the harll ur." Yi You are mad, I think, in earnest," sidd Mowbray ; " can you really be so absurd as to rejoice you have no way left to relieve yourself and me fromn ruin, want, and shame ?" " From shame, brother ?" said Clara. "No shame in honest poverty, I hope." "That is according as folks have used their prosperity, Clar.-1 must speik to the point.-There are strange repot go, ing belowv-By Heaven I they ae enough to disturb the ashes of the dead I Were I to mention them, I should expat our poor mother to enter the rGoW.-mClara Mowbray, can you guess what I On " It was with the utmost exertion, yet in at faulteritig voice. that she was able, atf ter an inefflectual eU'ort, to utter the monosyllable, " No !". " By Heaven ! I am ashained-I am even aafrd to express my own meaning! -Clara, what is there which makes you so obstinately reject every proposal of marriage ?-Is it that you feel yourself unworthy to be the wife of an honest man ? -Speak out !-Evil Fame has been busy with your reputation-Speak out !-Give me the right to cram their lies down the throats of the inventors; and when I go among them to-morrow, I shall know how to treat those who cast reflections on vou ! The fortunes of our house arc ruin. ed, but no tongue shall slander its ho. nour.-Speak - speak, wretched girl! why are you silent ?" " Stay at home, brother," said Clara; "stay at home, if you regard our house's honour-murder cannot mend misery stay at home, and let them talk of me as they will,-they cannot say worse than I deserve !" The passions of Mlowbray, at all times ungovernably strong, were at present inflamed by wine, by his rapid journey, and the previously disturbed state of his mind. He set his teeth, clenched his lhnds, looked on the ground, as one that forms sone horrid resolution, and mutta-red almost unintelligibly, "; It were cha. rity t!) kill her." " Oh ! no-:no-no !" exclaimed the terrified girl, throwing herself at his feet; " do not kill me, brother. I have wished for death-thought of death-prayed for death-but oh ! it is frightful to think that he is near-Oh ! not a bloody death, brother, nor by your hand !" She held him close by the knees as she spoke, and expressed in her looks and ace cents the utmost terror. It was not, in. deed, without reason; for the extreme solitude of the place, the lateness of the hour, the violent and inflamed passions of her brother, and the desperate circumstances to which he had reduced himself, seemed all to concur to render some hor. rid act of violence not an improbable termination of this strange interview. Mowbray folded his arms, without unclenching his hands, or raising his head, while his sister continued on the floor, clasping him round the knees with all her strength, and begging piteously for her life and for mercy. " Fool !" he said, at last " let me go ! -Who car for thy worthles life ?who cares if thou live or die? Live, if thou canst-and be the hate and son of every one else, as much as thou art mine !" Ile graspewd her by the shoulders with one hand pushed her from him ; and, it. she arose from the flor, and again pres. ed to throw her arms around his neck, he repulsed her with his an nd wad. with a push-or blow-it might be term. ed either one or the other, _ viole enough, in her weak state4 to have again extended her on the ground, had not a chair received her as she full He looked at her with ferocity, grappled a moment in his pocket; then ran to the window, and throwing the swn violently up, thnwt himself as far as he could without fall. ing, into the opxen air. Terrified, and yet her feelings of his unkindness predominating eveni above her lebars, (Clur continued to exclaim, " Oh, brother, muv you did not mean this !-Oh, siy yon did not inean to strike me !-Oh, what. ever I have deserved, be not you tl ex - ecutioner !-It is not manlygit is not natural-there are- but two of is in the World !" lie returned no answer; and, observing that he continued to stretch himselt' from the window, which was in the -w. cond story of the building, anud overlooked the court, a new cause of apprehension mingled, in some measure, with her per. sonial fears. Timidly, and with streumni. ing eyes and uplifted hands, she approuch. ed her angry brother, and fearfully, vet firmly, seized the skirt of his coat, as it anxious to preserve him froim the efflu of that deslpar, which so lately seemed turned against her, and now against him. self. Hle felt the pricsure of her hold, and drawing himself angrily back, sked her wternly what she wanted ? " Nothing," she said, quitting her hold of his coat; " but what-what did he look after so anxiously ?" " After the devil I" he answreod, fiercely: then drawing in his head, and taking her hand, " By my sul, Clarit is true, if ever there was truth in such a tale !-Ile stood by me just now, and urged me to murther thee I-What elc could have put my hunting-knife into my thought ?-Ay, by God, and into my vry hand-at suCal a moment P-Yonder I could almost fancy I we him .y, the wood, and the rock, and the water, gleaming back the dark.red funmW4bt, that is shed on them by his drgon wings By mny soul, I can hardly suppose it ten. cy lI- can hardly think but that I was under the influence of an evil splrt--..w der an act of OiendFh o ns !

" Clara," he said, after a pause of mournful silence, " we must think what is to be done, without passion or violence-there may be something for us in the dice yet, if we do not throw away our game. A blot is never a blot till it is hit-.dishonour concealed, is not dishonour in some respects.-Dost thou attend to me, wretched girl?" he said, suddenly and sternly raising his voice. " Yes, brother-yes indeed, brother," she hastily replied, terrified even by delay again to awaken his ferocious and ungovernable temper. " Thus it must be, then," he said. "You must marry this Etheringtori there is no help for it, Clara-You cannot complain of what your own vice and folly have rendered inevitable." " But, brother-" said the trembling girl. " Be silent. I know all that you would say. You love him not, you would say. I love him not, no more than you. SNay, what is more, he loves you notif he did, I might scruple to give you to him, you being such as you have owned yourself. But you shall wed him out of hate, Clara-or for the interest of your family-or for what reason you willBut wed him you shall and must." " Brother-dearest brother-one sin. gle word !" " Not of refusal or expostulation-that time is gone by," said her brother. " When I believed thee what I thought thee this morning, I might advise you, but I could not compel. But, since the honour of our family has been disgraced by your means, it is but just, that, if pos. sible, its disgrace should be hidden ; and it shall,-ay, if selling you for a slave would tend to conceal it !" " You do worse-you do worse by me ! A slave in an open market may be bought by a kind master-you do not give me that chance-you wed me to one who " "I Fear him not, nor the worst that he can do, Clara," said her brother. "' I know on what terms he marries; and, being once more your brother, as your obedience in this matter will make me, he had better tear his flesh from his bones with his own teeth, than do thee any displeasure! By Heaven, I hate him so much-for he has outreached me every way-.that methinks it is some consola. tion that he will not receive in thee the excellent creature I thought thee !.-Fall. en as thQu art, thou art still too good for him." Encouraged by the more gentle and almost affectionate tone in which her brother spoke, Clara could not help say. ing, although almost in a whisper, 'i X trust it will not be so-I trust he will consider his own conditions honour, and happiness, better than to share it with me." " let him utter such a scruple if he dares," said Afowbray-" But he dares not hesitate-he knows that the instant he recedes from addressing you, he signs his own death-warrant or mine, or per. haps that of both; and his views, too, are of a kind that will not be relinquished on a point of scrupulous delicacy merely. Therefore, Clara, nourish no such thought in your heart as that there is the least possibility of your escaping such a mar. riage! The match is booked-Swear you will not hesitate." " 1 will not," she said, almost breath. lessly, terrified lest he was about to start once more into the fit of unbridled fury which had before seized on him. " Do not even whisper or hint an ob. jection, but submit to your fate, for,it is inevitable." " I will-submit._." answered Clara, in the same trembling accent. " And I," he said, " will spare youat least at present-and it may be for ever-all inquiry into the guilt which you have confessed. Rumours there were of misconduct, which reached my ears even in England; but who could have believed them that looked on you daily, and witnessed your late course of life ?-On this subject I will be at present silent-perhaps may not again touch on it-that is, itf you do nothing to thwart my pleasure, or to avoid the fate which circumstances render unavoidable.-And now it is late-retire, Clara, to your bed -think on what I have said as what necessity has determined, and not my selfish pleasure." He held out his hand, and she placed, but not without reluctant terror, her trembling palm in hi. In this manner, and with a sort of mournful solemnity, as ir they had been in attendance upon a funeral, he handed his sise through a gallery hung with old family-pictures, at the end of which was Clara's bedchamber. The moon, which at this moment looked out through a huge volume of mustering clouds that had long been boding storm, fell on the two last descendants of that ancient family, as theY glided hand in hand, more like the ghosts of the deceased than like living persons, through the hall, and amongst the por. traits of their forefathers. The same thoughts were in the breasts of both, but neither attempted to say, while they cast a flitting glance on the pallid and decayed representations, " How little did these anticipate this catastrophe of their house !" At the door of the bed-room Mtowbray quitted his sister's hand, and said, " Clara, you should to-night thank God, that saved you from a great dan. ger, and me from a deadly sin." I will," she answered. " I will." And, as if her terror had been anew excited by this allusion to what had passed, she bid her brother hastily good-night, and was no sooner within her apartment, than he heard her turn the key in the lock, and draw two bolts besides. '; I understand you, Clara," muttered Mowbray between his teeth, as he heard one bar drawn after another. " But, if you could earth yourself under Ben Nevis, you could riot escape what fate has destined for you." The tottering reason of Clara is overset by the shock of this fearful interview. She wanders out from her room in the darkness of a stormy November night,-overhears the confession of her early companion, who had occasioned her misfortunes,-and dies almost by the side of Tyrrel, who, like her, had been the victim of that imposture. Of the secondary clharaiters, that of thc traveller Touch woud appears to us by far the most spirited and successful. There is infiuite humour in his introductory visit to MIr Cargill, the absent clergyman, who, by the bye, is first cousin, at least, to Dominie Sampson ; in his interview with Jekyl, and in the conversatioj with Mowbray, where he diclosses his relationship. 'I'he party at the Well are no favourites of ours;-Sir Bfingo Binks (a vile name) and his lady are mere supernumeraries ;-Win. terblossom is a go(xd sketch, but nothing more. The only member of the coterie, who seens to have any thing original about him, is Captain M'Turk, the Carauza of the party, who is labouring eternally to involve his acquaintances in duels, that he may act as second, and always ready, where the principal fails to alpear, to supply his place. On the whole, though the composition of the work bears obvious marks of haste, and must have been a mere delaosement to the author, after the more laborious efforts which have preceded it, the tale is evidently that of a master hand-bold and decided, even in its least flnished do. signs, and superior to others, even when inferior to itself.

I Autobiography and Reminiscnces of Sir I I I DotL8 aF(rayth. Edited by his Daughter. | a (Bentley.) This book is a good specimen of the performance of a difficult task. The impediments which attend the writing of a man's life by a near relation have passed into a commonplace; and Miss Forsyth is entitled to respectf il commendation for the way in which she has encountered them. The story before us is told, so far as possible, in the words of the hero; and the few remarks which the editor has considered indispensable are marked by good taste and self-control. Forsyth was one of those men, not uncommon in the old Indian services, who, without any exceptional ability or high previous training, were developed by the conditions of the cAreer. At Rugby, where he was contemporary with many men who have since risen to high distinction, he did not come prominently forward; being noted-so far as he was noted at all-for an amiable, honourable boy, rather lazy, and very good-looking. At Haileybury he did much better, coming out, ultimately, at the top of his term. With this prestige he landed in India, personally recommended besides to the ardent and ambitious Dalhousie. Failing to satisfy the great pro-consul, Forsyth fell into the shade for a while. But chance brought him a speciality -that opportunity for want of which many a clever man, in these days of divided labour, is doomed to live and die unknown. Being Deputy Commissioner of the Kangra Valley, he was much struck with the appearance of a number of Muslim Tartars who came down into that district from Central Asia for purposes of trade. Then came the Mutiny. But the memory of these people seems to have been fermenting in his mind.. Years after, when he went to Jalandhar as commissioner, the Kangra Valley was one of the districts subject to his control. He now re-opened the question; and he found that the strange visitors came from Yarkand and Kashgar, where a Mohammedan conquest had taken place some years before, the Chinese authorities having been expelled by followers of the Propbet from Kokand. This revolution had given a stimulus to the trade; and Forsyth endeavoured, though vainly, to interest Lord Lawrence in the matter. Nothing daunted, he went to Leh in 1867; and he was so satisfied with the result of his inquiries there, that he resolved to establish an annual fair at Palampur, where he invited the Yarkandis to come down and exchange their carpets and other produce for Indian tea. Led thus to study Central Asia and its affairs, he obtained sanction from Lord Mayo, and in 1864 repaired to London for the purpose of submitting his views to the government of Great Britain. The Duke of Argyll, then Secretary of State for India, received him coldly; but Lord Clarendon took a different view. Under instructions from the Foreign Office, Forsyth proceeded to St. Petersburg, via Constantinople, and successfully conducted a negotiation which was the original basis of the demarcation of the Afghan frontier recently concluded. This intelligent and happy idea was also the foundation of Forsyth's own fortunes. He returned to India, at the close of 1869, highly recommended to the government by Lord Clarendon. Shortly afterwards he was sent by Lord Mayo to make further examination into the Central Asia trade question, and to visit Yarkand for that purpose. In this he was highly successful. To quote the words of a paper of the day: "The double journey of two thousand miles between Lahore and Yarkand and back was successfully accomplished in six months, over the highest tract of country in the world." Then followed another difficulty with the government of India, more serious than that which has been noticed as occurring at the outset, in Lord Dalhousie's time. A band of excited peasants having caused anxiety in the Southern Punjab, a Mr. Cowan, Deputy-Come missioner of Ludhiana, proceeded against and captured a body of them encamped in the small independent state of Maler Kotla, on the borders of his district. Forsyth, who was then Commissioner of Ambila and Mr. Cowan's official superior, wrote to him, directing him to try his prisoners, but not to put any sentence in execution till he (the commissioner) should arrive. Mr. Cowan put the letter into his pocket and blew from guns some fifty of these unhappy bumpkins. Forsyth then wrote him a second letter, in whicb, instead of a reprimand or a call for explanation, he conveyed approval of the insubordinate and sanguinary act. The government of India, on learning these facts, dismissed Mr. Cowan from the service and censured Forsyth, who was removed from his commissionership l and pronounced unfit for further employment that might involve political action. The assassination of the lamented Mayo was followed by the viceroyship of Lord Northbrook, and Forsyth was sent back to Yarkand i-this time not merely for commercial enquiry lbut on a special mission. This was, to a certain extent, a reversal of the previous order; but it is obvious that the word " political " has two senses. A Punjab commissioner has political powers which I essentially differ from those of an envoy sent ito conclude a treaty of commerce with a foreign government. For the latter Forsyth had already proved his fitness, for the former -as it was thought-he had not. The second mission to Yarkand was in. teresting, and might have been important. Bat, as we now know (though the book before us gives no hint of it), the whole thing came to grief through circumstances quite beyond British control. The tenacious Chinese were even then growing the crops that were to furnish the commissariat of an avenging force. When the crops were all ripe along the line of march the Chinese troops advanced, occupied the country, slew the Muslim usurpers, and resumed the government of Yarkand and Eastern TurkistAn. The trade route is now closed; and the fair of Palampur is at an end. In 1875 Forsyth went upon another mission, which, in spite of his temporary success, has proved equally ineffectual. With his usual combination of tact, suavity, and real shrewdness, he concluded a treaty with the King of Barma, whose son is now a dethroned prisoner in British India. In the following year he quitted India, and in 1876 retired from the service. The short remainder of his life was chiefly passed in railway business, in pursuance of which he visited Lisbon and went back to India for a few months. He died, somewhat unexpectedly, at Eastbourne, in the last days of 1886, leaving behind him-in the language of the Zime8 obituary-" the ideal of an English gentleman." Formerly, the administrative work of India was either in bad hands-when it was not done at all; or it was in exceptional handsfor which nothing was impossible. In this latter case the very difficulty of the work created the power of doing it. We can hardly miss the lesson of such a life as Forsyth's. Rebuked by Dalhousie, coldly treated by Lawrence and Argyll, censured and punished by a later local government-his buoyancy, self-reliance, intelligent views, and sympathetic manners, enabled him to surmount every obstacle and carry all his responsibilities to a happy conclusion. At the outset of his public life he laid down for himself three rules, extracted from his diary by the pious care of Miss Forsyth (p. 282), and when we read the words we cease to wonder at his success. Those who enjoyed the privilege of his friendship will recognise the sincerity with which they were recorded. Young men entering the India Civil Service can hardly do better than study the life of Douglas Forsyth in the light thus thrown upon it by im elf. .-- -- - - -r -- -r -o H. G. KEENEr,.

THE LITERARY EXAMINER. Life of General Sir William Napier, K.C.B., Author of| 'History of the Peninsular War,' &c. Edited by I H. A. Bruce, M.P. In Two Volumes. Murray. From "The Eagle's Nest," at Celbridge, near Dublin, as their home was popularly called, on account of the remarkable features and high spirit of the Napier boys, there issued a brood that filled the world with their fame. Without specifying their several claims to distinction, though the names of at least three of them are written most conspicuously in their country's annals, we shall content ourselves with the subject of the present memoir, whose life alone exemplifies the bright career of a gallant soldier, a liberal politician, an eloquent historian, and a man of almost universal attainment. He was the third son of Colonel and Lady Sarah Napier; his father an officer of great capacity, his mother a woman of distinguished beauty and rare mental endowments, qualities which all their children inherited, and William in an eminent degree. Born in 1785, his youth, as his biographer remarks, fell in troublous times; but if untoward for domestic comfort, they were well fitted for preparing the fighting Napiers for the life of contest which awaited them. When the insurrection of 1798 broke out, Colonel Napier fortified his house against the threatened attack of the insurgents, and armed his five sons in its defence, William being then little more than twelve years old, an early initiation for the profession of which only two years afterwards he became a member. Obtaining a commission at the age of fourteen, and his only schooling having been received at the village of Celbridge, his education, as may well be supposed, did not make much progress; and it, therefore, surprises us little to be told that the letters which he wrote at this time were, as regards writing, spelling, and expression, those of a very ill-taught schoolboy. But William Napier's eagerness for knowledge, his perseverance, and his power of self-discipline were so great that, though he never was perfect in spelling he soon educated himself to become, eventually, one of the most eloquent writers of his time. He first entered the Royal Irish Artillery, was soon after transferred to the 62nd Regiment, reduced to half-pay at the peace of Amiens, and a few months later restored to full pay in the Royal Horse Guards, Blue, the regiment of his uncle the Duke of Richmond, which he joined at the age of seventeen. But at the instance of Sir John Moore, who was then forming his celebrated experimental brigade at Shorncliffe, William Napier, anxious to make himself a real soldier, relinquished the household cavalry for the 52nd Regiment. 'This act greatly pleased his General, who soon afterwards obtained a company for him in a West India Regiment, got him removed into a battalion of the army of reserve, and finally fixed him, in 1804, a captain in the 43rd Regiment, then forming a part of Moore's brigade. The regiment was at that time in a bad state of discipline, and the company to which Napier, when barely nineteen, was appointed, was avowedly then the worst in it, but in three months he made himself master of his duties, and the men whom 'he commanded became orderly in conduct, and in zeal second to none in the corps. " The secret of his success," says his biographer "is to be sought in the absorb"ing earnestness with which Napier threw himself into "every pursuit, but more particularly into the duties of a "profession for which he had an enthusiastic love; also " in the high standard he fixed in his own mind as attain. " able by the private soldier." We will not say that it was Napier's passionate admiration for Sir John Moore which made him so good an officer, but the example of that great man certainly contributed not a little towards forming his military character; and it was the high estimation in which he held the hero of Corunna, and the burning desire he felt to vindicate his fame, which led him, in the first instance, in spite of much diffident delay, to become the historian of the Peninsular War. On the other hand, it was Moore's penetration which disCooed the military merits of all the Napiers,-wben even I yet the oppor ite for d nishing themselves in the field had not arrived, and when it did come Moore's opinion was completely justifled. William Napiers moral and intellectual qualities were of the highest order, and General Shaw Kennedy, who knew him well for a period of fiftyfive years, speaks of him as " about the purest character he had ever known," and one who manifested the most high-minded and honourable temper in all that he said or did. His physical attributes, too, were remarkable; an old brother-officer in the 43rd Regt. says of him: "be "was ever eager to excel in all feats of activity, joining "and competing with the soldiers in all their sports"leaping, rnning, rowing," &c., - and of his personal appearance we have this description: In apperane William Napier was one of the handsomest men of his time. Six feet high, formed in the most powerful mould it is possible to conceive as compatible with extraordinary grace and activity. He was able to jump six feet in height. The head of an Antinous covered with short clustering black curls-the square brow, both wide and high-the aquiline nose-the firm mouth and the square massive jaw, indicating indomitable firmness and resolution -the eye of that remarkable bluish grey so terrible in anger, so melting in tenderness, so sparkling in fun. In his youth his head and face might have served for a portrait of the war god. It is little wonder that a young man so endowed both in mind and body made friends everywhere, but it is curious to find that amongst those friends was one who is traditionally believed to have been one of the coldest and most formal men of his time. In 1804, being then about nineteen, and having been a brother officer of Charles Stanhope, Mr Pitt's nephew, Napier was, through him, invited to pass some time at the Minister's house at Putney, and the account he gives of the personal demeanour of the great Statesman is as singular as it is amusing: Mr Pitt liked practical fun, and used to riot in it with Lady Hester, Charles and James Stanhope, and myself; and one instance is worth noticing. We were resolved to blacken his face with burnt cork, which he most strenuously resisted, but at the beginning of the fray a servant announced that Lords Castlereagh and Liverpool desired to see him on business. " Let them wait in the other room," was the answer; and the great Minister instantly turned to the battle, catching up a cushion and belabouring us with it in glorious fun. We were, however, too many and strong for him, and, after at least a ten minutes' fight, got him down and were actually daubing his face, when with a look of pretended confidence in his prowess he said, " Stop, this will do; I could easily beat you all, but we must not keep those grandees waiting any longer." His defeat was, how.ever, palpable, and we were obliged to get a towel and basin of water to wash him clean before he could receive the grandees. Being thus put in order, the basin was hid behind the sofa, and the two lords were ushered in. Then a new phase of Mr Pitt's manner appeared, to my great surprise and admiration. Lord Liverpool'd look and i manner are well known - melancholy, bending, nervous. Lord Castlereagh I had known from my childhood, had often been engaged with him in athletic sports, pitching the stone or bar, and looked upon him as what indeed he was, a model of quiet grace and strength combined. What was my surprise to see both him and Lord Liverpool bending like spaniels on approaching the man we had just been maltreating with such successful insolence of fun I but instantly Mr Pitt's change of manner and look entirely fixed my attention. His; tall, ungainly, bony figure seemed to grow to the ceiling, his head was thrown back, his eyes fixed immovably in one position, as if reading the heavens, and totally regardless of the bending figures near him. For some time they spoke; he made now and then some short observation, and finally, with an abrupt stiff inclination of the body, but without casting his eyes down, dismissed them. Then, turning to us with a laugh, caught up his cushions and renewed our fight. Of Fox, in whose company Napier often was, he says "His manners were totally different from Mr Pitt's, "always agreeable, gentle, kind, and good-natured, but "not attractive to young people, inasmuch as he did not "seem to take much interest in them, and rather to bear "with than to like them, at least such was the impression "he made on me. Whereas Mr Pitt's manner was that of "joyous hilarity and delight at being able to unbend, as "it were, when he could do it safely: he was very at" tractive." William Napier's first experience of foreign service was in the expedition to Copenhagen, in 1807, under Sir Arthur Wellesley. It was not an occasion for reaping much glory, and the record left of it by himself refers more to the conduct of a scoundrelly German general under whom he was detached, and who seems to have been deeply imbued with that plundering spirit which we identify rather with German warfare than to the stirring incidents of a campaign. More congenial service, unfortunate as was its issue, was Napier's in 1808, when he went with his regiment to Spain, and bore a heavy share of the hardships of Sir John Moore's retreat. These hardships, Napier tells us, wero such that they threw him into a fever, from which he hardly escaped with life. " I had marched," he says, "for several days with bare feet, and with only a jacket "and a pair of linen trowsers for clothes; my feet were "swelled, and bled at every step in such a manner, that "General Craufurd, who saw me in that statc, turned his "head away, and I must have perished if McLeod, hear"ing of my state, had not lent me a spare horse." In the following year, after relinquishing the peaceful employment of aide-de-camp to his uncle, the Duke of Richmond, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, to join his regiment in Portugal, he was in as bad a strait, and gave striking proof of the stuff that was in him. " On the march to Talavera he was " attacked with violent pleurisy, and carried to Placentia, " where he was bled four times in two days; but hearing "the army had been defeated, and that the French, under " Soult, were close to Placentia, he got out of bed, walked "forty-eight miles to Oropesa, and there getting post-horses, "he rode to Talavera to join the army, which he supposed to be in a dangerous position. The exertion arising so "soon after his recent bleeding was too much for him, so "that be fell from his horse at the gate of Talavera, and "some Spanish Soldiers, seeinA him in a blue great coa0 I I I I I I I I I "thought he was a Frenh O r, and wrn going to kill "s him, he was saved byan of 45th "who was fortunately pasn at the time." Being, after this, attached to the Light Division, he soon distinguished himsef in the field, and in the " bitter "fight" on the Co., where Craufard with 5,000 men and six guns stood to receive the attack of 80,000 French, he received the thanks of the gene4l and of his own command. ing officer, Lieutenant-Colonel MoLeod, for rallying his company under a heavy fire, and thereby giving time to gather a few hundred men and oover the passage of the broken troops over a long narrow bridge. Here, at the close of the action, he was shot through the hip, but though suffering considerably, continued with his regiment till the battle of Busco, where others of his race underwent the baptism of fire, his two brothers, Charles and George, being both wounded, the former desperately in the face, and cousin Charles, the sailor, an amateur, disabled by a crack in the knee. At Cazal Noval, which soon followed Busaco, William Napier received his worst wound, the results of which tortured him through life, a shot having struck him near the spine, and in the same fierce conflict his brother George had his arm broken by a bullet while carrying his mortally wounded subaltern off the field, under a heavy fire. To complete the picture we have this passage: " And it was after this fight that his "brother Charles, in hastening up, with his dreadful "Busaco wound unhealed, to the head of the army, met "the two litters carrying his brothers, of whom he was "informed that William was wounded mortally." The name of Napier might well, under such circumstances, be celebrated ! A story, in relation to the fight of Cazal Noval, is told by that brave and distinguished officer, Colonel Sir J. Morillyon Wilson, which is too interesting to be omitted: My first interview with my dear departed friend Sir William Napier was on the battle-field of Casal Noval. I was then captain of the grenadier company of the Royal Scots. We were advancing towards the enemy, when I saw an officer at the distance of about eighty yards stretched on the ground beneath an olive-tree, to the right of my company. Believing him to be either dead or badly wounded, I ran towards him and said, 'I hope you are not dangerously wounded,' at which he shook his bead. ' Have you been attended to by a surgeon ? ' He nodded assent. ' Can I be of any service to you ? ' I mid; and he again shook his bead, but did not utter a word. He looked deadly pale, and I was deeply impressed with the classical outline and beautiful expression of his handsome countenance I I told him I had some cold tea and brandy in my flask, and asked if I should give him a little of it; at which be raised his head, a sudden beam of pleasure sparkled in his eyes,-he stretched out his hand, and I gave him a tumblerful, which he drank with a most interesting expreuion of unexpected enjoyment-so r'uch so, that I gave him a second dose; and when he had finished, be seized my hand and grasped it several times, as much as to say, ' I don't know who you are, my good fellow, but I feel most gratefully thankful for your kindness.' I then mid, 'H eaven protect you!' and ran off to join my company. I had not the slightest knowledge who he was, and amidst the firing and excitement of the moment I did not notice big uniform. In after life I often spoke of this wounded officer as the handsomest man I had ever beheld. I never met him again in my wanderings through the various thoroughfares of military life, until about sixteen years afterwards, when he resided at Freshford, near Bath. I was then on a visit to Lady Wilson's father, when dear ' William' dined there, and after dinner, when we were just about to join the ladies, and while I was standing near the fireplace with my arm resting on the mantelpiece, the gentlemen were speaking about 'handsome men,' and I aid, of all the handsome men I had ever seen in the various parts of the world where I had been, there was none to be at all compared with td. oom whom I then described to them as above written. Napier sprang from his chair, put his arms round me, and exclaimed, I My dear Wilo, was that you that glaD of tea and bra saved my 1i/' Andafew tears trickled from his bright and animated eyes, expressive of his grateful recollection of the good service I had rendered him in that hour of his need and painful suffering.' The two wounded brothers each received the brevet of major for their conduct in the sanguinary affair of Cazal Noval,-but promotion came very slowly afterwards to William Napier-far too slowly for his deserts. It would be almost re-writing the ' History of the Peninsular War,' -that ' History' by which William Napier raised to himself an immortal monument,-to follow closely the military career of one so distinguished; much, therefore, we must leave untouched in this notice, and our abstinence will be for the gratification of the readers of this 'Life,' which is replete with the most interesting details. Returning home invalided, after the second siege of Badajoz, William Napier married, in 1811, the woman of his choice, a niece of Charles James Fox, but hearing that the place was again besieged, though far from being recovered, and only three weeks a Benedick, he sailed again for Portugal. On reaching Lisbon he heard of the bloody assault and capture of Badajoz; he learnt, too, that his dearest friend, Lieut.. Colonel McLeod, of the 43rd, had been killed in the breach;-and here begins the correspondence with his wife, which throws a wondrous charm over the contents of these volumes. In the first of thes letters, telling her of the loss of McLeod, he says that she must henceforth be his friend, wife, and everything; and her claims to this distinction her after life most nobly vindicated. McLeod's death gave Napier the regimental majority, and as the senior officer present he now commanded the 43rd. At Salamanca be, as an eye-witness, gives an account of the solitary occasion on which Lord Wellington was hit: " After dusk, at the battle of "Salamanca, the Duke rode up alome behind my regiment, "and I joined him; he was giving me some orders when a "ball passed through his left holster, and struck his thigh; "he put his hand to the place, and his countenance changed "for an instant, but only for an instant; and to my " eager inquiry if he was hurt, he replied, sharply, No!' "and went on with his orders.

This disappointmeast m nch chagrined him, that he was resolved to take a muset and march back the men who had come forward at his call, Ince he could not command them; but General Alta getting some inkling of his design, ordered him to join his regiment. A few months later, however, he met with no in trpio in this dangerous way of earning distintion by storming the Petite lhune, one of the str set m i positions in the Pyremeee. Napier planned this attack and led it at the head of the 43rd Regiment. Here ae some sbting inidents in thi The meninstantly chered and ranforward. It was I in to try, ad would have been dangerowu to top them, and I oould only make th. beat of the matter. I was the bA maon but one who reached and jpd into the rocks, and I was only second because my strength en speed were unequal to contend with the giant who got befor, me. He was the tallest ad mo active man in the regiment, and the day before, being sentenced to corporal punishment, I had pardoned him O th. occasion of an acpoac tion. He now repaid me by sffving always to plae ilf w e and the Are of the enemy. Hii name ws ies, an Irisbman; he died afterwards a seriesut and pensioner on the Irish esblishment. The mischief I had foreseen now arrived; the mn were quite blown, and fell down in the rocks witbin a few yards of thel rstcatlc from whence the enemy plied them with a heavy musketry. When they had recovered wind I advanced againt the first casle leading the way with ce -an: the enemy ed,with the exception of an offir ad two of his men; but, aided by my own man I scaled the wall. We pu the two men to fight, ad wounded andtook the offcer, for he foght to the last, andding on the wall and throwing heavy stoDs at me. One I parried with my sword, but I received a contusion in the thigh from another. The regiment then carried seveal castles in succession, the enemy flgti us muzzle to muzzle the whole way, so that many of the men'. lothes were scorhd al over the front with the ire. Gallan was the exploit of storming the Petite Rhune, it was not mentioned in the da , consequence of the affir not having fallen er the D of Wellington's peronal observation. There was no positive injustes dose . Napier in this particular matter, but he deeply reseted the ill usage be had received in not having been allowed to lead the storming pety at San Sebastian, and this circumstance, coupled with la1 of healih. and length of service without receiving the promotion which was justly his due, led him seriously to contemplate retirement from the service, but at the instance of his wife and friends he abadoned the intention, and shared, till the end of the war, in all its opsution. But, though neglected in one sense, Napier was never ovelooked by the one best Etted to form an opinion of his military genius, and a familiar emple of the Duke of Wellingon's appration of the Mjor of the 4rd appes in the following extract from a lte of Napier's written at V in September, 1813: Tell GeoWe, in justification of my abilities as a general (I told him I did not see how Lord Wellington was to cs the Doromthis in), that I dined with Lord W. three days agnd that after dinnr h explained to me all his mawn and rangments for the ompedn, and that deceiving the French and passing the Douro, turning their right by that movement, was the most difficut move ih ever Mde,-that it was to and go, and required more arran ment and more w than anytbing he ever did: had he been one da too late, be must have gem back.

He wa very kind a ery glad to me me. Napier returned to England early in 1814, and at the clos of the oamp g received the brevet rank of lieutenant-colonel. He had a severe illness consequent on his woud, but was able on his recovery to return to the theotioal pat of his profession by joining the Military College at Farnham, where his brother Charles (the future conqueror of Scnde) was also studying. Napoleon's epe from Elba called him thence, but not in time for him to share in the battle of Waterloo, which was fought while he was embarking for Belgium. He remained with the army of occupation in France till 1819, when he returned With his-regimnt, and vas quartered in Belfhkt.

The Ebb-Tide. By Robort Louis Stevenson und Lloyd < ^bourne. (Hoinomann.) A delight] ul thrill of excitement comes over one when a new volume arrives labelled with Mt. Stevenson's name. There is ever in his work a curious fascination, a wit gentle or terrible, a fine feeling for the swing of a phrase. Even when least successful, he contrives delicate effects unattainable by others. His unique style, his fastidious method, seemed to render it impossible that he should at any time seek the crude aid of another : here, surely, was a man sufficient unto himself. But, while this comfortable feeling of security lulled the reader, the unexpected swooped upon him. A hope that the new venture would be equally successful was hugged tightly. But, alas, the inevitable has happened. Excellent as a great deal of the joint work is, one realises, with a keen sense of annoyance, that the old Stevenson reveals himself but seldom. In each new story the rare excellencies, the unerring choice of words, the subtle charm are harder to discover. Yet even half a Stevenson is better than none at all; and had that proportion been strictly observed, perhaps some consolation were to be found. But the hand of the junior partner grows each year more masterful. Doubtless Mr. Osbourne can write, and well too, though at best he remains merely clever and fortunate Mr. Osbourne. The stuff manufactured by the firm is good, truly; it has few rivals in the market. Only Mr. Stevenson's never had any rivals. It may be urged that the discoverer of Treasure Island, the historian of Alan Brock, invented and wrote the greater part of The Ebb-Tide. If so, the conclusion is the more lamentable, for it shows less of the Stevensonian quality than any book that has borne his name. A law declaring literary partnerships illegal should not want a majority. For Mr. Stevenson is doing himself an injury, seeing that he can still write as finely as ever: the witchcraft stories of The Island Nights, published last year, are born of genius strong and mature. Association with less excellent, though creditable, work may well shipwreck the most admirable on its perilous voyage through the centuries. The Ebb Ttde, when all is said, is a capital story, not unconvincing, despite improbabilities. Faults it has, and of a kind we had scarcely expected; but it is a book to be read and discussed. At the beginning the reader is introduced to three persons, each with peculiar and exaggerated characteristics, each thoroughly alive. The fourth actor in the drama, one Attwater?prig, scholar, religious enthusiast, half charlatan, half honest man?is aggressively impossible. Not that these conflicting elements cannot go to mould one human being, but simply because the authors seem to have written "with tongue in cheek," and made him incredible of set purpose. Balancing, in some measure, this preposterous failure, there is Huish, the cockney clerk. I doubt if anywhere in fiction a more loathsome creature may be found. Without a redeeming virtue, save courage and a coarse wit, he Haunts his vices in our faces with a ftuiirk of hideous honesty. Undeniably he fascinates, snakelike, compelling a disgusted admiration. He dies pluckily, and one ought to feel a throb of sympathy, for courage is not common or mean, were it not that the atmosphere becomes suddenly the purer for his death. The prodigious Attwater is his executioner; and though the reader has prayed for a kindly catastrophe to carry off this irritating giant, no one with a spark of humanity could wish his contest with Huish had ended differently. If The Ebb Tide is to live, the cockney clerk, the memory of whose companionship through two hundred pages cannot be forgotten, will give a plausible explanation. Also that fine scene at the end, when the drunken American skipper has become Attwater's " pet penitent," may furnish a reason. His last speech, with which the volume closes, is a fine stroke of grisly humour. "But, O! why not be one of usP Why not come to Jesus right away, and let's meet in yon beautiful land ? That's just the one thing wanted; just say, Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief! And He'll fold you in His arms. You see, I know! I've been a sinner myself! " The authors know human nature better than the reviewers, who have attacked this passage as conceived in a spirit of " pure farce." Davis is the exact type of man who, unnerved by a reckless career of debauchery and crime, would take to religion and find comfort in Evangelistic excitement. To give the details of the story, not a long one by any means, were unfair. There will probably be divers opinions as to its merits. For my own part, I would suggest, very humbly, that, as this is the best book Mr. Osbourne has achieved, he should now be strong enough to run alone. Again, that Mr. Stevenson, having done right loyally by his step-son, should now remember his duty towards his admirers and himself. Percy Addlesuaw,

Tales of our Coast. SHORT STORIES. By S. R. Crockett, Gilbert Parker, Harold Frederic, W. Clark Russell, and Q. (Chatto & Windus.)?Vivid and informing should be the stories of our coast, taken from points so various as Galloway and Munster, Lincolnshire and the Land's End, and by so strong a company of writers as that whose names appear on the title-page ; and yet thereaderwillprobablybedoubtfulwhetherhehas had an entertainment so excellent as might have been anticipated. Mr. Crockett leads off with a story excessively thin in its texture, though the meeting of the young smuggler with "Maxwell" of Mochrum is well imagined. Mr. Crockett should really limit his output, if he is to maintain any sort of quality. Mr. Gilbert Parker's Lincolnshire story possesses more substance, and is condensed rather than expanded in the letters. " Back and forth," like other Americanisms, has probably its origin in some peasant dialect, but we do not feel confident that its home is in Lincolnshire. 'Tho Path of Murtogh' is a bloody tragedy of the Hibernian flavour, and Mr. Harold Frederic has known how to convey histale of the fierce sixteenth century sea king in diction appropriate to the scene. 'That There Mason,' which closes the book, is a perfect photograph of the " worst-tempered man on the coast " about Ramsgate. We can sympathize entirely, however, with that disappointed longshoreman in resenting to any point of ferocity the insolent remarks on George IV.'s obelisk with which his interviewer thought it good taste to begin his conversation. The best of this readable collection is the contribution of Q, 'Roll-call of the Reef,' whether spirit, style, or substance be considered. It savours of the awful; but they are dignified ghosts, these hussars and marines, who had to pay for their many sins, but could each report on that mysterious parade-ground that " I died as a man ought." Rita handicaps her volume of short stories? Vignettes (White & Co.)?by occasional carelessness. Such a spelling as "goaler" is singularly "ill-stared." "The annals of jurisdiction " may be considered a new phrase, but does not express her meaning. For tho rest, roost of tlie stories are readable, and one or two ('Snow-White,' for instance) are pathetic. Terence O'Hara's Irishwoman does not, we fancy, speak a very good brogue, but her kindly character is true to life. One of the best sketches is Mrs. Lyle in 'The Irony of Fate.'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reuben Medlicott; or, the Coming Mau. By ; M. W. Savage. 3 vols. Chapman & Hall. We are bound to state that Mr. Savage does not improve as a novelist. ' My Uncle the Curate,' as the Athentpum said on the occasion of its appearance [Ath. No. 1115], was a dull book,?but this is a duller one;?not solely because of its subject, but in part from the manner in which that subject is wrought out. A narrative of foibles, bearing bitter apples for fruit?of hopes disappointed and promises unfulfilled?can rarely be very inspiriting. Yet, Miss Edgeworth, in her stories of Vivian, the persuadable man, and of Basil Lowe, the procrastinator, knew how to administer such relief and contrast that we could read those admirably executed tales without our hopes in humanity being chilled, and without our views of life becoming pinched and dwarfed by reason of the low and waste monotony of the prospect within which they were confined. It may be recollected that we object to Mr. Thackeray, as to a novelist who deals too grudgingly with all that is amiable and elevated ; but, even into his most discouraging scenes?such, for instance, as the surprise of Becky over her petit soaper with Lord Steyne?he will every now and then throw a touch of strong feeling and human interest. Now, we have met with few writers who scatter their amenities so sparingly as Mr. Savage. Without commanding De Balzac's force or minuteness, he has all De Balzac's dreariness. His story contains a character, and exhibits a complete picture;?but the person selected is singularly unpleasing,?and the fulllength gallery picture has not an inch of blue sky or an episode of flower-vase in the background, by way of relief. Failure at school?failure at college?failure in parliament?failure at the bar?failure in platform oratory?failure, even, in the Quaker asceticism through which "the coming man" passes as one phase of his many changes,? such are the incidents of Mr. Selvage's book. Reuben Medlicott has many showy qualities and gracious gifts; but he is as unstable as water, and as vain as a foolish French beauty of the ancien regime. Such a hero, Mr. Savage may rest assured, would never have married the daughter of the quaint old Dissenting dame from whom he had his schooling. Nor is there any one character in the book which may serve as a foil to the hero in right of extraordinary gifts or virtues. His mother is foolish, ?his father is a non-entity,?his aunt is weak, ?the idol of his school-boy days marries his grandfather!?his favourite associates, a French shoemaker and a sister, are not much better than they should be. The descriptions are more smart than strong,?more diffuse than impressive. We select one of the best and most manageable scenes,? a Protestant meeting at Chichester.? "All 'tremendous demonstrations' resemble one another very closely: an excited knot of noblemen and gentlemen on a platform, a tumultuous sea of heads on the floor, an agitated bevy of mothers, aunts, and sisters in a gallery, a little table for reporters, a peer in the chair, if a peer can be found to fill it, but never anything beneath the baronetage. On the present occasion, the platform was thronged with parsons and squires until it overflowed; and every now and then a vicar, or a pair of top-boots, came tumbling down among the smock-frocks, who united their shoulders to heave him up again. When this disaster befel a man of ordinary dimensions, he was reinstated on the platform with no great difficulty ; but when it happened to public characters of more than average weight, the attempt to replace them sometimes proved as ineffectual as in the case of the celebrated Humpty Dumpty in the nursery rhyme. It was unquestionably a ' tremendous demonstration' of the lungs of the men of Sussex. John Bull bellowed like a herd of his four-footed namesakes, and the Protestant lion roared his best, without the slightest respect to the nerves of tho ladies. Bottom would have been greatly scandalised. Awful resolutions were proposed by peers, and seconded by commoners, but as to the eloquence, it was uniformly stifled by its own applause, and perished for ever in the premature raptures of the audience. It was proved, however, beyond a doubt, that there were two Curtii present, ready to jump into any chasm which the British soil might please to open beneath their feet; a Brutus in buckskin was equally prepared to sacrifice all the private affections to the public welfare ; as to Sydneys, Hampdens, and Russells, they appeared that day in a force that reflected undying honour upon the patriotism of Englishmen. How often Popery was flatly negatived with the energy of Cromwell himself, is not to be told in figures; but three orators, at least, pledged their lives and fortunes to defend the throne and the altar; the same number of prophetic voices foretold the sunset of British liberty; and thrice three times was it powerfully urged upon thc vast assembly to unite, heart and hand, in a ' strong pull, a long pull, and a pull altogether.' In the front of the gallery assigned to the ladies, who came to brave the roaring of the lion aforesaid, sat Mrs. Medlicott, and Hannah and Mary Hopkins. Their eyes were riveted on the platform, but it was not on the chairman they gazed, although he was the Earl of Stromness, nor on the Vicar, for he was lost in the crowd, nor on Mr. Pigwidgeon, ludicrous figure as he cut, for there was no novelty in that? you had only to watch the point where the three lines of female vision united, to convince yourself that they sought nothing, saw nothing, thought of nothing during that great day and demonstration, but the youngest of thc patriot band, he who came to dedicate the first-fruits of his talents and his fame to the service of his creed and his country. Probably few of the ladies present had been unobservant of Reuben from un early period of the day, for he was conspicuous not only by his heindsome person, but by his dress, which could scarcely have been gayer or more elaborate had he been going to be married, instead of only going to make a speech. His hair, artfully divided, thone like Apollo's, and flowed on his shoulders almost as wantonly as in his boyhood; a bouquet, nearly as large as Barsac's, bloomed in his button-hole; and the virgin whiteness of his gloves typified the maiden eloquence with which ho was about to enchant tlie world. The foppery was not entirely his own ; the gloves were due to his mother, the flowers had bein insisted on and even arranged on his breast by the young Quakeress. Nor was it amiss that so much care had been bestowed on his toilette; for had he been confounded with the parsons nnd the squires, his rising would not have commanded the attention that it did, and his oratory would probably have been lost, like that of the rest, in the incessant uproar of the meeting. Everything, however, was propitious, but, perhaps, most of all the emphatic and gracious manner in which the Earl of Stromness, a man of the highest courtesy, introduced him to the audience, as ' the son of his respected friend, the Rev. Thomas Medlicott.' Instantly the chawbacons, hundreds of whom were the Earl's tenants, raised a shout that well nigh brought down the roof of the Court-house. The 4m was little in unison with the modesty and gentleness with which the palpitating Reuben took his place in the front of the platform. His rising was soft as the south wind ; and you might have marked its effects in the female gallery, how the breeze fluttered the bonnets, rustled among thc ribbons, and especially how it made the maternal stomacher risc and fall, like a sail when the wind is irresolute. He rose, he spoke, he triumphed. His was the only speech that was not only delivered, but of which a considcmble portion was heard. A most excellent speech it was of the school of oratory it belonged to, though there were principles of eloquence by which it would have been cruel to have tried it. If, however, it had the defects of youth, it had its merits also; it was fresh, it was fury, it was animated and courageous. There was not a Quintilian in the meeting to find fault with it. Tried by the test of success, not Demosthenes himself could have gained a completer victory. Up Hew a cloud of hats before the exordium was over; the orator was actually invisible for a second. Tho same demonstration was repeated a score of times; upon one occasion Mr. Pigwidgeon (who was striking another stroke for a dinner) must throw up his beaver among the rest, and he never recovered it, for it fell among the mob, and was trampled to pieces in an instant. The hat was not worth sixpence, but he vowed it was a new one?a thing he had never been known to possess in his life. What signified .lr. Pigwidgeon'a hat, or Mr. Pigwidgeon himself:' Even Protestantism was forgotten in the excitement and enthusiasm occasioned by the Howers of Reuben's rhetoric, not unaided by the flowers in his coat. If one passage outshone another, where all was splendour, it was the dangerous topic of apostacy?the graphic picture of a renegade divine, which reached its climax, when the orator described the vain endeavours of such a Sillen character to regain his lost position, and imagined thc reception he would assuredly meet with from every honest man. Here he turned to good account the lines in Milton: ? Think'st thou, revolted spirit, thy shape thu same, Or undiniinish'd glory, as when once Thou stood'at erect in henv'n, erect and pure? The air was darkened with waving hats again; thc enthusiasm mounted to tho galleries, the women waved their handkerchiefs wildly, and Mrs. Medlicott and the Quakeresses, who had taken ort' their bonnets in consequence of the heat, tossed them about fanatically, and almost forgot their sex in the violence of their transports. In short, it was a relief to everybody when tho last bolt was launched, and the last long-protracted peal of applause greeted tlie solemn and high-wrought peroration." The above passage, we think, will be found to illustrate within itself at once Mr. Savage's strength and his want of strength. In fact, this second disappointment convinces us that the three-volume novel is not our author's forte. The sharp, clever sketch ? the short philosophical tale, in which want of incident is forgiven for the sake of pithy apothegms or logical sequences?the satire that keeps on the levels, in place of soaring high or sinking deep?are all at his command. It is fatal to a man's individuality to fancy that there is but one form of Art, one vehicle of expression palatable in the present day?thc three-volume novel;?and we wish Mr. Savage would own this, and act on it, ?let his publishers take it as they will.

Marius the Epicurean: his Sensations and Ideas. LITERATURE By Walter Pater, M.A. 2 vols. (Macmillan & Co.) With the real Hecay of paganism Epicureanism rapidly waned. The age of intense subjectivity was vanishing in emptiness of thought and nihilism of aim, and a foi wi in mt is _E th ce in ar lei a vi N __ fii ^ le new epoch?full of discord and trouble, but mc not without a definite general hope?had pa been inaugurated. As Goethe has said, all retrogressive epochs, and all that tend to dissolution, are subjective, while all progressive epochs have an objective tendency. That Epicureanism as a philosophy of life lingered long after the reign of Marcus Aurelius is certain, but it is generally supposed that it died out completely under the wide - spreading influence of the famous decree of Constantine. Of course, no genuine philosophy of life, such as that of Epicurus, ever lacks an adherent here and there, though that philosophy may be known by some other name?nay, more, even though the adherent should be all unconscious of his discipleship and even of the very name of his master. Gassendi, La Rochefoucauld, St. Evremond, Helvetius, and others in France practically viewed the panorama of life from the same standpoint as Epicurus; and Goethe, notwithstanding the patent divergence between him as the German apostle of culture and the philosopher who taught that culture, as we understand it, was valueless? Goethe waa also a true disciple. In our own day the chief English exponent of the central doctrine of Epicurus is Mr. Walter Pater, and though his new "Cyrenaicism " is manifest throughout the well - known ' Studies of the Renaissance,' and especially in the famous epilogue, it is to be discerned more distinctively and in more strictly philosophic garb in one or two of those uncollected essays of his which have attracted only less attention than those in his volume ?especially in his acute and sympathetic dissertation upon Wordsworth. Now, however, Mr. Pater publishes the fruit of his long contemplations on the problem of how to make the most of life for the benefit of all who care to feast on it, to become wiser or to turn away dissatisfied from that " Today " " which has outlasted so many tomorrows," as the translator of the ' Rubaiyat ' says. In these two volumes Mr. Pater writes an imaginary biography of a young man, brou ght up in the pagan religion and in strictly Roman grooves of thought, who in the reign of the last of the Antonines passes through a variety of mental and spiritual experiences, comes into contact with Marcus Aurelius himself, and finally makes acquaintance with the new religion which had been brought out of the mysterious East by one Paul, who od his westward way had astonished even the Athenian sceptics by his dissertation c On the Unknown God.' It is but a brief acquaintance, however, for by a strange irony he, the accomplished Epicurean, dies an obscure death among ignorant peasant adherents of the new faith, and thus attains to honours of martyrdom, the significance of which he would not have understood even if he had foreknown all that was to happen after the last breath had passed away from his lips. The boyhood of Marius is mainly passed in the retirement of a small Tuscan estate. Here, living with his widowed mother, he is amidst an atmosphere of reverence for that old religion which even in the days of the Antonines had still a real hold upon the populations of places remote from urban influences. No duty to the gods does the young Marius omit, and even while little more than a child the bias of his nature, partly hereditary, towards a grave reverence for all the greater and lesser powers with whom man is brought in contact soon or late in the course of each life, is made strikingly manifest. The first notable event of his youth is an expedition to a famous temple of iEsculapius, remote among the hills beyond the Arnus. Here he sees a man already celebrated, and whom he was often to meet in aftertime in Rome, the physician Galen; and here he receives his first important lesson as to the conduct of life, his instructor a young priest of the temple. When this visit is over Marius returns to " WhiteNights "?as the villa is called, Ad Vigilias Albas?and soon aftewards experiences his first real sorrow, the death of his mother. When the pain of this bereavement grows less intense he goes to Luna to be trained with other youths under an accomplished master. He will not see again for many years that ancestral villa of pale red and yellow marble, mellowed by age, there being " two centuries of the play of the sea-wind in the velvet of the mosses which lay along its inaccessible ledges and angles "; nor look again out of the little glazed windows in the upper chamber, wherefrom could be seen "the pallid crags of Carrara, like wildly-twisted snow-drifts above the purple heath ; the distant harbour with its freight of white marble going to sea; the lighthouse-temple of Venus Speciosa on its dark headland, amid the long-drawn curves of white breakers''; though often he may yearn, amid the furnace heat of a Roman August, for the fragrant coolness of that sequestered home, where " even on summer nights the air had always a motion in it, and drove the scent of the newmown hay along all the passages of the house." In Luna Marius gains the friendship of the brilliant Flavian, and the two friends, greatly dissimilar, though at one in their love of their heritage of undefiled Latinity ? rapidly growing corrupt at that period?develope in the company of each other all that is best in their natures. This friendship would not have lasted much longer, for Flavian, in spite of his brilliant qualities of mind, is an embodiment of the evil and licentious times of which a spirit such as his was the natural outcome. However, death inter* venes, and the young hedonist dies of the plague, that Oriental curse which Lucias Yerus had brought back with him from the conquered East. His death is a great shock to Marius, who for long feels it as an outrage on the part of the gods, or of that dominant Power who controls all other deities and guides the pliant hand of Destiny. Before leaving Luna he had witnessed in Flavian's company the festival of the Ship of Isis, taking part himself, though only as a spectator, in the blithe ceremonies of the day and festive night. Soon afterwards comes the summons to Rome, and Marius starts gladly enough for the capital. On his way he rests at Urbs Vetus, the Orvieto of to-day, and there makes the acquaintance of a young centurion, Cornelius by name, bound for the same destination. Cornelius influences him strongly from the first, and is the embodi- / ment of the moral force that ultimatelyv impels the weary Epicurean towards something at least of the peace and hope of the new doctrine of the Nazarene. The morning following his entry into Rome Marius leaves the ancestral house on the Coolian, and with Cornelius views the triumphal entry of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, and later on hears the famous disquisition of the former, delivered before the assembled Senate, on the vanity of all things. Time passes, and the young Tuscan sees much, that is new and wonderful, and undergoes many experiences that now serve to cause him vague doubts as to the rectitude of the plane of thought upon which he has partly found and partly impelled himself, and again but to intensify that Epicureanism he./ has endeavoured to carry out to its noblest development. A glimpse of his mental state at this time may here be afforded:? " Pitched to a really high and serious key, the precept?Be perfect in regard to what is here and now?the precept of 'culture,' as it is called?that is, of a complete education?might at least save him from the heaviness and vulgarity of a generation, certainly of no general fineness of temper, but with much material well-being. Conceded that what is secure in our existence is but the sharp apex of the present moment between two hypothetical eternities, and all that is real in our experience but a series of fleeting impressions.given, that we are never to get beyond the walls of this closely shut cell of our own subjective personality; if the ideas we are somehow impelled to form of an outer world, and even of other minds akin to our own, are, it may be, but a day-dream, and the thought of a world beyond, a day-dream probably thinner still: then, he, at least, in whom thoBe fleeting impressions?faces, voices, material sunshine?were very real and imperious, might well set himself to the consideration, how such actual moments as they passed might be made to yield him their utmost, by the most dexterous training of his capacities.But ?Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die !? is a principle, the real import of which differ*/ immensely according to the natural taste and the acquired judgment of the guests who sit at the table. It may express nothing better than the instinct of Dante's Ciacco, the accomplished glutton, in the mud of the 'Inferno'; or, since on no hypothesis does man ' five by bread alone,' it may come to be identical with ' My meat is to do what is just and kind '; while the soul, which cannot pretend to the apprehension of anything beyond the veil of immediate experience, yet never loses a feeling of happiness in conforming to the highest moral idea it can sincerely denne for itself; and actually, though but with so faint hope, does the ' Father's business.' " Occasionally Marius rides out across the Campagna, either for the keen pleasure of it, or on his way to Tusculum to dine with a poet friend (the description of a classic banquet at whose house in honour of Apuleius is one of the most delightful things in the book), or to the country villa of tho Emperor Aurelius, or to ono of his favourite spots among the Alban hills, " for a quiet even greater than that of Rome, in the countryair." An excursion of the latter kind is thus described :? " That flawless serenity, better than the most pleasurable excitement, but so easily ruffled by chance collisions even with things or persons he had begun to value as the greatest treasure in life, was to be wholly his to-day, he thought, as he rode towards Tibur, under the early sunshine ; the old yellow marbles of its villas glittering all the way before him on the hill-side. An even veil of lawn-like white cloud had now drawn over the sky; and under its broad, shadowiest light every tone and hue of time came out upon the old yellow temples and houses, seeming continuous with the rocks they rose from. Some half-conscious motive of poetic grace would appear to have determined their grouping; partly resisting, partly going along with the natural wilduess and harshness of the place, its floods and precipices. An air of immense age possessed above all the vegetation around?a world of evergreen trees?the olives especially (older than how many generations of / men's lives !) fretted and twisted by the combining forces of life and death into every conceivable caprice of form. In the windless weather all seemed to be listening to tho roar of the immemorial waterfall, plunging down so unassociably among theso human habitations, and with a motion as unchanging from age to age as to count, even in this time worn place, as an image of unalterable rest. Yet the clear sky all but broke, to let through the ray which was silently quickening everything in the late February afternoon, and the unseen violet refined itself through the air." Although Marius may have heard from his acquaintances some mention of the Christian faith, or at least of the obscure worshippers who were known to exist throughout the empire, little or no reference is made to one or the other up to the third book of Mr. Pater's work. But early in book iii. it is told how once, on his homeward way across the Campagna, with Cornelius as l ompanion, he is invited to enter the grounds jf a remote villa; and here he first makes acquaintance with the strange sweet singing of the Christian hymns, with a " church" of the catacombs, and with a noble Christian woman, the widow of a patrician. Having passed through the opening in the low wall, Marius shortly finds himself in * * an old flower garden in the rear of the house, set here and there with a venerable olive-tree*?a picture in pensive shade and fiery blossom, as transparent, in that afternoon light, as the old miniature-painters' work on the walls of the chambers above." This garden is bounded towards the west by a low, grassy hill, and in the steep side of the latter is a narrow opening, " liko a solid blackness there," admitting to the catacombs. He explores it, and when he comes out again he hears the singing. "The fragments of older architecture, the mosaics, the spiral columns, the precious cornerstones of immemorial building, had put on, by such juxtaposition, a new and singular expressiveness, an air of grave thought and intellectual purpose, in itself, aesthetically, very seductive. Lastly, herb and tree had taken possession of it all, spreading their seed-bells and light branches, just alive in the trembling air, above the ancient garden walls, against the wide spaces of sunset. And from the first they could hear singing?the singing partly of children, it would seem, and of a new sort; so novel indeed in its effect, that it carried the memory of Marius back to those old efforts of Flavian to conceive a new poesy. It was the expression not altogether of mirth, yet of a wonderful happiness?the blithe expansion of a joyful soul, in people upon whom some all-subduing experience had wrought heroically, and who still remembered, on this bland afternoon, the hour of a great deliverance.They were still within the precincts of the houso, still in possession of that wonderful singing, though almost in the open country, with a great view of the Campagna before them, and the hills beyond. Tho orchard or meadow, through which their path lay, was already grey in the dewy twilight, though the western sky, in which the greater stars were visible, was still afloat with ruddy splendour, seeming to repress by contrast the colouring of all earthly things, yet with the sense of a great richness lingering in their shadows. Just then the voices of the singers, a * voice of joy and health,' concentrated ?? themselves, with a solemn antistrophic movement, into an evening or 'candle' hymn?the hymn of the kindling of the lamp. It was like the evening itself, its hopes and fears, and the stars shining in the midst of it, made audible. Half above, half below the level mist, which seemed to divide light from darkness (the great wild flowers of the meadow just distinguishable around her skirts, as she moved across the grass), came now the mistress of the place, the wealthy Roman matron, left early a widow by the confessor Ciecilius a few years before. Arrayed in long robes, with heavy antique folds, and a veil or coif folded under the chin,' grey within grey,' she seemed to Marius to have, in her temperate beauty, something of the male and serious character of the best Greek female statuary. Very foreign, however, to any Greek statuary was the expression of pathetic care, with which she carried the child in her arms, warm within the folds of her mantle. Another little child, a year or two older, walked beside her, with the lingers of one hand bent upon her girdle.A few minutes afterwards, as he was passively again upon the public road, it might have seemed a dream.One of his most constant and characteristic traits had ever been the longing for escape? for sudden relieving interchange, even upon the spaces of life along which he had lingered most pleasantly?for a lifting, from time to time, of the actual horizon. It was.like the sick man's longing for northern coolness, and whispering willow-trees, amid the breathless and motionless evergreen forests of the south. Just in this way had that visit happened to him, through so slight an accident. Rome and Roman life, just then, had come to seem to him like a close wood of beautiful bronze-work, transformed, by some malign enchantment, out of the generations of living trees, yet with its roots in a deep, down-trodden soil of poignant human susceptibilities. In the midst of its suffocation, that old longing for escape had been satisfied by this vision of the church in Cacilia's house, as never before." A considerable period of time passes, and at length, weary of vague doubts and fatigued with long residonco in Rome, Marius pays a visit to his native place. On the return journey he joins Cornelius, who also had been seeking change and refreshment in that part of Tuscany, and the two travel slowly Romeward again together. But evil days have fallen upon the land; strange convulsions have disturbed the volcanic soil; rain and tempest have wrought havoc among the cornfields and vines ; the plague has broken out with fresh virulence, and everywhere there is sore trouble. Ignorance and blind dread produce a frenzy of superstition, and the object of the popular wrath are the Christians. One day in a little town, while Cornelius and Marius are stand* ing among a company of " the malefactorworshippers," there occurs an earthquake. The frantic people rush furiously upon the heretics, and the two friends are included among them. Both demand to be tried at Rome, and are accordingly, with a few other prisoners of like condition in life, sent thither under a guard. On the way Marius manages to contrive the escape of his friend, who hastens forward to the capital in order to obtain influential aid for the defence when the trial comes on. Meanwhile days pass, weary days of marching over boggy plains and desolate hills, and at last, partly overcome by fatigue and partly by his enforced sustenance on bad bread and water, Marius becomes so ill that he is left for dead by his indifferent guards. Some peasant folk, Christians as it turns out, tend him during his mortal sickness; and after his death, though he foresaw no such thing nor would ever have desired it, his memory receives all the honours due to a* martyr of the Church. ^, Yet it is not as a martyr that Marius dies. For himself he feels at the last something of the same pity, blended with a keen sense of outrage, that he experienced in his youthful years when Flavian succumbed in the prime of life to insidious disease. To Marius martyrdom meant, as his biographer says, nothing more than a common execution; and in the depth of his desolation his thoughts dwelt bitterly on the irony of men's fates, on the singular accidents of life and death. For him life, " from dying hour to dying hour," had been all-sufficient; " an end in itself?a kind of music, all-sufficing to the duly trained ear, even as it died out on the air." Nevertheless, stronger than his philosophy is the shadow of the grave. For Marius passes away with little personal hope; with, indeed, nothing more than a tired satisfaction that there had been established in the world a permanent protest? the practical outcome of this new faith? against the narrowness that had hemmed in the spiritual nature of man, " a thought which relieved for him the iron outline of the horizon about him, touching it as if with soft light from beyond." It is open to doubt if it has been Mr. Pater's intention to offer an apology for the higher Epicureanism: possibly he has merely endeavoured to trace the development of a cultured mind in a period that bears no slight resemblance to our own? development from belief in a venerable inherited creed to the adoption of a strictly worldly philosophy, a philosophy of how to make the most of life, the latter yielding in turn to spiritual weariness and even hopelessness ; relieved, perchance, not by vision of any ultimate individual good, but by a somewhat broader view of the future of humanity than bad formerly been entertained. On the other hand, there are, at any rate, some pages here and there in these two volumes which unmistakably express the personal opinions of the author, and these, conjointly with portions of Mr. Pater's other published writings, constitute sufficient basis for the assumption that he does, indeed, recognize the teaching of Epicurus as?in its quintessential doctrine ? not unworthy, even in these days of manifold isms, of serious consideration as a practical philosophy of life. Of course, no one can be better aware that this teaching in its entirety is antagonistic to the attainment of wide culture; but as this antagonism is more the result of tho ancient philosopher's own idiosyncrasy than the logical outcome of his philosophy of sensation as the means of knowledge and of selfsatisfaction as the end of life, Mr. Pater may well be willing to join hands with him so far. If, however, it has been his intention to demonstrate the futility of either Epicurean or Stoic philosophy,-and to show that Christianity is alone in any sense really responsive to man's deepest aspirations, then he has been only very partially successful. Indubitably he has in ' Marius' skilfully, and without precipitation, disclosed the lees that abide in the bottom of the cup that contains the mellow wine of the wisdom of Epicurus; but at most he only vaguely suggests that in its place, if we care to partake thereof, there is a draught of more vivifying essence, of more estimable flavour ?yet of the permanency of whose subtle regenerative quality he can say, as he knows, nothing. In a word, the mental history of Marius the Epicurean will hardly help any one in the same plight as was Marius himself after all his years of careful introspection, anxious thought, and vague expectancy. There is no real transition, on the part of the latter, from refined and in some points greatly modified Epicureanism to Christianity ; nor, even if he had not, with strange irony of circumstance, perished so untimely, is it in the least degree likely that he would ever have become an actual convert to the new faith/ He would have found it impossible to reconcile two teachings so really antagonistic?or, rather, so really distinct?as that of the pagan philosopher and that of the new God. His first conversion took place when, still a youth undisturbed in his reverence for and belief in the ancient religion of Rome, he hearkened with keenly receptive ears to the lessons of the young priest of the Temple of iEsculapius; as for a second conversion, does it ever really take place, or even seem as if it might have taken place if death had not intervened ? In impassioned contemplation, Mr. Pater says in that essay on Wordsworth already referred to, lies the true moral significance of art and poetry. But the passion must arise out of intensity of insight and be no mere mystical emotion ; with this writer, as with the Marius of whom he tells, there is a keen appreciation " of the poetic beauty of mere clearness of mind ? the actually aesthetic charm of a cold austerity of thought; as if the kinship of that to the clearness of physical light were something more than a figure of speech." There is no living writer who excels Mr. Pater in grace of style. He does not indulge in passages of sustained eloquence, but every word he writes is calculated to be the best word in that place, to have its full signification brought out. Here and there, of course, there are passages of exceptional beauty; but fine as these are, Mr. Pater's special faculty for verbal expression is more noticeable in his occasional use of certain words which in his mouth, so to speak, act like a charm. While he is the most rhythmical of English prosewriters, his is the music of the viola rather than of the violin. It is no joyous evangel that Mr. Pater proclaims in these two volumes, albeit it clearly infers the possibility of many joyous experiences. Everything that is is evanescent. The darkness beyond is still darkness for us; hence it is that these joys, these exhilarating flashes of insight and moments of vivid pleasurable emotion, are enhanced, "like the glow of summer itself," by the thought of their brevity. Consciously or unconsciously, there is in all that he has written a strain of that partly sad, partly genuinely contentful resignation of the great Aurelius which found fullest expression in these words:? " Sayest thou, 'I have not played five acts.' True ! but in human life three acts only make sometimes a complete play. That is the composer's business, not thine. Retire with a good will; for that too hath, perchance, a good will which dismisseth thee from thy part."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enigmas of Life. By W. R. Greg. (Triibner &Co.) In this earnest and eloquent volume Mr. Greg discusses, sadly, and yet hopefully, some of " the dark riddles and incomprehensive anomalies and strange perplexities of which life is full," his moral being, that though we may be deeply dissatisfied with the present condition of the human race, we need not despair of its amelioration, and that, though we cannot ignore the limitations to which the life and happiness of the individual are subject, we need not despair of their removal in another state of existence. Hence he condemns as partial and incomplete on the one hand the view of the theologian, that the future of the individual should occupy our undivided attention, aud on the other the view of the physicist, that the future of the race is the only future which lies before us. On the contrary, he anticipates for both, for the society and for the individual alike, a constant progress towards perfection, bringing with it ever-increasing happiness. Both of these progresses being discussed in the present work, it is in part sociological, in part theological; but the sociological chapters have indirectly a theological bearing, inasmuch as they suggest an answer to the doubts and difficulties which beset the belief in the beneficent government of the universe. The Preface, therefore, contains a statement of the grounds on which the author rests his theology. The following extract will go some way towards determining his position:? " The existence of a wise and beneficent Creator and of a renewed life hereafter are still to me beliefs?especially the first?very nearly reaching the solidity of absolute convictions. The ono is almost a Certainty, the other a solemn Hope. And it does seem to me unphilosophic to allow my contemplation of life or my speculations on the problems it presents to run in the grooves worn in the mind by its antecedent history, so long as no dogmatism is allowed, and no dUprovabk datum is suffered for a moment to intrude. The question, when stated with the perfect unreserve which alone befits it, lies in small compass. Of actual knotrledye we have simply nothing. Those who believe in a Creative Spirit and Ruler of the Universe are forced to admit that they can adduce no proofs or arguments cogent enough to compel conviction from sincere minds constituted in another mould. There are facts, indications, corollaries, which seem to suggest the great inference almost irresistibly to our minda. There are other facts, indications, corollaries, which to other minds seem as irresistibly to negative that inference. Data, admitted by both, appear of very different weight to each. The difficulties in the way of either conclusion are confusedly stupendous. The difficulty of conceiving the eternal pre-existence of a Personal Creator I perceive to be immense; the difficulty of conceiving the origin and evolution of the actual universe independently of such Personal Creator I should characterize as insuperable. The Positivist ?the devotee of pure science?would simply reverse the adjectives. We can neither of us turn the minor into the major difficulty for the other without altering the constitution of his intelligence." The difficulties which attend the belief in a future existence are, according to Mr. Greg, in a great measure due to the particularity of popular conceptions of it. The instinctive recognition " that a sense of identity, a conscious continuity of thc ego, is an essential clement of the doctrine," has led men to form detailed theories of the nature, mode, and conditions of the future life ; whereas, "while it is more than probable that our imagination is utterly incapable of picturing or conceiving, or even conjecturing or approaching, the actual truth about the unseen world, it is certain that our reason will find no difficulty at all in demolishing or discrediting every concrete and systematic conception we might form." Having thus laid his foundations in the Preface, Mr. Grog proceeds in the first chapter, upon " Realisable Ideals," to argue " that with time, patience, and intelligent exertion, every evil not inherent in or essential to a finite existence may be eliminated, and the gnawing gulf between the Actual and the Ideal at last bridged over." Mr. Greg continues :? " This faith is mine. I hold it with a conviction which I feel for scarcely any other conclusion of the reason. It appears to me the only one compatible with true piety? I mean with a rational conception of the attributes of the Creator ; for I can perceive no beauty and no religion in the notion that God placed us in this world only that we might be for ever working for and hankering after another. It appears to me, also?in spite of the clouds and darkness which are round about us ?the only one which reflection and reason will sanction. I am not prepared to give up this life as 'a bad job,' and to look for reward, compensation, virtue, and happiness solely to another. I distinctly refuse to believe in inevitable evita. I recognize in the rectification of existing wrong and the remedy of prevailing wretchedness,s the work which is given us to do.' For this we are to toil, and not to toil in vain." An analysis of the evils of our actual social condition, with suggestions for their ameliorations, follows, and serves as an introduction to a detailed consideration of two of the three agencies "the tendency of which appears hostile to all continuous progress or radical and farreaching amelioration, and which, if they be really as persistent and incurable as they seem, must be fatal to the realization of our dreams of the ultimate happiness of mankind, or must relegate that realization to a world of wholly altered conditions. These agencies are, first, the alleged perpetual and inevitable struggle for mere existence,?secondly, the multiplication of the race from its least eligible specimens, or as it has been happily termed, the non-survival of the fittest,?and, thirdly, the increasing prevalence of democratic views and institutions?a prevalence which many deem irresistible and fated." The third of these antagonistic agencies is not dealt with at length, an omission which we regret the more because we are not sure that we agree with the opinions which Mr. Greg indicates in the few pages devoted to it. In the second chapter, entitled ' Malthus notwithstanding,' it is argued that there are indications of the existence of undiscovered physiological laws the tendency of which is to counteract and control the laws of population so clearly perceived and enunciated by that acute reasoner. Mr. Greg seeks to show, firstly, that, even on Malthusian principles, the time is yet far distant when the whole earth will be overstocked; and, secondly, that the assumed counteracting influences are already in operation, and will operate more and more extensively as years go by, until at last the pressure of population on the means of subsistence ceases to be the normal condition of humanity. In justification of his belief that such counteracting influences are already at work, Mr. Greg urges that " the actual fecundity of the human race has never equalled, and scarcely ever even distantly approached, its possible fecundity, and that this difference is observable when there is neither vice, misery, nor moral restraint to account for it"; that " every man is able by his own labour to produce food enough not only to sustain himself and those naturally helpless and dependent upon him, but enough also to exchange for the shelter and clothing which are as necessary as food to the human animal" ; that "in spite of the alleged tendency of population to increase faster than food, food always has increased faster than population "; that there ave many instances of the extinction of families, classes, and tribes which are not accounted for by any of the laws recognized by Malthus; and, finally, that there is no other instance in which the laws of nature so flagrantly contradict each other, as on the Malthusian theory they would seem to do in the matter of population. Chief amongst the influences to which Mr. Greg looks to counteract the pressure of population is the tendency of cerebral development to lessen fecundity, which tendency will, he hopes, increasingly operate as a corrective of undue fertility, " even though free expansion into wider areas should have made the pressure of that struggle almost unfelt." His theory is, therefore, a much more hopeful one than that of Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose doctrine?that "the excess of fertility has rendered the process of civilization inevitable, and the process of civilization must inevitably diminish fertility, and at last destroy its excess,"? assumes that pressure of population is the necessary condition of cerebral development. If we mistake not, this is the weak point in Mr. Greg's theory of population. He anticipates cerebral development and increase of cerebral activity in spite of an artificial diminution in the severity of the struggle for existence, and a consequent prolongation of the life of imperfect specimens. He ought, therefore, to show either that cerebral development is independent of the struggle for existence, or at least that the struggle for existence may stimulate cerebral development indirectly by the assistance of some other physiological law. Hence, we conceive that, in order to make his hypothesis complete, Mr. Greg should work out his idea that Mr. Spencer's condemnation of Mr. Doubleday's theory needs qualification. Is it possible that certain kinds of food contribute a greater proportion than others to individuation, a less to genesis ; and that we have already profited unconsciously by the action of the law, and are destined in future to profit by it to a still greater extent? However this may be, we are grateful to Mr. Greg for raising this important question, as we are convinced that the artificial check of enforced celibacy is the main cause not only of what is called, par excellence, the social evil, but also of other serious ills from which the body politic is suffering. Not the least of these is " the non-survival of the fittest," which forms the subject of the following chapter. Our readers will doubtless remember an admirable passage in Mr. Galton';* ' Hereditary Genius,' in which the obstacles interposed by civilization to the action of the law of the survival of the fittest are discussed, with characteristic force and ingenuity. Mr. Greg, having independently pursued the same line of thought, appears to have come to conclusions substantially the same as those of Mr. Galton. But whilst Mr. Galton is content to mark the sources of the mischief, Mr. Greg attempts to indicate means by which it is to be counteracted. In our opinion, Mr. Greg is, in this part of his essay, less happy than usual. He pictures to himself a society in which " the sick, the tainted, and the maimed would betoo sensible and too unselfish to dream of marrying and handing down to their children the curse of diseased or feeble frames ; or if they did not thus control themselves, the State would exercise a salutary but unrelenting paternal despotism, and supply the deficiency by vigilant and timely prohibition. A republic is conceivable in which paupers should be forbidden to propagate ; in which all candidates for the proud and solemn privilege of continuing an untainted and perfecting race should be subjected to a pass or competitive examination, and those only be suffered to transmit their names and families to future generations who had a pure, vigorous, and well-developed constitution to transmit." We cannot help thinking that our author underrates not only the difficulties which stand in the way of such a refonn, but also the dangers to which it might lead if injudiciously carried out. If it were necessary only to improve the physical constitution of the race, we might, perhaps, enact legal restrictions such as Mr. Greg suggests; though even then the reform would presume, in the generations* which submitted to it, a height of heroic self sacrifice hitherto unexampled in the history of the world, and, in the rulers who enforced it, knowledge as yet far beyond our reach. But in order to the attainment of Mr. Greg's ideal, we must develope by artificial selection not only the physical, but also the intellectual capacities of man. How then must we adjust thebajance between the two, so that physical and intellectual excellence may both be secured, not one of them at the expense of the other I Until some solution is offered to these problems, we may well shrink from a reform which would necessitate a complete reconstruction of the principles of morality, that is to say which would require from a whole nation, as a duty, a self-sacrifice which has hitherto been accounted heroic in the individual. A chapter upon ' The Limits and Direction of Human Development' comes next, in which the relations of the physical, intellectual, and spiritual faculties of man are discussed, and the necessity of developing them harmoniously and equally insisted upon. The exaggerated cultivation of any one of the three sides of our nature has disease for its inevitable consequence, whence it is inferred that we must look in this life to the general and gradual advancement of the race rather than tb any rapid progress of the individual in one special direction. " The progress of the Race is here, the progress of the Man hereafter." Thus far Mr. Greg has been concerned with the present and the future of the Race; the remaining chapters, entitled 'The Significance of Life,' 'De Profundis,' and 'Elsewhere,' are concerned with the present and the future of the Individual. Of this part of the work we shall not attempt an analysis, not only because we are unwilling to engage in theological controversy, but also because it would be impossible to do justice to Mr. Greg's arguments within the space at our disposal. Of these three concluding chapters, the last, 'Elsewhere,' is, perhaps, the least satisfactory. Indeed, we are not sure that Mr. Greg's treatment of this most difficult subject is altogether consistent with the rules which he has laid down in his Preface. Whereas, as we have already remarked, he there protests against attempts to form a distinct theory about the future life, he is himself unable to resist the temptation; and, consequently, with all his ingenuity, subtlety, and self-control, lays himself open to the objections which may be urged against all such speculations. In conclusion, we cannot too highly commend the courage, earnestness, and skill with which Mr. Greg has maintained a position which will be attacked on the one side by those theologians who practically regard the virtues of faith and hope as superfluities lacking a raison d'etre, and, on the other side, by those men of science who think charity, in the large sense of the word, a sentimental delusion. Mr. Greg's merits as a writer are so well known that we have no need now to dwell upon them.

"On the 4th of April. l7i,, one Major Thomas Weir. an old man of seventy, expiated his crimes on the Gallowlie of Edinburgh. A bad man, surely a canting, loose-lived hypocrite, who made his l)uritanism the cloak for his seeret crines, serving Sill vith his bodv in (lailv and imuist d-et'staahle service, while his lips spoke only of zeal to God and the soul's devoutest e:zercise. Still, it was a terrible fate for nothing more heinous thati an unclean life - a purification by fire in truth, 1)ut not for the sanctificetion of souis. Perhaps he would have got off altogether, hal he not been charged with witcheraft. Incest and tlle foulest v ices were l)ad enough, but witcheraft was worse.

Scarcely in any story is the me.asure pointed out of fraud, selfdeception, disease, or exaggeration, but the writcr thinks that all four conditions, in varying p)roportions, inight 1)0 aplied to every ca(ese. -Those who belie:e in direct and personal intercourse between the spirit-world and man will probably accept every account with the unquestioning belief of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; those who have faith in the calm aud uniform opeI ritilns of nature will hold chiefly to the doctrine of fritud - thos, whi) hive sesn mulich of disease and that strange conlition called ' mesmerism' or ' sensitiveness' vill allow the presecec of absolute nervouis derangement mixed up with a large amount of conscious deception which the inlane credulity and nimrvellous ignorance of the time rendered easy to practise; and those who have been accustomed to sift evidence aind examine witnesses will be utterly (lissatisfied with the loose statements and wild distortiou of every instance on record." Th is is very well so far as it goes, but it fails to be altogether satisfactory. A fifth case sometimes arises, wliclh i8 not resolvable by any of tIe give lhypotheses.

FICTION She Case of MIchard Meynell. By MRS. HUMPHRY WARD. I (Smith, Elder, and Co.. 6s.) RICHA"D MEYNE.LL was a rebellious pugnacious person, but he was one of those' lovable revolutionists'whom even their enemies are compelled to'respeot aid to esteem;' His ?cosy rectory at Utcote Minor became a storm-centre not only for 'the district, but for the whole ' country; that is, in matters pertaining to the Church, for doubtless in uninterested spheres of thought there lived thousands of good people quite unaware of the whirlwind of- controversy raging so furiously around them. It is a curious sign of the times, the unconcern with which this book has. been received. Twenty years ago, when we approached " Robert Elsmere," it was with a sense of awe and a furtive feeling, as of those who grasp at forbidden fruit. Of Elamere's rebellion we. read with bated breath, vastly moved; of Meynell's antagonism to the conventions of the Established Church we now read with perfect, tranquillity.- It must be confessed that Meynell's love-story interests us a great deal more than the religious discussions and the clash of opinions which form what the author clearly intended to be the most important part of the book. Mary Elsmere, daughter of Robert (of whose struggles we hear many echoes in this volume), is a beautiful character, drawn with intense sympathy, and the gradual unfolding of her love for Richard Meynell is like the sweet opening of some pale, fragrant rose. In this book, indeed, Mrs. Humphry Ward is more successful with. her women than with the men. Rose Flaxman, charmingly backed up by her husband in her belief in Meynell throughout the scandal which threatened to overthrow him, is a fine example of the true "womanly " helpmeet-one who. retains her fascination, her humour, her homeliness in spite of -wealth and position. Hester Fox-Wilton,. too, the -wilful. girl -who insists upon carrying through her disastrous. passion for the scapegrace Philip Meryon, is full of life, and can be distinctly visualised; Philip, on the other hand, remains vague and unimpressive. The whole story tends to prove that matters of faith and belief, of ritual and procedure, however controversial, are out of place in the novel of the present day. Meynell is a vivid enough personality to bear a story to a thoroughly good finish, apart from the heterodox convictions with which he is saddled for the sake of the plot; and the baseless scandal disseminated by anonymous letters-the writer of 'which turns out, as ever, to be a negligible cad-would have made the theme of a side-issue suffciently real to hold any reader's attention. The book is written with all the' care and gravity which we expect from Mrs. Humphry Ward; but there have been several others from her pen, of late years, which will make a much wider appeal.

Old Rabbit, the Voodoo, and other Sorcerers. By Mary Alicia Owen. (Fisher Unwin.) " Brother, what a great deal of tea you do drink!" said the sister while handing him his fourteenth cup of weak tea. " Sister, what a great deal of water you make mo drink in order to get a little tea! " was his answer, and it comes to our mind while reading this collection of stories. It has, Mr. Leland says in the preface, not been " made on the Grimm principle of ' pleasing tales for the nursery.'" It is startling to hear that the brothers Grimm had the nursery in their minds when they set the stone of collecting folk-tales rolling, but it is manifest that Miss Owen cannot have had it in hers, for except in an American? not to say a Missouri?nursery her book will be almost unintelligible. Some words are obscure even to grown-up people, and it is hard to have to toil through so much Negro-English before we can enjoy the "items of true folk-lore, earnest, clear, and well-defined," that are promised by Mr. Leland. The promise is fulfilled; there is a great deal of valuable folk-lore in the stories, but it is injured not only by the uncouth dialect, but by being laboriously introduced into the conversation of five negresses and one child who draws thenout. One negress is from "Ole Feginney"; another was "bornded in Tennisee, but mos'ly brung up in Mizzoury "; a third has a French father, a fourth a Fox Indian, while the fifth (Aunt Mymee) is spoken of as the only pure-blooded African of the group. An African sorceress is indeed her mother, but she is anxious to have it generally understood that her other parent was the devil. She is acquainted with the mysteries of Voodooism, and can "trick" men and beasts, and to "trick" in NegroEnglish means more than in English proper. She lays " a turr'ble trick " on some dogs, but explains that it is one which is mostly used on human beings. "' Wut trick ?' asked Granny.'Des (just) one o' dem Oby pison; yo' kyarn' git all de greegins (ingredients) foh hit hyeah, so I don't mek no bones ter tell yo' dat hit am er powdeh mek outen de same hef' ob snails an' lizuhds an' crickits an' scorpums dry down an' beat fine. Huh ! ef yo' git dat on er man's haid, he ha'r all gwine ter fall off an4 he eye git dim an' he vittle lose dey good tase an' he gwine ter hyeah de soun' o' crickits an' frogs an' de likes in his yeahs, an' he swine ter be slow lak de snail an' spotty lak de snake an' he be dumb (stupid) lak de lizuhd, an' he gwine ter be ez full ob misery ez er Injun am ob lice. Dat so, an' he meat gwine ter swivel an' he bones gwine ter crack an' he marrer dry out." Some of this Obi poison was " got on the head " of the hero of one of Balzac's stories in the 'Histoire des Treize,' and there is an admirable description of his death by slow torture in the manner indicated by Aunt Mymee, whose form of dialect is happily simpler than that of her associates. Miss Owen, who has, we are told, been initiated sufficiently into the mysteries of Voodooism "to divine its full scope and nature," means to give her knowledge to the world at some future time. That being the case, she does not give so much of it now as we should like, but what she does give is most interesting. Aunt Mymee has a luck-ball, which she believes contains her soul as well as her luck. She calls it by her own name, and bathes it in whiskey once a week to preserve its strength. Full directions are given for the making, wearing, and treatment of a luck-ball. It is a thing (or a being) which " busts loose " if not properly treated, and may be taken out and consulted. His or her " approval or disapproval can always be felt Dy the owner at once, and help relied on if asked for." The negroes seem to have a large number of superstitions in common with us. The snake superstitions are, of course, their own and are curious. One is that if you kill the first snake you see, you are safe from all other snakes for the rest of your life. We tell the bees if a death occurs in the family ?so do they, but they tell the births and weddings too. There are a great many North-Country words in their dialect: one of the most unexpected is "bijitty," conceited ; " bigoted or even " bigitive " is used in the North in just the same sense. "Yarbs" is found in Yorkshire, so is "traipsing" (also heard in London), and many other instances might be given. "Dumb" for stupid in the recipe for Obi poison is, of course, German; and is not to give " a tongue thrashing " Irish ?

FLOWER 0' THE ORANGE. By Agnes and Egerton Castle. 6s. (Afethuea.) In this collection of short stories Mr. and Mrs. Castle display the delightful qualities that have given them a name as writers of romance. There is an air of charm about each brief tale; and only the most pacific will object to the prevalence of sword-play-a matter on which Mr. Castle writes with expert authority, he himself being a fencer of subtle ability. Here and there, however, even those who love fights and the clash of steel may find too much technicality in the description of a duel. The scene of the story which gives the title to the book is laid in Galloway, and the hero is Simon Carmichael of Eagernesse, one of the old fighting lairds of Scotland, whose return to Galloway after the death of his wife, fromn whom he has been separated, is celebrated by a dinner, which is described with rare zest. It is then that we meet Flower o' the Orange, -i young lady whose effectiveness might have been more complete had she not displayed a Castle-like anxiety to stab a man with a knife. In the end there is an alliance between Eagernesse and Flower o' the Orange, and this is le(l up to with delicate skill. One of the ablest stories is 11 I lagar of the Fariu," which deals not with swords, but nuill hunian love.

THE LITERARY EXAMINER. Oliver Twist. ByCharles Dickens. 3 vols. I Bentley. In our notice of last week we restricted ourselves to the latter scenes of this work merely, and to the degree of success with which the author has worked out his purposes in them. But we cannot let pass the opportunity of speaking more at large on the position and claims of Mr Dickens, which is afforded us by this happy completion of the greatest evidence of his peculiar powers he has yet given to the world. With no blindness, then, to the immaturities that aecompany the genius of this writer, of nothing are we better assured than of the soundness of our faith in that genius; nor is the creed, truly, a hazardous one, when we have all England, America, and [the Jiterati of France and Germany, to support us i nit ! LO Mr Dickens, indeed. has any opponents worth noticing (of which we are not aware), they can only be the 6lite of a clas8 which the poet has pronounced to be the natural shadows that always accompany and prove the substantial existence of genius and of fame. Let us add that if ever a man of genius appeared wht;sie lot would seem an enviable one, it is that of Mr Dickens; for he has been acknowledged as such at once, is voung, popular, prosperous, and doing good. Of whas other writer in the annals of literature could this be said ?-at least under such extet.sive circumstances of the combination of fame with utility'? Who, like him, ever promised to bring reforms into the Augean stables Qf mercenary schools and prisons and workhouses, by the apparently light arms of hbumour and the gentle ones of pathos ? by shaking the air around them with bursts of laughter, and purifying it with the uncanting tears of the very criminals themselves? Is whatever light Mr Dickes is regarded, with a view to this point, the felicity of his fortune is remarkable. He has been destined to show,-what 1as been thought impossible,-that a writer may have the very wat and most hazardous knowledge of a " man of the world," and yet be no such vicious and nerousminded pretender to universalit as the personage commenly so called, but a real and hearty cosm4)olite. Piel Jjq, it is true, and others have abow u thiin part; but not as if it were the business an apecial office of their lires to do so. With those great nvelists, existing abuses and such public and ofesive Fatten of fact wren but incidental, or treated occasonally and pa With Mr Dickens, *ey, and his humour, aid in pathos, are alike all in 'dl, He us the combiner of svere utilitaria , wit the laughing and tesrfii sy tbies that are jog jooked for in kt company. has as solid, e . every-day life for the dwork of his Adrima wit and tbs as me d supseded thet aMd petritya proEp of the Cian in the Arabian tale, andtruck the pry and parish goV., Of his country into palpable life for Let tbose who, even whie joiding in the popular xsi" which at prest cheeron this wrmter, yet facy the Fund on which be just now Ads so hi oUld and ucertan-pause a little to cook d Vii Upon tM lone, we may confidently say, u eadvan i b clim to a lowiq with poste. r4. For if bi worksould not benOr.dts thee, a ok_7an "a, bea over the daily occr and bsl s of everday lif thy hav Arown a awid m or becam we en gam~~*am Odtf onps av ie use. toisP- Mat S ~ w~ O ;5id I ~~ I - - -- - W-7 I- L - I I pvinrvei th lemons which jokys or m ies Oehs tauoht can at any time be fraught but with the deepeat nterst to all claes of people. And to what could such exetsions be applied with truth, if not, in an especial degree, to this admi. rable novel of Oliver Twist ? Who is there of its many thousand readers that cannot recall the face of almost every peson in the book, the air, the attitude, the dres, werl nigh as familiar to him as his own? Parson Adams sitting over a cup of ale in Sir Thoms Booby's kitchen, Parson TIrulliber rolling over his sty among his filthy favourites, are not more firmly fixedbefore the mind's eye for ever. Nor is it the dress, the air, the walk, the little peculiarities which express great points of characterbut the ery character itself in its most latent recesses, in its veriest internal workings, which is laid bare and open before us. We illustrated this by some striking examples last week-but it is obvious, even in the lighter passages of the book, and where the apparently careless hand of the author would seem to have aimed at no such effect. Take, for instance, the slight portrait of the Jew on the morning after little Oiveres introduction to his den. The villainous confidence of habit does not extinguish the anxious watches and listenings of crimeThere was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below; and, when he had satisfied himselt; he would go on whistling and stirring again as before. Of a similar sort is the sketch of this atrocious old thief as he crawls out on a night excursionThe mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly. down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls nd doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved, crawling forth by night in search of some rich offll for a meaL And with the same purpose we may quote, almost at random, the glance at a robber's flash ken, omitting a hundred others that would illustrate the remark with, perhaps, superior force and effectThere was the chairman himself, the landlord of the house: a coarse, rough, heavy-built fellow, who, while the songs were proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and seeming to give himself up to joviality had an eye for everything tat was done, and an ear for everything that was aid-anf sharp ones, too. Near him were the singers receiving with protessional indifference the compliments of the conpany, and applying themselves in turn to a dozen profferedd lasses of spirits and water tendered by their more boisterous admirers, whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention by their very repulsiveness. Cuoir, ferocity and drunkenness in all its stases were there in 1rt est aspects; and women-some with the last lingering tinge l of their early freshness almost fading as you lookand others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome blak. of profligacy and crime-some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of life-formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture. No one indeed, who has any pretension to good feeling or good judgment, will doubt for an instant, on reading this work, that its author has added an immortal novel to the already rich stores of English action. And what can a critic do better in ouch a case than offWer his hearty admiration too ? What can he hope to do better, when asked his opinion of it, than run enthusiastically over its different scenes and characters ? For what sufficient gratitude can he express for the hearty laughs afforded him by Bumble the Beadle, and delightful Charldy Bates, and the Cowardly Charity Boy wit his " such agony plase sir" (there is a whole school4iife in that single Prase) -or how can be thank Mr Dickens enough for the tear (he should be ashamed of his manhood if he did not shed them) which are called forth by poor little Oliver, and his mother, and, above all, by Sikes's mistress ;-or, finally, for the genuine and grand terrors (the grander for their subdIntion of common life into the region of the awful) occasioned by the husband and mother of the sbved woman in the first volume; by the murder in the third (with its sunshia neIt mrins, and t4 pool of blood makn g Jack o'Laithors on the ceiling); by the restless wapadr. jogsof Sikeswhem he hadcommtted it ; th petition of the words old Amn-old man" by the Jew before the judge, amidst all the bare worklip of his withered soul I by his last ago Of spite NW terror and d ir in Cmined cell, like a Poisoned h nrat; ad last of a by tt mX At and usaendous coesusaon of 1ikees life in the titudi s iing ad bi, _*aginagquumr Of lf y Di _ M IND in dot . isa Asth is r _s"to out of an atiaf a e ofm o . 11 onaly tM Jew saing-a viw .--|~~~~~ ~~~~~~ if I *;1; ths~~ofI Ike a 1 ubemI Js -ew Wq, myw of whlct - Joags ai the tehe an int the Ime wrsa beore -,of thle (iem tNe particular,-wilt show him At Qs w pards the heroism of gendeseis d th e in a better contrast to his truly id or i foregrounds than it St prmat occupies by somewhat trivial creaios of 1.ose d Hag Maylie.

" Oh, dear lady, why lu't those who claim to be God's own folks as gentle mmd as Iad to us poor wrfthes as you, who, having youth sd beat and afl that they have lost, might boa little proud inste o( so much humbler!" " Ad I" said the gentlema, "a Turk turns his fae, after washing it well, to the East when he says his prayers; thes good people, after gi ajt Ieir facecA the I World as take.

Or .here-where she is asked to desert Sikes and embrace a better life"'It is never too late," said Rosej &frw penitence ad atonement." "I It is," cried the girl, writhing in the agony of ber mind; cc I cannot leave him now-I could not he Ins death." "Why should you be?" asked Rose. "Nothing could save him," ced the girl. "If I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is the boldest, ad has bee so cruel !" Or, finally here, whers the very deepest recess of t4e woman's heart is again laid open before us", When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful u you are," replied the girl steadily, gieaway your hearts, lan will carry you all length#-eves such as you who have home, frieds, other admirers, evervbi- to ll them Wham sush as m h-o haW ew eu, t e Uict the' r aA no friend ii sickness or death but the hosital a t ow rotteP hAtson a04 T Msl sad lit hIillm i that parents, home, and friends illed one or that be a blank through all our wroted lis who ca h t cur us ?

It was light it as likely to he till night cameon again, ad the busy moning of half the London population had beg.n. - . .. ... .. Exquisite are the various remarks on life anti the aftctions which are abundantly scattered throuigh. out the volumes. As here, in speaking of Oliver over Rose's sick bedHe had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect or want of thought, for he had been devoted to her service; d et a hundred little occasions rose up before him on whicihe fancied he might have been more zealous and more ernest, and wished he had been. We need be cateful how we deal with those about us, for every death carries with it to some small circle of survivors thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done-of so many things forrotten, and so =any more which might have been reptired, hat such recollections are among the bitterest we can have. There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this in time. Or here-in a few lines which express the healthy wisdom of our author's philosophyMen who look on nature and their fellow men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the iigtht; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts. The iral hues are delicate, and require a clearer vision. Our concluding extract shall be a portion of the scene at "Folly Ditch," which expresses, in the various fear and horror inspired among the very thieves themselves by the return of the murderer after his frightful deed - and especially in the sudden re. sistance of the naturally good-}learted boy to the cruel and powerful villain-somei of the most beautiful reliefs and self-assertions of humanity even ill scenes and among characters so debased. " We must let him in," he said, taking up the candle. " Isn't there any help for it ?" asked the other man in a boars voice. " None. He must come in."

The contest, however, was too unequal to lst long. Sikel had him down and his kuee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm and pointed to the window.

One man on horseback seemed to be amog the crowd, fr there was the noise of hools rattling on the uneven pavement; the gleam of lights increased, the foot. steps came more thickly and noixily im. Then came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail. Write such books as Oliver Twist for ever, DICKENS, varied only as advancing years will vary themt, and for ever will collnultwi8ties, as well as individuals, have reason to be gratefdl. We have omitted any notice of the illustrations by Cruikshank becaiuse they merit, and shall receive, a separate notice by themselves. They advance Cruikshank's claims as ;n artist to a mntuch higher point than they had reached before.
