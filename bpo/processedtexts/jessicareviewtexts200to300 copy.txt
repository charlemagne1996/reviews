THE HUMAN BOY AGAIN. By Eden I'hilll*tt.. (,. (Chapman & Hall.) It is a delight to have further stories in the style o1 The Human Boy," the success of which was so great and so well deserved. The new sketches of life at a boys' boar(lingschool are de(licate(l to M -ark Twain, Father ol 'Tom Sawyer' and ' Huckleberry Finn,' those Human Bovs": and the book is worthy of a disciple ol the American humorist. Those who know Mr. Phillpotts only as the author of such works as " Lving Prophets ' and " Children of the Mist," those powerful novels of the West of England, may be sur)risedl to find that one who couII(l write these serious works could write also " The Human Bov Again," with its ingenious antl mightily amusing tales of schoolbov tricks, p)ranks, and cxKxriences. Like 'S talky &* Co.," the book confines itself wholly to a few school(boys and their masters, but it is a " Stalkv & Co."' with the savagery left out and geniality substituted. ()ne of the most almiusin,, tales is about a boy- whtlo wvas steeped in Sherlock Holmes andl canie to terrible grief through his attempts to apply- the methods (if the Master to a theft of a pKncil-sIlarpenler an(l another good story concerns itself withthe bankru4tcyof a boy who, w'hen toldl he must pay " so much in the pound,'' said that that wvas all right, but that he hadn't got the pound. It is to be trusted that Mr. IPhillpotts wvill give us more Human Bo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FATHER RALPH. By OSWALD O'DONOVAN. Macmillan. 6s. We know nothing of the official fate of this book, but only by a miracle could it have escaped being placed on the Index. Being a book which every Roman Catholic should read, doubtless the Church has already done her utmost to limit its circulation among her members. After the immemorial custom of institutions, the Roman Church delights to prosecute her redeemers, those who have her spiritual welfare most at heart. Mr. O'Donovan's story is a sincere and convincing indictment, not of Roman Catholicism, but of the administration of the affairs of the Church in Ireland. Mr. O'Donovan is evidently himself a devout and whole-hearted Catholic, a man of a nature so deeply religious that it has remained unperverted by the bitter experiences that must have gone to the making of this book; for there can be little doubt that Father Ralph is largely a record of actual experience. It is a story evidently written from the inside, and written with a transparently passionate purpose of a man moved to speak out by the knowledge that his Church is becoming a tool in the hands of the gombeen men for the suppression of the co-operative movement and of all efforts to ameliorate social conditions among the Irish people. Considered as a work of fiction, the book is able and absorbing. The character drawing is sympathetic and convincing. Unlike manv reformers, Mr. O'Donovan does not blunder into exaggeration. The black is not laid on with a mop. Among the numerous priests whom he portrays there are as many sheep as goats, as many saints as sinners-men who have remained truly religious in spite of theology, in spite of the Church.

The Bookman 7 : 42 185 - 185
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TILE HONOUR OF SAVELLI. By S. Levett Yeats. (S. Low.) 'The Honour of Savelli' is a romance inspired by a loving perusal of Dumas. The writer-who has already made a creditable reputation by his Indian stories-acknowledges this, and indeed the form and order of his p)lot and incidents remind us many a time of certain stages in the history of the famous Gascon adventurer. What Dumas's imitators cannot catch is his wit. But it is ungrateful to make a comparison, for Mr. Levett Yeats has written an excellent story. He has picked out a suitable epoch of history, which admits not only of the introduction of such interesting personages as Machiavelli, the Borgias, and the Chevalier Bayard, but which, faction being rife and plots and counterplots the order of the day in Florence and Rome, presents abundance of perilous errands for the brave Savelli to be entrusted with. There are commonplace passages-the particular accusation which unjustly disgraced the hero at the beginning does not content us; and there are improbable ones-notably his failure, in spite of abundant opportunity, to see through the disguise of Madame D'Entrangues. Nevertheless Mr. Yeats, though shaky as yet on his new ground, has written a strring and spirited story which we have read with interest to the end.

The Athenaeum  : 3670 283 - 284
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pccoronc of Ser Giovanni. FINE ARTS ILLUSTRATED BOOKS. Translated by >V. G. Waters. Illustrated. (Lawrence & Bullen.)?The 4 Pecorone ' has been translated with frankness and vivacity by Mr. Waters, and it is illustrated with original designs of great merit by Mr. E. It. Hughes, one of the most accomplished draughtsmen of our time. Like the tales of Masuccio and Straparola these tales have never been translated into English before, and, in this country at least, arc still less known, although to one or two of our playwrights and novelists a few of the more striking and picturesque 4< situations " have, with certain changes of local colour, supplied serviceable help. Indeed, except incompletely, ' Il Pecorone ' has not been rendered into a foreign tongue. The objections to it as a book for family reading are precisely those which apply to the 4 Decameron' and its successors, but they are less considerable. The writer has substituted for Boccaccio's garden party the authorized interviews in a convent parlour at Forli of a beautiful young nun, by name Saturnia, and her most exemplary admirer, the 44 wellmannered youth of Florence," Auretto. For five ? and ? twenty successive days did this admirable pair meet platonically in the parlour and each tell a story. Mr. Waters, in his erudite introductory essay, not only relates so much as he has been able to gather about Ser Giovanni individually, but recounts the history of his book, as well as of the sources of some of the tales he incorporated, and the manner and whereabouts of the few adaptations of them, or parts of them, which appeared after their publication. A large proportion had, with certain minor differences already appeared in older 44Novellieri," and it is fair to say, with Mr. Waters, that Ser Giovanni's versions do really 44gain in decency if not in dramatic force." In the latter element they are not at all deficient. At thc same time let us add that here and there a certain directness of description and vivacity is by no means wanting in ' Il Pecorone,' which, however, knows little or nothing of the occasional coarseness of the 'Decameron.' Be this as it may, the reader cannot fail to notice in the earlier portions of the compilation stories of the same character as those of which the 4 Decameron' is full, while in the latter part the tales are, so to say, more or less travesties of legitimate histories ?quaint and vivid inversions of the truth. For example, a version of her history and of her taking for her second husband the son of the Duke of Bavaria ?Ser Giovanni ignored the first of her spouses ? is related with a charming naivete by Auretto to Saturnia which would have surprised the Countess Matilda. Further on we hear how Attila overthrew Florence, how Charlemagne became emperor, how the world was divided into three parts, and how ^Eneas passed from Troy into Italy. Of Mr. Hughes's illustrations the pity is that there are so few of them. Of the best it is impossible to speak too highly. The charms of his ladies are undeniable, from those of Madonna Giovanna watching her indignant husband to those of the naked Countess Matilda defying her spouse. It is with nude and graceful figures Mr. Hughes, as in previous cases, succeeds best?see the design of Petruccia da Viterbo, facing p. 37 ; but he does not fail in draped and half-draped compositions, such as those of the Princess Lena (p. 115, Novel II.), the group of monks with the boy rescued from the tomb, and the death of Corso Donati. We have received from Messrs. Low & Co. Parts II. to VI. of their English version of the Life of our Lord Jesus Christ, illustrated by M. J. Tissot. Having already spoken in the highest terms of Part I. of this publication, it remains to say that the five parts now before us reproduce the coloration of the originals more especially with great good fortune, and display their stroug points, extraordinarily picturesque invention, insight, and dramatic feeling to advantage. The startling originality of the conception of 'Jesus taken up into a High Mountain,' the huge figure of the demon looming in twilight behind Him, may be compared with * Jesus ministered to by Angels,' where He sleeps, and the guardians' outstretched hands touch His garments. Both these works are striking examples of the power of the designer. The composition called 'Nathaniel under the Fig-Tree' is a good specimen of his treatment of Oriental landscape. Decidedly impressive is the figure of ' St. Bartholomew,' one of the best in a series of studies. Further parts will be published in the spring. Cinderella's Picture Book, with the original coloured pictures and new additions by W. Crane (Lane), contains 'Cinderella,' 'Puss in Boots,' and 'Valentine and Orson' in Mr. Walter Crane's versions, as well ns his excellent designs, the first group of which show what a pretty girl Cinderella really was, how graceful and natural, and likewise what a lovely fairy godmother looked after her. We do not care about' Puss in Boots,' but at the cartoon which heads 'Valentine and Orson,' and shows how two most ferocious lions guarded the gate when the heroic friends approached that fortress of the Green Knight's castle, we cannot look too often. These pictures have been "engraved and printed " by Mr. E. Evans ; but neither in colouring nor in delicacy do they equal the first issues of ' King Luckiboy' and ' The Fairy Ship.' Evangeline: a Tale of Acadie (Gay & Bird), appears decorated with certain prettily coloured plates, the productions of the Misses V. Oakley and J. W. Smith. Apart from the pleasing coloration, which may be due to the printer, but is really commendable, these pictures are exactly such as two young ladies might be expected to produce.

-------------------------------------------------------------
CHRISTMAS BOOKS. The Romance of the Forests. By Ascott R. Hope. (Hogg.) ' The Romance of the Forests ' is a sequel to a former work of the same author,' The Romance of the Mountains.' His object, as he expresses it, is to produce a web of stories, legends, adventures, descriptions, and the like, so compounded as to contain information combined with amusement, and thus to form " an interesting miscellany." He has fulfilled his purpose well, and given to his readers a collection of thrilling narratives of a most heterogeneous character. What connexion some of them have with forests it is not easy to discover; but altogether he has " compounded " an instructive and readable book.

The Crew of thc Water-wagtail. By R. M. Ballantyne. (Nisbet & Co.) 
 Mr. Ballantyne^ books for boys are so well known that it is almost superfluous to recommend them. ' The Crew of the Water-wagtail,' although not his best work, is replete with manly thought and sound principle, furnishing wholesome reading for youths. The scene is laid in Newfoundland, where the heroes were wrecked before the formal discovery of the western world by Columbus. The scenery and capabilities of this island, now the oldest colony of Great Britain, are well described, and they are for the most part the same as are still to be found in that unprogressive island.?

If they did not it was their own fault?they had a fair start.

Afloat at Last. By John C. Hutcheson. (Blackie & Son.)'Afloat at Last' will suit boys very well, though it is neither particularly original nor particularly grammatical. The Irish boatswain seems to us to speak an impossible sort of lingo.

THE GOLDEN WOMAN. By Ridgwcll (Cullumn. lss. (('hap- nliail .' 1H1all. ) It is a matter for sonie doubt wlhether Mr. RUlg-wcll Cutlilumi has chosen the best title for lis new novel, ill spite of the fact that here, in England, the open, free, irresponsiblc lifc of the prairri anl miining dlistricts of \Vestcrn Canada is often alluded to as life in the Land of the Golden West. 'rTe truth is ' The Golden Woman " to many persons xwill suggest a story or a musical comedy with a light and sparkling setting, whereas Mr. Cullum is nothing in this latest work of his if he is not virile and vocal and strenuous, painting his scenes in strong, convincin-g colours and making Iris characters live and move wvith all their instincts and emotions aflame with primitive power. Indeed, this is the wveakness of his construction. He makes the pace for himself much too hot at the start, and hence we can never forget those first memorable scenes iln which old Mercy Lascelles plays the crystal in her lap till, stung by the bitterness of her recollections of her loveless vouth, she turns suddenly and swiftly on her niece, and tells her what is written in the globe: Ad The storm of disaster that brought you into the world will dog y our footsteps. You are cursed with the luck that leads to disaster. Wherever you go men will bless your name, and, almost in the same breath their blessings shall be turned to the direst curses. I tell you you arc a leper, a pariah, whom all men, for their own safe guarding, must shun." And the girl says truly " The burden Fate has imposed upon me is too great. I am going to change my name and cover up my tracks." And she does tlat, and that is the theme of the book-for she is "The Golden Woman," but never again does she touch equally tragic heights.

206   5383316   HUNGARIAN TALES.
Jan 1829  ENGLISH ESSAYS - 18th Century|ENGLISH LITERATURE - History and Criticism - 19th Century|GREAT BRITAIN - Social Life and Customs - 18th Century
The London magazine 3 : 10 78 - 86
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HUNGARIAN TALES*. These tales are manifestly the production of a gifted and cultivated mind. They are written with ease, freshness, and, where it is needed, force, and scarcely ever betray exuberance or affectation. Their object is, partly, as is announced by the title and in the preface, to describe Hungary and the Hungarians;?the author (who is understood, and indeed in more than one place in these volumes is stated, tp be a lady) ?having passed some time, recently, in that part of Europe. We confess we had considerable forebodings on this score. We bethought us what innumerable scenes of unnecessary description, both of men and ? 3 vols, post 8vo, Londi 1829. Saunders and Ottley* things, awaited us?what pen-and-ink feasts would \>e put before us, and in what splendid paper-equipages we should take the air. To our great relief, we found that the utmost forbearance and skill distinguished the work on this most difficult and tempting point. We see a great deal of both the country and the people, but we become acquainted with both in the most easy and unconscious manner; the scenery is never more minutely described than is necessary for the locality, or the associations, of the story?nor are the general habits of the people detailed more than is required for our thorough knowledge of its persons. The whole consists of eight tales, of very different lengths and subjects; the longest occupies a volume and a half, and the shortest about thirty pages. This longest, which is also th<e most elaborate, stands first ;*?it is called Cassian, though why, it is difficult to discover, inasmuch as the personage of that name is seen only at the beginning and end of the story?which follows the fortunes of the heroine throughout. There are, in this tale, a great deal of knowledge of human nature?much delicacy and sweetness?and, here and there, outbreaks of very considerable force; but, besides faults of detail, there is one which pervades the whole, to which indeed the author herself alludes, which, though it may not appear to be a fault in the eyes of some readers, certainly to us diminished very greatly the gratification which the powers displayed in the story were calculated to give. We mean the gloom which pervades the whole composition from beginning to end. That gloom is thoroughly accounted for?is admirably rendered?but still it is gloom, and, though not unvaried, yet constant. In short, as we said while we were reading the story, the pleasure we derive from this is communicated through the medium of pain. The author is herself conscious of this, and pleads very humbly in pardon. She, however, uses the word " dulness^ instead of gloom? which, she may rest assured, no one but herself would ever have dreamed of using. It is about the middle of the story that she makes this singular appeal. She says that she might have introduced, in perfect unison with the scene and persons, a thousand descriptions ?' equally new to the English reader, and inviting to the English writer,"?a thousand minor characters which might have afforded *? very original specimens of national character arid individual comedy:"? But whenever I have meditated such an entree, or such details, my spirit hath shrunk rebuked by the impulse of its own levity. My story is a true one; true as far as regards its principal facts and awful catastrophe ; and it therefore shuns such adventitious ornaments as grace the more lively imaginings of fiction. I feel that the back-ground of my picture, like that of Titian's Pietro Martire, should be dark and lowering; that every period, like the overtures which announce the fable of an Opera Seria by Mozart ot Paesiello, should be attuned into a solemn cadence; and if the result of such opinions renders my story too cold and too monotonous for the taste of those unto whom it is addressed, let them lay it aside ;?I feel myself incapable of amending my fault. No one who has followed the tale thus far can, as the author must be very well assured, " lay it aside." But still it is a fault, and we most sincerely wish it had been avoided. There is so much that is admirable, in the tale, of various sorts?the insight into the folds of nature, and the, power of developing them, especially,?that we lament the more the general tone of depression which does certainly pervade it, from first to last. The story is true I What's that to us ? We do not care a pinch of snuff whether the story be fact or fiction?except that we are sorry that such a virulent ruffian as Lingotski could ever have existed, or that there should have been a person so amiable and at the same time ill-fated as Iolina. It is not our purpose to go into the story of Cassian?we shall now only just jauntily mention one or two little faults of detail. First, we object to the charming Princess Betthyani. We were very fast falling in love with her?so much brilliancy, sense, and feeling together were irresistible?when she becomes at once utterly odious by her shameless duplicity to Iolina in not communicating the real contents of her letter to Lingotski. We hope this is not among the real parts of the story. Secondly, we do not like the nature?though not exactly the events? of the catastrophe being announced early in the book. And thirdly, and chiefly, if we do not like this from the author herself, how can we endure it from gipsies ? We should like to know whether all literary people are, in imitation of Sir Walter, gone back to the belief in Mother Goose ? There really ought to be some legislative enactment to put a stop to prophecies and omens in novels and tales. And here, it is totally out of keeping with all the rest of the book?to the great benefit thereof, and relief of its readers. No?no?magic and foreboding should be confined to the pantomimes. And now are we sorely tempted to go off at score into a magnificent political essay upon the constitution of Hungary. There are very nice facts to comment upon for about a dozen pages or so : the unlimited power of the nobles, the (therefore) unlimited poverty and depression of the people;?the barbarism of the Magnats, isolated in their nationality, carried to a pitch not short of farcical;?the-but no ;?? we are reviewing a book of tales, and we will not propound our lucubrations, however admirable, on the government of nations. Next, is a tale entitled the Tzigany, which means a gipsey. This is very delightfully done indeed. The description of the midnight-meeting of the Tzigany and his love is one of the best-drawn scenes we have read for a long time. And the girl going and telling her father in the morning is a noble trait. We are quite vexed that this story was not made to end happily. For, though the concluding scene is admirably sketched, one could have sworn to its result. We come next to the tale honoured by our especial preference? which we intend to "review,"?therefore, before we set about that important task, we shall just dispose of the other half-dozen, (Plague take it! how cramped for room, one gets at this full-bearing season of books!) The * Elizabethines' is a touching picture?the * Ferry on the Danube' a smart, strong sketch, and the * Festival of the Three Kings'?oh, why did not the author continue the * Festival of the Three'Kings' ? The idea is admirable?a sublime farce is coming?and lo! the curtain drops at the end of the first scene. The idea is of an Hungarian Magnat, national up to the very fourteenth century?holding firm to the maxim prevalent in those regions, that " Extra Hunga* riam non est vita,"?having (would he ever ??) consented to his son going abroad?who returns with an English barouche, and a French valet?having hunted in Lecetdshare, and lounged in th*, Rue Vivienne ; a thorough travelled gentleman ! We quite agree in the fitness of making the foppishness only the froth, and the young man sound wine, ** any thing to the contrary notwithstanding;" but that need not have so totally checked the developement of the impayable contrast, even without one scene between the Anglo-Parisian son, and the Hungo-Hungo-Hungarian father. The Balsam-seller of Thurotzer is very lively and rapid?but we do not think the title of the work being " Hungarian Tales," should have deprived us of Rumalie's Arabian adventures. We are quite sure we did not care a jot for forgetting Hungary, when we were at Erizan, with the Jewish girl and the plague. Of the Infanta at Presburg, if we speak at all, we must speak a great deal. We should like to discuss it. It is a bold subject to choose?and certainly well worked out. Here, too, there is gloom?but thoroughly well accounted for, and sent to the right-about at last?" for a time." We now come back to the Tavernicus, which means, being interpreted, one of the chief officers of the Hungarian Treasury. This, taken altogether, we like the best of all the tales. There are three or four exquisite characters admirably sketched. Hungarian scenes, manners, and people, are most necessarily brought in, and felicitously described?and, above all, it ends happily. Really, we are grown sick of misfortune, and are right glad to be allowed to be a little comfortable when we can. We have not space to go through the tale as we could wish; we must content ourselves with giving an abstract of the story in a dozen lines, and then favour our readers (which we have not done yet) with some extracts. The story is simply this:?The Tavernicus arrives incognito at the Blaue Igel, (the Blue Hedgehog,) " the chief inn at the little village of Dorogh." He finds the host in great trouble at his rent being raised to an extent, he will not?he has sworn not to?submit to, by the Chapter of Gran, under whom he holds the house. This landlord has a daughter, whom we consider one of the most charmingly drawn characters we have met with for a very long time?the reader will, doubtless, see why anon:?she loves, and is loved, by her father's kellermeister?he is once or twice called waiter, but we are each time ready to exclaim?" No waiter, but a knight-templar" ! He takes it into his head, on the most absurdly slight grounds, to be jealous of the mysterious traveller. The Tavernicus, who is come down with ali manner of powers from Joseph II., to redress grievances in Hungary, pities Suzsi's despair about her father's removal,?and promises her that he will prevent it, on condition that she will be secret till his return towards Vienna in about a fortnight or a month. After this, every thing goes wrong. Franz Westermann, her lover, is outrageously jealous?and really for nothing at all;?they come to no explanation, but se boudent till it begins to prey upon her health. Her father grows sour and surly?odious intruding lovers try to take advantage of the manifest quarrel between her and her Franz?till, at last, knowing that all these evils?and they increase in number and intensity, till really the reader is frightened, and begins to think she will die,?knowing that they all depend upon a word, she determines to act-*-and she persuades her old godfather?another character, which, though a little caricatured at last, is worth its no slight weight in gold?to carry her to Buda. She goes?sees the Tavernicus, who introduces her to the Archduchess, as a specimen of the Hungarian contadine?gives her the lease of the Hedgehog, renewed at the old rent?loads her with presents, as also does the Archduchess?and sends her back, with god-papa Blaschka, whose head is turned for ever by the notice taken of him by the giggling maids of honour of her Imperial Highness. Of course, on her return, all is cleared up, and the lovers are married, according to the worthy, but now, alas ! somewhat obsolete, custom of the conclusion of tales. We admire this skeleton exceedingly: it is so scrupulously dry bone. Now, for some of the integuments. The following is her conversation with her godfather on the score of her father's sufferings at the necessity of his removal:? " You may perceive how sore my father is becoming on the subject of the Chapter. But it is not when he is irritated, and speaks as he did tonight, that I am grieved for him, neighbour Johann; it is when I hear him moaning and lamenting the livelong night; and can even distinguish through the boarded partition, that he calls on my poor mother's name, and those of my brothers and sisters; telling them that he shall be driven forth in his old age to bide in a strange home, far from the grave-yard of Dorogh!?Then what can I do but weep in my turn, and feel that I would give up every thing to induce him to comply with the terms of their reverences ; or, dismissing all his cares, settle at once in the town of Buda, within sight of his own vineyards/* " While thou, Suzsi, with Franz for thy helpmeet, wouldst take his place at the Blaue lgel? observed her godfather reproachfully. " Now Heaven forgive you for the thought," exclaimed Suzsi, blushing with indignation. " For well might you know,?you, friend Blaschka, who have watched me from my baby-days,?that even if the Palatine would make me a court lady, to flaunt in brocade at the palace, I would not leave my father alone in his grayheaded years. And why do I wish him to remain here, father than retire to the city, but that Franz with his book learning, and his civil speech, and ready welcome to the gentry who frequent the inn, can do him netter service than as a vintager; in which capacity all his scholarship would not render him stronger or more active than a common Slowak labourer." " So?so," interrupted Blaschka, striving to deprecate her wrath, " I believe thee, girl,?I believe thee." " Leave my father!"?contihued poor Suzsi, almost in tears, " leave my dear kind old father,?no! not for the mines of Lipto,?not to be queen over Hungary!" " Well spoken* and bravely felt," said a strange voice from beside the stove. And Johann and Suzsi, looking towards the spot, perceived that during their discourse, a stranger had entered the saal: a tall, well-looking young man, in a somewhat rusty riding cloak and cap. We beg to say that we had ourselves made an exclamation tantamount to that of the traveller, before we knew of his existence. From that moment Suzsi gained our admiration and respect?and well does she deserve them both. Her firmness?her truth to plighted word} under the most trying of human circumstances?at last, the kindling of her mind to self-decision, self-reliance, and action?all these shew that, under similar circumstances, Suzsi Would have been a Jeanie Deans?though, we will answer for it, the idea of Jeanie never crossed the author's mind, notwithstanding the similarity of some of the circumstances. She is a great deal prettier, however, than Jeanie?and thence the knot of the story?viz., the jealousy. Now, this jealousy is, as it is done, the main, indeed, the only considerable, fault in the tale. The grounds given are so exceedingly slight, that any man who could carry on a continued, vindictive jealousy, on such an account, must have been one utterly bad in mind and heart?which our friend Franz, though we see but little of him, is by no means meant to be. This should be altered in two points?more apparent cause should be given for the jealousy; and he never should have said one word to her discredit. A man, such as we are led to believe him to be, would rather have had his tongue drawn out with pincers first. But our readers shall judge :? The stranger had scarcely seated himself before his repast, when a band of zlgeuner who were passing through the village having noticed the lights still burning in the saal, entered without further invitation, and established themselves in the back-ground, for the performance of one of their singular concerts. A dulcimer, two violins, a monochord and a bass, were the instruments employed,?all of their own manufacture; and without the least knowledge of counterpoint, or of music as a science, they contrived to maintain a very decent degree of harmony; each in turn improvisating a variation upon the motivo sustained by the others,?a very beautiful and characteristic national melody. On the conclusion of their concerted piece, old Matthias, who was vain of his daughter s talents and sweet voice, desired one of the violinists to repeat alone the accompaniment of the same air; which he called upon Suzsi to sing in her best manner, for the entertainment of his guest. The young girl, unused to disobey, came forward without delay or affectation; and, save that she held the corner of her plaited apron for support and countenance, without any remarkable shew of timidity. Her voice was sweet and touching; and after breathing a prelude whose tripled notes closely resembled the call of a quail, she proceeded to sing the following HYMN. What lowly voice repeats with plaintive wail, Ama Deum,?ama Deum! So sings amid the corn the lowly quail, Ama Deum,?ama Deum ! There crouching in her loneliness, Her feeble accents humbly bless The Giver of the fields around.? Oh ! let me breathe the same soft sound? Ama Deum,?ama Deum! List! as the evening sun sinks low and dim, Ama Deum,?ama Deum ! The patient quail renews her vesper hymn, Aina Deum,?ama Deum ! Watching besides the turfen nest Wherein her callow fledgelings rest. There as I bend my wandering feet Let me her holy strain repeat? Ama Deum, ama Deum * / * I have heard this little song so modulated as to offer the closest imitation of the wachtetechlag, or quail-call, whose name it bears, ia Germany)?I believe, however, it is of Italian origin. Suzsi who, in the interest of her song, had lost the coy shyness arising from singing it to a stranger, had dropt the protecting corner of her apron, while she sweetly repeated the triple notes, which were modulated so as to imitate the quail-call with remarkable exactness ; and stood with her right hand extended, her head bent forward, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, when Franz, having concluded his diplomatic labours, entered the saal! The first robject that met his inquiring eyes, was the handsome young stranger leaning back negligently in his chair,?his supper standing untouched before him on the table,?and his eyes fixed, with no equivocal expression of admiration, upon those of the heiress of the Blue-Hedgehog ! Poor Franz felt an indescribable thrill through every vein, at the sight; and disdaining to hush the echo of his heavy footsteps in compliment to the singer, he stalked towards the table with the air of a Bajazet, twisting his mustachios with a demonstration of mental martyrdom which Kean might have envied. This really is all she does?for the rest is entirely the stranger? who, seeing that Franz is jealous,? began to pay her certain little attentions, which were hellebore and arsenic to poor Franz. He spoke his commands respecting the adjustment of his chamber in a whisper hard to be endured ; and begged her to sweeten the coffee she had set before him, in a tone of gallantry such as had rarely been breathed before in the Igelische Gasthof. And this is all: for the existence of her secret is known only to herself, and its revealment would, and in fact does, send the jealousy into the air at once. But, unfounded as it is, Suzsi suffers not the less:? How darkly comes the first grievous cloud of suspicion over the fair heaven of youthful love!?With what profound disunion may a word,?a look,?an inference,?sever the ties of confiding affection,?those sweet and holy bonds which, of all human impulses, appear the worthiest of immortality. The peevishness of an idle hour will overcome the remembrance of years of untiring patience and exclusive devotion; and like the son of Thetis, Love himself is doomed to perish by a puerile wound, however bravely he may have resisted fiercer attacks,?however strong his buckler may have proved against a more heroic enemy. Poor Suzsi was but the child of the landlord of a country inn; but so gently, so purely had run the current of her young existence,?so solely devoted was her kind heart to the duties of a tender daughter and a Christian maiden, that her claims to commiseration appear to me nowise inferior to those of a more classic or more courtly heroine. The heart is of no degree; and I doubt, indeed, whether the one or the other could have been more sensible to the value of an honest man's warm affections, or could have drooped with more heart-stricken affliction under the evil interpretation of a wayward and jealous lover.?Hers was not a tearful sorrow; but it w7as deep, and tender, and overcoming. The days went laggingly along;?her very existence appeared to have acquired a new character. She began to think that it might be endurable to abandon Dorogh and its green pastures, since Dorogh could wear so dull and joyless a seeming. The house was full of discordant noises,?the air seemed to hang heavily upon her, when Like an unrighteous and unburied ghost, She wandered up and down those long arcades. The paths of the village looked dusty and uninviting when her restless heart prompted her to wander forth ; and all the uses of this world seemed as flat and unprofitable to Suzsi, as they have done to every victim of discontent from the days of Hamlet until nowT. A thorn was in her heart;?a struggling pain haunted her parched throat,?the tears came quivering importunately over her eyes ; and never more painfully than when striving to assume a tone of merriment with her father's guests, in the vain hope of disguising the secret anguish of her feelings. We would fain give the scene on the hill, but our limits warn us. The following is as much as we can find room for from the scenes at the palace. Old Blaschka thinks that " she has been looked on with the evil eye/' when she boldly makes her way to the presence of the Tavernicus:? He was fain to follow her airy footsteps, however, into a chamber of which two splendidly-liveried attendants held open the folding doors; just as a voice within, which appeared unaccountably familiar to his ears, exclaimed to his companion, " Suzsi! my flower of Dorogh! you must have thought that I had forgotten you;?I have not so far wronged my conscience, susses mddchen. Even in the press of weighty affairs committed to my charge, your own have not been neglected." " And you, too, my Demosthenes of the speise-saal?my Mirabeau of Hungarian sans-culottisme*?how hath gone the world with you, since we drained a measure together at the Blue-Hedgehog ?" continued the young Tavernicus, towards Johann Blaschka, whose great eyes were fixed in utter consternation upon a vast mirror that reflected the whole interior of the gorgeous chamber. " How fares it now ? What, dumb?speechless altogether ??You, in whose reproof was wisdom,?in whose rhetoric was conviction ? 6' Johann Blaschka!" faltered the old man aghast. "Johann Blaschka himself,'1 he reiterated, as the Tavernicus perceived that his distended eyes were riveted upon the reflection of his own shape in the mirror before him. Suzsi, meanwhile, had advanced towards the writing-table by which the Tavernicus was seated; and having humbly kissed his hand, and thanked him for his honourable remembrance, she proceeded to acquaint him with the sorrow and humiliating suspicions to which she had been exposed in her faithful preservation of his secret. " Noble sir!" said she, smiling through her tears, " I trust you may never know such grief as that which has made my cheek so pale, and my heart so heavy, since 1 was last honoured by your lordship's countenance. Trust me, tekintetes Gr6f, nothing less than this would have emboldened me to trespass on your goodness, that I might crave permission to explain the truth to?to?my father, and to "? " My father's daughter's jealous lover ? Why Suzsi, I had rather my name had been bruited?even in the very ears of the captious Ur Pal,? rather my titles had been proclaimed by ail the heralds of the empire, than that one tear of thine had been wasted to secure my incognito. " Here," continued he, taking a parchment from his secretary, " here is the lease; I fought a good fight with my worthy friends the Canons to carry my point; ?a bloodier battle methinks hath not chanced in Hungary betwixt priest and layman, since the fatal field ofMohacs saw seven bishops left stiff and stark upon its turf. But no matter. The Chapter of Gran hath added, at my instigation, another life to the renewal of the lease; and 'tis granted in the name of Suzsi Westermann, edes Arnhem/*?say?hast thou aught to object ?" Surzi is presented to the Archduchess, and sings before her her Hungarian song. This scene is very delicately touched; but we would rather give the description of what she felt at all this, as well as old Blaschka. * Edes Jcintsem ! a term of endearment equivalent to the German mein schatz, my treasure. Suzsi had made her lowliest parting acknowledgments,?had spoken her grateful farewell to her generous patron, the Tavernicus;?had even reached the outer court of the palace on her return homewards, before her companion had sufficiently recovered from his saisissement to breathe one word in utterance of his amazement. During their visit to the Palatine's princely abode the heart of the young girl had been awakened to sentiments of deeper interest than those of mere vulgar admiration. Her duty to her father, her devotion to her lover, her care for her own fair fame,?all were involved in the momentous change of her destiny. She was gratified,?triumphant,?clear from shame ;?could she be interested at such a time by gilded cornices or inlaid floors ??could the splendours of a royal dwelling, or the flowing state of an Imperial presence disturb the gentle current of her heartfelt gratitude and joy ? Not so old Blaschka. His wonderment, when indeed it found leisure to expand itself in words, dwelt ever on the dazzling and inexplicable magnificence which had burst upon his bewildered senses ; and maugre the untrim shagginess of the national capiit in which he was enveloped,?maugre the rustiness of the flapped beaver, and still more?'despite the uncollected mass of shapeless features it overshadowed, Master Johann descended the hill towards the suburb of Wasserthal, with an air of jauntiness, an elevation of head, and trippingness of step, which argued something of the self-delusions of Malvolio. The spirit of feminine mischief had indeed besieged the brains of the reverend elder. The giggling courtesy with which the court damsels had greeted his grotesque person and untutored demeanour, had proved as flattering to his perceptions as a more favourable notice; and the " hyperbolical fiend which vexed the man," prompted him to " talk of nothing but ladies." We do not quite like the deceit practised upon Franz on their return. A fine, noble girl, like Suzsi, who has suffered so much from a necessary concealment, would have gone to him at once, and told him all. Nor does the supper-scene in any degree repay the sacrifice. The point is not come to after all; and moreover, that wretch Menesatz is too odious to have been let within the doors. We are quite aware how very imperfectly we have given any idea of even this tale, which we professed in some measure to analyze. We have not been able, from our cramped measure this month, to do any such thing, or we should have put it beyond all doubt whether we had bestowed upon it over-praise. We are aware it is cast in lowly life? And then??We will quote the motto prefixed to its first chapter, to which the name of Hood is appended : Alas ! there's far from coats of frieze To silk and satin gowns,? But I doubt if God made like degrees] 'Twixt courtly hearts and clowns'. So do we. For the rest, lordly readers will find plenty of noble blood in the other stories ; and, indeed, in the last there is no one below the rank of an archduchess. But, in all and each, we find the same merits and attractions, which must have gratified our readers in the extracts we have given; and, in some, excellences of other orders, with which we have had no opportunity of presenting them.

Chun Ti-kung, his Life and Adventures
Rees, Claude A.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Chun Ti-kung, his Life and Adventures. CHINESE STORIES. By Claude A. Rees. (Heinemann.)?Stories connected with China have appeared of late in considerable numbers, and the adventures of individual Chinamen have been described with more or less verisimilitude from almost every point of view. Though instances have, it is true, occurred in real life in which Chinamen have married English wives, the experiments have not been successful, and, so far as we are aware, in every case the lady has met with bitter disappointment on her arrival in China. Tho only known instance in which a wife of the English race has found Chinese surroundings congenial to her is that of an Australian lady who is now living in the neighbourhood of Foochow in perfect contentment with her adopted country and her pig-tailed husband. In the work before us the hero, who is the son of a coffin maker, is adopted by a childless uncle holding the office of Taotai; and after passing the necessary examinations with exceptional distinction, he is appointed secretary to the Chinese Legation in London. While here, although already married in China, he falls desperately in love with a Miss Nellie Serjeant, who, strange to say, returns his affection. The proposed match naturally arouses considerable opposition in the Serjeant family. But in the end love triumphs, and Miss Serjeant becomes in due course the second Mrs. Chun. The rest of the story is not a pleasant one. While Chun makes every endeavour to prevent Nellie from becoming aware of the existence of his first wife, she goes through the various stages of disillusionment until her Chinese rival forces her way into the room where she is prostrated with fever, and denounces her as a usurper in the affections of her husband. Frenzied with grief and shame, she carries her newly born infant to the neighbouring creek and plunges into the tide. The story is told well and interestingly, and considerable pains have evidently been taken to make the incidents conform as much as possible to Chinese manners and customs. To say that in all instances they do so would be to say that Mr. Rees has performed a miracle. So few foreigners have ever penetrated into the inner life of the Chinese that it is not to be expected that in the present volume, in spite of a considerable amount of local colouring, there should be a minutely accurate picture of native domestic scenes. But enough has been done to make the book readable and the plot plausible.

A Marriage in China
Little, Mrs. Archibald
-------------------------------------------------------------
A Marriage in China, by Mrs. Archibald Little (A. E. N. Bewicke) (White & Co.), is not the first work on China that we owe to the pen of Mrs. Little. ' My Diary in a Chinese Farm,' which lately appeared, contained her description of a summer residence in the neighbourhood of the gorges on the Yangtsze, spoken of in the present work ; but compared with that book this volume is of a far more pretentious nature. It is a novel of 312 closely printed pages, the scene of which is laid in China, and the author has brought her long experience of Chinese life and manners to add colour to her subject. To all those interested in Cathay the book will be welcome ; but it may be doubted whether " the general public " will be deeply stirred by it. The characters are not drawn with sufficient vigour, strength, and distinctness to make them generally interesting, and in the plot there is nothing to fix the attention or to excite sustained interest. The hero, Mr. Fortescue, is a consul in China who has made a companion of a young Chinese girl, by whom he has two children. While temporarily severed from his social entanglements he visits England, where he makes the acquaintance of a Miss Grey, who is residing with her aunt at Northampton. For this young lady he forms an attachment, and, finding it hard to struggle against his feelings, takes to flight. In course of time Miss Grey is left alone by the death of her aunt, and falling under the influence of a Mrs. Betterton, a lady missionary in China, she goes to the " Flowery Land " to make converts, and, as events prove, to meet Mr. Fortescue. At first he thinks it best to avoid her, but circumstances being too strong for him, he falls again under her influence and offers her marriage. The offer is accepted, and the story ends by the Fortescues taking charge of the two Eurasian children, and by the marriage of their mother with a Portuguese resident. Mr. Fortescue is represented as being highly intellectual, a sceptic as far as Christianity is concerned, and with a strong leaning towards Taoism. Probably his character is the one which the author has intended to draw with most distinctness. But he is, after all, too shadowy to make a strong impression, and his strange vagaries in moments of repent- a0ce and self-reproach are too erratic to be natural. To residents in China some of the scenes will be very familiar, and it is even possible to identify several of the characters as real personages. In fact, the book reads like a narration of actual facts. But it is somewhat wanting in"g??" an(* tne English is not in every instance all that could be desired. Such phrases as"He could not help but know I wished it," in the mouth of the heroine, and " What we bring the girls we say we love to !" are awkward, ?and some descriptive passages would be better for revision. For example, in the account of the struggles of the boatmen in the heroine's passage through the Yangtsze rapids, we meet with such a passage as the following :?44 Evidently the boat must have been caught by one of those sudden geysers that rise up unexpectedly in mid-Yangtsze like a waterspout, creating a new whirlpool for the moment. Whatever it was, there was the boat below turning, and worse ! Over now ! Four of them in a confused knot! The fifth caught with his hands at the edge of the cliff, then was jerked and flung down after the others. The sixth just saved himself by lying sprawling on the road ; the rest, by giving way a little, going back with the boat, then tugging with might and main, seemed getting the boat out of the whirlpool, when the tow-line gave, and they were all thrown forward on their faces against the cliff." The picture of life in China which the author draws is not an attractive one, and we would fain hope that the climate on the Yangtsze is not so unfavourable to European life, that the mobs are not quite so aggressive, and that the missionaries are not so unfavourably placed as she represents them.

Chin Chin-Wa
Hannan, Charles
-------------------------------------------------------------
Chin-Chin-JVa,by Charles Hannan, F.R.G.S. (Constable & Co.), is a volume of short stories, two of which are Chinese, three Indian, and the remaining three European. They are extremely light, and, as far as they go, are well and amusingly told. When looking abroad for his inspirations the author has not troubled himself over much to make acquaintance with the manners and customs of the people of whom he writes, and probably he would consider such a study superfluous. The book is of a kind that might while away the tedium of a railway journey or help to relieve the monotony of a sick room; but it would seem to require the environment of boredom to make it really acceptable. There is little that is new in the situations which are described, and the stories want point and finish.

Schloss Hainfeld ; ora Winter in Lower Styria. REVIEW OF NEW PUBLICATIONS. By Capt. B. Hall. THIS is an agreeable little volume; and we envy the author his romantic residence with the Countess Purgstall at the Castle of Hainfeld, and his wanderings among the mountains of Styria. ?And then, what a delight to find the old Countess transformed into Miss Jane Anne Cranstoun! and as soon as we have recovered our surprise, to find Miss Jane no less than our fair young friend Diana Vernon! Then there are some young ladies from Gratz, and an old one from Vienna;? there is the Archduke John, who is thus described: " His Imperial Highness is a very pleasant person, about fifty-five years of age, with a fine, high, bold forehead, and an expression of quietness and repose, bordering on melancholy, in his countenance, which is singularly engaging. His conversation and manners, too, are so untainted by the slightest shade of affectation, and withal so cordial, that any one must feel at ease in his presence. " His chief occupations are, 1st, superintending the great trigonometrical survey of Austria, of which, as chief of the engineer department/he has had the entire con* trol: 2ndly, directing the great iron works of Verdernberg: lastly, visiting his estates in Lower Styria, where his extensive vineyards are situated. His chief amusement is the chase of the chamois. Another of his amusements is the encouragement of science at Gratz and elsewhere in Styria: and as he sets about every thing in the most unpretending way, and by hu gentle and elegant manners conciliates all parties, his knowledge on these subjects is received, not with jealousy or suspicion, but with that degree of personal favour, which insures the success of every undertaking to which he wishes well. Upon the whole, there probably have been few men in any station, and not many princes, who have proved greater benefactors to their country; very few men indeed have the means, even if they had the disposition and talents and experience, requisite for so great a task ; and it is in the highest degree pleasing to witness the effect of so fortunate a combination of circumstances in the person of one individual." We shall now pass from the Archduke to a Scotch Professor: " ? You know,' said the Countess, * that my brother-in-law, Dugald Stewart, had not the faculties of distinguishing colours at any time; and,-like your own father, Sir James Hall, he absolutely lost his sight, when this sort of twilight set in. It was a most curious fact, that Dugald Stewart could not see any difference between colours so strongly contrasted as the ripe mulberry fruit and the leaf of the tree. Yet the practical inconvenience of this singular defect in the retina, was nothing in comparison to what he suffered from being blind when the day was nearly at a dose. I was laughing at the recollection (said the Countess) of a funny scene I had with your father and Mr. Stewart at least half a century ago. We had all been drinking tea with Mr. Alison, who had then a house in Bruntsfield Links; my two companions, the moment they came into the open air, recommenced a metaphysical discussion the party had been engaged in, and which from the popular tone the graceful genius of Mr. Alison gave to the most profound disquisitions, I had been able, in some degree, to understand. But when your father and Mr. Stewart found themselves alone?for they seemed to consider a young lady as nobody?they dived much deeper into the subject than I could follow ; and to the one or two questions I ventured to put, the philosophers made scarcely any answer, but trudged on over the little grassy hillocks of the Links, taking no more account of me than if I had not been present. As I well knew my companions to be two of the very kindest and best-bred men in the world, and they were merely absorbed in their darling topics, I paced after them in respectful patience, thinking of something else, and admiring, as the sun went down, the last touch of bright light on the top of Arthur's seat and the flagstaff and battlements of the old castle. Presently Mr. Stewart, slackening his pace, drew to my side, and remarked that the golf-players had quite destroyed the Links for a lady's walking, and that, unless I took his arm, I might put my feet into one of the holes used in the aforesaid game. As I found none of the inconvenience to which he referred, and as we had passed most of th rough ground, I begged him not to dis. turbhis philosophical tete-a-tete on m account; but he continued to press me to take his arm. I knew well enough what was the Professor's motive, for I had long been aware of his optical weakness, and I saw he could scarcely walk a step without setting his foot on a stone or in a hole ; but I was willing, by declining his twilight civilities, to punish his broad-day neglect. Sir James, who as yet saw quite well, had no idea what Mr. Stewart was manoeuvring about, and even tried all he could, being deeply interested in the discussion, to detach the blind lecturer's attention from me to himself. Mr. Stewart, however, in his fear of a sprained ancle, seemed quite to forget his moral philosophy, much to your father's surprize. In about five minutes afterwards, however, I was much amused when Sir James also offered me his arm, expressing in like manner a wonderful anxiety about my safety and comfort, and, as Mr. Stewart had done before him, insisted on encumbering me with help of which I stood in no need. It became truly a task of some difficulty, to lead these two gentlemen; for as neither could see an inch before him, I was obliged to act as a guide to both. They, on the other baud, as soon as they had regained their confidence through the agency of my pilotage, forgot their sudden fit of gallantry, and once more recommenced their unintelligible disquisitions across my very nose, and without once seeming to recollect that such an individual as their female protector was in existence." Tbe latter part of this work is rendered highly interesting, by some recollections of Sir Walter Scott; and the following letter is a beautiful specimen of his mind: " My dear and valued Friend, * 1820. "You cannot imagine how much I was interested and affected by receiving your token of your kind recollection, after the interval of many years. Your brother Henry breakfasted with me yesterday ; and gave me the letter and tbe book, which served me as a matter of much, melancholy reflection for many hours. Hardly anything makes the mind recoil so much upon itself as the being suddenly and strongly recalled to times long past, and that by the voice of one whom we have so long loved and respected. Do not think that I have ever forgotten you; or the many happy days I passed in Frederick Street, in society which fate has separated so far, and for so many years. The little volume was particularly acceptable to me, as it acquainted me with many circumstances of which distance and imperfect communi- cation had left me either entirely ignorant, or had transmitted only inaccurate information. " Alas ! my dear friend, what can the utmost efforts of friendship offer you beyond the sympathy which, however sincere, must sound like an empty compliment in the ear of affliction. God knows, with what willingness I would undertake anything which might afford you the melancholy consolation of knowing how much your old and early friend interests himself in the sad event which has so deeply wounded your peace of mind. The verses, therefore, which conclude this letter, must not be weighed according to their intrinsic value; for the more inadequate they are to express the feelings they would fain convey, the more they show the author's anxious wish to do what may be grateful to you. In truth, I have long given up poetry: I have had my day with the public; and being no great believer in poetical immortality, I was very well pleased to rise a winner, without continuing the game till I was beggared of any credit I might have acquired. Besides, I felt the prudence of giving way before the more forcible and powerful genius of Byron. If I were either greedy, or jealous of poetical fame?and both are strangers to my nature?I might comfort myself with the thought, that I would hesitate to strip myself to the contest, so fearlessly as Byron does; or to command the wonder and terror of the public, by exhibiting in my own person the sublime attitude of the Dying Gladiator. But with theold frankness of twentyyears since,I will fairly own, that this same delicacy of mine may arise more from conscious want of vigour and inferiority, than from a delicate dislike to the nature of the conflict. At any rate, there is a time for everything ; and without swearing oaths to it, I think my time for poetry is gone by. My health suffered horribly last year, I think from over-labour and excitation; and though it is now apparently restored to its usual tone, yet during the long and painful disorder (spasms in the stomach), and the frightful process of cure, by a prolonged use of calomel, I learned that my frame was made -of flesh and not of iron?a conviction which I will long keep in remembrance, and avoid any occupation so laborious and agitating as poetry must be to be worth anything. "In this, however, I often think of passing a few weeks on the continent? a summer vacation if I can ; and of course my attraction to Gratz would be very strong. I fear this is the only chance of our meeting in this world?we, who once saw each other daily! for I understand from George and Henry that there is little chance of your coming here. And when I look around me, and consider how many changes you will see in features,forms, and fashion, amongst all you knew and loved, and how much no sudden squall or violent tempest, bat the slow and gradual prqgress of life's long voyage has severed all the gallant fellowships whom you left spreading their sails to the morning breeze, I really am not sure that you would have much pleasure. The young and wild romance of life is over with all of us. The real, dull, and stern history of humanity has made a far greater progress over our heads; and age, dark and untimely, bestowed bis crutch over the stoutest fellow's shoulders. One thing your old society may boast, that they have all run their course with honour, and almost all with distinction, and the brother suppers of Frederic Stewart have certainly made a very considerable figure in the world, as was to be expected, from his talents under whose auspices they were assembled. One of the most pleasant sights which you would see in Scotland, as it now stands, would be your brother George in possession of the most beautiful and romantic place in Clydesdale?Core-house. I have promised often to go out with him, and assist him with my deep experience as a planter and landscape gardener; I promise you, my oaks will outlast my laurels, and I pique myself more upon my compositions for Horace, than any other compositions whatever to which I was accessary; but so much does business of one sort or another engage us both, that we never have been able to fix a time which suited us both, and with the utmost wish to make out the party, perhaps we never may. This is a melancholy letter; but it is chiefly so from the sad one of yours, who have had such real disasters to lament, while mine is only the humorous sadness, which a retrospect of human life is sure to produce on the most prosperous. For my own course of life, I have only to be ashamed of its prosperity, and afraid of its termination; for I have little reason, arguing on the doctrine of chances, to hope that the same good fortune will attend me ever. I have had an affectionate and promising family, many friends, few unfriends, and, I think, no enemies, and more of fame and fortune than mere literature ever produced for man before. I dwell among my own people, and have many whose happiness is dependent on me, and which I study to the best of my power. I trust my temper, while you know my nature is good and easy, has not been spoiled by flattery or prosperity; and therefore I have escaped entirely that irritability of disposition which I think is planted, like the slave in the poet's chariot, to prevent his enjoying the triumph. Should things therefore change with me?and in these times, or indeed in any times, such change is to be apprehended?I trust I shall be able to surrender these adventitious advantages, as I would my upper dress, as something extremely comfortable, but which I can make a shift to do without."

The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, including an Autobiographical Chapter. SCIENCE Edited by his Son, Francis Darwin. 3 vols. (Murray.) "Nature," wrote Emerson, "stretches out her arms to embrace man, only let his thoughts be of equal greatness. Willingly does she follow his steps with the rose and the violet, and bend her lines of grandeur and grace to the decoration of her darling child. Only let his thoughts be of equal scope, and the frame will suit the picture." These eloquent words may well occur to the reader as he lays down the last of the three volumes in which, with pious care and great skill in selection, Mr. Francis Darwin has furnished a fitting portrait of his father. Rising from them and setting at once to express one's feelings, it is difficult to find the means which will adequately represent to others the kind of emotions which the threefold picture has aroused. Mr. Darwin himself makes use of an expression of admiration which will best, perhaps, serve our present purpose; he wrote from Rio de Janeiro to Prof. Henslow: "I formerly admired Humboldt, I now almost adore him." We have advisedly called the present 'Life' a threefold picture, for it commences with a most interesting autobiographical account or picture of Mr. Darwin, consciously drawn by himself for his children ; it is followed by a touching chapter entitled " Reminiscences of my Father's Every-day Life," by Mr. F. Darwin; while the letters show us Mr. Darwin as he unconsciously revealed himself to others. The general result is that the reader gains an excellently vivid picture of one who wm even greater as a man than as a naturalist, a hero as well as a philosopher, and more rightly beloved for his moral nature than admired for his intellectual acquirements. The chief object which his biographer has set before himself has been that of illustrating his father's personal character; and he is to be sincerely congratulated on having well performed a task which, though it was not difficult, because of the noble simplicity of his father's nature, became so from the wealth of material at his disposal, and the character and variety of his father's work. In this connexion the world owes a deep debt of gratitude to Sir J. D. Hooker?"best of friends and philosophers"?for the care with which he preserved the letters received by him from his illustrious correspondent. The first remarkable point in Mr. Darwin's character was its absolute simplicity. His belief in the good feeling and uprightness of other men was quite astounding; indeed, after the virulent attacks to which he was subjected on the publication of the ' Origin of Species,' it is wonderful that he did not fall into a permanent pessimism, in which, with Schopenhauer, he would have regarded the world as a" harbouring place for rascals." Instead of this he writes even of Bishop Wilberforce: "If you have not seen the last Quarterly do get it; the Bishop of Oxford has made such capital fun of me and my grandfather " ; and of Mr. Mivart he seems to do no more than conclude " with sorrow that though he means to be honourable, he is so bigoted that he cannot act fairly."* We believe, indeed, that Mr. Darwin would never have mistaken, as the ordinary proverb-mon ger does, the words of Job, " and that mine adversary had written a book." Virtues such as simplicity are often found to be only superficial; when the mind becomes unhinged by sorrow or despair the self-consciousness of the natural man is revealed. Burke showed himself to be of the same kidney as Mr. Thomas Sapsea in the elaboration of his lamentations on the death of his son; but when Mr. Darwin lost his favourite child at Malvern he gave way to no public expression of his loss; the gravestone under the cedar to the north of the Priory Church bears only, in addition to the ordinary information, the simple and touching expression, "A good and dear child." Again and again it has been our fortune to see those words, and every time we see them they move us more and more. This genuine simplicity extended itself to every action of his life. Never was there a man who thought so little of fame or who so little thought he deserved it, and never was there one to whom the advice of Mark Pattison?" Shun above all that worst of slavery, the resting your happiness on the good opinion of others "?could be less appropriately given. Evidences innumerable of this central characteristic are to be found in the letters, as they were in the correspondence with Mr. Hancock, which we mentioned some months since. We call it the central characteristic, for it is that from which many others flowed. * The editor quotes Mr. Chauncey Wright's essay on Mr. Mivart from tbe North American Review. It may be useful for English and European readers in general, to whom tbe essay is probably more accessible in its pamphlet form as published by Mr. Murray, to state that pp. 83 aod 84 of tbe Asview are pp. 33 snd 33 of tbe pamphlet. It found expression in the " intense and almost passionate honesty " on which Prof. Huxley has insisted, for Darwin saw things as little through a glass darkly as mortal can ever hope to see them; it led him to see his own faults so distinctly that he was able to admire others unreservedly, to recognize his errors, to accept criticisms, and to avoid controversy; and it brought him, lastly, the esteem and admiration of the world, for " honour," as Solomon tells us, " shall uphold the humble in spirit." And, so far as others were concerned, it was the prime cause of their affection for him. His daughter writes:? " He was always so ready to be convinced that any suggested alteration was an improvement, and so full of gratitude for the trouble taken. I do not think he ever forgot to tell me what improvement he thought I had made, and he used almost to excuse himself if he did not agree with any correction. I think I felt the singular modesty and graciousness of his nature through thus working for him in a way I never should otherwise have done." Prof. Huxley has put on record that Darwin had the same desire as Socrates to find some one wiser than himself. Mr. Romanes applies to him what Darwin himself had said of Henslow:? " When I reflect how immediately we felt at perfect ease with a man older, and in every way so immensely our superior, I think it was as much owing to the transparent sincerity of bis character as to his kindness of heart, and perhaps even still more to a highly remarkable absence in him of all self-consciousness." His son describes his manner in the following terms:? " When he was excited with pleasant talk his whole manner was wonderfully bright and animated, and his face shared to the full in the general animation. His laugh was a free and sounding peal, like that of a man who gives himself sympathetically and with enjoyment to the person and thing which have amused him." The reader will recall the hero of Spenser: Whose every deed and word that he did say Was like enchantment, that through both the earea And both the eyes did steale the bart away. One or two quotations from his letters must suffice to exemplify the points on which we have been insisting. Here is what he thought of the world's honours. On receiving the information that he had been awarded the Royal Society's medal he wrote to Hooker:? "Amongst my letters received this morning I opened first one from Cot Sabine ; the contents certainly surprised me much, but, though the letter was a very kind one, somehow, I cared very little indeed for the announcement it contained. I then opened yours, and such is the effect of warmth, friendship, and kindness from one that is loved, that the very same fact, told as you told it, made me glow with pleasure till my very heart throbbed.Such hearty, affectionate sympathy is worth more than all the medals that ever were or will be coined." His candid repentance about the work of the South American Missionary Society is of especial interest at this moment, when tho missionary value of Christianity is under discussion:? " I had never heard a word about the success of the T. del Fuego mission. It is most wonderful, and shames me, as I always prophesied utter failure. It is a grand success. I shall feel proud if your committee think fit to elect me sn honorary member of your Society." His generous appreciation of others is well exhibited by the following to Mr. Chauncey Wright:? " I agree to almost everything which you say. Your memory must be wonderfully accurate, for you know my works as well as I do myself, and your power of grasping other men's thoughts is something quite surprising ; and this, as far as my experience goes, is a very rare quality." We must now select some of the sayings which illustrate the well-marked possession of humour. Weary with the length of his voyage, he writes to Mr. Whitley : " That this voyage must come to a conclusion my reason tells me, but otherwise I see no end to it." When he lived in London he used to "go and dine at the Athenaeum like a gentleman, or rather like a lord, for I am sure the first evening I sat in that great drawing-room, all on a sofa by myself, I felt just like a duke." But he hardly felt like a duke on that day's entomologizing on the banks of the Cam when " under a piece of bark I found two Carabi (I forget which), and caught one in each hand, when, lo and behold, I saw a sacred Panagams crux-major. I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, and to lose Panagmts was out of the question ; so that in my despair I gently seized one of the Carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable pain and disgust the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat and I lost both Carabi and Panagaus." He was wise enough to remember one paternal lesson:? " In this one respect I am in the state which, according to a very wise saying of my father's, is the only fit state for asking advice, viz., with my mind firmly made up, and then, as my father used to say, good advice was very comfortable, and it was easy to reject bad advice." He had an argument with Sir C. Lyell, and he writes to Sir J. Hooker:? " Lyell has written me a capital letter on ?our side, which ought to upset me entirely, but I cannot say it does quite. Though I must try and cease being rabid and try to feel humble, and allow you all to make continents as easily as a cook does pancakes." He could be friends with men with whom he disagreed. Of Mr. Brodie Innes, sometime Vicar of Down, he said :? " Innes and I have been fast friends for thirty years, and we never thoroughly agreed on any subject but once, and then we stared hard at each other, and thought one of us must be very UL" His friendly banter of Prof. Huxley is in excellent style:? " With respect to Automatism, I wish that you could review yourself in the old, and of course forgotten [do the Duke of Argyll and Mr. Gladstone agree ?J, trenchant style, and then you would here answer yourself with equal incisiveness ; and then, by Jove, you might go on ad infinitum to the joy and instruction of the world." And again:? "For heaven's sake don't write an AntiDarwinian article ; you would do it so confoundedly well I have sometimes amused myself with thinking how I could best pitch into myself, and I believe I could give two or three Rood digs." He waa, perhaps, better pleased with the booksellers than the critics, for he writes to Lyell that a friend had asked for the 'Origin of Species' at the bookstall at Waterloo Station, and " the bookseller said he had not read it, but heard it was a very remarkable book !!!" And he could enjoy the fun of others. He repeated with gusto his brother's answer on being asked by Charles to read his 'South American Geology': "Upon my life I would sooner even buy it." He writes to Hooker of Lyell being " so delighted with one of Agassiz* lectures on progressive development, &c., that he went to him afterwards, and told him ' that it was so delightful, that he could not help all the time wishing it was true.' " But his best story was the " Johnsonian answer of Erasmus Darwin's: ' Don't you find it very inconvenient stammering, Dr. Darwin ?' ' No, sir, because I have time to think before I speak, and don't ask impertinent questions.'" Unless, indeed, it be equalled by the letter " from a German homoeopathic doctor, an ardent admirer of the ' Origin.' Had himself published nearly the same sort of book, but goes much deeper. Explains the origin of plants and animals on the principle of homoeopathy, or by the law of spirality. Book fell dead in Germany. Therefore would I translate it and publish it in England." Many will ask, though most assuredly Mr. Darwin himself would never have done so, Was this great man, then, without faults ? Well, there were rather what may be called failings; the most remarkable, and one which he deplores himself most bitterly, was the gradual loss of the aesthetic tastes:? " My mind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of that part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I cannot conceive. A man with a mind more highly organized or better constituted than mine, would not, I suppose, have thus suffered ; and if I had to live roy life again, I would have made a rule to read some poetry and listen to some musio at least every week ; for perhaps the parts of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active through use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be iujurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral character, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature." He supposed he was a very slow thinker, and laments the want of quickness in criticism. The latter, of course, is a consequence of the former, and the quality of the thoughts may well be balanced against the length of their gestation. But, undoubtedly, the difficulty of composition to which he refers incessantly was a great misfortune: " There seems to be a sort of fatality in my mind leading me to put at first my statement or proposition in a wrong or awkward form" ? "I have as much difficulty as ever in expressing myself clearly and concisely; and this difficulty has caused me a very great loss of time "; but it had the advantage of increasing the period of self-criticism, and that he regarded as an advantage. The state of his health afforded him quite sufficient reason for taking but a slight share in the general duties of a citizen, yet " in all parish matters he was an active assistant"; he was for thirty years treasurer of a friendly club at Down, and of the coal club, and he was for some years a county magistrate. His only official connexion with a scientific society was his three years' secretaryship of the Geological Society. He took great interest in the vivisection question, and the settlement which was arrived at owed a good deal to the share that he had in the matter. But if the amount of civio or social duty performed by him was small, his interest (as every reader of his ' Journal' knows) in human affairs was prompted by a noble and generous liberality and a remarkable elevation of sentiment. His regard for the native and savage races of South America, his hatred and abomination of slavery, his generosity towards the Zoological Station at Naples (vol. iii. p. 225) and to the work at Kew (vol. iii. p. 351), are sufficient to prove this. The enormous quantity of work done by Mr. Darwin must often have led those who were unacquainted with the real facts to imagine that " his ill health " was a jaeon de parter; but they will learn now that it was not so. If he accomplished three hours' work a day he would say, "in a satisfied voice, ' I've done a good day's work.' " His children, Mr. Francis Darwin tells us, " saw him in constant ill-health?and saw him, in spite of it, full of pleasure in-what pleased them. Thus, in later life, their perceptions of what he endured had to be disentangled from the impression produced in childhood by constant genial kindness under conditions of unrecognized difficulty." After a touching reference to the devotion of Mrs. Darwin, a thing so sacred that her son hesitates to speak of it, he adds:? " But it is, I repeat, a principal feature of his life that for nearly forty years he never knew one day of the health of ordinary men, and that thus his life was one long struggle against the weariness and strain of sickness." Elsewhere Prof. Huxley has spoken of the " physical difficulties which would have converted nine men out of ten into aimless invalids." The numerous references to his health which are to be found in his letters fully confirm these statements. Thus in 1841 he wrote to Lyell:? " My father scarcely seems to expect that I shall become strong for some years ; it has been a bitter mortification for me to digest the conclusion that the ' race is for the strong,' and that I shall probably do little more, but be content to admire the strides others make in science." Some measure of the physical strength of his later years may be gained from another letter to Lyell twenty years later, when he was only fifty-two: "I have actually walked, I believe, good two miles out and back, which is a grand feat." In 1862 he writes to Mr. W. D. Fox, " My nights are always bad, and that stops my becoming vigorous"; and, a little later, "The other day I went to London and back, and the fatigue, though so trifling, brought on my bad form of vomiting." We shall respect the delicacy of the son, and only remark that the fact of so great and so constant a sufferer working till seventyone years of age, signally falsifying " his melancholy prophecy," and living till he could say with Dido, Urbem proclaram statui; mea mcenia vidi, is sufficient testimony to the oare with which his every-day life was surrounded. And, so far as concerns himself, his endurance, even without the masterly self-restraint with which he suffered malevolent criticism, would win for him the title of a hero. Compare the joyousness of his letters with the daily winnings of Casaubon or the cruel gibes of Carlyle. The details of Mr. Darwin's life are easily summed up. A youth of no great promise ; a course at Cambridge, when he began to attract the notice of men older than himself; the voyage on the Beagle, of which every reader knows; a short period in London; and a life of retirement at Down, broken by rare visits to friends and rather more frequent visits in search of health, make up the sum. Of his work we will only say that, pace the Duke of Argyll, the theory of coral reefs would have sufficed for an ordinary reputation; the monograph on cirripedes would have justified a Royal Medal; his observations on domesticated animals, on orchids, on carnivorous plants, on earthworms, or on the expression of the emotions, are, singly, works with which a naturalist might have been contented. The great central work and its companion on 'The Descent of Man' dwell, like a star, apart from any biological work by any other author. Mr. Francis Darwin has brought together in a most convenient manner the correspondence relating to the 'Origin of Species,' and has woven the whole in a fashion which will" give the second volume the highest scientific value. Here the letters to Hooker, Lyell, and Asa Gray are of signal importance. The most interesting point at this moment is the extent of Darwin's indebtedness to others ? a point, it must be said, which his own desire to give due credit has a little obscured. This has been aided by the common belief that all great achievements are the result of a number of combined forces, or, as Mr. Gladstone eloquently says in ' Juventus Mundi' :? " When some splendid edifice is to be reared, its diversified materials are brought from this quarter and from that, according as nature and man favour their production.Every worker was, with or without his knowledge and his will, to contribute to the work." In his autobiographical sketch Mr. Darwin puts the matter very clearly and simply :? " It has sometimes been said that the success of the ' Origin' proved that ' the subject was in the air' or ' that men's minds were prepared for it.' I do not think that this is strictly true, for I occasionally sounded not a few naturalists, and never happened to come across a single one who seemed to doubt about the permanence of species. Even Lyell and Hooker, though they would listen with interest to me, never seemed to agree. I tried once or twice to explain to able men what I meant by Natural Selection, but signally failed. What 1 believe was strictly true is that innumerable well - observed facts were stored in the minds of naturalists ready to take their proper places as soon as any theory which would receive them was sufficiently explained." Malthus was his only intellectual father. The claims of Lamarck and of R. Chambers are sufficiently disposed of by the following, though it unfortunately?and as, curiously enough, was the case also with Charles Bell's ' Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain' ?bears no date :? " Lamarck is the only exception, that I can think of, of an accurate describer of species, at least in the Invertebrate Kingdom, who has disbelieved in permanent species, but he in his absurd though clever work has done the subject harm, as has Mr. Vestiges, and, as (some fu sp future loose naturalist attempting the same speculations will, perhaps, say) has Mr. D..." As to priority of discovery?a " trumpery affair" in Mr. Darwin's eyes?he had, of course, predecessors of a kind; but Mr. Matthew, for example, can hardly be regarded as a serious competitor, for " one may be excused in not having discovered the fact in a work on Naval Timber." The last words in the following extract not only contain the real gist of the matter, but represent, as all the world knows, Mr. Wallace's own opinion :? "So all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed, though my book, if it will ever have any value, will not be deteriorated ; as all the labour consists in the application of the theory." Mr. Wallace, who alone could be regarded as a serious competitor, has thus expressed himself:? " I have felt all my life, and I still feel, the most sincere satisfaction that Mr. Darwin had been at work long before me, and that it was not left for me to write the ' Origin of Species.' I have long since measured my own strength, and know well that it would be quite unequal to that task." The letters in the second volume reveal the slow, cautious, but steady progress made by Mr. Darwin in his convictions of the value of his theory, and they will always form the best vade mecum to a comprehension of his real intentions. The historian of the subject will be much indebted to Prof. Huxley for the vigorous chapter which he has contributed "On the Reception of the Origin of Species "; but at this moment, while every one must recognize its great value, its vigour impresses the reader not unfavourably, but painfully, when compared with the calm atmosphere of Darwin's benign geniality; it is a "tempest after sun," and not the " sunshine after rain." Yet if it is realistic, it is artistic in the sense of conveying to the reader a good idea of the tempest that raged, while fury, virulence, and ignorance sharpened every one of their darts, and misrepresentations and base imputations worked their wicked will. For Mr. Darwin and his theories that kind of thing is at an end, and Prof. Huxley hopes, though a good deal against hope, that it is at end for other people too. If this be so, none would more desire to have been its victim than Mr. Darwin ; but as it is a kind of envy, we fear that it will continue to be what Bacon calls the " most importune and continual of affections." That in Mr. Darwin's case it came to an end as soon as it did was largely because Prof. Huxley acted on the offensive as well as the defensive, that Lyell was converted, and Hooker a prophet. It is curious that Mr. Darwin's correspondence does not contain any remarks on Baden Powell's * Unity of Worlds,' which, from the more strictly philosophical aspect, ought to have done much in preparing the minds of men for Mr. Darwin's views. The philosophy of Mr. Spencer has had, of course, enormous influence; and the interest which Mr. Darwin aroused quickened the study of biology throughout the world, and, as a consequence, brought daily adherents to his views. But the great lesson which Darwin taught was by no means confined to biology. Schleicher* of Jena early (1863) perceived the influence it would have on the study of language, and justly remarked that "the two main points in Darwin's theory have this in common with many other important discoveries, that they are confirmed even in those spheres which at first had been left unnoticed." It has made a belief in evolution possible in other branches of science, as was well shown by Sir R. S. Ball in his address on ' The Relation of Darwinism to other Branches of Science.' It has invaded the domains of politics and of morals; and theologians apply it td all religions but their own. The numerous and valuable researches on botany are considered together in the latter part of the third volume; and here, again, the editor's method will prove of great assistance to the student. In these also the true genius of Darwin is seen?so slight appear to be the points which he selects for observation, so wide and far-reaching the results which he obtains. As to Mr. Darwin's religious views we shall say nothing, " for he felt strongly that a man's religion is an essentially private matter, and one concerning himself alone"; and as to the question, which, in a suitable place, may be justly discussed, Do Darwin's scientific teachings incline to agnosticism or atheism ? it is not proper here to say more than that a large number of evolutionists? such as Prof. Cope, whom we quoted a few months since?are most certainly neither agnostics nor atheists. Here?though we have by no means said all, and still less quoted all that we wished? we take leave of these delightful volumes. If Mr. John Morley believes in "that terrible, that woeful, that desolating saying, There is in every man and woman something which, if you knew it, would make you hate them," he may now cite, we believe, a great instance against that truly dreadful law. If the Duke of Argyll has had reason to fear " idolatry " in the past, he will have much more reason now, for we of this day?and we ought to be particularly proud of our age?know that we have had among us one who may as justly as Gordon claim to belong to the band of gentle heroes, and as proudly as Newton assert his place among the great benefactors of mankind.

NEW NOVELS. John Chilcote, M.P. By Katherine Cecil Thurston. (Blackwood & Sons.) Mrs. Thurston has written one of the most notable novels of the year. If it be objected that the motive?an exchange of identities?has done service in many similar tales, the success she has achieved may be reckoned the greater. Barely has a wellworn idea been treated with such boldness, originality, and power. John Chilcott, forced into Parliamentary life by family tradition, and married to a clever and ambitious wife, whose fondest desire is that he should occupy a leading place in the House of Commons, becomes a slave to the morphia habit. John Loder, who bears a striking resemblance to him, is a studious recluse in Clifford's Inn, yearning to take an active part in public life, but without the means of gratifying his ambition. The long-sought opportunity comes at last, and he sucoumbs to the temptation. Chilcote, weary of every obligation that involves an effort, becomes the occupier of the lonely chambers in Clifford's Inn, where he abandons himself to drug-taking ; Loder, clever, energetic, and self-assured, takes up the threads of Chilcote's life in Grosvenor Square and the House of Commons. What adds enormously to the dramatic interest of the story is that the arrangement is not continuous. Loder is summoned back to Clifford's Inn at the most inopportune moments, when he is elated by some triumph in the House of Commons, or when his relations with Chilcote's wife? handled throughout by the author with much delicacy?reach their most critical Eoint. Eve, having lost all faith in her usband, has drifted wholly apart from him, but Loder, through the simple force of a strong individuality, causes her, during his periodical visits, to renew her early hopes of his career. That two such men should be absolutely alike may be dismissed as an impossibility; but the incidents of the book move so rapidly towards an inevitable result, the characters behave so naturally, that even the impossible assumes an air of reality. The supreme merit of the story lies in the characterization of the two men, physically so alike, morally so different. Scarcely less interesting, however, is the personality of Chilcote's wife. We congratulate the author on her success, but should add that a book which has appeared as a serial both in Blackwood^ Magatine and the Daily Mail can hardly be regarded as a new novel.

Imaginary Portraits. By Walter Pater, M.A. (Macmillan & Co.) In Mr. Pater's volume of ' Imaginary Portraits ' his eclectic philosophy of sensation has once more been turned to account in a fashion intensely personal and attractive. ' Marius the Epicurean' demonstrated the absence in the author of that dramatic instinct which can create and vivify various conceptions of character. The deepest interest of that graceful story arose not from the portrayal of some imagined Marius, but from the picture given of what Mr. Pater thought he himself would have been like had ho started life under the same con- ditions as his Latin double. ' Marius the Epicurean' was, we repeat, a vision of Mr. Pater by himself?a subjective analysis of that which he would have been and felt and thought had he lived in the crisis of the great transition from old things to new_ a dream abruptly broken, inconsequent incomplete, but lovely in its very inefficiency' in its purposeless phases and hasty end'. And here, again, in other " imaginary portraits," we have other presentments of Mr. Pater's self, now masquerading delicately in the flowered sacque of Watteau's girl friend (for of Watteau himself there is no image); now greedily gallant in the joy of life as Denys l'Auxerrois?type of that after-living of the classic day into the Middle Age which carried with it an atmosphere of witchery, rousing ultimate suspicion and wrath in the Christian witnesses of its irresistible charm; now enamoured of a high and stainless learning as the comely young Dutch philosopher Sebastian van Storck, and again demanding a combination of the choicest pleasures of taste and fancy and experience in the person of Duke Carl of Rosenmold. Each of these images of himself which Mr. Pater sees in the mirror of past days trembles, breaks up, disappears abruptly! No gentle fading, no even passing onwards to conclusion and some final accomplishment of fate; as soon as he catches sight of the state of mind which would have been born in him of life in such or such an hour he drops the glass. It is enough! Now the very incompleteness of these portraits, or rather that which would be incompleteness if we had to look on them as portrayals of any others than Mr. Pater himself, adds to the reality of their characterization as pictures of states of his own mind, and increases the interest with which we read in them moods of the inmost soul of one amongst ourselves, and one of no mean order?moods in which are rendered some of the most interesting currents of the thought of the day. The consciousness of the wider training and further outlook which fall to the lot of us, the heirs of all the ages, if it has bred in the coarser fibres a brutal certainty of judgment and light appraisement of all things not to be measured by the yard of sense, has engendered in minds of a different mould a great hesitancy, due to the very vastness of their inherited possessions?a hesitancy which seems to paralyze the happy putting forth of their powers in an hour which lacks that simplicity of affirmation and denial necessary to work out its issues in matters other than practical. Such as these, therefore, retire on themselves and on the stored riches of the past?these at least they may enjoy; but here, too,the problem of life seems insoluble. So Marius and Sebastian pass away in the hour of their blossoming, and the girl in her journal declares that her friend has sought in life that which is not there, and the golden age returns with Denys only to find the world afraid to take its share in it, and tho new gospel of revolution sweeps Duke Carl before it in the hour of his pleasure. Thus in every page the answer to the unspoken question is evaded, and it is because on this point, as on many others, we find in these pages the reflection of one of the most intellectual phases of the modern mind, that Mr. Pater's ' Imaginary Portraits' should be read by all lovers of psychological problems, and not only by those who value him for the pleasantness and choiceness of his language.

M i R most exquisite pleasures in life re (lerivetl front contrast: We never fully tMel the blesings of health, till sicknesmi has unnerved the languid liumb, atnd taLuugt us the value of those every- day enjoynents which we had lpuwed over and forgotten, merely lumause we had never been be- reft oi themn. We never know what swettetns thiere is in " the common Carth, the air, the skies," till we come fi)rtb from the melancholy Eamencss of a sick roon, to enjoy them. 'hlen every sense seems to have received fresh vigour-dten the eye sees beauty, thev avr hc.,rm harmony, which the eoQ1mnon sighlts and sounds of nature had never before appeared to convey. II ow tb i~titUl this provision of a beleticent B1 ing, and how admirably (XLkculated to enhance the value of his rifts to man! It is not enough, so transitLory is the impression left upon our minds by the continual display of pvwcr and goodness, to keep on an unvarying rounld otWlessings. Although tlutr, must be system in the operalions of Providence, sufficient to jus tify us in the vxpcctation, that what has betn shall again be-although the unalterable nature of the Divine Being must -I made manifest in his works, yet the chanpul and ficklc nature of mum must also be accommodated, and the condescension of Providence, blending, with its general alecrees, some portion of uncertainty in its operations, fixes owu slumbering powers, and arouses our fl UTg tt teution. " Summe d witer, stime und harvt, dis na M." MWe Inow that the i wi coone, but as winta tmay rT o the year for a shorteror longa' time, there is -rom for the emotions of joyft thankflm 'Wwhen its sMai Md teno ar " The wbls oye and gOwcthe beds cam out upon the t the ulm_ of iokIe d lao noctarine trc ewen, and the grcuij ihaves sprout."* Those to whose minlhds the beautiful composition of which thcse words form a pzrt, haNe long beeil Lmnilar, will be at no loss ill conceiving the pleasure it gives to turn to them again on every returning spring. They will remember with what delight their childish fancies compared the faithful description of natural objects, which had, by means of these hymns, been impressed upon their minds, with the objects themselves, then first presented to their eyes in all their freshness, and will perhaps exclaim with me, as far as their influence is concerned.-.-" May we be always children! May the day never arrive when we shall unlearn the lessons they have taught us."T'here is something delightful in recurring to the pleasures wefirst tasteCd, on feeling ourselves awakened to a sense of the beauty that surrounds us; but it is still more cheering to find, from the expericUCe of those who have numbered many returns of this reviving season, that the time seems never likely to arrive when we shall enjoy tlhen less, provided our minds be preserved in that purity without the pervading presence of which all created things are seemi through a distorted medium. A relish for the simple pleasures of nature, formed in early life, seems to wear better and last longer than any other taste. It is, moreover, on the whole, certainly a cheer~fl taste,though even here there is room for the operation of that strapge perversity ot' mind which delights to dwell only on the austere and gloomy, insteadl of the smiling and productive. Some will turn away frm the cultiVated scenes of nature with disdain, and seek the barren heath or the awful precipice. It is useffil, no doubt, occasionally to catch a glimpse of the sublime, if only to impras ou our minds the idea of the i uity of the Deity- to shor is thdt, his love is, so is his po*er. But let us not be called effeminate; if X a doubt whetter 'them &*J'oiuany ninds wbi&i wi l proved by ubto sad u teo rall 44 ratherit b c , 'm. :IvbsiIi. . a 1inshtjlw Jeff rish of some of the boasted heroes of antiquity: We see them all mightall power-We forget the attributes of goodness. The view of the more terrific scenes of nature, of the eternal rocks piled one above another, surviving the wreck andl the ruin of human greatness, and wearing the same solemn and sublime aspect amid all the changes of human affairs, brings home to our bosoms, in an overpowering degree, the feeling of our own nothingness. Let what will become of ii who are gazing on tbem, tlhet will continue the same till the world shall be no more. It seems, too, as if we were contemplating the most awful attributes of the Deity-as if lie had there stamped the image of his unapproachable Majesty, and un-i alterable resolution, instead of the milder features of his love. There may be something of weakness in this, yet surely t ie error is not so great as its opposite. Surely that is no barren and unproductive taste which prompts us to live with man and for man, rather than in the abstract contemplation of power. Surely the order and happiness of created things should be of more account in the eyes of a human being, than the displays of incomprehensible and seemingly useless energy. " What I do thou knowest not now." We tu~rn from what is unknown to what is known. Why the hand of nature should have been so busy overturning the foundations of the earth, andi laying bare her mysteries where human eye seldom penetrates, we know not; but we do know why the rain falls; why the dew descends: Why the whirlwinds of winter should shake our habitations to the ground, we understand not now, but we see the spring sun srhining on the tender blade, and feel that there are bless-. ings around us which demand our thankfulung For those storms which have taken away our fib more valuable tresure, TyLPe~?~a g~ad4b'I the 4wdatic X1 I. .

Smith, Kider el* Co. To nine-tenths of those not directly interested in ?>. geographical discovery or culoni/.uion, ihe Mo-- al quito Shore will present no other idea than that T of ii dismal swam]), where fevers are' rife, vi-g-a- xv latiou rank, and vermin not to be counted; und v* Mr. Voting's volume ought to be accept able, as ;*: calculated to mitigate the horrors of such a pietine. To those who are better instructed, it will ?' be no less welcome, as enlarging the store of their information ; while, in itself, the book is ^ agreeably written, and deserves lo be co.upli- ,; indited, after the fi*diion p -intcd out by Dr. j. Johnson?namely, by quotation. 1 i The situation whieh Mr. Voling held as Deputy v Superintendent under the liritish Central Ame- d rican Land Company, ami the purpose of his t mission to Honduras, xvhieii was to form :i s.tt!-'- ' mont at Ulack Uiver, certainly gave him ample l oppoi tm ii; ie. 111'milking a close- jicqu tint ance wit ;i ' d the conni ry and its inli;il;itaiits; but gave, a!---), a milural bias to his opinion*, which ih iso who may rt i-r to his work as a guide to einigr uion, will ku ( I svcll lo bear in iniiid. This prcuii. eu, we m.iy oh- . ; serve thal the general impression which his r'.u'.-e- ? ' nionts produce is liol disheartening to emigrants I xvho have stout hearts, strong arms, and a li*.tie ? ' money in their purses. The aspect of the country . ; is rich and beautiful, if the scenery around Cape ' , (Sracias a Dies may be accepted as a lair specimen. Limes, enies, cocoa-nuts, and other haud^ some plants, form ihe forest and the bush, an 1 " j " impregnate the air xvith ssveotness"; th-* cii' ! mate in the same district is not unhealthy, and I as tillage an 1 clear.igo advance, xviii increase, ol' 1 i course, in salubrity. The savannas are capable 1 : of feeding large Hocks or holds; and on th* l Mosquito Kay s are banks ,-f turtle ample ciu'iigh c_ i to mike a citizen's m-iuh water. As to the '.'drawback of insects and reptiles, despite the j menacing name on his own title-page, Mr. Voting ! ! makes light of the annoyance of mosquitoes ; ' ? " they aro not trouhh'somo nt the Cape xvhile ! i tin re is the slightest breeze from seaward," and 1 j ihe wind, he adds, generally blows mi tho land. '" i The plague of sand-flies is worse to encounter; *.. land, worse still, the exceedingly troublesome j aud unpleasant chegoe-fica, which buries itself I beneath the victim's skin,?the least tolerable, K> ', perhaps, of jill those entomological niii-aurt s so d i '.vhinisiciilly hit oil' by Sydney Smith, in hi. roll I siesv of the Ci'ocodilc-coinpollcr, Mr. diaries Waioi'ton. On the oilier hand, the inhabitants of this teeming district are fir less formidable than l-'ancy has painted them. The Carib*; are cominendrd by Mr. Voling, as remarkable for pel-mini cleanliness, and good will towards ihe while man ; und if not very teachable, they are not malicious. Consciously, or unconsciously, we cannot but think that the varnish of advocacy is spread over Mr. Vonng's portraiture of this much-abused corner of ihe Nexv World; hut even making allowance for this, the pie lure is not repulsive. The book shall now speak for itself. As we have followed thc example of '".ir Deputy Superintendent in making light of the insects sshich h-r-et the settler, it is but fair to in mention that tho settler's horse inns constant danger of losing his ears from the ticks, which are ii nui:ic_':.".is, hungry, aad dc ?! niel ive legion The bat.*-, also, are fond of horse-Mesh on thc Mosquito Slime; an.l " when a lnrso bel on gi ht ... i , t lo a ii t'.ive has a sore Inc*-., h.- rarely gets cured ; f>r ii' he is turned out on ilie savanna, ihe flies torment him to death,'' lin1, ht us speak of pleasanter things:? ** The guana is very |>'cntiful; it lives upon flowers aul the blossom-, nf trees, an i is much esteemed, ticing considered a gi .alor delicacy than a fowl ; its eggs aie lichcioas. l'o vis ctn i.e obtained for one yard of Osiialiarg or iwo e_g-cu|>s ol' powder, \c. each; |>ig.s can be got for three or lour yards of jiriut, c.c. each ; vciy r; od oysters an- brought from the mangrove bush on Sin l'io, ami are much sought after; lacy grow on tlie branches inst above water.

In this emergency, our nttcntion was directed to save the goods ; I promised to reward tbe people well if they exerted themselves, which they agreed to do, and immediately set to work to get the property out of the hold. Fortunately we bail a small dorey with us. and before twelve o'clock five or six loads were lauded on Half- j Moon Kay, about one mile and a hali distant; but this service was attended with great ditliculty and danger, the dorey having been swamped two or three tune, and all the goods capsized. The brave Mos. I ipaito men, having j.roniised that untiling should be lost, dived for them by tlie light of the full moon, : and ssa ed them all, but not without being sadly cut iind exhausted. At one I'.M.. as marly as we could calculate, the tide began to come in ; our situation j w;is bad enough before, now, however, it was much worse, for every sea made a complete sweep over us, . rendering it highly dangerous for the dorey to approach, while we were taint with toil, and miserably i wet iind cold. On tbe return of the dorey, the two Mos.jiiitn men, alter some trouble, succeeded in get- j ting tn leeward of us. and when more goods were . ready to be put in this little craft, they said, 'No, . massa, no take em, we come for you?rock-stone cut too much ;' poer fellows! they were both badly cut by the eural and sea egg*., in diving for the tilings that bad been upset. Tko danger of our situation ? now increased, so that nothing more could be done. ' Mr. I "jilim. therefore, went on shore with them, taking some more goods and two or three small articles and paj.ers ; the men jiroinising to return immediately. Ou their dcjiiirture, the Knglish sailor, a Mosquito man, and myself, battened down the hatches, ami jdaceil all the goods we were able to get out of the hold ou the weather side of the deck, iind when all was done, sat down wounded in body and mind. On examining our situation, we found that we were on ;i white reef of coral, and that iit the distance vi tin yunis to leeward we should be in doe|> blue water, ami we bad some fears of being driven our the reef and immediately sinking, as the j'oor schooner was much bilged. In many place:, around us we observed little [aitches of rock, which seemed to lu- dancing merrily in the moon's rays, iis if inviting us to their festival ; and so strange did every thing appear, we could hardly believe our eyes. Numbers of sea eggs were seen in all directions, an,.! we well knew the danger of getting amongst them, iis they have long and shaij> pointed Sjunes, which inflict deeji and dangerous wounds on those ?.-.ho chance to tread on them. Some considerable time ha'.iugeliij.sed, and no dorey arriving, we set to work getting to.-ithcr the laug oars, spare spars, &e., to form a raft, so that in case of necessity we might have something to trust to. Having lashed the spars, \e. together, we Mere on the point of attaching a water cask to each end, when we heard the wi leoine cry of ' Kisur, kisar, wop!' (lie quick!) of our faithful men, v, ho relieved us from our miserable situation about three a..m. ; and on landing on thc kay, without dry clothing or covering, we nestled ourselves near the tire that bad been made, and wearied nature soon found repose. On examining th.e kay at daylight, we could not discover any fresh water, and were therefore compelled to resort to cocoa-nut w;iter, which, although refreshing, was but au indifferent substitute. On the wind moderating, our Mosipiitians went over to the island and brought a supjdy fruin one of the numerous gulleys on the island. Having a large tarj-aulin, we erected a tent, mulei* which to jdace our goods, whilst we si'.sjvndcd our hammocks between the cocoa-nut trees, their j thick iind widely sjireading leaves sufficiently sheltering us from the rays cf thc noon-tide sun. Wo laid taken the j.recaution of cutting down the large nuts hanging over our beads, to prevent uujili-asant consequences. One of our Mosquito men also struck a large gi'o'.ij'er, ii remarkably fine fish, with bis staff, as it was swimming leisurely by, which proved a great treat to us ;;',|, it being quickly converted into a stew. Tho Musquito men. William and lien, and myself, ?proceeded the next day in the small dorey, iind after I two hears j.-,dilling, found the Scotchman, residing on frenchman's, otherwise Sheen's Kay. He seemed dei lighted at our arrival, and sail he had heard our guns j eo'.uii'g Hom the white shoal, on the night we were on the reef, but was unable to render us any assistance, huv- ing only thc use of one arm, the other being disabled by a fall from a tree. He was, therefore, prevented from either fishing or hunting, ns he could not, with one band, paddle his dorey.

The boat being large enough to carry us and the goods saved from ibo Amity to I.laek Uiver he advised us to proceed on the following morning. ''On our return to Half-Moon Kay, we had the exceedingly good fortune to strike two large fi-li, and to jump two hawkV-bill turtle. The manner of jumping turtle is singular : as wc paddled along tho edges of a shoal, William's eyes were suddenly attracted by a distant object; be made a signal to Ben when they both began paddling in a violent manner now on one side, then on thc other, backwards, for. wards?all their energies being directed to soim-thin* in the water, which I in vain tried to discover. At length they succeeded in elfecting their object, which was to drive the turtle into shallow water ; suddenly William jumped overboard, and before 1 bad recovered from my astonishment, he rc-iqipearcd, iHililiii*. a bawk's-bill turtle over bis bead. The second one caj.tured bit him severely, lie not having laid lmlil of it in the usual manner, owing to some ditliculty he encountered. Passing one of the kays, we observed an immense quantity of large conks, many of which we collected, iis they make good stews, and are tho best bait for tish. I )n reaching the kay, we made ti hearty siij.j.er from turtle soup, stewed groiqu-r, and fried Johnny .cakes; 1 turned into my hammock, resolving to start again at day-break. At sunrise I jiroceeded, according to the old Scotchman's di rections, with my two Indians, who were well acquainted willi bush travelling ; but after seven hours joni nev, we were obliged to return, having lost our way, owing to our being misled by the numerous marks made l.y the j.ine-wood cutters ; we therefore returned to the Scotchman, who, hearing of our bad success, kindly offered to be our guide on the morrow. Wv spread a few cocoa-nut leaves outside his little hut, and after a meillon wild parsley atidcocoa-nuts, hojungfurl-etter fortune th.e next day, myself and my two faithful com. jiaiiioiis s!ej)t as soundly as many who were reposing on beds ofthe softest down. We rose with the sun, and set out with good heart?, boping to obtain ii hearty meal from the companions ofthe Scotchman, whom ; we expected to fall in with on the other side of the island. After travelling for some hours through underwood and tall trees, or cutting our way through thiekcts.at limes climbing steep mountains, ordescendI ing them slowly and cautiously, for they were rough \ and steep, wcurrivedatthe top of one of the highe.t, j to which tbe guide pointed my attention, saying it j was a silver mine, which had formerly been worked ; by an Englishman of the name of Sheen, iind who, ! after great expense and trouble, began to anticipate ' a return for his out hiv : unfortunately for him, how. J ever, the Sjianiurds bearing of it, carno to the island, drove him off, and filled up the mine ; none of them ? having sj.irit enough to work it, for fear of retaliation j from the English.' Mac Millan (our Scotch friend) assured me that the ore was found to be extremely good. The place certainly appears to warrant the idea of its being a mine of some sort, it being completely barren to its base, whilst all around can be | seen cahoon ridges, pine ridges, noble and stately Santa Maria trees, tit for masts of large si/e ; lano ' wood and cedar, and a variety of other woods well ! iidapted fur shij) building ; ft nit trees of many sorts, j such as tlie marinee, cachew, plum and allicavo pears 1 in profusion. Although the Spaniards, jealous of the ' English having claimed the island, continually fell i such tues as they require, ard they do not fail to j lay the axe to every fruit tree they meet with, to j ).recent thc English from reaping the benefit. It is, ; indeed, ii disgraceful thing, that cocoa-nut trees I should be cut down merely for the sake of their nuts thus destroying, in a few minutes, what it bas taken veart *o produce, and yet it is often done by Carib* ii from Truxillo : and on a late visit by a French man- i\ nf-xvar the crexv cut down upwards of txvo hundred t trees, in one ofthe most licautilul parts ofthe island, s Shortlv after passing the barren mountain, xve heard j thexvciconie cry,' Searpe barrossa !' (There'sthe sea !) x nnd on arming on the sea-beach, had the niortitica- t tion to find the boat had sailed, and by the fresh : tracks of men and dogs on the sand, not above txvo t or three hours. Tired and footsore, xve in vain looked i for irater to appease our thirst ; this was felt bitterly, i as we could not even obtain a cocoa-nut to refresh i our parched throats, there being but fe xv trees mar j u? and all the nuts containing water having already j i been taken. After a few minutes rest, Mac Millan : s observed, it was better to start at once, as probably | i the boat had gone round the island to his kay ; so j I retracing our footsteps for a short distance, xve struck ! ' into a new pass, and after three hours travelling ' I through numerous thickets and the foul draxvback I s crass,"which lacerated us severely, xve xvere astounded ; i tc> hem- that our guide had lost his xvay *. yet the still- ' ; Kart Scotchman kept stalking on, xvith one arin in a j sims, and his feet dripping svith blood, cutting away , ? with his inachect in the direction he thought xvould lead us to the lagoon, in which xvas our dorey, but all to no purpose. Our spirits xvere, however, kept up: bx- constantly meeting xvitli gulleys of xvater. iit sshich ?ve stopped and drunk greedily, first bathing our | temples and xvrists. At any other time, xvhen not ? suffering from intense pain, toil-xvorn and feverish, I should have been enchanted svith the many beautiful ', scene!-.

Day advanced, and xve xvere still ! xvandcring xvithout any prospect of finding our xvay, so completely bexvildei'i-d xvi's our poor guide. At length sxe reached a matted mangrove thicket, and after cutting a pass svith our niacheets for upxvards of , a mile, sometimes craxvling on our hands and knees on the dank and fret id swamp, at other times over the huge roots of the mangrove, xvhich impeded our progress hy their vast size, and their being twisted ' togi'tlier in so many fantastical shapes, and again climbing over the top of .cine thick hush, xvhich | supported our weight by the interlacing of its branches, we discovered xve xvere going wrong, and were obligid to retrace our xveary steps, almost dropping svith exhaustion. " We again struck out as near as sse could guess in a north cast direction, until we came to a high and solitary pine tree, which one of the Mosquito nan climbed,and sang out,' Casak svo]), arxvaller harro.*s;i,' (Go straight ahead, there's the Lagoon ;) but even this cheering nexvs had not much effect on us, xve scinicd spell-bound, so coniph tidy xvere xve exhausted hy our exertions, and there appeared every probability of our passing the night in the impurity of the unwholesome mangrove bush. It being noxs- nearly sunset, every thing depended upon our vigorous exertions; so following the directions pointed out, xve commenced cutting a pass, for sse could not proceed a step xvithout lirst charing the bush, being surrounded xvith thickets or tall tiger grass, six, -.even, and eight feet in hciuht. Just as the sun sunk helotstho horizon, xve contrived to reach the lagoon, about a mile from thc place xvh"rexvehad left the dorey ; night fa*-t npproachiiig.aml being (juite exhausted, ive found it finite impossible to cut our xvay to it. After much hesitation, xvo agreed to go through ti.e lagoon, and wade to our dorey, rather choosing to run the risk ot alligators and sharks, of which there xvere plenty, than to remain in the filthy swamp all the night, tormented with myriads of flies. < In jumping into tbe lagoon, the water just n ached up to my chin,and in my xvearied condition I could not have got on without the aid of the tallest Mnsi|iiit!an.

Wearied and distressed svith hunger, and the poor guide having nothing to give us lint Indian corn and cocoa-nuts, xve endeavoured to reach our companions on Half-Moon Kay. Thc wind and sea, hoxvever, being against us, and our strength totally gone, we were obliged to j abandon the attini|>t, alter several ui-.a.ailing efforts, and return to Mac Millan's for the night. We slept on ii couch of leaves, with logs (lf wood for our pillows, and the broad canopy of lu awn for our covering ; towards morning I awoke, colt! and wretched, the east wind blowing keenly. Again I fell ash ej>, and on awaking found ruy si If warm and c. mfc: table. for the two faithful Moseuitinns had taken off their own tournous in the night, seeing mo shiver, and had carefully jdac.d them owr n;e, which I haw io doubt saved me fri in a sci ions fit of dhu *s ?. such .an act of genuine kindness speaks f..r itself.

A Dreamer's Tales. --- a1 I By LORD DUNSANY. (George Allen I and ;ons. ts.) THE stories that Lord Dunsany has gathered together in this volume can, indeed, lay claim to all the rarer qualities of dreams. They take us into strange countries and curious cities where the folk have new words on their lips and old, unfamiliar gods in their hearts. They are full of strange scents and sounds and colours, and, as in dreams, fear is always close at hand. But even in dreams, where it has been charitably supposed we are all imaginative, it is granted to few men to attain to so fertile a country as that from which these stories, it would seem, have been brought. They are good storiesi and the proof of this is that we ourselves have been able by their aid to reach that mysterious, that most delectable of lands. We, too, have heard the music of the throbbing tambang, the clinking kalipac, and the melodious zootibar. We, too, have smoked the fragrant tollub and drunk the foaming syrabub from cups of gold. It is something to have done this, as our readers ma.y readily prove for themselves. The best of the stories is perhaps that most desolate tale of the man whose soul was imprisoned in his body, fated to rot for centuries in the terrible mind; or " The Hashish Man," wherein Fear is rampant; or " Poor Old Bill," wherein she lurks with laughing lips. But we have no fault to find with any of them, and nothing but admiration for the manner in which they are told. Mr. S. H. Sime's illustrations are wonderful.

A BROKEN JOURNEY.* The sub-title is rather long, and would be better understood by the untravelled if it said " Yellow River" and " lower reaches," but this volume may be quickly read sitting by the fire, reflecting at every page, " Thank goodness, there is no kink in my character forcing me to undergo such discomfort." To others it may pleasantly recall like but more enjoyable experiences, shared by a sympathetic companion, attended by excellent servants and with no need of interpreters: also untroubled by that characteristic that seems to impel Mrs. Gaunt out of all modes of travel always to choose the most disagreeable. Were a foreigner to insist on travelling through our Black Country, and by by-ways, and, let us say, mounted on a sorry donkey, she, if a woman, would probably meet various experiences! Mrs. Gaunt met hers cheerfully, but was it quite wise to invite them ? She started riding a pack mule ! but very soon found that was a mistake-for her; took to a mule litter, and seems to have been lifted in and out. Where the traveller is not so very tall, and the mules are, that method has advantages. But in Siberia she describes herself as still lifted ! It is to be supposed she is not a woman of weight. Her book certainly is not heavy. She starts, it seems, to meet White Wolf, a brigand ravaging the country she decides to travel through; but when she gets nearer turns precipitately, giving up that journey-certainly a very wise step. She first sees the Yellow River! . But the Yellow River is on view in much nearer, more convenient places, even from the windows of trains, furnished with sleepers. After having put up wherever she could, in missionary houses and at their expense, she sets off to return home across Siberia, but-in a manner somewhat confusing to anyone not reading with an atlas handy-turns east instead of west, till she arrives in Saghalien with the ocean all round it and " ' danger-danger from men.' ' Do they steal ? ' said I, surprised. ' And kill,' he added with conviction." Having travelled with a pretty young woman along the Amur I remember her telling me she had been governess in a family in Saghalien. None of my fellow travellers would believe in such a family, saying firmly, " The only women sent there are murderesses." I refused to accept this young woman as a murderess; to believe her a governess was easier, though that also- Seven days after leaving Blagovestchensk, scene of the most horrible, wholesale murder before Bolshevism, Mrs. Gaunt came " in contact with the world war" and after that there is fresh excitement in every page. The Siberian half of her book is therefore the most interesting, but although she must have been in China before (see her " A Woman in China ") she writes of Chinese wedding ceremonies with as much freshness as if she had never even heard of them. She expresses forcibly her pity for Chinese women with their crippled feetyet, apparently, not unbound on the route she took. But if heartfelt, surely her pity would have prompted her to carry placards and leaflets telling the ignorant people how the educated classes had abandoned this cruel custom, and the government denounced it. Had she distributed such leaflets, or better still sold them-Chinese understand selling best-she would have been welcomed everywhere as one who does good works. And that she did not do this, travelling through a part of China which it seems no one ever could visit for pleasure, makes of this broken journey, that might have been so fruitful of good, a lost opportunity. The reader will none the less find her pages on the subject lively reading, and will be himself insensibly drawn on to follow Mrs. Gaunt not only to the Yellow River and back again, but backwards and forwards through Siberia.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Talba or Moor of Portugal, a Romance. By Mrs. Bray, Author of the White Hoods, &{c.8[c. 3 vols, post 8vo. Lngman and Co. THE Romance grew out of Chivalry, and implies writings highly moral and heroic. Every human perfection is attached lo the characters ; and very often a dramatic exhibition of ihe most interesting kind fills the mind's eye in the descriptions of persons, scenes, and things highly picturesque, but now no more. Some resemblance exists in the modern melodrame. Still in the present day lhere is no subject fitted for the genuine romance. The modes of life are quite altered. No persons now live in state, or cultivate heroism, nor do events ensue which appertain only to times of violence. If however the modern romance has not the epic character of the ancient, amends are made by the omission of much tedious trash, which, to use Horace Walpole's phrase, would tire even the patience of a girl in love. It is well-known, that there was ever among the Spanish Moors some frantic prophet or other, who excited the people to tumults; and a riot occasioned by one of these persons, compelled Mahomet the Little to surrender the Alhambra of Grenada in 1492, to Ferdinand, before the time appointed for the delivery of it. The Talba, here an heroic character, is one of these popular soothsayers. The horrible tragedy of Ines de Castro, forms the substance of the plot, and it is but justice to say, that there are very few beauties in the dramatic or the epic of our first poets, which Mrs. Bray has not most successfully rivalled. We think that the following extracts will prove our affirmation. The first is the expostulation of a rejected lover: '< Thou fairest among women?the first, the only object of my devoted love?even in these moments, when thy bitter taunts sting more than an adder's fang, thy very scorn is dearer to me than would be the affections of another. As I look on thee, there is a charm in thy presence which disarms even my resentments. Not the mother, whose heart and whose eye is with her infant when it sleeps, is more watchful in her holy care than I would be over thee.?Come, then, Ines, forget the past; teach thy heart to relent; bid the frank and gentle feelings of thy early youth return, when Diego was not abhorred, when he was thy betrothed husband, and all shall be forgiven. Why wert thou ever false ?" In vol. iii. p. 26, we have this beautiful figure: " Man in prosperity may be good, but it is in adversity he becomes great: like the anchoring bark, which, as she rides in the light on calm seas, may be an object of beauty; yet when she sails amid wild and tempestuous billows assailing her on every side, then is it that we contemplate her as a thing in which there is grandeur and sublimity, for then is she a spectacle that speaks the triumph of roan above the war of elements." We should like to hear Mrs. Siddons recite the following addresses of Ines to Alonzo for mercy: " ' Oh, you will prove that you are more than man, for mercy is of higher mould,' exclaimed Ines : * man follows the impulse of his own fallen nature if he gives way to passion; but when pity moves the soul to spare, then does he rise above himself, and emulates the attributes of heaven; then is he like to God. Hard-hearted, relentless, what is he but a son who bears not the image of his Father ? for God will remove the impress of himself from that being who has no mercy. Thou wilt not kill me?' " Alonso turned aside his head, and waved his hand as if to chide back the unhappy woman, who drew nearer o him, till at last she ventured to place her hand on his. ' Life,' continued Ines, ' is dear to all; for who so strong in suffering, who so resolute to bear, who so confident in innocence, that he would wish to rush before his Maker till He shall call him ? Alonso, I will plead to thee for thy own sake. Hast thou no regard for thy own repose; thy rest by day, thy quiet in the night ? Hast thou not a conscience ? and will that slumber, think you, whilst my blood shall cry from the very earth The King's hand shed it? Thou wilt fear thy conscience.' " Alon3o appeared greatly moved. He turned towards Ines; and there was that expression in his countenance which spoke the struggles of his mind. " The unhappy lady observed this, and hailed it as an omen of mercy. Desirous to complete the favourable impression she hoped she had made on his feelings, she thus continued : ' Yes, I will tell thee, that though thy conscience may now sleep, yet shall it one day awaken, never more to rest. Oh, trifle not with such a power. To the good, it is like the rest of infancy, calm and sweet; to the bad, it is as a fire that burns for ever, yet without consuming that which feeds its flame. Conscience is of more worth than thy crown of gold. Nay, it is of more worth even than thy dearest friend; for he may die, and the world see him no more. But a just conscience, that friend of life or death, will stand by thy sickbed, combat thy last enemy, yea, blunt his most cruel dart. The arrow of death itself shall fall harmless on a heart alive to mercy. Oh, conscience, holy, just, and pure, thou art as the angel who first spreads his wing to raise the soul to heaven. Thou wilt bid our frail dust lodge with safety in the ground, and sleep awhile to rise in honour. Canst thou, Alonso, canst thou cease to feel a power like this ? Poor, helpless, trembling at your feet, I sue for life. If for one so desolate thou hast no pity, yet for thy own sake respect thy conscience; bid it not condemn thee.' " ( Rise, lady, rise,' said Alonso; 'by the rood, thy prayers have in them a power stronger than that of wrath.' ??* They have the force of truth. Who may resist it ?' said Ines. * Oh, Alonso, look on this boy :' she lifted up her eldest son in her arms as she spoke, and presented him to the king : ( Look in his face. Dost thou see nothing there that may remind thee of his father?of thyself ? He has his mother's eyes; so have I heard it said by one dear to thee and me. Those eyes drop tears. Let them move thee to pity; and the day will come when this child shall learn to bless thee for it. He can already lisp his prayers; and in those orisons of innocence have I taught him to name thee, to pray for Alonso's life, yet wouldst thou destroy his mother?' " Alonso took the child from her arms, kissed the boy, and passing bis hand over a head of clustering curls, said, ' I will think of thy prayer. Go, lady; retire, retire to thy chamber. Promise me not to quit it. I cannot harm thee whilst these innocents look in my face. Go to thy chamber. Yet stir not from it. I command obedience.'" We shall add a very beautiful remark. " I read the deed in his dark eye. Father, murder has looks that are unearthly.'' Antiquaries will be amused by this curious feature in the performance of the Mystery of the Decapitation of John the Baptist. " The young man who personated the child of the fair Herodias was fained for his dancing, and admirable as a tumbler. The way he represented melting the heart of the Hebrew king, was by dancing on his head before him. An example of this favourite mode, in the middle ages, of so representing this circumstance in Jewish history, our curious readers, if they are travellers, may still see, carved in alto relievo, above the western entrance of Rouen cathedral in France."

The Works of Oliver Goldsmith. Illustrated. (Cassell & Co.)?As we have already spoken of the quality of the illustrations of Messrs. Cassell Sc Co.'s reissue of Goldsmith in a very popular form, so far as related to that portion of ' The Vicar of Wakefield ' which was then in question, we shall now add a general commendation of the improved spirit of tbe designs it contains, and confine ourselves to that part of tbe publication which appeared since our remarks were written. Accepting the illustrations at their own standard, which is, of coursej that by which their producers would desire them to be judged, we find they are equal to the average of modern book cuts; their value is unequal, whether in execution or design, some being trite, others,?as the pair of lovers in 'The Deserted Vi|lage,' and tbe tiger nest in 'The Traveller,' the illustration to 'A Madrigal,' the frontispiece to ' She Stoops to Conquer,' and one or two more in the last,?acceptable. To return to 'The Vicar of Wakefield,' let us name as the most praiseworthy of the illustrations in question, the characteristic 'Miss Wilmot Undeceived,' 'The Baronet and the Squire,' a *well drawn and cut piece of work, and, in the Memoir of Goldsmith, the design which shows him performing on the flute to the French peasantry. This editiou does not contain Goldsmith's oratorio, ' The Captivity,' and many of the minor poems.

I Passers-By. By ANTHONY PARTRIDGE. (Ward, Lock and Co. 6s.) WHIAT more can a reader want than an excellent story, cosmopolitan as to place and as to characters, with wicked, dissolute Frenchmen into the bargain ? Here we. have a dwarf, a girl, and a monkey (Chicot) wandering in search of a man on whom the story centres. Millions of francs are supposed to be hidden in a piano-drgan. The head of the French detective police is engaged, an English peer is .involved, there are murders ad lib., and the interest is maintained right up to the end. We must make one remark as to the peer's wife. Seeing that he is evidently in great mental distress, she inquires what is the matter, and if her assistance is of any use. The peer says lie loves her, as she knows, and no further questions must be asked, to which she assents, saying, " It would be bouryeois of me to inquire further." We have not as yet met this type of woman, but are glad to find it exists, although apparently confined to the peerage.

Every Jll)anese, however low his rank, knows how to write in this last chiaracter. They were, therefore, exceedingly astonished to find, that of four Russian sailors not one should be able to write !" [Is not this at once a lesson and a reproach to more civilized E 'rope ?] li *he Japanese write wvith liAir-pencils instead of peiis. They are exceedingly fond of reading ; even the coininoni soldiers, when onl (ity, are continually engaged with books. This passion for literature, however, prove(l somiewhat iconvenient to us, as they always reald aloud, in a tone of voice resellmbling sillgilg ; mu111ch in the same style in which the psaliiis are reald at fiimierals iln Russia. Before we were acclistolmned to this, we were unable to elijov a nlloiloetit's rest dluriiimr time nigi.t. lThie history of their native couliltry, the conitests which have arisen among themniclei, amid the wars in which they have beemi engaged with neiglhboutring nationis, formit Ilie subjects of their favouirite books, which iare all primited ill Japan. iliey d1o) not Ilse Imetal types, bmt print with laltes, v t ollt of piece;s of hard wood. *11Il tile capital of tlie .Jaallpes Emllpire (Yeeddo) there is al I histittit itio resciniding omr UImiversitics or A0 ailciiiies.

One of these acadelicains % isitcd the p)risolers towalv d the close of thleir a-;lltivity, and endeavoturcd to extr act all tile inform uation lie could fromi the.il.

'Thie academician evinced c bnsiderable knowvledlge of arithmietic. Ini other sciences, from thle wvant of interpreters, it was not easy to ascertain what p)rogress had been iade. Hle once asked,W hether the Russians, like the Iumitci, reckoned accordling to the new style. When I (Captain Golownin) re1)lied,' that the Russians reckoned by the old style, lie requested ine to explain to hilni tile distinction between the ol( and new styles, and what occasioned the difference betwveen them, which I accordingly did. He then observed, that tile newv mumode of reckoning was by no meanis exact, becanse, after a certain number of centuries, a difference of 24 hours would again arise. I readily perceived that lie questioned me merely to discover how far I was informed on a subject with I I E I I I I 1 1 1 1 I I which he was perfectly familiur. The i Japanese consider the Co)ernican the true Y system of the ulniverse. e'1'c orbit and Sil- ( tellites of Uranus are knowI to the I; but i they knowv nothing of the planiets whielh have been mIiore recectly discovered." 'ihe acaidemician also shewed his ac(ilaintalice with the use of logarithmns, and the nature of Sines (here called si;ns by In elrOr of thle l)ress) and tangents ; le (lemonstrated the problem I that the square of the Iyl)pothenuse of a right-angl-ed triangle is equal to the I SqUareS of the other two, sides, thus, " Iaving drawnI a figure wit11 a pair of coIIpI)aISSes on1 paper, hie eut out the three squ11ares, folded the squares of the two SIlort sidles into a1 mlllmher of triangles, and alSo) ett out these tamiagles: thiemi laying t;le several triangles on1 the slirface of the large squnare, lie mIade thlemt exac'tly (?oer ;utill lit it. nhe aeadainlecianl assmLre(l us, that the *Japanese c'alcuIlate with great l)reeisionul tlhe Celipses otf the .4i11 all(n Moon.

' () yes,' lhe saidl, I I have ohserveol that, though 1 (10 not know holw it Ilallpens.' When we tried to explain to hnin the refraction of rays, lie asked its what a ray was? No soomier had we lna(lc !himii un(lerstali(l thel meaning of the word, than he l)urst into a loudlfit of laughter. OIh, that's impossil)le!' si(l lic; I what man can break a ray ?' W\e were likewise unable to repress our laugliter, and the Japanese joilncd us without knowing why." Some whimsical stories connecteol with these efiorts at conversation, anol the interchange of intelligence, may also be quoted in this place. Ja Among the Russian words which the Janese had set (lown in the lexicon made at qatsmai, was DOSTOINY (zvort/y), wich we had translated to them by ineritorioug, respectfvbile, &c. We never entered into critical illustrations of words, knowing that it would lbe no easy task to make our pupils cl:inpreliheid them. Wheni the Japanese eaine to the word digne, which in the French Russian dictionary was unluckily exemp)lified by the phrase, " trorty of the galloirs," they immediately concluded that the gallows must be some high oflice, or distinguished reward. Notwithstanding all tbe ains we took to elucidate the meaning of the word g-allows, the Japaniese could not easily extricate themselves from the colnfusion of ideas in whicb they were involved 1b) the different (lefinitions-' -I twrlrtly, neritoriorts ?nan, rworthy of the yfllows,' was an associatiol whicih they had forined in their minds, and whichl they repeatei with ainazement. W\e em ploved all our knowve(lge of the Japanese language, andl suinimoned all our pantomimic powers to facilitate our explamiations to the inter'reters; and11 we were ohliged to quote a miliumber of examples, in which the word iworlhuy correslpondedl in signification with tile several translntion-s given of it, an(l was inmide to -iapjly to very different objects. Wh'Ien occuirrenices of thlis kind took place (anid they were byv no means i nfrequent) the .al lanese would hang their heads on oIIe si( e (a movement corresponding to the I uropean shrug of tile shoulders) and exclilil, Mivtssrassi kodolho ! hlwnv'aklhanda inrt.grassi hodvhadI !-A (hifficult language an extremely (lificult. language!" One of (Aptain (olownin's exauiinatioiis furnish another amusing instance of this kind. lie wvs asked his .iiaie and fauiily name. *6 The question (says lie) gave us not a little trouble. Alexci, who expressed himself very imperfectly in Russian, asked ir/,it lvii has iyour naime ? (In the Kurile language there is only oine word for feail and ending.) e' could not comprehend what he mealnt, 1ntil at last, by a happy thought, he explainied himself by an example :-' I amn called[ Alerei,' said he, I hut my name has the tail Makgsinylch, what yefch have you got.' We had great difficulty with other questions, and often, after an hour's explalnation vithi him, wve remained just as wise as we were at first. ' The Japanese have family names and proper names; but the former are always placed before the latter. For instance, lWec/ara is a family name, and Kumaddgcicero a proper name; yet our interpreter was called Yeschera-Kiiinaddschero." With regard to the Japanese division of time, it is extraordinary: we find it state(l: I At this time (1812) the Japanese new year commenced on the Ist of February. As they reekon by lunar years, but supply the difference between the lunar and solar reckoning by adding a thirteenth mouth to each year of the proper nuwnber, for that intercalation, their new year's day corres- p* si'. e o-vry niitiet th year wvlit tile solir 'iph' .ldl)aIiesc OCC4IjIV til (an eIirelil t 1 Iti i in ve1lchratiii- theil ncwv year; thotigh the ,enriod ut tilht feitival, striethv speaking, is al'v h'l ulml tiiC ll4'%V to the full mlunul, or it fo i g!,t.

Passagesfrom the Enelish lote-Books of Arthanic!, Hawthornt. I London: Stralian and Co, 1870. These two neatly-bound and clearly-printed volumes are in tended to form, in conjunction with other Notes, American and Italian, a substitute in some sort for a more formal biography. We agree with the editor that a better plan could hardly b adopted. Set biographies are useful as books of reference for facts; but, after all, the external facts of a man's life are far les important to his fellows than the phenomena of his inner life and mental habit. The impression we may gain of any man's individuality is far sharper and clearer to ourselves when worked out of our own thought and examination than when presented to us complete by any hand, however skilful. And hands skilful at this work are not so abundant with us-CG lyle, Foster, Southey, and a few more-we can easily tell then on our fingers; and, therefore, we welcome this other nietho of letting a man speak for himself. And few men could better speak for themselves than Nathaniel Hawthorne. With a power of mental analysis keeness of observation, and a faculty of expression rarely stipassed, he puts his own individuality before any eyes than can see it better than any interpreter of his life could have rendere it These lEnglish notes are the record of his impressions of our country during the years 1853 to I857, while he was American Consul at Liverpool. The editor warns us that we are to understand his author as " entertaining, and not asserting opinions and ideas. He questions, doubts, and reflects with his pen, and, as it were, instructs himself. So that these notebooks should be read, not as definite conclusions of his mind, but often merely as passing impressions. Whatever conclusions lie arrived at are condensed in the works given to the world by his own hand, in which will never be found a careless word. He was so extremely scrupulous about the value and effect of every expression, that the Editor has felt great compunction in allowing a single sentence to be printed unrevised by himself; but, with the consideration of the above remarks always kept in mind, these volumes are intrusted to the generous interpretation of the reader." These few sensible words of caution are wvell-timed and appropriate, in view of certain inconsistencies and crudities natural enough in this kind of writing. In a case like the present, criticism, in the ordinary sense, would, of course, be quite out of place. We will rather endeavour to form some idea of Hawthorne's characteristics and mental habits as here revealed. From beginning to end he never forgets that he is American; and generous and candid as are many of his views, he will not in the least affect that cosmopolitan spirit to which some travellers make such pretension. During his stay in England Hawthorne visited nearly all our chief centres both of manufacture and of natural beauty. Liverpool, Chester, and North Wales, Coventry, Kenilworth, and Warvick, the Lakes, Shrewsbury and Worcester, London, Aldershot, and Battle, Oxford and York, Edinburgh, Glasgow and the Trosachs, Manchester, Southampton, Salisbury, Gloucester, Peterborough, Carlisle, Stirling, and other places all came underhis notice, many of them again and again. It would be beyond our limits here to give any idea of the effect produced on his mind by many of these visits, but we may select some few, and perhaps see pretty clearly his general manner of observing. One is especially struck at the outset with his zealous way of searching for the beautiful. Over such of our old towns as Shrewsbury, Chester, and Coventry he grows perfectly enthusiastic, and the marvellous beauties of Oxford draw forth his finest touches of description :-" I am in despair about the architecture and old edifices of these Oxford colleges, it is so impossible to express them in words. They are themselvesas the architect left them, and as Time has modified and improved them-the expression of an idea which does not admit of being othervise expressed or translated into anything else. Those old battlemented walls around the quadrangles; many gables; the windows with stone pavilions, so very antique, yet some of them adorned with fresh flowers in pots-a very sweet contrast; the ivy mantling the grey stone; and the infinite repose, both in sunshine and shadow-it is as if half-a-dozen bygone centuries had set up their rest here, and as if nothing of the present time ever passed through the deeply recessed archway which shuts in the college from the street" This passage exemplifies one phase of Hawthorne's mind, a kind of desperation at being utterly unable to give anythinglike the spirit of the scene in his accounts. Again and again in cathedral, and castle, and street, does it occur, and it speaks a great deal. But much as Hawthorne revels in the "sweet, quiet, sacred, stately seclusion" ofOxford, and the strange repose, of here and there, a I" little island of quiet" in the Inns of Court where "all the rumble and bustle of London dies away at once; and it seems as if a person might live there in perfect quiet Witnout suspecting that it was not always a Sabbath," he can never "get enough of the bustle of London, which may weary, but can never satisfy me." The poet nature shows plainly enough in these little sayings. Eagerly as he searches for and admires the old and beautiful, he is no fanatic for mere antiquity, not scrupling to designate "solemn old trumpery" relics in which he sees nothing. But how tender is this passage-" Sunshine adapts itself to the character of a ruin in a wonderful way, it does not 'flout the ruins grey,' as Scott says, but sympathises with their decay and saddens itselt for their sake. It beautifies the ivy too . . . . oh that we could have ivy in America! what is there to beautify us when our time of ruin comes ? " It is singular how timid he seems in judging of pictures. He will hardly trust himself to say a word. Many of our national collections of various kinds ovewhelm him with their richness. But he does, in a sense, hate sight-seeing, likening it to eating off the same plate with a crowd of other people. What a consolation is it to the weakness of ordinary human nature to hear even a man like Hawthorne make this confession, "It is a hopeless and tame, generally, a depressing business to go through an immense multifarious show like this (the British Museum), glancing at a thousand things, and conscious of some little titillation of mind from them, but really taking in nothing, and getting no good from anything. The fact is, the world is accumulating too many materials for knowledge. We do not recognise for rubbish what is really rubbish; and under this head may be reckoned very many things one sees in the British Museum; and as each generation leaves its fragments and potsherds behind it, such will finally be the desperate conclusion of the learned." Space would fail us to give specimens of the frequent reflections in these notes on our climate, our social habits, our degrees of refinement, our beggars, our street-music, our buildings, our botany, especially our English gardens and lawns, our physical development, our State institutions, and other matters, all of which are treated by turns, and generally with some reference to America. Nor can we copy, even if good taste dictated it, those vigorous, graphic sketches of the manner and personal appearance of the most remarkable people met by Hawthorne, many yet living. Penetration, candour, and unaffected good sense, make all this'pleasant and valuable reading, and we can only refer to it to cordially commend it to those of our readers who think it well we should " see ourselves as others see us." Many a passage full of feeling and delicacy must we pass over, but we cannot conclude without drawing attention to the fine word-picture of London existence towards the end of the second volume. We will close with a few words from the preface, expressing a wish which we think is abundantly fulfilled. "It is very earnestly hoped that these volumes willdispel an often expressed opinion that Mr. Hawthorne was gloomy and morbid. He had the inevitable pensiveness and gravity of a person who possessed what a friend of his called "the awful power of insight ;" but his mood was always cheerful and equal, and his mind peculiarly healthful, and the airy splendour of his wit and humour was the light of his home. He saw, too far to be despondent, though his vivid sympathies and quick imagination often made him sad in behalf of others. He also perceived morbidness, wherever it existed, instantly, as if by the illumination of his own clear insight; and he had the plastic power of putting himself into each person's situation, and of looking from every point of view, which made his charity most comprehensive. From this cause he necessarily attracted confidences, and became confessor to very many sinning and suffering souls, to whom he gave tender sympathy and help, while resigning judgment to the Omniscient and Allwise."

JULIAN THE APOSTATE. Julieu VApostat et sa Philosophie du Poly- theisme. Par H.-Adrien Naville. (Paris Sando/ et Fischbacher, 1877.) A character whose merits have been the subject of no little contention between divines and historians ; whom the Fathers systematically condemned and the freethinkers of the last century indiscriminately lauded ; for whom theologians like Milman can find apology and even encomium, but whom Auguste Comte, in his Calendar, marked out for solemn reprobation, must always be an interesting study. That a prince distinguished by more than ordinary intellectual powers, of lofty aims and austere morality, one educated in the full light of Christian doctrine as professed by Constantine and expounded at Nicaea, should deliberately retrograde into the adoption of a worn-out creed at which a Polybius, a Cicero, and a Strabo had laughed, and should find supreme delight in sacrificing white bulls, exploring entrails, and pouring forth libations, is a phenomenon which historians of thc calibre of Joseph Milner can contemplate only with blank dismay. Much that contributes to tho solution of this problcmc historique, as M. Naville rightly designates it, is undoubtedly to be found in Julian's peculiar idiosyncracy and in the circumstances of his early life. We have but to recall that he was possessed by temperament with a Greek-like love of thc beautiful in nature ; that he was one to whom the " old divinities " shone through a golden mist of poetry and antiquity ; that he had learned from Mardonius in early youth to admire the genius and philosophy of ancient Athens, an admiration which maturer study only deepened and enhanced ; that the eloquence of Libanius drew him still further on in the pursuit of Hellenic culture, while the thcurgic skill of Maximus appealed to his imagination, and the lessons of Aedesins familiarised him with the new eclecticism, and his sympathy with paganism is alreadyhalf explained. It is certain, again, that the aspect under which Christianity pre- sented itself to his view must have been singularly repcllant. The lives of his nearest relatives had been mercilessly sacrificed to the suspicions of his Christian uncle. He had seen Arian and Athanasian engaged in furious conflict until the streets of the chief cities of the East ran with blood. Constantius himself exhibited in his religious creed a strange compound of Christian doctrine and contemptible superstition; while in that great city where the new faith first bore its name, its primitive austerity was fast disappearing amid the all-pervading Syrian voluptuousness. For Antioch, indeed, as he compared its luxury and debauchery with the standard of morality at Athens in the days of Pericles, or oven with that which obtained amid the Celtic rusticity of his favourite Lutetia, Julian did not hesitate to express his aversion and contempt. In the evidence thus afforded of repelling and attracting influences, operating with exceptional potency on Julian individually or in thc age in which ho lived, most writers have been content to find an adequate explanation of his relapse into paganism. M. Naville's treatise, however, supplies us with much that materially contributes towards a truer historical apprehension of the circumstances. He has devoted careful study both to Julian's own writings and those of the contemporary authorities, and has also duly familiarised himself with tho conclusions of j modern writers on his subject, such as j Neander, Strauss, Baur, and Semisch. He | makes, however, no referenco to the more recent and elaborate treatise of J. F. A. Miicke. The opening chapters set the more obvious causes of Julian's antagonism to Christianity briefly but very clearly before us. In the first place, he early fell under the spell of Neo-Platonism, and therewith embraced the theory of thc pre-existence of the soul as an emanation from the Deity, aud not, as the Christian Fathers taught, created at the physical birth ; while, in opposition to the doctrine of the resurrection, he believed that at death the soul was re-absorbed into the divine principle, and its personality ceased. He looked, again, on the disregard which Christianity avowed for nationality as an impracticable effort to set aside the unalterable distinctions of nature. Nations, he declares in the Misopogon, can no more change their peculiar characteristics and institutions than the different species of tho vegetable world can fail to reproduce their distinguishing features. Of this he considered the evident incapacity for science and philosophy of those western nations which Rome had subdued to offer decisive proof. The national and the traditional arc identical. j As the different peoples represent so many | genera of the human race, so the deity to whom each nation pays especial worship represents the "idea" of the national genius, an "idea" which the nation's characteristic institutions faithfully reflect. Upon Judaism, regarded from this point of view, he could look with toleration, as the maintenance of a national faith ; but the " Galilaeans " were, by their own avowal, essentially innovators and destroyers. So far as his own religious belief is to be inferred, he would appear to have maintained, in a qualified sense, tho personality of the gods of the Greek mytho- l?gy> Dnf; without the ancient anthropomorphism. The doctrine, however, to which M. Naville accords the greatest prominence is Julian's Sun-worship, a cult which, as associated with the Oriental deity Mithra, is the object of such frequent denunciation on the part of Christian writers of the third and fourth centuries. To Julian the Sun-god was his tutelary deity; he held the great centre of heat and light to be a grand mediatory principle linking together the Platonic world of pure intelligences (the world of " ideas") and the sensible, visible world around ns. M. Naville considers (a view already hinted at in Maurice's Philosophy of the First Six Centuries) that in this theory we have a direct imitation of the cardinal Christian doctrine of the Trinity, and observes that the terminology which Julian employs to define the celestial nature of his deity bears a remarkable resemblance to that which tho Fathers of the period employ with respect to the Logos. The Sungod was, in fact, opposed by Julian, as an object of worship, to the tb&g, Ik tptorug of Athanasius; a view which his well-known criticism, preserved by Cyril {Adv. Julian., book x.), to the effect that the author of the Fourth Gospel was the first to teach Christ's divinity, appears very remarkably to confirm. M. Naville entirely restricts his observations to the age of Julian himself. Otherwise it would have been quite pertinent to his enquiry had he taken occasion to point out the extent to which this worship of Mithra made its way in the Empire, not only among the adherents of paganism, but even among Christian communities. As regards the former, M. Gaston Boissier, in his Religion romaine d'Auguste aux Antonius (ii., 417), inclines to the conclusion that at the fall of the Empire the expounders of the declining paganism had theoretically adopted the belief that Mithra was the sole true deity; while, with respect to the Christians, we have it on the authority of Leo the Great himself (Migne, Patrologia, liv., 94) that even in his day many at Rome were wont when ascending the steps of St. Peter's to join in sacred worship, to turn and make their solemn obeisance to the Sun-god in the heavens. Our limits preclude our here noting the many other points of interest illustrated in M. Naville's valuable treatise. " Comprendre la pensee do Julien," he truly says, " c'est comprendre toute une epoque de l'histoire intellectuel de l'humanite," Not the least remarkable are the singular resemblances that Julian's speculations offer to theories of far more recent date?his adoration of the great centre of our planetary system (whence modern science derives all terrestrial forces and existences) as the true lord and giver of life ; his theory of the immutability of national characteristics, landing us in conclusions that inevitably point to a certain "survival of the fittest;" his fatalism in his estimate of human destiny; and finally, his view of pagan ceremonial as something which it was expedient and even necessary to maintain as an aid to minds too gross to conceive a purely spiritual worship.

The Sabbath, Sabbath Walks, and other Poems. By James Grahame. Illustrated by Birket Foster. (Nisbet & Co.)?We are glad to meet Mr. Birket Foster here alone, and engaged on a congenial subject, which, however, ne has treated rather in an English than a Scotch manner. We must not forget how very Scotch that poem is; a poem which we cannot open but it reminds us of the herdboy we came upon reading his Bible on a knoll purple and fragrant with dry thyme, with a sprig of which he had marked the place of David's combat, which had a professional interest for him; or recalls the old grey-headed shepherd seated on the bare slab of granite right away by Glen Ogle, who was reading his Bible with his large flat bonnet reverently laid beside him. Nor is thc poem less dear to us on other accounts, for it recalls to us the pleasant anecdote of its author,?how he wrote it unknown to his wife, gave it to her as a pleasant trifle, and leapt up delighted when she longed to know the writer. Mr. Foster is a landscape painter in miniature?small not because ne thinks in a narrow ring, but because he delights in fine workmanship. His first Sabbath Morning is very still and hushed,?the great elms breathe not, the sheep feed sleepily on the sunny hill by the church. The water-mill rests, the stream runs low and soft, while the cottage smoke exhales like a thin blue waft of incense. The country church is tinted with poetry. The details are wonderful as the execution,?the elms swell and breathe with such wealth of leaves, the water shines with so many mingling and fusing lustres. The wood that Grahame describes as just within reach of " city chime," is better than most coloured landscapes, so leafy and semitransparent are its depths, with the bee upon the flower and the linnet on the spray. The Scotch views are equally good. The border tower, with the broken drawbridge, the bare sullen hills, and thc white stream with its dark pools, are wonders of technical skill. He gives us the Puritan camp-meeting just as it used to be, beside some rough, noisy, irreverent stream, whose jargon drowned the chant of the Psalms and deafened the listening and prowling redcoats of davers. It is in his little nameless vignettes, original and individualized as Bewick's, only more poetical and idyllic, that Mr. Foster puts forth his best strength. It is now a leafless tree over a brook where the robin, red as the autumn leaf, sings to the listening silvercoated dace who dance below to his unpaid music;?it is a lark rising over a sunny meadow to his azure hermitage, high and lonely in heaven;?it is a church winter-thatched with snow, with the sparse, keen grass rising through the soft whiteness that beds the fields ;?it is the emerald-necked dowager-duck, leading out her daughters, and steering them through the stiff, rude water-lilies, past the flaunting rushes, and under the wandering willows. Everywhere he is tender, poetical?the very Goldsmith of illustrators.

229   8978909   INTERNATIONAL LAW.
Aug 7, 1880  ENGLISH LITERATURE - History and Criticism - 19th Century
Examiner  : 3784 947 - 948
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTERNATIONAL LAW. International Law. By William Edward Hall, M.A., Barristerat-Law. Oxford: The Clarendon Press. 1880. This is a big book on a big subject, and such a work ought to have for its author a big man. Now, we frankly confess at the outset, that we have no antecedent knowledge of Mr. Hall. He severely abstains from naming the college where he graduated, or the inn of court by which he was called. Nor does he favour us with a single word of preface. In these circumstances, therefore, the critic is to blame who is not impartial. He is under none of the ordinary temptations that beset reviewers. It is related of a Scotch judge of the Restoration period, that, being interrogated by a friend how it came to pass that Cromwell's judges gave so much greater satisfaction to suitors than the native lords of session, he replied, " Deil thank them ! A pack o' kinless loons ! But for my kith an' kin I could be a just judge mysel." In this case we are like the Protector's judges, in a position to be just, and there are patriotic reasons why we should even be generous. For the systematic study of international law in this country is at a low ebb indeed, and every honest effort to contribute towards its cultivation ought to be hailed with satisfaction. Englishmen in these later times seem to have lost either the capacity or the industry to write great instttutional works, whether in law or theology. Professor Hunter's "Roman Law" and Sir James Fitzjames Stephen's "D igests of Certain Sections of the Common Law" are almost the only works of real scientific merit that have seen the light in England for years. And now we are privileged to add Mr. Hall's treatise on international law to the number. It is not certainly the greatest work on international law that has been written, but it traverses the whole field of public international law with fidelity and perspicuity, and the result is a treatise to which the diplomatist, the law student, or the journalist may refer with equal advantage. It will not supersede Wheaton, because Wheaton can no more be superseded in international law than Adam Smith in the domain of political economy. In some respects it is even inferior to Professor Woolsey's wellknown handbook; for our American kinsmen have developed an enviable faculty for lucid presentation of such subjects hard to be equalled, and not to be excelled. Needless to say Mr. Hall's style does not possess the classic elegance of Judge Story nor the subtle analytic power of Chancellor Kent. but it is plain, unencumbered writing which can be readily followed even by the nonlegal mind. The whole subject is mapped out with excellent judgment, and due proportion is observed in the treatment of its several parts. This, if not the chief, is one of the chief merits of the book, for it is an excellence that can only be attained by one who has made a complete survey of the whole field before he takes pen in hand. The author has not written in order that he might learn, but has acquired in order that he might by writing instruct. Mr. Hall does not waste much space in discussing the nature and origin of international law, but he clearly defines his own standpoint at the outset. The rules of conduct which modern civilised States regard as binding on them in their relations with one another may either be regarded as approximations towards an absolute right which is assumed to exist (called jus naturale or the will of God), or as simple reflections of the moral development and the external life of the particular nations governed by them. It is the latter view that Mr. Hall adopts, and by so doing he reaches his subject at once. On the Continent of Europe generally, and in the University of Edinburgh, the subject of international law is taught as the law of nature and nations. A great deal is made of nature and comparatively little of the nations. Such writers as Irendlenburg, Ahrens, and Lorimer, of whom, by the way, Mr. Hall seems to live in happy ignorance, can have but a poor idea of Mr. Hall's performance. They profess to discover and formulate a body of absolute rights depending on the constitution of human nature itself; and having achieved this arduous task, thev then proceed to show how shockingly improper the rules of actual, positive international morality are. And we are not prepared to say that this high d priori method has not led to improvements in the relations of state to state. Thefiis naturale of the stoics was an ever present ideal, which operated on the best minds of antiquity just as the word progress influences the noblest intellects of to-day. After all, however, these are but generalisations, and it is more profitable to follow Mr. Hall in ascertaining what the state of international law or usage actually is than in trying to divine what it ought theoretically to be. From 1 the base and ignoble known let us proceed with cautious induction to the brighter unknown future of hunanity. In dealing with so vast a body of material as is necessarily contained between the covers of any adequate s treatise on international law, it would be absurd with our limited space to attempt by means of quotations to a give the reader any notion of how the author has per- t formed his task. T his we say with regret, for the I reviewer who neglects to quote reasonably from his v author ordinarily does injustice both to author and E reader. But we cannot afford to incur the condemnation s of the Athenian of the Greek comedy, who, having a o house to sell, went about with a specimen brick in his S pocket in order to find a. purchaser. Suffice it to say f( that on every point Mr. Hall has conscientiously brought c his subject down to date, and that he is throughout n unbiassed and cautious in the judgments he pronounces. 1 Yet he is not afraid to condemn when condemnation is S necessary. During the siege of Paris an English subject ir was captured in a balloon, and Prince Bismarck main- ci tained that he was liable to arrest and trial by court- oi nmartial "because he had spied out and crossed our out- ci posts, possibly to make use of the information thus sz gained to our prejudice." Regarding this incident Mr. om Hall justly observes: "Neither secrecy, nor disguise, lo nor pretence being possible to persons travelling in fe balloons, the view taken by the Germans is inexplicable; in and it is satisfactory to notice that the treatment of tit balloon travellers as spies was forbidden in the proposed te: Declaration of Brussels, and that their right to be treated ev ne as prisoners of war is affirmed in the French Official 11- Manual for the use of military officers." But of all re- nations, the readiest to stand on what it regards as ch its international rights, has almost from its ongin been d. the American Republic. he The case of Martin Koszta, the Hungarian refugee, tic which Mr. Hall relates, is in point. He had been to the Zd United-States, and had made a statutory declaration of n- his intention to become a citizen. But long before the x- period of naturalisation was matured he turned up at ie Smyrna, and was seized by the Austrians under certain is capitulations with Turkey, and put on board the brig -e Hussar for conveyance to an Austrian dungeon. Before ?- the Eissar could get under weigh, however, an American in frigate arrived, which threatened to send her to the ie bottom if Koszta were not at once delivered up. And )y shipped off he was to the United States, the American Government defending the action taken by its commander ie on the ground that his American domicile conferred on ly Koszta a sufficient national character to entitle him to )f the protection of the State. Later, during the Civil War !g in i863, an Act was passed subjecting foreigners, who had !r expressed their intention to become citizens, to military It service. Thereupon Earl Russell made a representation )f that such persons should be allowed a reasonable time to it withdraw from the country; and sixty-five days were d granted them as a right, Mr. Hall asserts, and not as a j concession. If this be so, the older doctrine affecting the rights and duties of intending American citizens has if been abandoned in favour of one less likely to breed s trouble, but Mr. Hall's reasoning on the point is not f conclusive. The volume contains some valuable appens dices, notably those on Naturalisation in different States, , on the Conditions of the Nationality of Vessels, and X on the papers carried by them.

2THE REFLECTOR. [No. LIX ] THE FARMER'S BOY, BY ROBERT BLOOMFIELD. Thi Farmer's life displays in every part A moral lesson to the sensual heart: Thougl* in the lap of plenty thoughtful still, He looks beyond thle pA-sot good or ill. FARNIER'S BOY. r ROM that portion of the Farner's Bcy entiU tled Spring, which was the subject of our last paper, we pass on to Summer, where passages of equal merit will deserve our attention. The same ease and simplicity are still apparent-the evervarying scenes of nature are here painted with his aceustomed fidelity. The Summer opens with a delineation of the husbandman's prospects, from vhich we may draw much moral instruction. We shall, however, transcribe those lines which relate to the green corn, and Giles beating off the sparrows, who are intent on the destructioni of it Slot up from broad rank blades that droop below, The nodding bwheat-ear forms a graceful bow; With milky kernels starting, full weigh'd down, Ere yet the sun hath ting'd its head with brown. Whilst thousands in a flock, for ever gay, Loud chirping sparrows welcome on the day, And from the mazes of the leafy thorn Drop one by one upon the bending corn - Giles with a pole assails their close retreats, And round the grass-grown dewy border beats On either side completely overspread, Here branches bend-there corn 6'ertops his head. In his humble employment he espies the sky-lark, and the soaring of this lively bird is thus picturesquely described : Just starting from the corn sbe cheerly sings, And trusts with conscious pride her downy wings, Still louder breathes, and, in the face of day, Mounts up and calls on Giles to mark her way: Close to his eyes his hat he instant bends, And forms a friendly telescope, that lends Just aid enough to dull the glaring light, And place the wandering bird before his sight, Yet oft beneath a cloud she sweeps along, Lost for a while, yet pours her vaired song; He views the spot, and, as the cloud moves by, Again she stretches up the clear blue skyHer form, her motion undistinguished quite, Save when she wheels direct from shade to light; The fluttering songstress a mere speck became, Like fancy's tloating bubbles in a dreamHe sees her yet, but yielding to repose, Unwittingly his jaded eye-lids close 1 We cannot refrain from adding the following six lines, descriptive of the slumber into -which he has. now fallen, there is something so peculiarly natural in the exclamation: .Delicious sleep-! -from sleep who could forbear, With no more guilt than Giles, and no more care? Peace o'er his slumbers waves her guardian wing, Wor conscience once disturbs him with a sting He wakes refresh'd from every trivial pain, And takes his pole and brushes round again. The farmer's pride in surveying the ripening cPrn is thus beautifully pourtrayed; Here vanity slinks back, her head to hideWhat is there here to flatter human pride ? TIhe tow'ring fabric or the dome's loud roar, And stedfast columns may astonish more, Where the charin'dgazer long delighted stays, Yet traced but to the architect the praise: Whilst here the veriest clown that treads the sod Without one scruple gives the praise to GOD ! Ahd two-fold joys possess his raptur'd mind, From gratitude and admiration join'd! The following scene is peculiar to the season, and must afford every lover of nature gratification: Hark! where the sweeping scythe now rips along, Each sturdy mower em ulous and strong, Whose writhing form meridian heat defies, Benlds o'er his work, and every. sinew tries, Prostrates the waving treasure at his feet, But spares the rising clover short and sweet. Come health, come jollity, light-footed come, Here hold your revels, and make this your home; Each heart awaits and hails you as its own, Each moistened brow that scorns to wear a frown! The repose of twilight next attracts our regard in these delightful lines: Still twilight welcome! rest, how sweet art thou! Now eve o'erhangs the western clouds' thick brow, Thq far-strerch'd curtain of retiring light With fiery treasures fraught, that on the sight -Flash from its bulging sides, where darkness lours In fancy's eye a chain of mouldering tow'rs, Or craggy coasts just rising into view, 'Midst javelins dire and darts of streaming blue! The poet closes with an impressive descant on har'vest-hodrne-that period of general festivity. He affectingly contrasts ancient gcnerosity with modem custom-the poor man is made to exclaim, with great beauty, in favour of the good old master in strains which shall form our conclusion HEAVEN bless his memory! bless his honollr'd name ! The poor will speak his lasting worthy fame. To souls fair-purpos'd strength and guidance give, In pity to us still let goodness live! Let LABOUR have its due! mny lot shall be - From chilling want and guilty murmuis free; Let LABOUR heave its due! then peace is mine, And never never shall my heart repine t May these equitable wishes meet with abundant gratification !-Virtuous industry ought never to fail of its reward.

No. 4 is a " Fuguetta " which cleverly illustrates ' The Children's Quarrel.' There are some young folk who think fugues dry,. but if their attention was drawn specially to the title they would enjoy the music.

DARNELEY PLACE. By RICHARD BAGOT. 6s. (Methuen.) Hypnotism and spiritualism are enough to spoil any novel. " Trilby " did succeed in spite of the former, but " Trilby " was the exception, and Mr. Bagot, in allowing spiritualistic motives to affect his characters has not added to the reality and interest of his story. The Sicilian vendetta would have borne development better than the somewhat elusive and roundabout influence of the spirit-world after two gencrations. Still, there are pretty pieces of Italian life. Now that Mr. larion Crawford is dead, Mr. Bagot has this field to himself, and he manages even a cardinal in the present novel without making him more than sympathetic, privately, with ideas frowned on by the Curia. An Italian professor tells this cardinal incidentally that he objects to " wade through pages of anmatory silliness in novels which might otherwise be interesting ." Mr. iagot has exvidently had this warning before his mind, for the novel has more breadth andl atmilosphere than usual. It is not anti-papal or antianvthing. Tlhe incidents, beyond a ghastlyn murder at the end, are neither sensational nor anmorous. )n the other hand, the story is rather long, an(l there is not enough lhumour to relieve the desLriptions and dialogues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SUBSTITUTE. By Will N. Harben. 6s. (Harper and Brothers.) This is an American story, and the character drawing is done with the rather charming optimism that so frequently characterises American fiction when dealing with life in some minor town or country village. It is almost as if, away from the contagion of cities, the Yankee still retained, along with the cuteness which is always one side of the disposition, a large element of freshness and good humour, and an admirable faculty for simple and generous enthusiasms. In "The Substitute" almost everybody is what one might call a * likeable " person. And the gossip, the 'mall talk, the intense engrossment in other people's affairs as being practically the one great means of enriching the meagre eventfulness of one's own, which forms part of the habits of any small community, stirs a homeliness of feeling, as comfortable as a sudden entrance upon a cheerful fireside. The central figure in the book is the son of a man who gets five years' imprisonment for theft. The boy had been adopted, educated, was one of the most promising young men in the town, and in love with the daughter of the one aristocratic family resident there. The disgrace of his father's conviction starts the craving for drink gnawing like a living beast within him. He is pulled up by a sudden insight into torture secretly endured for years by his adopted father, who during a fit of rage accidentally killed a man in his youth. There are other supporting interests in the story, but the principal action is concerned with the love affair of the two deeply frustrated young people, and its final pleasant conclusion. " The Substitute" distinctly refreshes, and at the same time is grounded on a basis of careful observation. If events and people are finally handled a little more genially than would have been the case in reality, the reader is aware that the reason for their being so is less a false perception of life's methods, than a desire for cheer's sake, to seize one of the rare occasions when destiny does eventually reward the decently behaved, and work out cordial episodes for the deserving.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pleasures of Life. By Sir John Lubbock. (Macmillan & Co.) The world, it is often complained, is getting too full. The crowd is so densely packed, and in such constant movement, that personal intercourse between people of similar tastes, who have something to teach to, and something to learn from, each other, is becoming impossible save in rare cases and at distant intervals. As a set-off to the loss involved in this is to be noted the practice, which seems to be gaining ground, whereby men of eminence in various lines?politics, science, or literature?give tothedim common populations, in the form of addresses or essays, the benefit of their experience of life. In the little volume before us, for example, Sir John Lubbock, dropping for the occasion the character of man of science, banker, or politician, or retaining it only in so far as his eminence in any of those lines ensures a respectful hearing for all he may have to say, comes forward as an observer of life and student of literature, "naturally rather prone to low spirits," in order that he may impart to others, and especially to others similarly troubled, a share of the compensations which he has observed in the one, and the consolations which he has derived from the other. Both heads, indeed, may be almost brought under one. As a scientific observer of life Sir John likes to verify his observations by those which others have recorded, so that life and literature are blended. Even when he is discoursing on duty, or travel, or science, Sir John prefers to express his opinions in the words of others. His book is a very anthology of wise and noble sayings. In the opening of two pages we find quotations from Mr. Ruskin, Sir H. Taylor, St. Bernard, Marcus Aurelius; we go a little further, and see at a glance the names of Michael Angelo, Izaak Walton, Epicurus, Mr. Ruskin again, Jeremy Taylor. Indeed, an index of all the authors quoted would materially enlarge the volume. Among the other addresses will be found that on 'The Choice of Books,' which, innocent in itself, was the means of opening the floodgates to a wondrous stream of nonsense. In its place, as delivered to tho London Working Men's College, it was no doubt useful enough; and its author can hardly have been expected to foresee what a " lead " he was giving to self-advertisement. Perhaps the most interesting bit of his own mind which Sir John gives his readers is in the address on ' Science,' where he ventures to anticipate a time when the study of natural history may " replace the loss of what is, not very happily I think, termed ' sport.' " " Some of up," he continues, " even now?and more, no doubt, will hereafter?satisfy instincts essentially of the same origin by the study of birds, or insects, or even infusoria?of creatures which more than make up by their variety what they want in size." " Game," in fact, will have an even wider connotation than gibier in French. Sir John Lubbock's little book appears at a seasonable time. It is just the oook for the holiday-maker to slip into his pocket and read at odd moments. If he will verify the quotations when he comes home he will find himself over and over again brought into the presence of the masterpieces of human thought, and get as much benefit spiritually from them as he will, it is to be hoped, have obtained corporeally from his holiday, and that, too, " without money and without price."

Along the Road. By A. C. BENSON. (Nisbet and Co. 7s. 6d. net.) THOUGH this series of essays is lucid and in a measure inspiring, as are all this author's works, -it provides little of mental food, but rather a succession of sweetmeats, more toothsome than nutritious. We read "A. C.' as we read Omar, for the philosophy which its author describes as "threadbare" is expressed far more mellifluously than we had thought possible. At the end, it is almost as Mr. Benson says of Gladstone's speech on "Artemis": "When I came to make up my report, I could not think where the whole thing had vanished to," for here we have thoughts intrinsically old and familiar, dressed anew. It is the form that attracts, not the substance, and we come to such a book as this rather for mental soothing than for food. It may be that "if one could clear away all the unnecessary work of the world, be content with simple shelter, well-worn clothes, inexpensive meals, a few good books, one would have time to live"; and then one would agree with Mr. Benson that the "inner life" is all that really matters, and the fever of every-day existence is a vain business. Scenery, friendship, emotions-even passions-on these the inner self lives, we are told. Unfortunately, the work-a-day world compels us to maintain the pace set by our own fellows: bread and butter matters, and must be considered. So we will take our Bensonian reflections in such doses as the hustle of life permits, rejoicing in their literary form, and grateful to their author for such delicate, fragrant studies. When we require to chop away the trees in the path of life, we will grasp the commonplace hatchet; when we desire to cut flowers that we may inhale their fragrance by the way, we will make use of such dainty, razor-edged tools as are provided by these essays. To drop strained metaphor, we will read "Along the Road" as time permits for the sense of indolent pleasure that perusal of its contents imparts-but we will not read it for its use.

A Master of Craft. By W. W. Jacobs. (Methuen & Co.) The seafaring characters familiar from Mr. Jacobs's short stories are here again in a novel, and make a successful reappearance. It seemed doubtful if they could display their ingeniously stupid tricks, their superstition, and their eye for a girl ashore to advantage in a lengthy narrative; but Mr. Jacobs's humour has triumphed, and his book can be read with pleasure straight off. Only he must not make his sailors too clever, and should remember that one is apt to over-emphasize effective points in familiar parts. We do not really believe that sailors are as slyly humorous as Mr. Jacobs represents them, but that is no matter; in this present arid world any genuine personal vein of fun is uncommon.

I OPERA-H1OUSE DISPUTE. I A Stlatellent of Maflers relative to TI& I I King's Tathvtre. lBv E. Waters, Esq. jpl. ) 2 . We hLave been inuch entertained wvith this judicious pamphlet. Mr. Waters has expounded his case in language at once respectful and firm; feeling what is due to himself, he has in no instance, that we observe, forgotten what was lue to others, to the public, or to the noblemen and gentlemen w%%-ho had arrayedl themselves against lhinm. Hlis .statement is sim)jle andI perspicuous, without any aini at triumph in argunieit, l)ut on the contrary, preservillg a measured tone of conciliation wvhich, we think, must recommend him even to his ol)ponents; while his facts are so prodigiously strong, as to secure him a ver(dict wvithi those in whllose hands the scales of justice are held. So much for the matter between the Writer and those who (lisapl)proved of his nmanagement; as betwveen him an(l general readers the work is infinitely more amnisingv for it is accompanied with (locumnents of the most whimsical and extraordinary kind, with letters fromu foreiign singers and lanicers beyond all compare on the score of modesty, humilitv, and moderation. It sets out with an account of the ineetings at the 'hiatche(l Hlouse, whichwe have notice(l as they occurred, and complains that such proceedings, without l)revious communication or inquiry, were only calculated to produce a crude anol imperfect result, injurious to the theatre, and calculate(l to bring forth all the obscure hostility inseparable from management, while it encouraged the rapacity of foreign Performers, already far too exorbitant in their demands. As was foreseen, anonymous letters of the most infamous kind (as all anonyilotS letters are cowardly and infamous) were poured in upon every person connected with the King'sTheatres. Bankers, Solicitors, Performers, Insurance-offices, were assailed with insiutations against the stability of Mr. Waters, and thus a run create(l against himi, which must certainly have mortified the authors of those movements which led to it. Indeed they seen to have felt some comptiction; for they now agreed to do that which it would have been best to begin with, namiely, to meet at the Opera House, and examine into the concern and its conduct, before taking public measures against it. This meeting took place accordingly on the 3d of June, and as the public were excluded, we shall take 'Mr. Waters's account of it, only supplying some names which lie llias (mlitted, but which we have ascertaillCed. Previously to the Committee's entering upon the immediate object of their meeting, I begged leave to ask Lord Ailesbury, if the speech, said to be his lordship's, aid %vhichi had appeared in most of the Sunday and Monday papers, (together with the )roceedings that took place at the Thatched 1louse Tavern the Saturday previous) were such as his lordship considered to be correct. This related to the charge of 361. in ad(dition to the 3001. of usual subscription alleged against 'Mr. Waters: in contra(liCtion to which he gave in a statement of the years 1813 and 1818; the tornier being 3151. and the latter only 3001. and consequently a reduction. Lord Ailesbury, the Chairman, denied having ia(le the allegation. A discusSion next arose as to Mr. Waters's right of thus questioning the Chairman. No doubt ummost of the illustrious persons present assumed the dignity that belonged to their birth and station, and the august business on which they were employed. A noble Lord observed, ' that he considered all persons in my employ as the servants of the public.' This I of course b)egge(l leave to doubt, so long as they were pail by Inc. The noble Chairman then !ibserve(d, that they had met to require some explanation from Mr. Waters on the management of the theatre; and, in reply, I expressed my readiness to give every information they inight desire; observing, at the same time, that I should have considercd it as rather more kind and friendly, if some intimation had been given previously to the first meeting; as, in coaue. quence of this omission, misrepresentations had gone abroad. Upoin this a noble Lord observed, ' Kind and friendly, indeed, to our servant !' " This I was olviousIv not bound to bear; and I requested his lordship to soften his niode of exj)ression. His lordship observed, I that lhe should use what expressions hle please(d.' ()n this I rel!lied, that lie must excuse Ilme if I u(lopted a similar course. This spirite(l nobleman was no less than one of the ci'l/it British mrIr met on this momentous affair, as the Banrons did at Runymiede about iln affair of les.9 conlsequence, Magna C(hlarta ; and as plosterity is alwavs anxious about the persons wh;o were tlistigiiiished onl such oeasioins, it is but proper to 9a) that tile E!arl (ot PlyniouthI was the Iiian.

The Mar/ician. By Leitch Ritchie, o vols. Mamine. Tm:ur. is no dogmatizing upon the general fi tendency of the ago, if our light literature is to bo considered as its index. One week, we f might presume that no tale but such as dealt with the actual passions and conditions of humanity, could expect even a hearing, much less . success,--that Philosophy and Experience wvro the role spirits called into council, when ii new , tay Wits to be contrived for the pastime of those; . grown children, iii-* reading public. But scarcely ( ,' hiive wo settled ourselves into this comfortless . conviction, than we aro startled by tho appear- , ance ot si::i"c legend of splendid improbability-- ? some' tissue- of l.ri'.'ht fancies, so free from tho hues of this work-day i.r.el care-soiled world, as . to convince us that the imaginative has not ; ., been wholly driven from out its nestling place ; in tho human heart. Perhaps it would como ",. neat' tho truth, to say, that universal toleration . and i\.is'!!i are one ; and that though we can no longer believe implicitly in the tricks and shows , of im..-.'iiiation, wo love them none the less, j though " with ;i dilll-rence," than our more eic- ! ? I dillons foivfa'.her.-i. i Mr. Ritchie'spowerfulandgraphiesketchesiind short stories are well known, but he has hitherto j been less successful when his canvas Wits more ; i ambitiously enlarged. The romance before us ! . ] is. however, a groat improvement upon all its J predec.'s-ovs; full of action, though n.<t too full; I devoted to the moro violent and stormy passions, ' , yet not dinning their cries into our ears till we long j 1 i to doze over a page of level writing: and tlr".igh rilli in description, containing fewer ofthe mere I i properties of the dark days and occult sciences, | than might be expected in a tide of " trine, ; sextant, and pentacle.'' We cannot, however, I , unde'.'slaiiel why Mr. Ritchie should neutralize | . tlie elect of his dory, hy a careful and systema- j tic destruction ofthe woiideis it contains. It is j 1 folly to suppose that anyone could in these days \ \ j believe in magic; why then awaken Fancy fruin > ? her reverie, by pertinaciously proving to her I ; ? that the perfumes of tho enchanted cauldron | .? ; are only so many drugs sold by the pound,-? I that the charmed circle is tlc fonded by no more ? I spiritual arni than such as is forged in the lbun' ! derv,?that the spirits of the dead walk not, save ? ; in tho trev. ti.-, of a masquerade' warehouse; ? j and that the Magician himself is, after till, no j pale, pas-ii:;'.ess, Wandering Jew. but?we will , \ not imitate his example, and break tho mystery i of the boo'..., which, with all these drawbacks. . I unwisely iutroduci tl to conciliate the spirit of J tito age, is full of life and colour, and excites ti strong interest. The subject of the tale, the crimes and fortunes of <idles de Rctz, Lord of Laval, iind of the mysterious being who ruled them, was suggested to Mr. Ritchie during his visits to the rivers of France, on ono of which, the Ertlre, stands the scene of his sorceries?the ruined Chateau de la Verriere. The author's subsequent reaideiice in the French capital, enabled him to lill li]) the outline presented by the popular legend, hy research and inquiry; his story is consequently consistent and complete, and its details, to borrow an artist's phrase, well studied. It would be too much to expect that a romance of " grainarye" should not cont;,in a .Jew and his daughter; and here, aocnrdii.- ly, wo lind them?tho credulous adept, and his spirited, aitcctionate daughter Hagar, worthy, in every respect, of tho stout Scottish '.uro, David Armstrong, whose countrymen and fellow siiuletits, too, are cleverly hit off: the Breton peasants aro loss individual. The dialogue, though a little too much sliffened-up with exclamations and involutions, is, on the whole, clear, forcible, and appropriate; and we recom- mend such of our readers as are not wholly " unused at ghost and rattling bones to start," further to consult ' The Magician.'

The accoutitt ot' Mr1. Ilmuke',s lifre commences front the earliest period. We leaIrn that ie isam Iborit ill the city ot' I)ublin ; that lie .'as delicate in lielutil, alltd for thiat reason was sent to school at so801e distalneC fromi1 tile- ll('trolpolis; that here lie ltikily net withi all inIstluctotr every wsay Nvortlty to fotr'mti t he nmind of' sitht a youthi, mit e r whose root' lie continited to reside utitil htis removal to 'l'riInity College ; atid that, after tavinti gonl(e tluro"tght the iecessauy cot rse otf a College education hbe was (.entered as a sttdettt of the Middle Temitple, vitli tile ititentioti of' being called to tile EttgliIh h In'.

Thte buildings are very tinle: it may be called the sink ot' vice: but its Hospitals andI clharitable institutions, whose turrets p)ierce the skies like so many electrical condtitctors, avert the wrath ot Heaven. Tile inhabitants mav be divided into two classes, the unduers and the undone, generally so, I say, for I ain persoiaded there are mainy men ot honestv, and women t'l virtue, in every street. An E ntlisiinan is cold and([ distant at first ; lie is very cautious even ill forminiz an ac(linainitance ; lie miust know yon well before lie enters into tfienidlshiip with olt tint it' lie (loes, lie is not the first to dissolve that sacred elondl ill short, a real Englishimian is Ollf' thia;t perforims more than lie promises: in comipany lie is rather silent, extreumely Ipi-tlelit in hiis expressionis, even in polities, his tavonirite topic. 'hile women are not (Iuite so reserved ; they consuilt their glasses to the best advantage and as nature is very liberal in her gifts to their p('i')IIS, and even mind, it is not Cel'V tor a vongi nman to e. ape their glalices, or to shliut lhis ears to their softlvflownvlg acet ets. As to the state of learning in this City, von know I hIve niot been long enouigh in it to thrimi a paroper jumdigment of that siilbject. I (lon't thlik, however, there is as iiinch respeet pai(l to a maila of letters on thic side tile water as you imne~ine. I don't findl that geniuis, the ' ratht prmimiose, which forsaken die s,' is patronized by any atf t' e nobility, so that writers ot the' irst talents are left to tile capriciolls patronage otfthe pualblic. Notwithistand(liiig this (liscouiragemeint, literattire is ciiltiateul ini a high degree. Poetry raises her enchanting voice to heaven. History arrests the vings ot Time in lhis flig ht to the guilt of oblivion. P'hilosol)hy, the queen ot I arts, and the daughter ot heaven, is daily extending her intellectual empire. Fancy sports on airy wing, like a meteor on the bosonm ofta sutimner cloud ; anul even Metaphysics sp)ins liC cObwebs, and(1 ('catcles some ties."' We now find, however, thiat tile la' had few attractionis ;or him ; for it appears that lie was never "' called,," bitt that lie devoted himself' sholly to general literature, cotitribItting lar'. ely to the lwriodhic;al paroductions then most in vogue, and pIblishliing " lhe 'inudication of Natural Society," tile " Issay on the Suibhlime and Beautitififl," and sonie o his miost celebrated pamplhilets. Trme next extract we shalel m;ike is f'rou a letter lie adthressed to .)r. Robertson tilon his History of Anmerica: I I anil pet hectlv senlilble of tile very flattering distinction I liave receive(l, in your thinkin, ine worthiy of sO noble a presenit as that ot your History ot Anmerica. I have, hiowvever, suffered my ,i ttitilde to lie tinder somtit suilpicioln, by deiyi' ng my acknowledgments otf so great a tfivotir. But mily delay wvas only to rendier my obligatioii to you more cuml)lete, alld my thanks, if possil;1e, more merited. Thlle close of the session hbrought a great deal oft roublesomne thotigli not iml)ortant businiess I oM nc at onlce. I could not go through your %sork at one breath at that tiniethoiugh I have dolie it since. 11 I ani now enab)led to thank you, not only t'or the lhonour onl have dotie me, buat ftr the great satisfaction and the infinite variety andl conlnpass of inistruction I have received t'rom your incomihibarble work. EIvery thing has been d oie which was so naturallv to be expected f'roni the auithor ot the History of Scotlanid, and ot the Age ot Cliarles the Fifth. 1I believe few books have done nmore thian this towards clearing np (lark points, correctinli errors, and removing prejudices. You have, too, the rare secret of rekindling an interest on sul)jects that had so often b-en treated, and in %shich any thing that could feed a vital flame appeared to have been consumed. I am sire I read many parts ot your History with that frevi concern and anxiety which attend thiose whlo are not previously apprised of the evert. A'oui have besides thrown quite a newv light on the present state of the Spanish provinces, and furnished both materials and hints for a Iational theory of what may be expected tromn Ithein in futtire. ; The j)art which I rea(l with the greatest pleasure, is the discussion on the manners and character of the inhablitants of that new world. I have always thought with you, that we possess at this time very great advantage towards tIme know ledgc of hunman nature. We need no longer go to history to trace it in all stages and periods. History, trom its comparative youtih, is but a poor instructor. When the lgyvptianis called the Greeks children in antiquities, %s e may well call them children anid so we mlay cell all those nations which were ahle to trace the progress of society only within their own limits. But now the. great muip of mankind is unrolled at once, anl there is no state or gradation of barbarism, and no mode of refinement wbich we hIave not at the same moment un(ler our view; the very different civility of Europe and of China; the barbarism ot' lersia and of Abyssinia ; the erratic manners of Tartary and Aralbia, the savage of North America, and of New Zealand. Indeed you have made a noble use of the advantages you have had. You have employed philosophy to judge on manners, and from manners you have drawn new resources for philosophy. I onlv think thiat in one or two points )oUl have Hardly done justice to the savage character. Theme remains before you a great field. Peric(losw plenum opus nulkw tractas, et incedis per i,,nes suppositos cineri doloso. When ever these ashies will be spread over the present fire, God knows.

Mr. Prior, then, notwithstdnding I thle occasional looseness of' his style, a tewI grammatical inaccitracies, and here and there an exlression which we shoild characterize by the terms coat seness or impuirity -has nevertheless so many redeeminmg points about lainm in other resptects, that we mtst, injustice, prononiaee hiuii to be a very entertaining writer. The characters and the parallels he has occasionally drawn of Pitt andl Fox, of Johnson and Sheridan, and of some other coutemporat ies of tIme hero ot his voltile, are executied in a very masterly way ; and lie exhibits altogethier so much vigour of intellect, so intach isower and discrimination, and is so thoroughly acqutainted w ith his sulbject, that we cannot but congratulate him tpoat the ability hie has displayed, and recommend hi' book to our readers as one of the most agreeable and instructive prodhurtions of the prtesent day. As a favourable illu tration ot what we have advanred, we shall conclude our extracts with a portion of his character of Fox, aid at the same time subjoino two little domestic anecdotes t he one exhibitinht, withi respect to Biurkv's only son, a degree of filial attachanvit petliaps rarely eqtuilled ; andt the other referring to a favolmrite old horse of his;-both of which are I well related. Tle exttraordinary powers which he (Fox) ipossesseul were chietlv from nature, and he I often seemed to depend upon them alone without consiulting tlme suirer gnide of experience. He had, of course, infinitely more of inzennity than of knowledge, more of originalitv of thouilht than of p ,tient recearech mnore ot decision tIhan of reflection ; he was niore acute tltan discriminating ; lie was self. 'willed thlrongh lite, obstinately attached to his own opinions, and Undertvaluimig, though not offensively, tho c of the rest of mankind. H He was heard to say, in the earlier part of Ilife, that ' he hImat never wished to do any tIming which lie did not do,' and that ' he conside red advice an insuilt to his tn(lerstanding.' -In conversationl he was backward and shlu-gish, seldom rising above mediocrity ; in f epistolary communication, commom - plnace; f in historical writing, neither profound nor toriginal ; in debate alone, lie oftenl rose above all competition, especially in mursts of indescribable power; but as an orator, in the I higher and more extended sense of the word, whose ontpouirings are wortly to live and will live, he 'sas on all RIeat oecasions much excelled by Biikie. Tlue bent ot his minn in politics was to gre-it thliil-ss rather than to tbe more common; to what was itiposing and theoretically perfect, rather than to what was nseful and applicable ; le catight eagerly at the lbold and tile splen(lid, at daring novelties and platisil)le generalities, w ithont snfficiently considering, or caring for, the difficulties o posedl to their being carried into effect. o one knew men hetter in every-(lay lite; but he did not so well know tnan, when placed In Uncommon an(l untried situations. '* A remaikal)fe distinction between him and 1B1trke was, that the latter, thongh edu. catedl like a lshilosopher, and often teachinl with the wisdom of one, rejected all theory opposed to experience, in treating of the practical busin-ss of tile state. While Fox brought lip as u man of the world, and always declaiming as stich, appeared in practice often inclined to play the mere philosopher. Though eqlially grand in his views, he had not the knowledge, the cantion, the penetration of Bulrke to foresee their results. What he clearly saw, no man could better describe, blut his eye did not take in tile whole moral horizon; he was impatient of that labour of meditation and calculation whichl distinguish. eul his celebrated friend and political instructor. - - - " In the closing scene itself there were some circtimstances sufficiently affecting. The poor sufferer passed the night preceding his diss'jlution in a very restless and agitited state, thongh resigned to that decree which wai so soon to separate him from tile world; but in the morning, hearing the lond lamenta. tions of his parents in an adjoining room,and anxious as far as in hit power to relieve their agony by seeming better than lie really was, he rose with some astitance, and, leaning on the arm of the faithful houisekeeper(Mlrs.Web. ster) and her hutsband, proceeded to the door of the room in which they were sitting, desiring his sutpporters to quit him before they I came within sight (ot his father and mothera kind of affectionate imposition meant to impress them with a belief of his gsining sfrength. He even made a vigorous effort to tread the room with a firm step, walking acrosi it to thl* window, and tilence towirds where they sate in tile deepest distressviewing h1inil with intense anxiety, bnit ninable to uitter a word. To some efforts which he made to colnsole them, excessive grief still pievenlteul any reply ;-' Speak to me, my dear father,' said he, in a pathet iC tone, ' speak to me of religion, speak to me of moralityspeak to me of inulifferent matters, for I derive mitch satisfartion from what you say.' Shorlyafterwards, heariiig somne noise withoilt doors, he inquired whether it was raini, adding imme(liately, No; it is but the wind whi-tling throtigh the trees,-and then repeated in I solemni manner three lines from Adam's hymllil to the morning, which had been favourites with his urncle Richard, and were repeateil by himi more than once just before his death:IIis praine, ye winds, that from fbur quarters blow, Breathe slft or foold; and wave your tops ye pines, With every platit, in sign of worship wave. " He repeated them a second time with in. creaseil solemnity, and had scarcely finished the conchlding w'ord of the passage, when the hand of death smote him, and staggering into the arms of his father, was carried in a state of insensibility to bed, where shortly after. wards, without reviving, he breathed his last." - " A feeble old( horse, which had heen a great favonrite with the jiniior Mr. Buirke, and his constant companion in all rural jouinevinas and sports, when both were alike healthful and vigorous, was now in his age, and on the death of his master, tOrned out to take the run ofthe park tor the remnainder of his lite at ease, with strict injunctions to the servants that he should neither be ridden nor mniolested by any one. While walking one day in solitary musing, Mr. Burke perceived this wornout old servant come close npI) to hiu, antd at length after some nionients spent in viewing him, tollowed by seeming recollection anld conlidence, deliberately reste(l its head upon his bosom.

Transformed
Montgomery, Florence
-------------------------------------------------------------
Transformed. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. ( By Florence Montgomery. * (Bentley & Son.) 'Transformed' Miss Montgomery shows how the influence of a little boy changed an austere, selfish old bachelor into a rather dreamy philanthropist, whose life was "a poem in itself." The author made her first and greatest success with children, and her latest work contains some happy touches of child life; but the active grace of her little hero partakes too much of the exaggerated optimism which used to be the note of the " Sunday book." Just as the idea and sentiment of the book are strained beyond nature, its matter is stretched by the uncomfortable device of making short sentences into separate paragraphs, so that what was fitted more or less well for a short story is expanded into the compass of a fair-sized volume. The exact age of the " dear little boy," as the child is called with annoying iteration, is wisely left doubtful, but one leaves him with the impression that he was at times a terrible little prig, or that instead of being a little boy he was really a little girl.

-------------------------------------------------------------
A Strong-minded Woman. By William A. Hammond. (New York, Appleton & Co.) 'A Strong-minded Woman' demands considerable resolution from the reader. If he will persevere through the early chapters he will find himself in the company of a writer who has a good deal to say and an agreeable stock of knowledge, but no great art as a story-teller. Dr. Hammond holds strong opinions with regard to protective duties, and can be both amusing and instructive about " the woman question." Political matters such as these seem to be better suited to him than the study of character in detail.

The Lost Name
Dahlgren, Madeleine Vinton
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Lost Name. By Madeleine Vinton Dahlgren. (Boston, U.S., Ticknor & Co.) Ix  Mrs. Dahlgren's novelette contains the story of a young American who turned out to be a French marquis. She admits that the book has some of the improbabilities of romance, but says that the characters are not all pure idealizations. The fact is of no great importance. The story is one that might be true, and therefore might be interesting; but the book is chiefly noticeable as the work of a writer who has had considerable experience of life, and who apparently holds at home a fair place among , American novelists of the second class. This fact, if it be such, only shows how very wide a gap there is between the first and the second class. Mrs. Dahlgren in her conversations is pompous to absurdity, and in her characters has succeeded in expelling nature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE OLD SCHOOL. In Two Volumes. "Our virtues would be proud, if our faults whip. ped them not; and our crimes would despair. if they were not cherished by our virtues." AU's well that cedst wcU. Act iv. LONDON: Booth, 1813. 8vo. Pr. 12s. Barfield, Printer. THE volumes before us consist of a series of letters supposed to be written from a young lady to her aunt, during her visits in the family of one of her intimate friends. In these, -she describes the characters, reports the conversations, and details the incidents, which she conceived would be most interesting to her absent relative. Sir William Jeruingham, the kind father of the family, and hospitable owner of the mansion, is tinged with a deep melanclolv, which the tenderness of bisafieictionate wife,aud the growing beauties of his lovely children, had repressed and softened, but could not entirely overcome. He had early formed an attachment with a lady whose father had refused his offers. The confidant of his hope- less passion became the favored lover of his former mistress, and time and absence had almost healed the heartfelt wound, when accident threw the lady in his way as she was flying from a storn; he eagerly offered her a protection, which she as speedily accepted-they were observed by her favored suitor, who hastily demanded satisfaction for his supposed injury. Mutual pride prevented an explanation, and his mistaken friend fell by time hand ofJerningham. Derangement seized the unfortunate lady, till death put a period to her misfortunes. Time alleviated the pangs it could not remove-Sir W married most hapily,. and succeeded to a large estate on the death of his elder brother. At the time of the present narrative, the family consisted of Harriet the oldest daughter, debased into a fine lady by a dissipated and worldly aunt-Selina, the second, adorned with the most winning graces-Maria, full of arch playfulness and sportive goodness.- Henry, a youth of genius without polish, fromi Oxford-and two younger childrei. Lady Jerningham's aunt, Mrs. Cooper, an old lady possessed of cheerful piety, which had supported her through a stormy and desolatecourse, inspired mingled feelings of love and veneration. Various are the families to whom, as visitors at the happy mansion, we are introduced; but the )rominenIt is a young Caledonian of large fortune; pf rich intellectual endowments and of native grace beyond the reach of art; who arrives with his excellent tutor, at the dying request of his father, with the hopes of meeting with a partner for life. He is first attracted by the blandishments of the eldcst da.%ghter; but he soon breaks the dangerous enchmanhtient and becomes most ten- derly enamored of the second. After an accident which gives a fine opportunity for displaying the sensibility of the lady, and the fortitude of the hero, their hands are united by his reverend tutor. In the midst of the ensuing bliss, intelligence is received that Miss Harriet who has married a dissipated Marquis without the consent of her parents, had left her husband; the trembling father flew to Brightoll in time to save her reputation and honor, and touch her heart with salutary remorse, and she returns home to her rejoicing parents, to be reunited to her husband and to begin the amendment of her character. Mrs. Cooper dies amidst the tender sorrows of the whole family, and full of joyful confidence and holy hope enters triumphant into a nobler scene of existence. With some extracts from her papers, the book closes, which, as the reader may perceive, aims rather at the lively representation of detached incidents, and the expression of good family sentiments than at the intricacy or interest of the main story. It is interspersed with remarks on modern events, authors, and publications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tn an Enchanted Island; or, a Winter's Re- treat in Cyprus. By W. H. Mallock. (Bentley & Son.) In his definition of a perfect traveller Mr. Mallock contemptuously sets aside the professional student, who is " merely a maker of roads for others to travel on." He candidly tells such students, and also the globe-trotter and the specialist, to put his book at the back of the fire; he only wants the attention of " those who can soar into the highest realms of sentiment, those who care for words fragrant with thyme and myrtle," not of those " who seek to throw new light on the relations of Phoenician art to Hellenic," not of those who go " to collect facts with which to discredit the Foreign Office." The true traveller Mr. Mallock defines as one who " is sensitive to all the magic of poetry, but facts and dates, as he moves from one historical place to another, are for him merely so many sticks on which to train the tendrils of his imagination." Mr. Mallock's stick round which he has twined his imaginings was entirely utilitarian. He went to Cyprus to search for a particular kind of green marble, out of which he hoped to reap much profit. He did search for it in a listless way in company with the "shy professor," Mr. Adam; but the glamour of the enchanted island was over him, and the whereabouts of his treasure was as vague to him as one of his own dreams, and his search ended in nought. At Nicosia Mr. Mallock stayed with Col. and Mrs. Falkland Warren. Everything was new to him; he revelled in the enchantment of his surroundings; even the quaint conversation of the half-witted servant Metaphora, who had committed two murders in her youthful days, affords him material for an amusing chapter. One day Mrs. Warren offered to take him to the bazaars. He recoiled from such an expedition, fearing lest his enchantment should be dispelled by Huntley & Palmer's or Singer's advertisements ; but he was " never more mistaken." In these labyrinthine passages he found a gallery of living pictures, and the fashion in which he has transferred them to his pages is decidedly picturesque. On another occasion Mr. Mallock was carried off, very much against his will, by Col. Warren for a walk of four miles to witness excavations conducted by Mr. Adam, in whose tones of " placid academic refinement " we Beena, to recognize those of Mr. Ernest Gardner, who was at that time superintending the work of the Cyprus Exploration Fund not far from Nicosia. " With an unexpressed reluctance" Mr. Mallock set out with the party, eagerly snatching at the excitement afforded him by seeing a leper hospital, and a house in which dwelt ''a mysterious Turkish lady," to alleviate the boredom of this expedition; but when he came to the spot where Mr. Adam and Mr. St. John, alias Mr. Gardner and Mr. Munro, were " peering into a narrow open trench " with certain notes of excitement in their usually placid voices, even Mr. Mallock caught the infection, and felt an ardour of which, with his avowed antipathy to such things, he must have been ashamed. He saw opened before him the tomb of a Phoenician child; he saw a round brown pot of rude workmanship produced, and also some of the child's toys which had there been buried for so many centuries. It was too much for him. " I presently left the group and walked along the brink of the hill, like a dog with a bone, taking this thought with me." Mr. Mallock is at his best when describing mediaeval structures. His chapter on the Abbey of Happy Peace (Bella Pais) is the pleasantest in the book; to him the exploration of this ruin was " surprise on surprise of delicate spiritual beauty." He carries his readers back with him into a lost world; he peoples the walls with the pageants and processions of former days; he revels in every shade of colour, in every line of Gothic tracery. " It all seemed unreal," he writes, " and yet at the same time so real, that as I looked up at the tangled arched roofs, whose ribs sprang from their columns like the curved stamens of flowers, it seemed as if they would compel the life they once sheltered to return to them." There are, as might be expected, many political sallies, showing that, though Mr. Mallock strove to ban all that occasioned objectionable thought, nevertheless the bugbear of Radicalism followed him still. After visiting one of the prisons of Cyprus he reposed in a charming garden, and these were his reflections:? " I thought of our modern Radicals, of our sentimental believers in the natural goodness of man, and of what a lesson those people might learn from Cyprus. Here were no wicked plutocrats, no hereditary aristocracy. The merchant princes and the nobles of the Middle Ages had gone. They had not left even the memory of their names behind, and modern times had produced no class to replace them. The larger part of the population owned the larger part of the soil. They worked by themselves and for themselves. They had no example except their own to corrupt them, and no oppression except that of the necessary tax-gatherer. They lived, in fact, under the Radical's ideal conditions, and yet crimes, which included crimes of the most brutal and degraded character, occurred amongst them with a frequency not to be matched in any country of aristocratic and capitalistic Europe. Surely this in itself is enough to show how false, or at best how insufficient, is the theory that the wickedness of the many is caused by the artificial oppressions of the few." Mr. Mallock in a measure disarms criticism at the outset by not wishing the student to travel with him, but let us hope that he himself will admit that the epithet "cadaverous," as applied to the waves of the British Channel, is curious. They look anything but corpselike to those who embark upon them during a winter's storm. Then let us ask, What reeds are they which murmured, " Midas has no ears"? Has Mr. Mallock substituted the word " no " for the ugly word " ass's " solely for the sake of euphony, in defiance of mythological traditions? Surely, too, his host must have counted on his want of knowledge of modern Greek when he gave him, as au example of phrases used by the peasants of Cyprus " not to be found elsewhere," the adjective voarifMou, or homeward-going, which, as he says, "stands to-day in their dialect as a synonym for * lovely' or' desirable.' " There is not a modern Greek living who, when he hears a spicy story, will not speak of it as votTTtfJLo; and vooraA-yia, or homesickness, is a complaint common to every modern Greek, no matter from where he may come.

A Topographical Dictionary of Great Britain and Ireland, by John Gorton; and the Irish and Welsh Articles by G. N. Wright, M.A. 3 vols. 8vo. THE present is one of the most valuable of the numerous compilations with which the press has of late been so fertile; it contains a mass of in- formation well digested and carefully arranged, of the highest practical utility to a very numerous class of readers ; who from motives of interest or amusement may seek occasion either to correspond with, or travel to any distant part of the British empire. The arrangement is good, the whole of the British islands being described in one alphabet. The distance of each place from the metropolis, as well as from the nearest post town, being given in every instance, with the name and locality in alphabetical order, renders a search for any required town or village the work of a moment, when compared with the time which is often lost in seeking out for the same information by means of a map. The numerous statistical papers which have at different times been printed by the direction of the House of Commons, contain matter of great practical use to the topographer. The Editors of the present work have availed themselves largely of this fertile source of information, and thus have succeeded in embodying in a small compass a quantity of information often sought for with difficulty, and not easily obtained. A compact notice of each place, with an account of its antiquities and other matters for which it is memorable, with a brief abstract of its history, is given in every instance where it is attainable, and these particulars are in some instances distinguished for their accuracy. In a work of this nature it might be expected a few errors would necessarily creep in, in spite of the exertions of the most vigilant author, but we regret to have discovered several errors and inaccuracies which must have arisen in some degree from a want of care, and as it is only possible to speak from local knowledge, we shall notice some points in those places with which we are best acquainted: St. Alban's. The reader is informed that, " The abbey church is constructed of Roman brick, to which age has given the appearance of stone." This assertion, which has originated from a quantity of such bricks appearing in parts of the structure, particularly the Tower, becomes very extravagant when applied to the whole edifice. Ashby-de-la-Zouche is not noticed as a watering-place, although it has now a handsome pump-room, baths, and theatre. All that is said connected with this subject is, " lt likewise contains a mineral spring, called Griffydam;" but Griffydam is the name of a hamlet in the parish of Worthington, three miles north-west from Ashby; whereas the Moira Baths, whence the water used at Ashby is derived, are about the same distance in the opposite direction. The hamlet of Boothorpe should be Borthorpe. Barn Elms. " The manor-house has been much enlarged and modernized by Sir Richard Colt Hoare, to whose family it still belongs." This is a misquotation from Lysons, who states that the house was " modernized " more than fifty years ago, in the year 1771, hy the late Sir Richard Hoare, Bart. Sir Richard Colt Hoare never possessed the estate, and it has for many years ceased to belong to the family. The little village of Bedfont in Middlesex, we are told, " is chiefly remarkable for its ruins." The verdant peacocks over the church gate were the only remarkable objects which occurred to our attention. The alleged ruins really escaped our notice. Canterbury Cathedral. " The altar-piece was designed by Sir James Burroughs; it is in the Corinthian order, and very lofty, with a handsome pediment supported on fluted columns." Removed in 1825, and in its place is a stone screen of open work in the pointed style of architecture, built with Caen stone from St. Augustine's monastery. Chelsea is not " an extensive parish" as far as respects the number of acres, for it is not one-third so large as either Kensington or Fulham, lt may be justly termed a very populous and opulent parish; or more properly, as divided by a recent Act of parliament, it is two parishes; of which the district nearest tile metropolis is named Upper Chelsea. The church of this parish is situated at the south end of Sloane-street, and dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Its Rector, the Rev. H. Blunt, is one of the most popular preachers now in the metropolis. This church we presume was overlooked by Mr. Gorton, as the single "district church" he mentions must be the magnificent building which is more generally known, and which has now become the parish church of St. Luke's, whilst the old church is degraded into a chapel of ease. Sir Thomas More's chapel is on the south, not at the "east end" of the old church; and his monument is not in the chapel, but in the chancel. If personal inquiries were made any where, they might fairly be expected with respect to a national establishment like Chelsea Hospital. We are sorry, however, to perceive several inaccuracies. The hospital was finished in 1690, not 1692; its shape is not a parallelogram. The present Infirmary is not in one of the large squares, but a new building erected by Sir John Soane on the site of a house belonging to Lord Yarborough. The statistics given of the hospital are of very old date. The number of in-door pensioners is 539, not 336; and their allowance is not uniformly "eight-pence a week," but ranges from that sum to 3*. 6d.; the allowance to the outpensioners ranges from " five pence " to 3s.; they have now not a half-year's pension in advance, but only a quarter's ; this alteration took place in 1815. They amount to 75,000 instead of 22,000 men. These are only a few of the points in which this account is erroneous or defective, for the emendation of which we refer to the last edition of Mr. Faulkner's History of Chelsea. The Royal Military Asylum is in no respect " connected " with the Hospital, unless by vicinity; and there are no waterworks in the parish, since the " Chelsea Waterworks" are in the parish of St. George, Hanover-square. Cheltenham. The description of this place appears to have been taken from a guide-book at least twenty years old. It is notorious that the town no longer consists of only " one main street," but that now it is as wide as it is long. The Old Well was inclosed in 1718, not 1761. lt will hardly be credited by those acquainted with Cheltenham, that the old pump-room alone is noticed, and none of the magnificent rivals which have arisen within the last thirty years in such rapid succession. There are four new episcopal churches, but only two are mentioned. The monastery, said to have existed at Cheltenham in 803, is a pure fiction. Southam House is no longer the property of Thomas Baghott (misprinted Bagshott) de la Bere, Esq. who died in 1821; it has been sold by his heirs to Lord Ellenborough, who has made very extensive repairs. but with strict attention to the ancient style of this venerable building (a view of which was published in our vol. xciv. ii. p. 393). During these repairs a discovery has been made which contradicts parts of the notice given by Leland of Southam, whilst it confirms the remainder. He says, " Here dwellithe Sir John Hodleston, and hath builded a pretty mannour place. He bought the land of one Goodman." Now, in the spandrils of the principal door of the house, under the porch, were lately discovered, on clearing away some plaister, the initials of Goodman, T. G. and his crest, a unicorn's head erased ; and on au old oaken press up stairs (since taken by Lord Ellenborough for a screen in the hall) was the same crest; proving that Goodman himself not only built the " pretty mannour place," but furnished it. Egham. "The church is an ancient building with a south aile, and a square western tower crowned with a slender wooden spire." This church was demolished so long ago as 1817, the present edifice being a large structure of Grecian architecture. A view of the old church, drawn and etched by J. C. Buckler, Esq. is given in our Magazine, voL lxxxviii. i. 577. At Fulham the eight monuments of the Bishops of London are described as being in the church instead of the church-yard. There are tablets to Bishops Gibson and Porteus in the church; but the tombs of Bishops Compton, Robinson, Gibson, Sherlock, Hayter, Terrick, Lowth, and Randolph, are in the church-yard*. The church (except the tower) is not built of stone, but of a mixture of flint and brick. The present Vicar, the Rev. W. Wood, having purchased the sinecure rectory, the livings may now be considered as one. Hinckley. The vicarage is not in the archdeaconry of Sudbury, but of Leicester; and in the diocese of Lincoln, not Norwich. The ancient town hall is no longer " very curious," having been re-placed in 1802. There is no " river." Kensington is described in Domesday-book as Chenesitun, not Chenisistun. There is no other proprietory episcopal chapel besides that at Bays* The tomb of Porteus, at Sundridge in Kent, was engraved in cur vol. xciv. ii. p. 577. water. There is a reservoir for the West Middlesex Water company at Kensington Gravel-pits; but their " Works" are by the river side at Hammersmith. The state apartments of Kensington-palace consist of fifteen rooms. It is correct that they are not inhabited (and they may be seen any day in the week), but it might have been noticed. The Duchess of Kent resides in the first story underneath the state rooms; all this part of the Palace has been nearly new built during the residence of the late Duke of Kent. The Duke of Sussex resides in the south-west wing of the Palace, and has just completed a new- library of extensive proportions. A catalogue of his collection of books has been published by his librarian Mr. Pettigrew. Hampstead. In the account of the resort to the mineral water at the beginning of the last century, the handsome pump-room in the Well-walk is not noticed, although it is still existing, converted into an episcopal chapel. The painted-glass has long been removed from the Chicken House; it represented indubitable portraits of James the First and the Marquis of Buckingham, bearing their names ; but it has been shown in Mr. Nichols's " Progresses " of that monarch, that it came originally from Wroxton in Oxfordshire. The hunting it recorded was therefore far from Hampstead; and the house being " said to have been a hunting seat belonging to James II." is altogether a confusion of names and dates. Mitcham. " The church is an ancient structure." It was entirely rebuilt in 1821 with the exception of the tower. A full description of the new church is given in our Magazine, vol. xci. ii. p. 17; and a view of the old one in October 1800, plate iii. p. 945. Plymouth. The two episcopal chapels are not noticed. Peterborough. The extensive repairs of the cathedral have been entirely overlooked. Rochester. The cathedral is said to possess a central tower and spire; the latter was removed and a new square tower with pinnacles built circa 1S26, at which time considerable renovations took place under the direction of. Mr. Cottingham, all of which are left without notice. As the work was brought out in numbers, it has necessarily occupied a considerable time in publication, in consequence of which the population, as given with each article, is taken from the census of 1821; but the last population returns are added in a condensed form, and this portion of the volume, though forming but a small part, is in itself a very valuable document. At the same time, as the periodical mode of publication allowed of the correction of errors and the introduction of omissions, we are rather surprised at the collection we have made, and which, on account of the general utility of the work, we could have wished had not been found in its pages. The preface, though short, contains some useful hints on the etymology of various places. The great roads branching from the metropolis are measured from various situations; and it is much to be regretted that some standard has not been chosen as a central situation to which the distances on every main road should be made to refer. In the present state of the roads it may not be uninteresting to our readers to know the many stations which are now used for this purpose. 1. The Kent roads from the Surrey side of London Bridge. 2. The Portsmouth road, and tbe branches from it, from the same standard. 3. The Isle of Wight roads are measured from Cowes, such distance being added to the distance of Cowes from London by way of Portsmouth. 4. The Croydon, Reigate, Brighton, and Epsom roads are measured from the Surrey side of Westminster Bridge. 5. The Southampton, Dorsetshire, Devonshire, Cornwall, WUtshire, Somersetshire, and all the other roads in the south west of the kingdom, are measured from Hyde Park corner. 6. The Uxbridge, Edgware, Birmingham, Shrewsbury, and most of the roads to the north western parts of the kingdom, are measured from Tyburn turnpike. 7. The Barnet, and great northern roads, and some of the roads in the north western part of the kingdom, are measured from the spot where Hick's Hall formerly stood; a stone, in front of one of the houses at the end of St John'slane, St. John-street, West Smithfield, pointing out the spot. 8. The Ware and Huntingdon roads are measured from St. Leonard's Church, Shorediteh. 9. The Essex roads arc measured from the Church of St. Mary, Whitechapel. Thc series of maps executed by Syd - ney Hall, are honourable to his talent; the various roads are distinctly traced, and though each county is contained in a quarto sheet, the numerous towns and villages are plainly and totally indicated *. Upon the whole, this work is creditable to the Editors, and we hope will meet with that patronage which its practical utility so well entitles it to receive.

BOUNDARIES OF EMPIRES: COLONISATION. The Natural Boundaries of Empires; and a New View of Colonisation. By John Finch, Esq. Pp. 279. Longmans. THIS little book has been published some time, and has not, we think, attracted the notice it deserves -we (Lit. Ouzz.) being among the defaulters. But since we hive recently shewn how the small Wren is somehow or other recognised as a bird-king, s0 may we emerge this little book from under the covering of its larger contemporaries, and give it some of that prominency we think due to it. The natural boundaries of empires: what are they ? What the folly or ambition of men are apt to disregard and despise. France used to say the Rhine, as Rome did the Rubicon; and yet neither could be satisfied with all that lay within their imagined line. Beyond, there were other worlds to conquer; ay, and to weep like Alexander when there were no more. And in our own very present hour a yet more insatiable thirst for dominion has been proclaimed: We will have the entire new world, the whole continent of America from Terra del Fuego to Behring's Straits, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, says MTr. President Polk (what a short insignificant kind of name for so vast a sway), and no European powcr shall dare to interfere with us in this " snug little island." Here there can be no question of the leading points started by our author. It matters not that river boundaries are demonstrated to be disadvantageous, and mountain ranges or deserts the reverse: they are, as 'Mathews used to sing, "All the same to General .ackson; For General Jackson is the boy." Speaking of forests, the author says: "'The empire of Zunder Bund in India is protected by an extensive forest, inhabited by a war like race, who fight with such desperate valour that they have never been subdued. At the sight of these terrific warriors, the timid Hindoo utters a cry of despair, and even the Englishman runs away. They might easily take possession of the whole country; but being fond of a country life, they disdain to confine themselves in villages or towns. From the period of their earliest traditional history, they have preserved th ir wild independence under a republican form of government. Tllhere no individual lords it over his fellows ; for they are too proud to bend and bow, and too magnanimous and too fond of liberty to set any one in authority over them. There no monarch isallowed to levy heavy contributions on his subjects, and no president interposes his veto on the acts of their legislative assemblies. While the historian praises their unconquerable spirit, which renders them a model to all nations, their enemies, unable to con. quer, have recourse to a very common expedient, -they calumniate, and accuse them of making predatory expeditions over the neighbouring territory, and even denounce them as cannibals. As these brave people cannot speak the English lan. guage, at least not sufficiently well to be understood, we will undertake their defence. To the first accusation we reply, that it is an act of retributive justice. They plunder alike the Tartar, the Mongol, the Persian, the Briton, the Russian, who, in rapid succession, conquer Hindoostan, and govern that truly unfortunate people. And as to their being cannibals, they merely kill and eat th; enemies I" This statement is new to us; and so we thit will the following information be to most of Ou readers. The author is inquiring what the hums5 race are, and proceeds to reply: " In the first place, in respect to their for which has some relation to tile subject, althoug may appear a distant one; and in the next, wit respect to their disposition or character, on which in point of fact, governments depend for theirde velopment. Do we find perfection of form or C character in any member of the human race wil whom we have ever been acquainted ? A Prench author has very truly observed, that we are all sur. rounded by merely halves atadi quarters of men, With reverence be it spoken, the reason fhy angel, are not permitted to visit the earth, except at very distant intervals, is because they would be starte at as curiosities; and yet the accounts which are given to us of angelic natures is, that they nserely exhibit all the good qualities of which man is Ca. pable, wrought to the highest degree of intensjiy, Who ever saw perfection in the human figure? and what lumps of men we see around us, and what variety ! Why is it that the statues of the Apollo di Belvidere and the Venus de' Medici always ex. cite in us such emotions of pleasure and delighii If we met Apollos walking in the street, ani t Venuses were our companions every momentofour leisure hours, we should pass by the statues with. out observation. It is because they are vervinau . tiful, anad difier from anything we sea in conainon life, that they attract our notice. We must ac. knowledge that the kind Father of tile human race has been more bountiful in conferring grace, beauty, and elegance, on the female portion of it, than on those of the opposite sex. We have seen several who would compare very favourably with the Alediccan Goddess; but still the proportion of thosa who are beautiful, even among females, is small." With this proportion, however, we must be coo. tent, till the angel visits are not so few and far be. tween. Now for the writer's ideas upon govern. ments: " Monarchy, especially hereditary monarchy, is expensive ; it is so of necessity. All people, all nations, connect ideas of dignity with expense and luxury. It is a false association ot' ideas, but so general, that it is adopted by every nation. Itii therefore necessary that the monarch presiding over the destinies of a nation should excel all his subjects in luxury and expense, as much as he ex. ceeds them in power. There have been but two monarchs since the commencement of time who were maintained at a very trifling cost to their subjects; and the nations over whom they ruled were so exasperated against them on that account, that they put one to death, and were constantly conspiring against the other. The first was the beau. tiful white ox that formerly reigned in Egypt, and of whom an account is given in the page of Hero. dotus. He was one of the best monarchs the world ever saw; lie never engaged in bloody wars to gra. tify an unreasonable ambition, or to extend his dominion; and while he chewed the cud, his subjects were peaceful and happy. It was under his reign that some of those beautiful temples were built, which have attested to a later age the power and magnificence of ancient Egypt, and which the modern degenerate nations of Europe make not even an attempt to imitate. A plentiful supply of grass, with a little corn and pure water, were all that he required ; but at length lois subjects were so indignant against him, because he would not spend more money, that they rose in rebellion, effected a revolution, and cruelly put him to death. The other monarch, who neat ly sullered the same fate, was Don Francia, who ruled over the destinies of Paraguayfor nearly thirty years. He was possessed of the mhost economical habits, and was supported at the least expenditure to his subjects of any monarch that ever existed. A cup of mate in the morning, a sallI5 pce of meat or salt fish for his dinner, and a few cigars, that he might pass his evenings happily, were the whole of his personal expenditure; and forpurposes of splendour and the pomp of royalty, the whole of his attendants were comprised in an ancient fern le slave. Ilis reign was the most be. nefici3l the Paraguans had ever witnessed; for he kept them at peace, while all the neighbouring states were involved in continual revolutions and wars. In fact, he was a monarch of extraordinary abilil)y but his subjects, disliking his economy, were constantly conspiring against him, and lie was compelled occasionally to put a few of them in prison, to prevent their succeeding in designs against his person. * 0 0 "iIn every country man bows submissively to hose in authority over him. For myself, when I am in any of the parks or public places where our gracious sovereign is expected, my hat of its own accord raises itself instinctively from my head, and I stand uncovered to await our sovereign's approach. A proper degree of homage and respect Is certainly due to the sovereign who presides over the destinies of a great nation. The wonder is, tbht, with so much adulation paid tothem, monarchs do not forget they are human, and consider themselves as superior beings. The fact is, that the svrtebrce of the human race are so constituted, that it is impossible for man to remain upright in the presence of those who are in possession of power. A good deal of this adulation also arises from the asseciation of ideag, as the multitude invariably follow the cisteons which they see around them. * * *'there is a perpetual oscillation in all governments. Those which are free to-day, become despotic to-morrow: and those which are the seats of tyranny now, gradually acquire liberty. Never is a nation so happy as to be always free, nor so miserable as to be always enslaved. Liberty is like the sun, which God in his beneficence allows to shine sometimes on one portion of the human race and sometimes upon another. Although it is certainly true, that, at various periods in the history of the world, legislators have arisen who have possessed such a superior force of intellect that they have stamped a peculiar character and a peculiar legislation upon the ever, varying materials called a nation, which stamp has continued for many centuries ; but even this at length wears out and changes. Pile up the clouds of heaven in a heap, and bid them retain a particular shape,then %ou may attempt to restrain nations to one particular forna of civil or uncivil polity. In the wars that arise between monarchies and republics, the latter have usually the advantage; for kings ileep, but republicans never. That which is called sheep in a republic is only a minor degree of excitement, except among the farmers, whose happy life and useful occupation procure them tranquil sleep and pleasing dreams. And when is man so happy as when lie is asleep and has a pleasant dream? for lie then enjoys all the various pleasures of existence, without the slightest fatigue. The mostsplendid chariot that we ever saw was one in which we rode in a dream; the most magnificent banquet of which we ever partook was one to which Wewere invited in a dream ; and Julia never looked shbeautiful, and never smiled so sweetly, as when we spoke to her in a dream. But a conquest over kings introduces kings to a republic, not merely those who are captured on their thrones, or taken prisoners in battle; for the pride of success and the wealth that is seized introduce that state of feeling which cannot be gratified without monarchal go. vernment. Some writers have amused the imnaginatinas of their readers by adopting an opinion that the human race are gradually advancing in a career Of happiness, and that political affairs partake of t general progress. Let us now examine this question, and endeavour to ascertain whether it is founded n truth. The fact appears to be, that all governments are founded more on the passions of a than on his reasoning faculties; and hence has eisen the stability and the sameness of go- vernments in all ages and in all times. Human nature is the same now that it was thousands of years ago. Is the child that is born to-day different from the child that was born yesterday ? is it provided with six legs instead of two ? or is it born with two hands upon each arm, or furnished with four faces, so as to be able to look to the four (luarters of the compass at the same time ? And is not the infant fond of the nourishment of its mother's breast? and when it grows up, is it not fond of rolling on tire grass, t-nd of gathering daisies and cowslips? and is it not the supreme delight of children to walk with bare feet, in the heat of summer, in a small puddle of water? It is like making a voyage of discovery, and exploring an unknown world ; for who knows what dreadful chasms may be concealed beneath the surface of the water? and are not the children of the rich discontented and unhappy, b'causC they are never allowed to participate in this amusement ? And so the men and women of the present day arc similar to those of a thousand years ago, both in their individual and their political capacity: they are neither much better nor much worse. Has civilisation advanced ? Let us first agree what is the meaning of the term. It appears to us that civilisation does not consist in a small proportion of the human race riding in carriages, and the rest groaning in misery; it does not consist in the mnere conventional forms of fashionable life-in eating fish with a silver fork, or drinking a particular kind of wine, or in having the coat made in a peculiar fashion: these are not those things whuich constitute civilisation. If we were asked our opinion, we should say, that it consisted in a majority of a nation passing throulgh life in a pleasing and happy manner. If tire account given by Captain Hall of the natives of the Loochoo Islands is correct, and there seems no reason to doubt it, we should be disposed to consider those islanders as more civilised than the people of Britain. 'They never go to war, and are always happy. Tire civilisatton of a country depends in a great degree on the comfort anrd enjoyment of the mass of the population; but where, as in England, they groan beneath a weight of taxation caused by the corrotant wars in which they engage, that is impossible. Ask a hyana, when it is faruished, to stand on points of ceremony; or a wolf, when it is hungry, to make a profound bow to the lamb which it is going to tlevour,-then expect civilisation from a starving population." From the foregoing extracts, we think it will be admitted that this is rather a curious volume, with a good deal of originality about it. The writer's view of the immense boundaries of tire British empire, in. cluding all its colonies and foreign settlements, assumes the poetic form, and leads him to his grand panacea for all social evils, viz. free colonies. The process, if not tire reasoning, is amnusirrg. " We have conquered the lion of Africa. We have saddled the elephant of India. Tbre crocodile of Berbice crouches beneath our sway. T're tiger of Bengal alone stands at bay. " Song. To the Tiger of India. Tiger! I adore thee, For valour in the tight, Skin of matchless beauty, And eyes so keen and bright. Your empire, the jungle, You guard with jearous care; Your foes, though numeroul Inspire no cowvard fear. The Turk comes with sabre, The Russ like savage bear, Briton with his musket, The Ilindoo with his spear. You breakfast on a Turk, You sandwich on a Jew, Dine upon Englishman, And sup on the llindoo. Feasting on dainty fare, Your dreams are calm and light; Awake, then, 'tis morning, And shew your eyes so bright. d" All the nations of the earth find that we have either conquered some of their colonies or retain some of their subjects under our dominion. The Negro is not so black but that we govern him. We retain the Hottentot tribes in subjection, in order that they may produce a second Venus for our admiration. 1hle Ceylonese endeavours in vain to conceal himself in his jungle, for lie finds himself subject to our laws. The Canadian finds the frost and snow of his climate no bar to our occupation of his strongest fortress. The Dutchman flies in vain to the interior desert of Africa to escape the meteor flag of England; lie is pursued, and finds that, however far lie may travel, lie cannot escape from Biritish jurisdiction. The Spaniard is not so proud but we keep him in subjection. The Fren rchman finds his colonies torn from his grasp, and in the possession of his ancient foe. Even our old Saxon countrymen, the Germans, find us pouncing on their territory, and capturing the little island of Heligoland; but this is only a trifling revenge for the incursions of llengist and his coxnpantons in arms. The Hindoo, glorying in his sunny clime, has, alas ! no city left which lie can call his own ; and the patient Chinainan beholds with afiright the mark ot an English foot upon the territory of the Celestial Empire. The Nepaulese mourns on his mountain, the Burmese mourns on his plain, the Cafi're laments by his fountain, the Arab laments for Eden. The men of England have conquered a thousand tribes. A thousand expeditions have left our shore in search of foreign conquest, and have returned victorious. A thousand rivers are tributary to us, and the waves of every oceati have seen our victorious flag. * * * " When a crocodile leaves his native stream to take a walk in the country and breathe a little fresh air, lhe suddenly finds an Englishman astride upon his back, who compels him to take a gallop along the sand before lie allows him to return to his despairing little ones at home, who shed tears of joy at his safe return." Finally, upon these and other data, lie exclaims: " Statesmen of Britain!i expand your ideas, enlarge the boundaries of your hearts, ofyour sympathies, of your minds: instead of founding these miserable colonies, placing your governors over. them, and your ships cruising near to keep them in subjection, proclaim their liberty. Found empires instead ot colonies. Proclaim Australia free, or establish there eight einpires,-Sydney should be capital of the first; Port Philip ot the second; South Australia the third; the fourth should comprise the territory between South Atistralia and Swan river; the fifth, Western Australia; and divide the northern c6ast into three distinct states, by geographical lines, and determine by an exact frontier the distinction between them and the older settlements. Withdraw all governors and troops, and all official people of every sort and degree, and proclaim to the people of England that whoever goes to Australia may possess a farm of one hundred acres, that they may choose their own governors, make their own laws, choose their own custom-house officers. In a single year one hundred thousand Britons would flock there; the population of Australia would be doubleu in a single year; they would plough the land; they would build houses they would lay the foundation of towns, of cities, of villages. The exportation of British manufactures would be doubled to Australia in a single year; in two years the population would be trebled, in four years it would b, quadrupled. We talk and admire about the trade to China, but why not make a, British China in Australia ? it can be done, and only can be done bygiving them perfect liberty; the other experiment has been tried for fifty-six years, and see the remilt. But with freedom, unnumbered blessings would be conferred on the British islands: one hundred thousand emigrants leaving her shore annually would leave better room for the remaining inhabitants: the Suffolk peasant, who is now savagely employed in burning farmers' ricks, would then, in consequence of so many labourers being taken away, receive good pay for his labour; the condition of every pezant and of every artisan throughout England would be improved. New Sheffields, and Manchesters, and Birminghams, must be built, to answer the demand which the inhabitants of Australia alone would require; the port of London would be nearly blocked up by vessels coming from the Australian ports. A youth of twenty years of age, now living in England, might live to see an empire containing twenty millions of human beings living free and happy in Australia, blessing the land which gave them birth, and calling down blessings on the heads of those statesmen whose coun cils had contributed to their happiness. On every hundred miles of the sea-coast there would be a city, and in every twenty miles a large town. The Australian ships would trade with the numerous islands in the Pacific, and thty would capture almost every whale in the Southern Ocean; and all their wealth, all their produce, all their exchangeable value of every kind, would be poured into Britain in exchange for her manufactures. In a new country, under laws of their own making, labour is wealth; the various states would, therefore, compete with each other in drawing labourers and their families from England. In the empire of Victoria, to be founded on the northern coast, they would pay half the expense of emigration. In Western Australia they would probably defray onethird the expense; and at Sydney they would have a large ox always roasting on the shore in order to attract British emigrants to that quarter ; the only contest between them would be which should secure the larger number. Would not this be better thin shutting up the poor people in union-houses, and compelling them to fire stacks for want of better employment ?"

I Charlie Thorniill; or, The Dunce of the Family. By Charles Clarke. In Three Volumes. Chapman and Hall.
Among the new race of novel-writers none gives promine of greater excellence than Mr Charles Clarke. His Charlip Thornhill, published some eighteen or twenty months ago, showed great power of writing, freshness of thought, and purity of purpose.  He is 'clever at the building up of a plot; but he knows how to build it up of every-day materials, and to avoid the exaggerations and improbabilities thought necessary to the interest of the newest sort of popular novels Among the least unworthy of that sort are John Marckmont's Legacy ad The DoCr's Wife, but between them and such novels - Which iw the Winer ? and Charlie ThonhiU there is a much difference as between spurious coinag, and good gold. Charlie ThornhiU is the history of a dunce. Poor Charlie cannot get on at school. He is a capital playfellow, the best runner, boxer, swimmer, or rider of the lot; but the little boys pas him by in school-time, and when he leaves, 'it is only because he is too big to stay. But there is something better than scholarship in him. He thinks and acts throughout in the spirit of a gentleman. Whya he beeosm I a fourthafom boy be will not diobey any rule of di uhool beue fourth-form boys me not ged, but left to aot as their own honesty dictate When his elde brother Tom begins to waste his fortune in play and horberacing he holds aloof, obeying the rule of honour set up by his own concience, though not at all observed in the world he moves in. When it proves that the smaller fortune assigned to him hu, by his father's carelessness, fallen into other hands, he sets himself bravely to fight his own way in the world, and at last shows that a prosperous banker, albeit "the dunce of the family," can be as thorough a gentleman as one who follows the fashion of his anoestors in the hunting field, and surpasses them on the race course. That hunting and racing of the old sort are the manliest of English sports, but that Newmarket and Goodwood are ceasing to be fit resorts for gentlemen, unless they go as mere lookers-on, and that betting and playing as businesses are altogether blackguardly, are the wholesome truths that Mr Clarke is most fond of enforcing. No novelist is more at home in describing a hunt-breakfast or a steeple-chase, and no one knows better where to draw the line between honourable and dishonourable sport. We have rarely seen more piquant or accurate descriptions of country-house life, or the holiday keeping of " good "society."

Clarke, Charles
-------------------------------------------------------------
Wkich is the Winner ? or, The First Gentleman of his Family. By Charles Clarke. In Three Volumes. Chapman and Hall. And now Which is the Winner ? comes to prove that, though Mr Clarke still limits himself to the description of those parts of English life in which he is most at home, there is no monotony in his treatment of it, and only so much sameness as is necessary in the steady setting forth of honour and honesty, courtesy and pluck, as essential to the character of a true gentleman. Mr ;.Clarke writes always as a man of education and refinei'ment. His dialogue is racy and natural; his narrative is easy and lifelike. A good moral pervades all he writes; but he has the wit to keep it in the background. Which is the Winner? is a more finished novel than Charlie Tlwrnlhil. Concerned chiefly with the events of a year or two, it has to do with the history of two families through three generations. An old Sir Reginald Carrington had mortgaged his Sommerton estate, the bulk of his property, to Henry Bradfield, a vulgar and bad man, who had grown rich by help of mines and manufactures. The mortgage was redeemed, but old Bradfield managed to rob Sir Reginald of the document containing the release, and thereby frightened him to death. Therefore Sommerton descends to Abel Bradfield, and he does not know of his father's fraud till long-growing hatred of Sir Michael Carrington, the poor but haughty country gentleman, heir to Sir Reginald, makes him willing to maintain his wrongful possession as a way of revenge against his enemy. As soon as he discovers the state of affairs he hunts for the document hidden long ago by his father, intending to destroy it, and with it all proof of the fraud. But it falls by accident into the hands of his high-principled son Lawrence, and when that son declares his determination to restore their property to the Carringtons, the elder Bradfield storms himself into an apoplexy, and so dies. Thereupon old wrongs are done away with and old jealousies are removed, with the help of some love-making among the younger branches of the family. The secrets of this love-making ought not to be told. Lawrence Bradfield falls in love with Evelyn Carrington, and his sister Ellen has for one of her admirers Stafford Carrington, Evelyn's sister. Besides these there is a Lord Mentmore, a dummy nobleman, who comes to pay court to each of the young ladies in turn, and the reader's puzzle, not a very difficult one, is to find out, three gentlemen being devoted to two ladies, " which is the winner." This is a specimen in little of the way in which Mr Clarke can I tell a love-story. It is told by Miss Phillis Carrington, an old woman of eighty, to whom her grand niece Evelyn goes for counsel when, her heart being given to a plebeian,. her father wishes her to marry a duke: " My love, come and sit upon this footstool, and put your head in my lap; I'll tell you a story." There was something very beautiful in this sympathy between youth and age. The thin, wrinkled face of dear Aunt Philly, bending over the lovely girl, whose eyes had filled with bashful tear, and which dared not look up to the placo whence she expected aid. Aunt Philly began in a low voice, and it was wonderful how sweet it bad become, and how memory softened the tones which betokened too often hardness and disappointment. "I was not always what I am now, my child, I am told that I was not ugly nor deformed. I think that is very likely true. I saw a great deal of society, and your great grandfather was proud of me, and made me his companion. In fact, he liked me better than my brothers, whose occupations took them from home. Among other things he wanted me to make a great match; I knew this, and tried hard to please him; but the right people would not propose. I oouldn't help that, you know, Evelyn; none of us can. I could no more fall in love with the men who made love to me than you can with Splinterbars. It's a great pity, for he has excellent blood in his veins." "But I will try, dear Aunt Philly, if you particularly wish it." "It's not necessary, my dear. Amongst the men who came to my father's house then, was a captain in the navy, of the name of Gray, he was a distinguished officer, when there were more of them than now: but he was of the-' aucune famille' a he himself acknIowledged; and in our house it required a great deal of moral courage to acknowledge that. I knew bow it would grieve my father if such a thig were contemplated as an engagement between Captain G(y and myself; you se, it was not necessar to marry any one whom I did not love even to please my father; but I refused the man I did love, and who loved me. I bore it like an Indian at the stake, or rather like a shipwrecked sailor in sight of lad, who refuses to be saved for the credit of his cloth. I refused poor Charley," the old lady's eyes dropped all she had left of teas, "and I never told my father, nor did he ever suspect that I had had an opportunity of doing so. I how it is a noble nature that learns to bear well, without crying out. I tried it, and failed. I strove, if not for victory, for patient endurance. But it was too much for me. I endured torture upon torture; and all the diversions of my age, and the scenes through which I was hurried, served to increase my pain. I do't look it now, der, do I ? It's almost laughable to hear an old woman talk in thi way; and then the dear old lady put her shrivelled hand over the smooth brown hair and feverish cheek of her niece. " My health suffered, and at lst my father, I forget how, detected my secret. Al was to go welL Had I only mentioned it before I said he. But I know better, though be believed what he sid to be true.

B But Mr Clarke mever forgets, at the proper times, to mix a sharp satire and wise reproof with the playful talk or rapid e' incident of his novel. Here, for instance, is a ehance C paragraph, telling of the justice administered by Sir hi Michael Carrington and his brother magistrates: | is fMiend Derby was there, a pluralist, the editor of the great 01 Tory paper of the county, the Revoker; his enemy, Abel Brad. field, was there, who was only so far right in his views that he con- si aradisted the decisions of the other two, who were as often wrong. ol When he VW Wrong, the othen were right. They balanced accounts in this manner, until the Sazonby beach had become a paragon of w jiut judgment in the neighbourhood. 8 They let off an outrageous poacher, because Sir Michael ws too r woud to oontest the point with Bradfield.

" Independently," says Mr. Warner, " of my wish to pay a tribute of respect to the memory of an illustrious and wellknown divine, an excellent man, and a most sincere Christian, from whose convsation I derived much delight, instruction, and, I trust, improvement; I conceived, that the Sketch would serve as a sort of practical comment upon the letter, by manifesting, that the deepest religious impressions, and the most uniform holiness of life, are by no means ineompatible with high intellectual accomplisbments, elegant literary attainments, a coospicuous amenity of manners, and a delightful cheerfulness of disposition ; and that the natural tendency of rational and Scriptural views of our most holy faith is, to reflne the mind, meliorate and gladden the heart, and perfect the general character. Dr. Maclaine, indeed, was a bright example of the truth of this assertion. Wise, without austerity; deeply learned, without arrogance; sincerely pious, without ostentation; of refined wit, untinctured with severity; of polished manners, unsophisticated by affectation; of warm benevolence and lively sensibility, but cool in judgment, and unbending in principle; he lived much in the world, without being injured by its vices, or infected with its follies; and confuted, by a visible proof, the unsoundness of that paradox of the ingenious author, against whom he exercised his pen (Soame Jenyns), that ' the Religion of JESUS CHRIST cannot go hand in hand with secular business, worldly intercourse, and rational social enjoyment.' " Leaving, therefore, his Lordship or Gloucester and the Rector of Great Chalfield to settle their differences as amicably as may be; we shall transfer into another department of our Magazine some anecdotes of our old Aequaintance Dr. Maclaine.

Ballant>/nc's Novelist's Library. Vols. 1, 2, and 3. Royal Svo. Edin* burgh, 1821. So many editions of the British novelists have alreadyappcurcd,thatit seemed almost difficult any longer to present them under a new aspect; this, however, has been done by Mr. Ballantyne, an enterprising bookseller of Edinburgh, who has elied since they were commenced. The 4 Novelist's Library' is edited by Sir Walter Scott, that extraordinary genius,? 4-whose prolific quill Can every month, with case, a volume fill.1 The three volumes that have already been published, contain the works of Fielding and of Smollet, including* by the former, Joseph Andrews, Tom Jone?, Amelia, and Jonathan Wild, which till the first volume. The second and third are devoted to Smollet, and contain Roderick Random, Peregrine Pickle, Humphrey Clinker, Count Fathom, Sir Launrelot Greaves, and the translation of Don Quixote. Tiie labours of the present very able editor, which add an increased value and interest even to works so decidedly popular, consist of biographical notices tr and critical "-remarks; the former are brief anecdotal sketches of some of the most prominent features, or most strikingly illustrative of the characters of the individuals. Of the qualifications ofthe authoiLof the Scottish novels, as a critic on tiox'el writing, no person will doubt; xve shall, therefore, leave him in both cases to speak for himself. From the prefatory memoir to Fieldin xve quote the folloxviug extracts :? < Fielding, the first of British novelists, for sucli he may surely he termed, has thus added his name to that of Le Sage and others, xvho, eminent for fictitious narration, have either altogether failed in their dramatic attempts, or at lean have fallen far short of that degree of excellence xvhich might have been previously augured of them. It is hard to fix upon any plausible reason for a failure, xvhich has occured in too many instances to he the operation of mere chance, especialiv since, a priori, one xvould think the same talents necessarv for hoth xvalks of Utera- ture. Force of character, strength of expression, felicity of contrast and situation, a well-constructed plot, iv which the elevelopement is at once natural and unexpected, and where the interest is krui uniformly alive, till summed up by the catastrophe,?all these are requisites as essential to the labour ofthe novelist, as to that ofthe dramatist, anel, indeeel, appear to _1.1 i!.,.. ~ C j.\.Iii* ~_ trical success, as ansuisr laovi me careless haste with which he huddled up his dvvvatic compositions; it being no uncommon tiling with him to finish an act or two in a morning, anel to write out whole scenes upon the paper in which his favourite tobacco had been wrapped uv. Neuliirenre of tliis kind will no doubt "ive rise to qreat inequalities in the productions of an author so careless of his reputation, but will scarcely account for an attribute something like chillness, which pervades Fielding's plavs, and which is rarely lound in those works which a mae. of genius throws olf ' at a heat/to use Dryden's expression, in prodigal self-reliance on his internal re-ourccs. Neither are v. e at all disposed to believe, that an author, so careless as Fielding, took much in ore pains in labouring his novels, than ni composing his plays; and we are, therefore, compelled to *e'jk some oilier and more general rea-on for the infiviorilv ot the latter. rriiis may, perhaps, be found in the nature of t!ve>e two studies, which, intimately connected aa they seem to be, are yet naturally distinct in some very essential particulars; so much so as to vindicate tbe general opinion, thal he, who applies himself with eminent ^ucceos to the one, becomes, in some degree, unqualified for the other, liko the arti an, *ho, .by a pavticvLr turn lor exccMav. e hi oneinecluiiicd depaitment. tas^sthe I habit of dexterity necessary for acquitting himself xvith equal reputation iu another, or as the artist, xvho has dedicated himself to the use of xvater-colours, is usually Jess distinguished by his skill in oil-painting. '? It is the object of the novel-xvriter, to place before :he reader as full and accurate a representation of the events xvhich he relate-, as ern lie done by the mere force of au excited imagination, xviehont tiie assistance of material objects. 11;s sole appeal is made to tiie xvo;ld of fancy and of ideas, and in this consist: iiistrength and his weakness, Ins poverty a:.d his wealth. Ile cannot, like the painter, present a visible and tangible representation of histoxvns and his woods, his palaces and his ca-tles; but, by awakening the imagination of a congenial reader, he places before- his mind's eve. landscapes fairer than those of Claude, and wilder than those of Salvator. Ile cannot, like the dramatist, present before our living eves the heroes of former days, or the beautiful creations of his own fancv, em- bodied in the ccrace and majesty of Momble or of Siddons; hut lie ca;i leach his reader to conjure up forms even more dignified and beautiful than theirs. The same difference follows lum through everv branch of his art. 'The author of a novel, in short, has neither stage nor scene-painter, nor company of comedians, nor diesser, ne- xvardrobe,?word^ epplied xvith the her-t of his illili, must supply ali that these bring t<> the assistance of t!ie dramatist. Action, and tone, and gosture, tfie smile of tiie lover, tue iroxvn of the tyrant, the grimace ofthe buffoon,? al! must be told, eur nothing can beshexvn. Thus, the very dialogue becomes mixed willi the narradon ; tor he must no! o:i!v tel! xvhat the characters actually -aid, in which hh t.uk is the same as that of the dauuiiic author, but must also describe t!ie tom*, thc look, the gesture, xvith which their speech xvas accompanied,? teliimr, in short, ailxvhich, in the drama, it becomes the provinre of thu ac lor to express. It murt, then-tore, frequently hapuen, tiiat tiie author host ouuliiie ! foi a \)vj\ ince, in which all depends on the couiimmication of his oxvn ideas and feelings to the rca.!er, xvithout any intervening medium, mav fail short ofthe kill necessary to adciut his compositions to the medium of tiie sta^e, xvhere the \ erv omililies n.o-'t excellent in a novelist are out of place, and an impediment to success. Description and ru .rr:, lion, xvhich form the very essence of the novel, nu: t he vcrv sparinHv introduced irto dramatic composition, and scarce cvt have a good cull et upon tiie stage. Mr. Imff, in 7'.c Critic, has tho tzooj cen-e to have out "all about gilding tin? eastern hemi-pheic;M and the very ii:>t ihmg which the players struck out of his memorable tragedy, xvas the description oi Queen Elizaheth, her palfrev,and her side-saddle. The o: trna speaks {) the eve and eu; and ii cele- to a loiU'3 I.,cse boddv v -rn , organs, anel woulel exact from a theatrical audience that exercise of the imagination which is necessary to follow forth and embody circumstances neither spoken nor exhibited, there is an immediate failure, though it mav be tho failure of a man of genius. Hence it follows, that though a gooel acting play may be made by selecting a plot and characters from a novel, yet scarcely any effort of genius could render a play into a narrative romance. In the former ca^e, the author has only to contract the events within the space necessary for representation, to chose ti.e mot striking characters, and exhibit them in Mic ino-t forcible contra t, discard from the dialogue whatever is redundant or tcelious. and so dramatize the whole. But we know not any effort of genius, which could successfully insert into a good play, those accessaries of description and elelineation, which are necessary to dilate it into a readable novel, lt may thus easily be conceived, that he who-e chief talent lies in addressing the imagination only, and whose style, therefore, must be ex- paneled v.nd circumstantial, may tail vi a kind cf composition where so much mu-t be left b> the efforts ofthe actor, with his allies and assistants the scene-painter and propertv-man, and where every attempt j to interfe-re w iib. their province, is an error ! unfavourable to the success ofthe piece. | Ihvidc-v it mint farther be remembered, : that in fictitious narrative an author carries j on Ids nranuiVciure alone, and upon his j own account; whereas, in dramatic writing, he enters into partnership with tUe j performers, and it is by their joint efforts j that the piece is to succeed. Copartnery j is called, by civilian-, the mother of disj cord ; aud bow likely it is to prove ?o ii j tb.e present instance, may be illustrated by reference to theadmirvde eiialoiivc between tiie player avd poet iu k< Joseph Andrews," bovk iii. chap. 10. The poet must either be contented to fail, or to make great condescensions to tiie experience, and pay much attention to the peculiar qualifications, of tho>e by whom his piece is to be represented. And he who in a novel had only to fit sentiments, action, and character, "to ieieal beings, is now compelled to assume the much more difficult tad; of adapting all these to read on idling persons who, unless their parts av exactly suited to their own taste anel their peculiar capacities, have, each in his lim1, tiie means, aud not unfrevuently the inclination, to ruin the success of thc olav. bach are, amongst many othei s the peculiar difficulties of thc dramatic art, and they >eem impediments which liv peculiarly in the way of the novelist who azures to extend his sw av over the stage.' After noticing Fielding's dramatic pieces, Sir Walter gives tiie following anecdote:? * After the publication cf ?' Jose ph Andrews/' Fielding Iud again recouis1 to ihe stave, anel brought out " The \Vtdd.n^ Dav," wvich, though on the whole unsuccessful, poiveed hun some small profit. This xvas the last of his theatrical efforts which appeared during his life. The manuscript comedy of " The Fathers" was lost by Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, and, xvhen recovered, was acted after the author's death for the benefit of his family. An anecdote respecting the carelessness xvith xvhich Fielding regarded his theatrical fame, is thus given by former biographers: ? 'On one of the days of its rehearsal, (i. e. the rehearsal of the ?' WeddingDay,") Garrick, xvho performed a principal part, and xvho was even then a favourite with the public, told Fielding, he xvas apprehensive that the audience xvould make free xxith him in a particular passage, and remarked, that as a repulse might disconcert him during the remainder of the night, the passage should be omitted,?" No ; d?n Vm," replied he, " if the ^cene is not a good one, let them find tltat out." Accordingly, the play was brought out xvithout alteration, and, as had been foreseen, marks of disapprobation appeared. Garrick, alarmed at the hisses he had met with, retired into the green-room, xvhere the author was solacing himself xvith a bottle of champain. He had by this time drank pretty freely; and, glancing his eye at the actor, while clouds of tobacco issued from his mouth, cried out, " What's the matter, Garrick? what are they hissing noxv ?"?" Why the scene that I begged you to retrench," replied the actor ; " I knexv it would not do; and they have so frightened me, that I shall not be able to collect myself again the whole night."?" Oh ! d?ni 'em,"'rejoined he, xvith great coolness, 4'they hare found it out, have they ?" ' 4 Miller published ''Amelia" in 1751. He had paid a thousand pounds for the copy-right ; and when he began to suspect that the work xvould be judged inferior to its predecessor, he employed the following stratagem to push it upon the trade. At a sale made to the booksellers, (irevious to the publication, Miller offered lis friends his other publications on the usual terms of discount; but when he came to " Amelia," he laid it aside, as a xvork in such demand, that he could not affoid todeliver it to thetrade in the usual manner. The ruse succeeded?the impression was anxiously bought up, and the bookseller relieved from every apprehension of a sloxv sale.' As xve do not mean to enter into any connected biography of either Fielding or Smollett, xve shall only quote one passage relating to the life of the latter, and some of the editor's critical remarks on his works:? ' 1 he person of Smollett xvas eminently handsome, his features prepossessing, and, by ihe joint testimony of all his surviving friends, his conversation in the highest deg ree insti uctive and amusing. Of his disposition, those xvho have read his works (and who has not done so?) may form a very accurate estimate; for in eachofthem he has presented, and sometimes under various points of view, the leading features of bis own character, without disguising the most unfavourable of them. Nay, there is room to believe, that he rather exaggerated than softened that cynical turn of temper, which was the principal fault of his disposition,and which engaged him in so many quarrels. It is remarkable, that all his heroes, from Roderick Random downward, possessa haughty, fierce, irritability of disposition, until the same features appearsoftened, and rendered venerable by age and philosophy, in Matthew Bramble. The sports in which they most delight are those which are attended with disgrace, mental pain, and bodily mischief to others; and their humanity is never represented as interrupting the course of their frolics. We know not that Smollett had any other marked failing, save that which he himself has so often and so liberally acknowleged. When unseduceel by his satirical propensities, he was kinel, generous, and humane to others; bold, upright, and independent in his own character; stooping to no pa- tron, suing for no favour, but honestly and honourably maintaining himself on his literary labours; xvhen, if he xvas occasionally employed in xvork xvhich xvas beneath his talents, the disgrace must remain xvith those xvho saved not such a genius from the degrading drudgery of compiling and translating. He xvas a doting father and an affectionate husband ; and the warm zeal with xvhich his memory was cherished by his surviving friends, shexved clearly the reliance xxhich they placed upon his regard. Even his resentments, though often hastily adopted, and incautiously expressed, were neither ungeneous nor enduring. He was open to conviction, and ready to make both acknoxvledgement and allowance xvhen he had done injustice to others, willing also (o forgive and to be reconciled when he had received it at their hand.' The following admirable remarks are maele on two of Smollett's xvorks, Peregrine Pickle and Count Fathom. Speaking of the former, Sir Walter says,? ? The splendid merit of the work itself, xvas a much greater victory over the author's enemies, if he really had such, than any xvhich he could gain by personal altercation with unworthy opponents. Yet by many his second novel xvas not thought quite equal to his first. In truth, there occurs betwixt Roderick Random and Peregrine Pickle a difference, xvhich is often observed betwixt the first and second efforts of authors xvho have been successful in this line. Peregrine Pickle is more finished, more sedulously laboured into excellence, exhibits scenes of more accumulated interest, and presents a richer variety of character and adventure than Roderick Random; but yet there is an ease and simplicity in the first novel which is not quite attained in the second, xvhere the author has substituted splendour of colouring forsiinplicity of outline Thus, ofthe inimitablesea-characters,Trunnion, Pip s, and even Hatchway, border upon caricature; but Lieutenant Bowling and Jack Rattlin are truth and nature itself. The reason seems to be, that when an author brings forth his fust representation of any class of characters, he seizes on the leading and striking outlines, and, therefore, in the second attempt of the same kind, he is forced to make some distinction, and either to invest his personage with less obvious and ordinary traits of character, or to place him in a new and less natural light. Hence it would seem, the difference in opinion which sometimes occurs betwixt the author and the reader, respecting the comparative value of early and of subsequent publications. The author naturally prefers that upon which he is conscious much more labour has been bestowed, while the public often remain constant to their first love, and prefer the facility and truth of the earlier work to the more elaborate execution displayed in those which follow it. But though the simplicity of his predecessor was not, and could not be, repeated in Smollett's second novel, his powers are so far from evincing any falling otf, that in Peregrine Pickle there'is a much wider range of character and incident, than is exhibited in Roderick Random, as well as a more rich and brilliant display ofthe talents and humour of the distinguished author.' * * * * ' To a reader of a good disposition and xvell-regulated mind, the picture of moral depravity presented in the character of Count Fathom, is a disgusting pollution of the imagination. To those, on the other hand, who hesitate on the brink of meditated iniquity, it is not safe to detail the arts by xvhich the ingenuity of villainy has triumphed in former instances; and it is xvell known that the publication of the real account of uncommon climes, although attended by the public and infamous punishment of the perpetrators, has often Ind tiie effect of stimulating others to similar actions. To some unhappy minds it may occur as a sort of extenuation ofthe crime xxhich they meditate, that even if thev carrv their purpose into execution, their guilt will fall far short of what the author has ascribed to his fictitious character; and there are other imaginations so ill regulated, that they catch infection from stories of wickedness, and feel an insane impulse to emulate and to realize the pictures of villainy which are embodied in such narratives as those Qi Zeluco or Count Fathom/ The concluding remarks of the prefatory memoir to Smollett, which consists of forty-two pages, ure derated U> a comparison of the merits of that able writer xvith Fielding:-? ? Fielding and Smollett were bott born in the highest rank of society, both^dtt- cated to learned professions, yet both obliged to follow miscellaneous literature as the means of subsistence. Both were confined, during their lives, by the narrowness of their circumstances,?both united a humourous cynicism willi generosity and good nature,?both died ofthe diseases incident to a sedentary life, and to literary labour, and both drew their last breath in a foreign land, to which they retreated underthe adverse circumstances of a decayed constitution and an exhausted fortune. ?Their studies were no less similar than their lives. They both wrote for the stage, and neither of them successfully They both meddled in politics; they both wrote travels, in which they shewed that their good humour was wasted under the sufferings of their disease; and, to conclude, they were both so eminently successful as novelists, that no other English author of that class has a right to be mentioned in the same breath with Fielding and Smollett. 1 If we compare the works of these two great masters yet more closely, we may assign to Fielding, with little hesitation, the praise of a higher and a purer taste than was shewn by his rival; more elegance of composition and expression ; a nearer approach to the grave irony of Swift and Cervantes ; a great deal more adelress or felicity in the conduct of his story ; and, finally, a power of describing amiable and virtuous characters, and of placing before us heroes, and especially heroines, of a much higher as well as pleasing character, than Smollett was able to present/ * * # * ' Upon the whole, the genius of SmolJett may be said to resemble that of Rubens. His pictures are often deficient in grace; sometimes coarse, and even vulgar in conception ; deficient, too, in keeping, and in the due subordination of parts to each other ; and intimating too much carelessness on the part of the artist. But these faults are redeemed by such richness and brilliancy of colours; such a profusion of imagination?now bodying forth the grand and terrible?now the natural, the easy, and thc ludicrous ; there is so much of "life, action, and bustle, in every group he has painted; so much force and individuality of character, that we readily grant to Smollett an equal rank with his great rival Fielding, while we place both far above any of their successors in the same line of fictitious composition. } We ought to add, that this edition ofthe British Novelists, in addition to the enhancement of its value by its editor, is elegantly printed at the Border Press of Mr. James Ballantyne, brother of the publisher. It appears in bulky volumes with double columns, and is published at a price somewhat moderate.

A Woman Alone in the Heart of Japan. THE LIBKAKY TABLE By Gertrude Adams Fisher. (Sisleys, 7s. 6d.j Publishers, who define themselves as "makers of beautiful books," set up a dangerously high standard. Authors, who undertake to describe a country of which the beauty is so contagious and so familiar as that of Japan run the same risk. By none but the most lenient of critics can the epithet " beautiful" be applied to either text or illustrations of this vigorous and sometimes vulgar book. The bulk of the illustrations recall forgotten photographs which every globe-trotter has purchased and not a few book-makers have reproduced. The American schoolmistress who here records her tour must possess courage, resource, confidence, vitality, and a sense of humour, but the&e qualities do not necessarily make for beauty. Even delicacy is painfully unapparent. Is it squeamishness or obtuseness which recoils from Miss Fisher's comment on the coolie, who took her for " A First Riksha Ride " ? When rikky is stocked with garlic and absinthe, he makes the air talk. To the boiling Bethesda of sufferers from syphilis at Kusatsu, to the Red Cross Hospital where she was fortu- nate enough to witness the dissection of a conveniently deceased patient, to the Yoshiwara, where she scrambled and jostled to behold "The Leader of Sin and Her Gay Retinue" (ks"-, brilliant headline informs us)?to everything that was repulsive and striking and sensational Miss Fisher forced her way with inquisitive eyes and releritless pen. We can only conclude that the authoress was employed by a yellow editor to paint the boldest of the yellow races in her lividest colours. The headlines tell their own tale. From the first page to the last there is no evidence of any but the most hasty and superficial observation. But, of course, polite Japanese hosts supplied innumerable opportunities and photographs to garnish their flying visitor's pungent adventures. Her pages are lively* graphic, good-tempered?but never beautiful.

We opened Mr. Hare's book with the most pleasing anticipations. The Introductory Chapter, describing the arrival in Rome, served only to whet our interest; while the full list of hotels, shops, studios, &c, given under the head of " Dull-useful Information," showed the extent of the author's knowledge. So fur we bad no reason to complain; but as soon as we came to the real contents of the book, our views began to change. We then found that Mr. Hare, with all his love of Rome and all his experience, was content to be a compiler. His ''walks" are all taken in the company of former writers. He points out a church or palace, and tells you what others have said about it. His own contribution is only the arrangement of old materials; and we think we do him no injustice in saying that he studiously avoids anything original. After this statement, it is needless to add, that we were disappointed. Mr. Hare certainly quotes with much taste and aptitude. His leading on Rome has been unusually extensive; and he seems to miss no author of note, no one who has substantially contributed to Roman literature ; but we can hardly think that it was worth anyone's while to copy out all these passages; and it is impossible to review a mere compilation.

REVIEW Or NEW BOOKS. Chronicles of the Canopigalc. Second Series. By the Author of Waverley, &c. :i vols. hdinburgh, (adell and Co. ; Lonldon, Simp. kin and Marshall. HAVING heen published early in the w eek, many of our readers will have rcad this histo. rical novel before our reiewv of it can lic laid before them. For the rest, as the laid trans. hators from the French say, they wvill peruse it so soon, that any elaborate criticism ot ours would be worse than wvasted, even were we at this time of day inclined to deliver opinions upon the Author of Waverley. We shall, therefore, content ourselves with observing, that the period of Scottish history here illustrated by his pen, seems always to have left a stronig impression onl the nmi~ld of Sir Walter Scott. Of the battle of llomildon lill he made a dramatic poem ; and the conflict between the Clan Chattan and the Clan Kay, on the North. Inch of Perth, forms one of the most remark. able of the Tales of a Grandfather (see that work, vol. ii. p. 67). In the present publdica. tion we have the characters of the same era drawn out in fuller proportions, from King Robert III. to Henry Wynd, the valiant citizen of Perth, whose alliance so largely contri. buted to wiin the field for the Clan (hiattan - some fictitious personages introducedt; andl the whole wrought into a CLhroniclc (if such a composition can witlh propriety lie so called) of vivid and striking reality. The circumstances are related with all the force of actual truth ; the'dramatis personm are developed either with historical fidelity or a keen perception of hInman nature in those fierce and barbarous times; and king, prince, noble, citizen, clansman, retainer, glee-maiden, &c. are individiialiscd with the skill of an acute observer, who had lived among the chivalrous barons, wvarlike buirghers, and wild Hhighlanders,-amidst the feuds and brawls,-of the closing years of the fourteenth century. We do not, however, mean to say that the facts of history or of individual character have been scrupulously adhered to: on the contrary, they have been disregarded when it suited the an hor to shape his narrative into a higher, more affecting, or more tragical tone. Thus, Henry W'And, the little bandy.legged saddler of tra. diwoo, vho for half a French crown periled his life in mortal combat, is elevated into the best armourer in Scotland,-a.n athlete of good bodily appearance, and n hero in soul. Thie chief of the Clan Kay is a creature of superStition and romance, wvhose imagined conIdu(ct has a leading influence throughout the tale. The death of the unfortulnate Duke of Rothsay is brought about by other causes and other instruments than our annals have assigned, though the principal incidents of his sadl fIte, as report has handed thein down, havo been preserve(l with appalling minuteness. Jn other respects, thle Fair Maid of Perth, the daughter of Simon (ilover, a worthy citizen of that place, though adorned with great per- fections, is, like most of the author's heroines, rather uninteresting. WVe are never afraid of aught that is threatened of danger towards her; and she reaches her apotheosis without affording us any extraordinary degree of pleasure. The imagineed citizens ot Perth are admirally conceived. Ilenbaie D)wining, it leariked and travelled leech or pottingar, is a powerful agent in the (Iranila ; and Simon Glover himself, Blailie ('raigdallie, Oliver Prondfute bonnet. maker, Griffin not of that ilk but of that inn, &c. &c. are all faithfully painted, naid cleverly contrasted : wh ilst Mrs. Proudfnte, Dorothy Glover the domestic of Simon, Luckie Shool. lbred the Smith's housekeeper, and Louise the gleewoman, serve, with them, not only to dishlay the manners of the age, huat to carrv on the businiess of the story. Of the genuine persons knowii to us by record, King Robert, simple. hearted and wnavering; his gay and thoughtless am1 botiosa, and his brother the crafty and amiitious i)uke of Albany, are finely developed. The Black Douglas is not perhaps so accurately depicted i indeed lie is more pecu. liarly anid farcibly drawvn by several ancient wvriters ; but still he is a bold sketch upon the canIvass of Sir Walter's grouping. Of the equally potent Earl of March we dlo not see nitich; but thiese mighty feudal lords, together with their followers, hiriors aind monks, Sir Patrick Charteris provost of Perth, Ramorinx master (if the horse to the D)uke of llothsay, Eviot his page, Bonthron a ruffian, the foster-father and brothers of the chieftain of Clan Kay, and many interior characters,are stamped with the masterly touch of our great delineator of the meni aind mainers of ancieLnt as vell as modernl days. Of his powers in this respect, nearly the whole of the last volume is a remarkable example: the cata. strophie of Rothsay in Falkland castle'; and, still more, the contest of the clans on tIhe Inch of Perth, are not sulrpasse(l by any thing lie has ever done. 'Tile latter we tire inclined to class above the matchless tournament in Ivanihoe, inasmuch as its reality and deep tragedy are sulierior to tIme show and chivalry of that su. perb picture. Btut the most original and strik. ing feature in this production is, that the author has contrived to invest the character of a coward with the finest of our sympathies. 'rhis is an entirely novel idea; and WCe wonder when we find tha;t stuch a being-the general scoff, derision, and at best pity, of all hpreced. ing times and writers-is, by a magical charm and : just viewv of nature, ren(lered one for wvhom our feelings are warmly excited, amid for whose destiniy our tears are maile to flow. With these preliminiaries we shall piroceedl to a brief epitomime of the Fair BiMW of Perth, and a few (Iluotationis to exeinhlhify her Chronicle. Trhie book opens on St. Valentinme's eve: King Robert is holding his court in the l)omi. nican coinvent at Perth ; ald we become acauninted with the inhabitanits of that city who are necessary to the tale, especially with Katie (Glover, whose rare heatity inspires all hearts, from that of the heir-apparent to Henry IVyud - - - I I I I the armourer, and Conachar, a Highland youth-, apprentice to Simon 'lover, over whose con. nexion a mystery hangs, till he is discovered to lie the onlyv on of the head of Clan KaV. D)urinig the Valentino revels, when ciivalrv bent at the shrine of female loveliness with perfect devotion, though sometimes not with perfect purity, the fair daughter of the (lover was all object of universal attraction. A midnight attempt to carry her off, by Rothsay, and Hta morny and his other adherents, is defeated by the brave Smith, who is her Valentine, and who in the affray chops off the hand of the luckless mas. ter of the prince's horse. Other scenes and revels succeed on Shrove Tuesday, or Fastern's H'en ; when Prondfute, a good-natured boaster, who is always imitating the Smith, is mistaken for his prototype7 in(l assassinated by Donthron, in revenge for this wvound. The corpse is found on the morning of Ash Wednesday, and the hardly appeased tumults in the city, occasioued by the gallant affair at Simon Olover's, are renewed against the reckless courtiers with greater fury than before. The rumour runs at first that Henry Smith hms been murdered - which throws the Fair Maid, who had hitherto been coy and cold to his addresses, offlher guard; and the following ensues. " Cathar ine ran through the streets of Perth in a manner which at another moment would have brought on her the attention of every ono who saw her hurrying on with a reckless impetuosity, wildly and widely different from the ordinary decency and composure of her step and manner, and without the plaid, scarf, or mantle, which ' women of good,' of fair character and decent rank, universally carried around them, when they went abroad. But, distracted as the people were, every one in. quiring or telling the cause of the tumult, and most recounting it different ways, the neglis gence of her dress, and discomposure of her manler, made no impression on any one; and she was suffered to press forward on the path she had chosen, without attracting more notice than the other females, who, stirred by anxious curiosity or fear, had come out to inquire the cause of an w arm so generali-t might be to seek for friends, for whose safety they were interested. As Catharine passed along, she felt all the wild influence of the agitating scene, and it was with difficulty she forbore from repeating the cries of lamentation and alarm which were echoed around her. In the meantime, she rushed rapidly on, embarrassed like one in a dream, with a strange sense of dread. ful calamity, the precise nature of which she was unable to define, but which implied the I terrible consciousness, that the man who loved her so fondly, whose good qualities she so highly esteemed, and whom shlo now felt to be dearer than perhaps she would before have acknow. ledged to her own bosom, was murdered, and most probably by her means. " 6 0 " Without knowing what she sought, ex,cept the general desire to know the worst of the dreadful report, sihe hurried forward to the I very spot, which of all others her feelings of the preceding dlay would have induced hier to avoid. W%'ho would, tipon the eveninig ot'Shrove. tidle, hiave persuiadetd the 1)Ftld, the timid. tilst shy, the rigilIly decorous Catharine (lover, thlat before Tnasi oin Ash We'dlnesday she should rush through the streets of Perth, making her way amidst tumult and conifusion, with her hair unbound, and hier dress disarranged, to seek the house of that same lover, whlo, sihe had reason to bKlieve, had so) grossly and inde. licately neglected and affronted heras to psur. sue a lowv and licentious arimour ! * '' At length, without any dlibtiict Idea of hier owln purpose, ttshe stood. before hier lover's door, and knocked for admittance. The silence which suieeteded tile echoing sif her hasty surunimis increased the alarim which had induiced her to take thiis desperate meastire. I Ope,-Iojwu, Henry !' she criedl. ' Opeu, If you yet live !_ ol)pen, if you would not oind (Cathariute (Glover dead upon your tisreshold !' As sile cried thus fransticly to cars which she was taught to helieve were stopped by death, tile lover site invoked Opened tile door in personi, just in titne to prevent hier sinking ont tile ground. T'he extremity of his ecstatic joy upon tun Occasion to utnexpected, was uiualitiesl only by the wovi. 41er which forblade hin to believe it real, and hby his alarm tlit the closed eves, lialfopeuied nudl blanched. lip-i, total absenioe ot complexion, and apparentiy total cessation of breathing.

At the sound of his voice, May Catharine experienced a revival mucihl speedlier than Dame Shoolhred's restoratives hlade been able to produce ; and the paleness of her comnplexion changed into a deep glowv of the most lovelv redh. S-he pushed her lover from lher with both her hands, is lkich, unitil this minute, her want of consciousness, or her affection, awakened by the events of the mnorning-, had well nigh abandoned to his caresses.

The highlander advanced, with his large sword uplifted, as in act to strike; but just as he came wvithin swvord's length, lie dropt the long and cumbrous weapon, leapt lightly over the Smitd's sword, as he fetched a cut at him, dIrew his dagger, an(l being thus within Henry's guard, struck him with the weapon (his olwn gift) on the side of the throat, di. recting- the blow downwards into the chest, and calling aloud, at the same time, ' You tasught me the stab !' But Henry Wynd wore his own. good hlauberk, doubly defended with a lining of tempered steel. Had he been less surely armed, his combats had bieen ended for ever. Even als it was, lie was slightly wounded. ' Fool !' he replied, striking Nor. man~a a ldlow with the pomniel of his long swvord, wvhich made him stagger backwards, ' you were taught the thrust, but not the parry ;' and fetching nl blow at his antagonist, which, cleft his skull through the steel-cap, he stro(le over the lifeless body to engage the youing chief, who now stood open before him. But the sonorous voice of Torquih thundered out, Far eil oair son Eac/hin !' (Another for Hfector!) and th e two brethren who flanked their chief on each sido thrust forward upon Henry, nand, striking both at once, compelled him to keep the defensive. ' Forward, race of thle tiger-cat !' cried 31ac(illie Chattanach ; I save the brave Saxon ! let these kites feel v'our talons !' Already much vounded, the chief dragn ed himself up to the Smith's assist. ance and cut down one of the Leicihtach, by whoni he was assailed. Henry's own good sword rid him of the other. 'Rcist air son Idahih!' (Again for hlector !) shouted the faithful foster-father. ' Bas air son Fachin!' (I)eath for Hector!) answered two more of his devoted sons, and opposed themselves to the fury of the Smith and those who had come to his aid ; while Eachin, moving towards the left wing of the battle, sought less formidable adversaries, and again, by some show of valour, revived the sinking hopes of his followers. The two children of the oak, who had( covered this movement, shared the fate of their brethren, for the cry of the Clan Chat. tan chief hnd drawn, to that part of the field some of his bravest warriors. The sons of Torquil did not fall unavenged, but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons of the dead and living. But the necessity of keeping their most distinguished soldiers around the person of their chief, told to disadvantage on the general event of the combat; and so few were now thlo number wVho remained fighting, that it was easy to see that the Clan (hattan had lifteen of t heir number left, thotigh miost of them Gvounded ; and that of the Clan Quhele, only about ten remained, of wlhom there were four of the chief's body. guard, including Torquil himself. Thiey fotught and struggled on, however, and as their strength decayed, their fury seemed to in. crease. Henry WVynd, now wounded in manv places, was still bent on breaking through, or exterminating, the band of bold hearts who continued to fight around the object of his animositv. But still the father's shout of, 'Another for Ilector!' was chieerfillv all swered by the fatal countersign, ' D)eaili for Hector!' an(1 though the ('Ian Quhlele were now outnumbered, the combat seemed still dubious. It was bodilv lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause. The Clan Chattan were then oblserved to be twelve in numlier, but two or three were scarce able to stand without leaninlg on their swords. }'ive were left of the ('lan (Quliele; Tor-quil and his youngest soii were of the number, both slightly wounded. Eachin alone had, from the vigilance used to intercept all blows levelled against his persoII, escaped without injury. The rage of both parties had sulink through exhaustion into sullen desperatioll. They wvalked staggering, ats if in their sleep, through the carcasses of the slain, and gazed on them, as if again to animate their hatred towards their surviving enemies, lby viewving the friends they had lost. The multitiide soon aItfer beheldi the survivors of the desperate conflict drawing together to renew the exterminating lcudl ol the banks of the river, as the spot least slippery with. blood, and less encumbered with the bodies of the slain." In the third and last affray the standardbearers and p)ipers of both sides join tile battle and aie slain b)y each other. " Mleanwhile, youig Tormot, devoted, like his brethen, by his fiather Torqnil to the nrotection of huis chief, had been mortally w ounded by the unspariung sword Kf the Simithl. The other two remaining of' tile C(lan Qtuhlele had also fallen ; and Torquil, withi his foster-sou, and the wvotunded Tormot, forced to retreat before'eighit or ten of the ('lan Chattan, made a stan(l ol the hank of, tile river, while their enemiies were making such exertions as their wounds vouildl permit to comiie llp with them. Tortlidl had just reached the spot where lie had resolved to make the stand, when the youth Tormot dropped alidl expiredl. His deathi drew from his father the first anid Only sigh which lie had breathed throughout the eventfil day. ' 3Iv son Ttormot !' he said, ' my youngest and dearest! But if I save Hector, I save all. Now, my darling l)ault, I have (lone for thee all that manl mav, excepting the last.

While Torptuil thuis sl)tpke, lie unloosed the clasps of tihe youn"g chief's hauiberk! in the siml)le belief that lie could thuts break the meshes which fear and neeromancy ha(d twinedl about his heart. ' 31v father, my father, my more thani parent !' said tilh! unhappy Eachinii' Stay with me !_Nvithi You by my side I feel I canll fight to the last.' ' It is impossible,' said Torquil. I I will stop thlem coming ulp, while yOu put oil the lau. berk. God eternally b.less thee, beloved( of my 80ul !'

' Brave battle, hawk well flown, falcon !' ex. claimed the multitude, as they witnessed ex. ertions which seemed, even at this last hour, to threaten a change of the fortunes of the dav. Suddenidv these cries were hushed into silence, anll succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful, fs if the whole conaflict had recominencecd in the person of Henry Wvnd an(l Torquil of the Oak. They cut, foiiied, hewed, and thrust, as if they had drawvn their blades for the first time tlat day ; and their invete racy was mutual, foir Torqtuil recogniised the foul w-izard, who, as lie sup)pOsed, had cast a sl)ell over his child; anld Il enr saw before hlimi the giant, who, durhing the wlhole conictlit 1ha/l iliterrupted the purpose for which alone lie had joilled the combatants.

255   6646505   THE METHODS OF MR. MORRISON.
Dec 12, 1896  ENGLISH LITERATURE|ENGLISH LITERATURE - 19th Century|ENGLISH LITERATURE - 20th Century
The Academy, 1869-1902, 0269-333X  : 1284 531 - 531
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE METHODS OF MR. MORRISON- A writer in the St. James's Gazette claims to have discovered the secret of Mr. Arthur Morrison's realism, and to have proved that A Child of the Jago is not in any true sense Mr. Morrison's child, but owes its parentage to the Rev. Osborne Jay, of Holy Trinity, Shoreditch. "In a sense," says the reviewer, " the book has been written before." For A Child of the Jago is the story of a boy brought up in one of the lowest slums of the East End, the district known as Old Nichol. Now five- years ago the Rev. Osborne Jay published a little book, now out of print and somewhat difficult to obtain, entitled Life in Darkest London, and dealing with the same district. A copy of this book has fallen into the hands of the St. James's reviewer, and he roundly asserts that the chief characters and incidents in Mr. Morrison's book appeared originally in the work of Mr. Jay. "Opportunities of observing how fiction is worked up out of a nucleus of fact," he continues, "are so rare that it seems worth while to give some illustrations from the present example in the shape of parallel passages." And then follows a series of " parallel passages " by which it is sought to prove that Mr. Morrison's realism is not based on observation, but is merely an expansion of the facts set forth in Mr. Jay's book. For example, Mr. Jay states in a passage of about thirty lines that faction fights are common in Old Nichol. Mr. Morrison gives two chapters of vivid description of a definite faction fight. Mr. Jay makes the plain statement that " women even take part, biting at each other's faces and tearing out each other's hair," while Mr. Morrison "expands" this piece of information into the character of Sally Green, " the female champion of the old Jago." Such parallels as these, the writer urges, " suffice to show how realistic fiction may be written." Now it will occur to the least reflecting that Mr. Morrison must be a much cleverer man than he is, to evolve a realistic story, full of the minutest details of slum-life, from the few bald facts which the St. James's reviewer discovers to be common to Life in Darkest London and A Child of the Jago. Moreover, my own knowledge of Mr. Morrison convinced me that this was not the method on which he worked. And in answer to my request he was good enough to relate to me the genesis of his book, and to explain the origin of those points of resemblance which certainly exist between his work and that of Mr Jay. It was shortly after the publication of Tales of Mean Streets that Mr. Morrison made the acquaintance of Mr. Jay and his parish. Mr. Jay, struck by the grim truth of Mr. Morrison's work, wrote him a letter of appreciation, which brought the author on a visit of inspection to Old Nichol. Already Mr. Morrison had the idea of Dicky Perrott in his mind (I have seen it, among scores of other jotted notions, in one of his old note-books) and was hesitating whether to place him in Poplar, in Bethnal Green, or elsewhere. The sight of Mr. Jay's parish, and the hope that a story written round it might help that devoted clergyman in his work, induced Mr. Morrison to select Holy Trinity, Shoreditch, as the parish of Dicky Perrott's residence. Hither, then, Mr. Morrison came day after day for more than eighteen months, learning every inch of the half-dozen streets?now improved off the face of the earth ? which make up the Jago, haunting the public-houses, sitting with the people in their homes, and even trying in his own person what it feels like to earn a living by making match-boxes. The rival families ? the Ranns and the Learys, Sally Green whose method was to bite the nape of her adversary's neck, Norah Walsh who was given to jabbing her enemy with a broken bottle, so far from being expansions and exaggerations of Mr. Jay's statistics, are real people of flesh and blood, with names of their own; even the man who laid the constable low with a fire-grate which he dropped from an upper window?one of the "parallel" cases?is still living in his sins, and Mr. Morrison told the story to Mr. Jay. It must be remembered that the Jago covers a very small area, not more than 250 yards each way. Now, given two men who spend eighteen months or so studying the lives of its inhabitants, and comparing notes of their discoveries and impressions, is it unlikely that when the one sets down the facts and the other weaves the facts into fiction a similarity should here and there appear ? It is only due to the Rev. Osborne Jay to add that he has taken the earliest opportunity of bearing witness to the thoroughness of Mr. Morrison's methods of research and of clearing him from the imputation of plagiarism. C.

The White Chief. a Legend o fSorthsernt fexico. By Captain MAYNIE REID. London: David Bogue. 1855. A TALE of Spanish America, full of rare feats and desperate encounters, of fierce passions. cruel deeds, and stern reprisals. No one knows better how to handle these melodramatic materials than Captain Mayne Reid, whose fietions, drawn from the mysterious recesses of the Great American Desert, are not unworthy to be compared with those of Fenimore Cooper himself. To unwind the thread of such a story as is The White Chifwfvould be a very useless task. Suffice it to Fay that the hero, Carlos the Cibolero, will stand comparison, for skill, courage, and fertility of invention, with the great Leatherstocking himnself. The style is vivid and fascinating, the interest never flags, and is often wound up to that pitch of painful intensity which is so grateful to the epicurean novel-reader. This novel will be one of the favourites of the season.

Woman's Wit; or Love's Distuises. A Play, in Five Acts. Bv JAMES SHERIDAN KNOWLES, Author of " Virginius," " The Hunchback," &c. 8vo. pp. 120. MIoxon. THis Play, which ought to have been introduced to the public, as the Preface or Advertisement informs us, about six months ago, is one of the most successful of its talented author's performances, and will not inconsiderably increase his already great reputation. The poetry is not exceedingly smooth, nor is the metre invariably correct; but these trifling inaccuracieswhich, perhaps, after all, ought rather to be styled inadvertencies-detract but little from the general merits of the piece; and those merits are great and numerous; viz., a well-laid plot-an agreeable cast of characters-a happy conception of stage-effect-and a pleasant denodernent. The following portion of a most amusing scene is, unfortunately, all to which we can afford sufficient space:- " SIR VALENTINE. "I fear thou art a slanderer. " CLEVER. " I see Thou lack'st good manners, which is grievous, friend, In one of thy degree. Thou callest names, As scavengers that quarrel in the streets, Mlost unbecomingly! SIR VALENTINE. " Well; now proceed. What of her cousin ? "CLEVER. " Though a godly man, Yet am I flesh and blood, and thou dost vex My spirit, friend, by so misusing me. I tell thee once again, my name is not Liar, nor knave, nor slanderer, nor aught But Obadiah. " SIR VALENTINE. "Well; enough of that. Her cousin ? Come-her cousin? "CLEVER. "'Tho' I am A man of peace, I am a valiant man. I combat not; but yet the elements Of war are given me, friend! I'm full of them, Save what is in me of the goodly thing That mortifies the flesh, and keeps them in Subjection! Yea-I am a warlike man! Yea-verily, a very warlike man! "SIR VALENTINE. "I ask thy pardon ! "CLEVER. " I do grant it thee; Thou dost a proper thing; and now shalt hear Wherein the maiden, Ruth, who, outwardly, Is to the maiden Hero what that maiden Is to herself, is, inwardly, reverse As summer is to winter." For the conclusion of this interesting colloquy we must refer the curious reader to the work itself, or else recommend him to purchase a ticket for a box at Covent Garden Theatre.

Lizzie Lotion of Grey Rigge. A Novel in 3 Vols. By Mrs. Lynn Linton. (Tinsley.) IF the wilds of Cumberland are as here set down, life must be in the same condition in which it was about the time of the 1st George. The heroine is a beautiful wayward girl, represented as somewhat tigrine in character; although we must confess we ourselves consider her extremely ill-used by the vain, handsome Ainslie Forbes, the manager of a mine lately sunk in the neighbourhood of Langthwaite. The new rector of Langthwaite, amongst other improvements, takes Lizzie Lorton in hand, and of course falls in love with her, but does not succeed. The troubles of the rector in his parish restorations are very amusingly narrated. There is much poetry in the description of the Cumberland rock scenery. Ainslie encounters a ruffian on the mountains, and in a contest hurls him over the precipice. The fact is kept secret by himself and Lizzie, in whose defence he has committed the homicide. On this secret depends the plot of the novel. Ainslie, who had not really been in love with Lizzie, falls in love with another lady, who is proprietor of an estate near, and confesses his so-called murder to her, upon which she marries him on condition that he gives himself up to the authorities. On the inquest, Lizzie, in revenge at Ainslie's desertion, swears that he had thrown his assailant over the rocks with murderous intent, the man lying helpless on the ground at the time. This evidence insures Forbes' committal on the capital charge. At the assizes Lizzie Lorton repents, and gives a true account of the struggle, confessing that she herself had committed perjury on the coroner's inquest. Ainslie i3 acquitted of course. Lizzie, who has always kept a boat on the lake, drowns herself near the Plash, the mansion belonging now to Ainslie, in right of his wife Margaret. It is an interesting tale, made more so by the local colouring a knowledge of the habits of the people affords the author.

MEMOIRS OF A STATE PRISONER.T A PORTION of the singular and interesting details which form these two volumes, was published about a year ago, having been condensed and translated from the original French of the author, by Signor Fortunato Prandi. M. Andryane has since published a second part to his work, which proves to be even more valuable and interesting than the first; and the present publication consists of the two works of M. Andryane, abridged into their present form. The origiginal author, whose sufferings as a state prisoner are here so forcibly and graphically described, was a young officer in Napoleon's army, whom the events of 1814 and 1815 threw upon the world with all the ardour of the political feeling of the time full upon him, and who presently fell into the hands of a set of crafty Italian exiles, who made a tool of him to his destruction. He was persuaded to set out from Geneva, on a mission from the secret societies, to endeavour once more to revolutionize Italy, and was (as his heartless abettors must have perfectly well known he would be) cast into prison immediately on his arrival at Milan, and (on the unquestionable evidence which he had been induced madly to bear about him) condemned to perpetual imO Colburn's Kalendar of Amusements in Town and Country, for 1840. Edited by Boleyne Reeves, Esq. 1 Vol. t Memoirs of a StateqPrisoner in the Fortress of Speilberg. By Alexander Andryme. 2 vold. prisonnent in the fortress of Speilberg. The work consists of the various details connected with these events, and with his subsequent confinement during a period of ten years, up to his release in 1832. These events are related, in the original French work, with a minutens of detail, a diffuseness of reflection, and in a style so flowery andfiuw, and consequently so little adapted to the subject, that Mr. Andryane's four volumes, though containing all the interest of those before us, can-. not be said to call it forth, by reason of the weight of words with whsih it is overlaid.- But in the admirable translation (if so it is to be called) of Signor Prandi, every thing has been seized which was worthy of preservation; every thing has been abandoned which clogged the movement of the narrative; and the whole has been put into a style which would do no discredit to the most practised and popular of our native writers. The result is a work quite equal in interest to that of Silvio Pellico; and one that, on account of the greater variety of its materials, will please the popular taste still more.

The fictionT wits that they were the coitiposition of a young New England farmer, shrewd, 'cute, observant, sarcastic, yet uneducated, who, (li.gusted with the encroachments of prosl.-Avery Southern politicians (then in power ait Washinlfton, as they had been for many years", and with the shamieful. subserviency of the so-calle(l "g Deiocratic" party at the North, vented his scornl and indirnAtion in these versified philippics. The idea was a good one, for it enabled the real author to give at Most lively and droll representation of New En gland- aricultural life, ha.1bits of thought, andl modcs of speech, and to add to his satire that )eculiar sting and potency arising, from homely and direct utterance. IBumrIs himself is not mnore keen, piercingr, and downright while the grotes(que od(ity of the chiaracterization is in itself an attraction, even to those who do not care about the political ideas thus quaintly expounded, or who may be irnorant of the facts and opinions alluded to. As aIn illustration Of Yankee character, these productions are as good as "Samn S-lick," and they possess a veritable historic interest, especially at the present time. ' We may trace in these pages the elements that have exploded in the civil war now desolating America; we may see in the low morality, the (raspin, ;nambition, the chicanery, the vulgarity and timeserving, of the politicians of 147--, as reflected in the lyrics of Tiospa I3i-low, the first causes of that crash which has since echoed so direfully through both the New and the Old Worlds. Hosea Biglow, thc supposed author, is a sort of Puritan of the o0d "Pilgrim Fathers " stamnp, though with all the smart knowingness of the modern Yankee. Ile can see nothing, but wicked aggression, thievishness, and murder, in the Mexican war, and thinks the national tolerance of slaverya disgrace to al Republic boasting of its freedom. However muich Englishmen may condemn the present attempt to sul)(ldue the South, it is hardly possible for them not to be struck by the fine, blunt, sterling honesty which is apparent in these satires. It was that quality, no less than their wit-it was their fresh, hearty out-spokenness, aIts mutch as their hbumourwhich made them a power in the State ; for such in truth they Were. "On one occalsion,"' savs the English editor, "the election of a governor for the State of MINassachusetts was decided by a few of these verses appearing -in a local journal. They favoured the return of aI M1r. Briggs ; the laugh was turned against his opponents, and he wis chosen as rovernor." The poem which aehieved this success is called, Wl~hat Mr. Robinson thinks," and .s full of humiour and spirit. How capital is this ."My! ain't it terrible! Wut shall we du? We can't never choose him, o' course,-tlhet's flat; Guess we shall have to come round (don't you?) A n' go in fer thunder en' gqns, an' all tiat ; The Biglow Papers. By James Russell Lowell.

A notewcrthy passage in one of M\r. Hosea Biglow's poenrs .Slhows that at the period of tie Alexican war many of the Northerners were very well inclined to cut adrift from the South, and let her (go on with the contest .alone. This is Mr. Biglow's opinion ; for, sas he,-M 'len hed ough' to put asunder Them thet God has noways jined; An' I shouldn't gretly wonder Ef there's thousands o' my mind." Yet the author of "The Biglow Papers " is now strongly opposed to Secession. It will be seen from our brief extracts tha~t these poems have a historical, a political, and a literary value. , The easy command of comic verse, and the novelty and incenuity'of the rhymes, are as excellent as the honest feeling that lives throughout; and the peculiar variety of English which they exhibit is worthy of the attention of philologists. We are glad to see that Mr. Hotten has reissued the work in a neat shilling volume, to which he has contributed some excellent notes explanatory of obscure passages, and a greatly enlarged glossary, which is certainly much needed by the English reader. M\r. Hotten has himself resided in America, and is therefore a safe guide on such ground.

A I VOTAGNS AND T3RAYZSE. I Travels in Central America; being a Journal I of nearly Three Years' Residence in the t Country. Together with a Sketch of the History of the Republic, and an Account nf its Climate, Productions, and Commerce, 4yc. By ROBERT GLA8GOW DUNLOP, Esq. London 1847. , Mfr. DUNLOP was, it seems, a grandson of the Mrs. DUNLOP who fills so prominent and cre-I ditable a place in the biography of BURNS. T He was educated at the London University; exhibited early signs of ability, and was especially remarkable for his love of science, and devotion to scientific pursuits. He entered the merchant-service while yet young. After some voyages in the East and Vest Indies, he resolved to visit Central America. He quitted England for this excursion in March 1844, and never to return to his native shores, for he died in the land he was exploring on New Year's-day 1847, of the fever of the country. The volume before us received, nevertheless, the author's corrections. It was printed before he died, for he had despatched it to the publisher's, having carefully revised every page of the manuscript. So tar as it extends it is a sensible, practical, business-like book, very much in the manner of HUMBOLDT'S; the facts set down as he found them, with no attempt to heighten the colour for the sake of effect. Without altogether neglecting personal adventure and lively anecdote, he does not make them the staple of his volume. They are introduced only by way of relief from the sober business of facts and figures. The volume, therefore, is not " of the season " books, to be thrown aside and forgotten as soon as read. It is a storehouse of valuable information-an addition to the stock of geographical knowledge -and more likely to be permanently respected than immediately popular. The district over which his observations had extended is not very large. They were limited to the Western side of the Andes, and to the four provinces of Mearagua, Salvador, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. The first experiences of the traveller were anything but promising. This is TRAVELLERS' FARE IN GUATEMALA. I presented my passport to the port captain, Son. Nicholss Espinosa, an ugly little dirty mestizo, i C 7 but a man of most polished manners and address, well known, as I afterwards found, for his want of principle, and distinguished for crime even in a country full of thieves and assassins. I landed my luggage in the afternoon, and Sen. Espinosa passed it without examination with a very polite bow. After a great deal of difficulty and search, we found an empty room to sleep in, and, after another search, a bedstead and table. In no part of Central America is the traveller ever accommodated with any thing beyond an empty room; hence a ham. mock is an indispensable article in a journey, other. wise he must make shift with an untanned bide to lay upon the floor, for eating, sleeping, &c. and even this is not always to be bad. The heat here was truly oppressive, even after that of Guayaquil, which is nearly under the equator, and far exceeded anything I ever felt even in the tropical parts of Asia and Africa. I afterwards found that it is the hottest place in Central America. The following shews the character of THE GOVERNMENT or GUATEMALA. Two newspapers, the Government Gazette, and the Aurora, are published weekly; they are pnnted upon small paper, and their circulation can do little more than pay expenses. There are from four to five printing offices, and three almanacks are published, very neatly got up, and containing much more useful information than those generalUy published in Europe. There is no bookseller's shop, though a few volumes of novels are exposed for sale by many of the dealers. Reading is rarely resorted to in Guatemala, the only amusements of the men being gambling and making love to the fair sex; and of the women intriguing and scandal. Rafael Carrera, the commander-in-chief and presi. dent of the state of Guatemala, is a dark-coloured and extremely ill-looking mestizo. He was ori. ginally servant to a woman of no very respectable character in Amatitlan, and afterwards to a Spatiard, from whom it is supposed he learued the little knowledge and breeding he possessed when be first appeared on the political stage of Guatemala; atter. wards be was employed as a pig driver, that is, in purchasing and personally driving pigs from the villages to Guatemala and the more populous towns. Tbe cholera morbus having appeared in April 1837, the Indians were led to believe that the watere bad been poisoned by emissaries sent by the parties thea ruling the state; aud being also excited agaiust the system of trial by jury (then lately brought into operation) by parties inimical to liberal Institutions, they united to the number of some thousands in the town of Santa Rosa, and under the couimand of Carrera, who had been one of the most active in deceiving them, destroyed a party of forty dragoons who had been sent out to disperse them. Carrera's faction was frequently defeated, and a vast slaughter F made of the ludians who followed him at Villa Nueva by the government troops, under the corn. mand of General Salagar, on the 11th of September, 1838; but they have always reunited in greater force, and on the 13th of April, 1839, Carreri, took fGuatemala at the head of 5,0tJ0 Iidians, siuce l which time he has retained all the real power in his hands. It must be allowed (adds our inforamant) that though at the commencement of his power he r perpetrated some horrid acts of cruelty, which any B one must shudder to recount, and frequently put to death his real or supposed enemies with the most B dreadful tortures, without a shadow of proof or form of trial, he has since conducted himself with I remarkable moderation, and has done much to iwn e prove the administration of the laws, destroy rob. db ers, and consolidate the government. By extor. r tions and confiscations he has amassed some hun. It dred thousand dollars in cash, lands, and house, n and it is consequently his interest to maintain a set. fled government, and give protection to property; but in his private life he is more indecently immoral than could be conceived or understood by most English readers. We find a novel and interestin account of cARAzaA, rE GUATEMALA, CHIEF. On the 2nd of February, 1845, 1 witnessed what i cAlled . rts ,t iu in u 4 u,te ;li h li.., &i (lie risio,. protiu(dl n) V!lugC ill tle go.- Crimno t , it shoutid hc. itore p opeciv cdled ant i ion.

M lhue nimes niUy croxI. bly never transpire, to *hminir the goserwnieut. The greater part of the soldoitri, in nn hl Iner about thiree hundred, were tampered with, and, at at signal early in the morning, rushed to aerma, dqwoscd their officers, and breaking open the riol, led out all the prisoners. Among these wis (.oloncl Monte Rosas, who was imprisoned oln ac n mt of an atteminpted revolution the predling )ear, and ho mWas now put at the head of the insurgents. Beinm awoke in the morning by a continuted firing, I imagined it was merely the celebratiou of the ceariival, of which this was the first d&y, till a Vountg man, a friend of the owner of tfle house where I w s lo;(1iog, entered in the greatest terror, excliinming. 'Ticr is a revolution ! Thle tiring ,ofn ct.'eid, the matll part of the troops who llhcrrt ! to (Cmrri a s interest being kidled and driven out of the city; and the illsurgents, havirlr taken pOsSV-siOn of the barracks and all the arms and aninmuuition, remained in undisputed possession for four dIys. l)tring this tiuic, accounts arrived that Carrvr as bol t r adlid bOIUe of his ofticers were collecting troops Lo attack the city; but as al the arms of the state were in possession of the ic.urgents, they wNe re a good deal p)uzzled what to (to; and Carrera's bnl)tler, after approaching the city, retreated ihk confsiiolo before a body of the insur ents, who sallied ouit to attack him. This victory was celebrated ill (iatemala by ringiog ull the church-bells, tiring guins, letting otf crackers, &c. .; ut it soon appeared thiat tile triumph was pr mature, for none of the respectable citizens joined Rosas, considering him, it was said, to be. as bad as or worse than Carrera. It appeared most surprising that such a set of desperadoes, as a large part of Monte Robas's troops were, bhould have conducted themselves so' moderately as they did: they neither plundered uior committed an y violence after the first outbrcaLk vas over, thougw, as usual, all the horses were taken for the officers. I saved those in the house where I was staying; for when the officer came with a troop to take them, I appeared to answer his sumrnions, and told him he had better leave alone the property of British subjects; upon which lhe went away without touching them. As no attempts were niade to barricade the streets, or take other means to defendl the city, it was clear that Monte tosas despoiied of success when he saw that no respectable persons joined iom ; and on the 6th le entered iato a cons entiou with the civic authorities, by which he was Ito receive Z,000 dollars to 'livide anmong his troops, bho were to march out ot the citv and dclivor up tbihtr arms, not being further nniole-tecl. 'lliis convention was, hIosrver, entirely disreg irILL by Carretra's party. Ilis brother lur u. d and attacked tile ilsurgents, who were dispersed, and offered little re. sistance, killing a great many ; but Monte Rlosas and most of the officers managed to escape to Mexicem. Rafael Carrera, on the first account of the insurrection, huad b4ecome quite desperate, and was thrown into a high fever, durin7, which le Ipoposed to resign his authority and leave the state; but hearinig of the suppressienn of the revolt, lie returned to Guatemala on the 10th, making a poom. pous entry with 2,000 unarmed troops, or rather ivgabonds, whom his lealers had collected in the ilWages in hopes that thty would be allowed to plunder Guatemala. Finding that nearly all the sel-i4lc;d nuobles and most of the party who hail raijed him to power had favoured the revolt, he prudently contented hilliseli with niinor victims.

They enter all thc houses, and steal any food they can timl; tiny are not venomous, but, if caught, bite severely. There is another variety of lizard (called areehuehe) which is small-sized, not exceedting two or three inches in length, and of a brilliant colour, being purple striped with gold, but exceedingly venomous: they do not easily enter the towns, and are only seen in the fields and roads. Poisonous insects are by far the greatest pests of all. Svorpions, large poisonous bugs, and centipedles, are very numerous on the coast and middle land, but are not found in the cool regions. There is al o a sort of sp)ider (called eassanpulya, not resembling the tarantala, having the body of a blue colour, small legs, and working a large and strong web), which is said to have the power of poisoning any animal by means of its urine. From the mere touch of it several people have (lied; and the only remedy, it is said, is to immerse them in water till i they are nearly choked. Bees abound in the woods, making their nests in the hollow branches of trees, which the natives frequently cut down, and hang outside their houses, where7 the bees continue to work (Iuite contentedly: there are a great variety of species, many without stings; and there is another insect, with long legs and small body, called doncella, which miakes honey and bright yellow wax. Ants are in most parts eseedingly numerous and tile city of San Salvador appears as if it were built on a large ant-nest : they swarm in all the houses, and every description of food, not carefully protected, is in a short time covered with them. A large description of brown ankt (called sonpopes) are very numerous in the fields, and exceedingly destructive to the cochiaeal planta. tions and the young maize-plant, as they come in swarms, and In a few (lays eat up all the young shoots. Volcanoes abound. We extract an extremel] interesting account of the author's visit to Till. VOLCANO OF TORM ENTOS. The volcano of Tormentos is much the highest of the three, and its name is derived from its being nearly always covered by dark heavy clouds of black smoke, through which scattered gleams of fire are seen at night; but its top is rarely visible, being always concealed by sulphury vapours and dense smoke. Now and then, loud reports, like broken peals of thunder, and frequent shocks of earthquake, proceed from it. About eight a. m. we reached the small village of Apacaga, which is about two leagues distant, in a direct line from the foot of the volcano to which we proceeded (leaving our horses at the village) as direct as the rugged and broken nature of the country would permit; but we did not reach it till the sun had considerably declined to the horizon. We commenced the ascent amidst broken and charred rocks, intermixed with cinders and broken l)ieces of lava. After about two hours' hard toil we approached the part of the mountain which is covered with smoke; and the dis. F cordant noises we heard as we approached it i became loud and terrific, while the ground shook as with one continued earthquake. Of a sudden ve were enveloped amidst the smoke, and heard a loud ex1)losion, which scattered ashes all nround, us. Iy guide exclaimed, '" () santissima 'Maria, soinus perdidos "' Oh most holy Mary, ve are lost !) and called out to me, " For God's sake, let us return if it be poossible :" but I felt so strong a curiosity to go on that I would not be deterredt; so I answered, "Go back if you like ; nothing shall prevent my going forward." Scrambling up like a cat among the cinders, which were ill soniw places so hot as to hurn my shoes-jndl guiding miys-lf by the f{lashes of lightning wvhlicl plaN ed about tile volcano, and the direction from lvh,1i thle loudlet noises proceeel d, as the smnoke entircly obscured tile vision-I sl(owy ascended i :ong the lava anal vinders; vbhich, however, occupied a good deal of tine ; and, in my eagerness to Ipcnetrate into the strange scenic before me, I did niot retltct that the day must be p)asing. At last, a lurid glare penetrating from amongst the smoke, and the increased proximity and brilliancy of the flashes of lightning, accompanied by a noise like that of the burning of an immense furnace, shewed my near approach to the grand centre of the volcano. I slowly proceeded towards it; but at last feeling exhausted by my exertions, I sat down on a block of lava, and began to eat a piece of bread I carried in rny pocket: but I was roused by a tremendous explosion, louder than any thunder I ever heard; an immense lurid flame rose from the crater, the intense light of which seemed to penetrate the smoke and illuminate all the neighbouring country. The ground felt as if sinking below me. I felt myself thrown with violence among the ashes, and lay for some time stunned with the noise and blinded with the light. When, after a little, I recovered my ob - servation, I heard the smothered roar of the volcano near, but faint, and saw the smoke slowly rising from the crater; the rocking of the ground had ceased, and the eruption seemed to have passed over. Here and there a twinkling star appeared through the vapour, and the moon was for a moment seen now and then through the smoke: the dread solemnity of the scene might make an impression on the least sentimental. I sat still some time, as it were bewildered, looking at the red glare of the crater, which appeared like the chimney of a huge furnace. 1 then attempted to approach its edge; but the heat and suffocating vapours prevented my reaching it within about twenty or thirty yards. Being aware that it would be impossible to find my way atnong the precipices forming the sides of the mountain at night, I waited till the grey light penetrating through the smoke announced the approach of day; and, having found a more accessible path than that by which I had ascended, emerged from the smoke just as the sun wvas rising clear behind the eastern hills, and the sky of an azure blue, without the least speck or cloud. In about two hours more I reached the rugged plain below the mountain of thunders, and wending my way to the village, found my guide waiting, though, it api peared, with little hope of again seeing me. Nor must wve onit his brief description of THE MINES. The natives of Tegucigalpa are among the best class of people in Central America; and as, from the most authentic statements I have been able to collect, its neighbourhood would appear to possess natural stores of the precious metals, even exceeding those of the celebrated mines of Potosi, in Bolivia, it would appear a very good speculation for a scientific and practical miner, supported with sufficient capital, to attempt their working; perhaps the best adventure now to be found in Spanish America. The ores generally contain from twelve to fifteen per cent. of silver, and from one to one and a half per cent. of gold ; but the latter metal is also found pure in many places, and the value of some thou. sand dollars is annually collected by the Indians in the sands of the rivers,-pieces of gold weighing as much as five or six pounds being occasionally discovered. Traces of gold and silver are found in | nearly all the mountainous parts of Honduras, which, as before stated, formn nearly the whole of the state, and, were they examined by competent persons, no doubt most valuable discoveries would be made. From the vicinity of all parts of this state to the ports of the Atlantic, it possesses great advantages over the interior of Mexico, Colombia, and Bolivia ; but the unsettled state of the government, and the wretched condition of the roads, certainly form a great objection. Is any reader inclined to hazard the apeculation ? Further on we light upon another unpleasant narrative of the troubles of TlA.\LLIANG IN CENTI:RAL AMERICA. We entered Guatemala by the gate called Guarda Provincial, a little before sunset. After seeking about for lodgings an entire hour without success, I was forced, on the night setting in, to take up my quarters at one of the miserable public-houses, called mesones, and serving as the residences of mule-drivers and native petty dealers. My dormi- ' if tory was a small dirty room without a window; c and its furniture comprised an old deal table, a it broken chair, and a raw ox-skin stretched on a it frame, to serve as a place for sleeping, here called a b bed, though possessing none of the requisites usually n considered as belonging to that luxurious piece of furniture in Europe, and as hard as stone. In spite of being pretty tired, as might be expected after a c journey of 130 odd leagues over Central American roads with a rough tottering mule, the nature of my couch, combined w ith the attacks of innume. rable fleas and all sorts of biting insects, proved as effectual an antidote of sleep as ever (lid the magic rod of Mercury. At daylight I got up in a complete fever, and found the old man who passed for my servant (though really lie had served me in no- , thing but to shew me the road), sleeping like a hog 3 on the pavement outside my door, wrapped up in my poncho, which is a long figured blanket, with a hole in the middle to put the head through, and an 1 indispensable article with all the natives of Central America. With some difficulty I roused him up; and, after a great deal of explanation, got, in about two hours' time, a cup of what was called coffee, though it had no resemblance to that pleasant drink as prepared in other parts of the world, a plate of a description of black kidney beans, called frijoles, and scraps of meat fried in rancid hog's lard. The | two latter I sent away, and, after wasting another hour in explanations, succeeded at last in obtaining two boiled eggs and a roll of bread. The woman who brought them was in agony at not having been allowed to daub them over with hog's lard, and P could not help exclaiming, " Que jeute san los Ingleses !" (What extraordinary people these 1 English are !) T may mention, that the word !I " Ingles" (Englishman), is applied to all strangers, except Spaniards, in Central America. And more barbarous even than the roads I and inns are THE PEOPLE OF CENTRAL AMERICA. In the towns, not one in ten can read or write, and in many parts of the country, not one in a'' thousand. In many villages containing some thousand inhabitants, no person is to be found who can read; and when a traveller is compelled to shew his passport to the alculde, who is the first civil and criminal judge, he is generally requested to read it. l Morality is at the lowest ebb among all classes, especially the whites and creoles; indeed, I could never find that among them any disgrace was attached to any sort of crime except petty larceny. Murder, perjury, forgery, and swindling of all sorts are considered as quite venial. The priests are, for the n.ost part, blind leaders of the blind; and the better educated merely consider themselves as actors, whose business it is to extort money by acting the part which will please the people. Forms and religious parade are carefully kept up, but no one thinks of inculcating private morality or even de. cency. The marriage ceremony is also, as might be expected, considered merely as a form to keep up public decency, anad both man and wife act in private as they please. I never have found any native of Central America who would admnit that there could be any vice in lying; and when one has succeeded in cheating another, however gross and in. famous the fraud may be, the natives will only remark, " Quekhombrerivo!" (what a clever fellow!) All classes are addicted to gambling, and far more money changes hands in this manner than in commerce or any legitimate business. Nearly all the Guatemala merchants, who are the only ones possessed of any capital, have commenced their career with some rascality. One of the richest of them was some years ago, when in bad circumstances, sent to look after a quantity of very valuable goods which had been abandoned by the carriers in some revolutionary panic; but, instead of restoring the goods to their owner, he altered the marks, and so mixed them together that when they came to Guatemala they could not be identified; there he managed to keep the greater part, by selling which he at once accumulated a good capital for commencing business; and being a shrewd dealer, and above all, a successful gambler, he has realised what is in Central America a large fortune, and he is a courted by all the Belize merchants. Concubiniage I is common amonlg all possessed of any wealth; nor I is this, as in other countries, done secretly, if at all ;I but even wives will publicly speak of their husbands' mistresses. I And with this wve reluctantly close a valuable contribution to geography.

The Bookman 6 : 34 121 - 121
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A CRUEL DILEMMA. By Mary H. Tennyson. 3 vols. (F. Warne.) Three closely printed volumes full of plot, and yet the plot, though well made, would have been more effective in narrower space. The characters are drawn after elementary patterns. The vain, stupid baronet, tricked by the innocentfaced, sweet-mannered adventuress, the adventuress's blackbrowed, oblique-eyed, villainous accomplice, the baronet's worthy and most accomplished daughter, the victim of much cruel scheming, need little description and few opportunities for revealing all that is in them. In one thin volume ' A Cruel Dilemma' would have made a good bookstall story; the poisoning attempts would then have been near enough to the daughter's flight from home, and to her subsequent starvation in London and rescue by her lover, and to the final rout of all the wicked, to have ensured a wakeful hour. Miss Tennyson has ready invention, and simple characters she presents vividly. If she would but aim after brevity, she might be a very popular writer of sensational romance.

LITERARY. THE POET AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE. Tke Post at the Breakfast Table. By Oliver Wendell Holmes. Routledge and Sons. Beaders of ' The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table' and <The Professor at the Breakfast Table' will heartily welcome the thud and last volume of 'The Breakfast Table Series,' whioh is certainly equal, and perhaps in some respects superior, to either of its predecessors. In'The Poet at the Breakfast Table' we have the same blending of wit, humour, fancy, philosophical speculation, shrewd, kindly observation of human character, and out-of-the-way scientific and literary research, that rendered the first issue of Dr Holmes's discursive, conversational essays so widely popular on both sides of the Atlantic. As versatile, copious, rich, and animated as ever, the essayist's tone seems to have grown even more genial and human than it was before, and geniality and keen human sympathy have always been prominent characteristics of Dr Holmes's works. It might be supposed that the change we perceive is sufficiently accounted for by the fact that it is " the Poet," and neither " the Autocrat" nor " the Professor " who acts as reporter of the conversations recorded in this latest volume. But although " the Poet " is the narrator, a very large proportion of the most important dialogue and monologue the book contains is spoken by a " Master of Arts," whose pursuits are decidedly not peculiarly favourable to the development of the emotional nature, and the utterances of the latter exhibit the same increased mellowness of feeling and maturity of thought as those of the former. Besides, the personality of the author of 'The Breakfast Table Series' enters largely into the composition of all his characters, and makes itself more or less manifest in each. They are not dramatic creations, and of this he is himself fully aware. In an epilogue, which prophetically describes the purchase at an old book stall, a century hence, of a complete copy of his ' Breakfast Table Essays,' for one dime, Dr Holmes criticises his own work, under cover of the buyer, of course, in a playful style, but with commendable impartiality, judgment, and good taste. He frequently indulges in self-criticism, we may remark, and has uncommon qualifications for the successful performance of that difficult task. " What have I rescued from the shelf ? " he makes the book-hunter of 1972 exclaim, after an hour's reading of the dime's worth : A Boswell writing ont himself! For though he changes dress and name The man beneath is still the same, Laughing or sad, by fits and starts, One actor in a dozen parts. And whatsoe'er the mask may be, The voice assures us This is he. The dramatis personal that figure in these essays, however, are not mere puppets, endowed only with a superficial and mechanical semblance of life and movement, although they are not full-rounded, self-sustaining creations. It is body and substance that they lack, rather than soul, and those of them that are not shadowy outlines altogether bear so strong a family likeness to each other that any marks of distinctive individuality they may possess scarcely attract attention. Nevertheless they answer their purpose admirably, by enabling the writer to depict and speculate on men and things from various points of view, and we willingly overlook their defects as dramatic conceptions in consideration of the valuable services they render to their author and to us. With the good-natured critic of 1972, we are, in this case, inclined to say : What matters if the figures seen Are only shadows on a screen, He finds in them his lurking thought, And on their lips the words he sought, Like one who sits before the keys And plays a tune himself to please. It is 'not with the speakers, accordingly, but with their speeches, that we are chiefly concerned; and in these the variety of the themes touched upon, and of the aspects and fights in which they are handled, presents a striking contrast to the uniformity of character of the person- ages who deal with them. Dr Holmes is a things-ingeneral philosopher, interesting himself in theology, the physical, mental, and moral sciences, professional and commercial life, past and present manners and fashions, politics, belles letires, religion, ftc, and looking at all subjects with the eye of a philosopher, as well as with the eye of a humourist. He never attempts an exhaustive treatment of any question, but the remarks he makes are frequently penetrating and highly suggestive. There are certain large subjects that possess a peculiar attraction for him, and to which he returns again and again. One of the best of his earlier poems, it may be remembered, contained an eloquent and passionate protest against one of the cardinal doctrines of the popular theology. He reverts to the subject more than once in the volume before us, as he has done in each of its predecessors, but he has never touched it more happily than in ' The Poet at the Breakfast Table.' Thus he says: Justice, at least as between the Infinite and the finite, has been so utterly dehumanised, disintegrated, decomposed, and diabolised in passing through the minds of the half-civilised banditti who have peopled and unpeopled the world for some score of generations, that it has become a mere algebraic x, and has no fixed value whatever as a human conception. As for power, we are outgrowing all superstition about that. We have not the slightest respect for it as snch, and it is just as well to remember that in onr spiritual adjustments. We fear power when we cannot master it; bat just as far as we can master it, we make a slave and a beast of burden of it without hesitation. On the theological notions of " Nature " and " Grace," and the bearing of the Darwinian hypothesis upon them, the "Master of Arts" delivers a very interesting and instructive discourse, from which we make the following extracts: One of our old boarders?the one that called himself " The Professor," I think it was?said some pretty audacious things about what he called " pathological piety," as I remember, in one of his papers. And here comes along Mr Galton, and shows ia detail from religious biographies that u there is a frequent correlation between an unusually devout disposition and a weak constitution." Neither of them appeared to know that John Banyan had got at the same fact long before them. He tells us, " The more healthy the lusty man is, the more prone he is unto evil." If the converse is true, no wonder that good people, according to Banyan, are always in trouble and terror, for be says, " A Christian man is never long at ease; When one fright's gone, another doth him seize." If invalidism and the nervous timidity which is apt to go with it are elements of spiritual superiority, it follows that pathology aod toxicology should form a most important part of a theological education, so that a divine might know how to keep a parish in a state of chronic bad health in order that it might be virtuous. ? It is a great mistake to think that a man's religion is going to rid bim of his natural qualities. "Bishop Hall" (as you may remember to have seen quoted elsewhere) " prefers Nature before Grace in the Election of a wife, because, saith he, it will be a hard Task, where the Natnre is peevish and froward, for Grace to make an entire conquest while Life lasteth." "Nature " and " Grace" have been contrasted with each other with them,?that congenital gift which good Bishop Hall would look for in a wife,?is attributed to ** Nature." In fact ?' Nature " and M Grace," as handled by the scholastics, are nothing more nor less than two hostile Divinities in tbe Pantheon of post classical polytheism. What is the secret of the profound interest which " Darwinism " has excited in the minds and hearts of more persons than dare to confess their doubts and hopes? It is because it restores " Nature " to its place as a true divine manifestation. It is that it removes the traditional curse from that helpless infant lying in its mother's arms. It is that it lifts from the shoulders of man the responsibility for the fact of death. It is that, if it is true, woman can no longer be taunted with having brought down on herself the pangs which make her sex a martyrdom. If development upward is the general law of the race; if we have grown by natural evolution out of the cave-man, and even less human forms of life, we have everything to hope from the future. That the question can be discussed without offence shows that we are entering on a new era, a Revival greater than that of Letters, the Revival of Humanity. In another part of this volume, the "Old Master" makes the following concise statement on this subject: "If for the Fall of man, science comes to substitute the Rise of man, it means the utter disintegration of all the spiritual pessimisms which have been like a spasm in the heart, and a cramp in the intellect, of men tor so many centuries." Regarding the scientific study of religion, this worthy has much to say that merits careful attention. For instance: We snow a good deal aboot the earth on which we live. But the study of man has been so completely subjected to oar preconceived opinions, that we have got to begin all over again. We have studied anthropology through theology; we have now to begin the study of theology through anthropology. Until we have exhausted tbe human element in every form.of belief, and that can only be done by what we may call comparative spiritual anatomy, we cannot begin to deal with the alleged extra-human elements without blundering into all imaginable puerilities. If you think for one moment that there is not a single religion in the world which does not come to us through the medium of a preexisting language; and if you remember that this language embodies absolutely nothing but human conceptions and human passions, you will see at once that every religion pre-supposes its own elements as already existing in those to whom it is addressed. There are many equally profound and courageous reflections on the science of religion scattered through this book, but we must refrain from quoting more of them, as the lighter elements in its composition demand notice. It is but just, however, to acknowledge, before leaving this branch of the work, that no writer has ever excelled Dr Holmes in investing a weighty subject with popular interest. The extracts we have made suffer somewhat in this respect from being separated from their context. We can only give a few specimens of the felicitous passages which abound in f The Poet at the Breakfast Table.' Here is a sentence on the vowels and consonants, which shows keen susceptibility to sound and poetic power of expression: There is a fascination in the mere sound of articulated breath ; of consonants that resist with the firmness of a maid of honour, or half or wholly yield to the wooing lips; of vowels that flow and murmur; the peremptory b and/*, the brittle k, the vibrating r, thc insinuating *, the feathery yj the velvety v, the bell-voiced ro, thc tranquil broad a, the penetrating e, the cooing m, the emotional o, and the beautiful combinations of alternate rock and stream, as it were, that they give to the rippling flow of speech,?there is a fascination in the skilful handling of these that the great poets and even prose* writers have not disdained to acknowledge and use to recommend their thought. John Milton's views -on the Woman Question form the subject of a cleverly managed bit of dialogue. The Poet having laid it down that a woman's business was to please, and that a woman " would rather talk with a man than an angel any day," the Young Girl who supports herself by writing novels for the newspapers declares his opinion to bc shocking, and threatens to show him up in one of her next stories. Whereupon the Lady tells the Young Girl that Milton has said the same thing, and sends for 'Paradise Lost' to prove the assertion. The book is brought, a little volume, covered with soft white leather to protect its binding, and the Young Girl reads, blushes, laughs, and slaps the book down, pronouncing John Milton " a horrid man," who " had as many wives as Bluebeard." But the Master wished to see the passage; the book was handed to him, and it was soon found. He read aloud with grand scholastic intonation and in a deep voice that silenced the table as if a prophet had just spoken, Thus saith the Lord :? " So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve Perceiving?" went to water her geraniums, to make a short story of it, and left thc two " conversationists," to wit, the angel Raphael and the gentleman,?there was but one gentleman in society then, you kuow,?to talk it ont, " Yet went she not, as not with such discourse Delighted, or not capable her ear Of what was high ; such pleasure she reserved, Adam relating, she sole auditress; J fer husband the relater she preferred Be/ore the angel, and of him to ask Chose rather; he she knew would intermix Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute With conjugal caresses: from his lips Not words alone pleased her." Everybody laughed, except the Capitalist, who was a little hard of hearing, and the Scarabee, whose life was too earnest for demonstrations of that kind. He had his eyes fixed on the volume, however, with eager interest. ? The p'int's carried,?said the Member of the Haouse. Will you let me look at that book a single minute ??said the Scarabee. I passed it to him, wondering what in the world he wanted of Paradise Lost. Dcrmestes tardarins,?hc said, pointing to a place where thc edge of one side of the outer cover had been slightly tasted by some imcct.?Very fond of leather while they're in thc larva state. The Scarabee is an entomologist who has chiefly confined his attention to the study of the genus Searahaeus, and regrets that he has not done so exclusively, as u the beetles proper are quite enough for the labour of one man's life." He is described as a thin, dry man who carries " a camphorated atmosphere about him, as if to keep the moths from attacking him." He furnishes the occasion for more than one disquisition on specialists, " the coral insects that build up the reefs of science," and on the tendency of science to breed its votaries down too fast into coral-insects. " Nowadays you have a society, and they come together and make a great mosaic, each man bringing his little bit and sticking it in its place, but so taken np with his pretty fragment that he never thinks of looking at the picture the little bits make when they are put together. You can't get any talk out of these specialists away from their own subject, any more than you can get help from a policeman outside of his own beat." One example of Dr Holmes's treatment of another class of men, and we must part from thb pleasant book. A salesman occupies a seat at the Breakfast Table, but seldom takes part in the talk. His silence is thus accounted for by " The Poet," who has been watching and speculating about him for some time: I notice particularly a certain electrical briskness of movement, such as one may see in a squirrel, which clearly belongs to his calling. The dry-goodsman's life behind his counter is a succession of sudden, snappy perceptions and brief series of co-ordinated spasms, as thus:? " Purple calico, three quarters wide, six yards." Up goes the arm; bang ! tumbles out the flat roll and turns half a dozen somersets, as if for the fun of the thing; the six yards of calico hurry over the measuring nails, hunching their backs up, like six cankerworms ; out jump the scissors; snip, clip, rip; the stuff is whisped up, brown-papered, tied, labelled, delivered, and the man is himself again, like a child just come out of a convulsion-fit. Think of a man's having some hundreds of these semi-epileptic seizures every day, and you need not wonder that he does not say much; these fits take the talk all out of him.

It is not one of the least pleasing evidences of the improvement which is gradhualy taking p)11ce in general knowledge, that fromi those very presses whiCh have for so many years poured forth the most insipidi, nay sometimes thle most offensive publications-publications which, (lithised by means of illnumuerable circiulating libraries, have stltitie(l andcl tainted the young felmille indw. in every towvn, village anid hamilet ill tile istln(, now occasionally p)rocee(d works of a very ol)l)osite telldellcvworks c(alculdated( to excite ill those into wvhose hlandis th ev mayv fortuncately fill, a mor aland an intellectiual taste which we are persuad1(le(d will not l)ermlit them to return with their former relish to tile trashl by which their imaginations have been hitherto heated and corrmplte.Of this description is tlhe book I,,,ler our consideration ; the merits of which justly entitle its fair author (whoever She may be) to rank with those aI)le and anliadle benefactors of their sex, and, through their sex, of ours, by whom the present age has been so happily distiniguislhed. 'The story of " Woman," lhas in it no ver! remark able feature. Although sutlicientlt interesting for its purpose, it ha1s apparently not en-nged much of tile attention of the autihor ; and is ilerely th-e thread(l w hichi sustains the pearls-tile vehicle tor tile admiuirable exposition of character, and tile still more adm'irab le inflerences from tilat exl)osition wit,, Which these two little volumes abound. It is one of their most lowerful cllarnms, that Virtue is not (lepictedl With tilat allsterity of visag-e i)y wilich, so many moral painters have callumniated her breauty, and hlave qualified her to take tile place of h1er antagonist in the (listich of tile poet: Vice is a monster of suelh hideous incen, As to be hlated needs hlut to he seen." Candour and good temper are tile qualities most strongly ilnsistedI on; and in tile doulestic incidents, and nitilul intercourse of several neighbouring but contrasted families, are found tile mieanis of showving the inestimable value of those qualities. Without enumerating VOL. It. all the (Iruaintis persona', or attemp)ting to enter into any thing like an analysis of the work, we shall quote, for the gratilicatioi of 01 o11 readers, a few of the ipassages which appear to us to be the Ilost striking. Mlrs. IEgcrton, the heroine of the tale, is thus descriljed 1lelena, wvas onc of those ivlo believed that stch innumerabl - affections weore engrafted in the human licart-not to w ither, uinknowvii and unexerted, bit to bjestowv the nirest joys of life.

Igerton, tilat baffled all his effroitery: a(l realiv, to do(himn justice, dail All ronlimcad, Esq. i;had no small share of that uiality. Ih short, at tile cll of a fewv wveels, the gentlemnall wvas compelled to beat a retreat, to resciue himself from the disgrace of capitulation; i"steadl of being the conqueror, lie found himnself the conquered; instead of having to boast hiis power, he ha(l to feel her mercv; iiisteadl of gaining her heart, he foun(d he had lost his owvn. It wvas evcr afterwards amusing? to see the discomfited beau in the resncinee of the woman whose light hove li VIad so confidenitly anticipated to gain-his eve sinkingl beneath her calu glance, his cheek reddening at her slightest coimilllent. The reflections whieh immediately follow are full of iml)ortant matter for female med(itation : Mrs. Egertoni is no favourite of ours, as may readfily be supposed ; her tame virtues hieingr mnore calculated to embellish the spiritless secenes of domestic life, than to gild the pages of a novel. She did miothing worthy publicity- nothing that could be talked of; her favourite motto was, " Privacy is tIme sphere of woman."-tHer conduct, therefore, towar(ls Adam Wronghiea(l, Esq1. we can neither applaud nor justify; for what harmncan possibly arise from a wife giving gracious encouragement to the innocent familiiarities of her bachelor acquaintance-lolling on the arm of one, and strikilmi another with her fani-looking grave when no harni is in'cnded, to show she was thinking of what might have been intendedl; and laughingg at palpable rudeness, to prove her forgiving goodnature, vithl a laudable (dis4lain of the maxim ascribed to Cwsar-" It is not enough for a wvoman to be virtuous; Fhe must also appear so."-We can recollect only two rat/er disagreean le consequemices likely to cnsue fiom such petty trifling. First, tIme chance of giving pain to a husband -andl what womimami of spirit cares for that ? Nav, if the silly inan chooses to be jealous, this is the best mode of curingiimn; for since jealousy cannot exist without love, the deuce is in it if by destroying his love lhe will not also be cured of his jealousy.Secondly, the general opinion that the most ah)an(lone(l proifigatc will not presume to violate a female's delicacy by a look, a wvor(l, an act, of undue freedrm, if that femiale does not, by the before-mentioned levitv, give licence and encouragement to his tolhly. Hence such pretty trifling is leemed too otten the precursor of deeper error; and the 'voman who begins with excusing levity, too often finishes by participating guilt.-IPrilwph it is as trellfor her to avoid both thI eliances; the risk-of her hIusband's peace and attachment-of her own virtue and happimess!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE MAKING OF A PRIG, By Evelyn Sharp. 3s. 6J. (Lane.) She wasn't a prig, judged by any definition we have ever understood. Even Mliss Sharp's elaborate treatise on prigdom doesut convince us. She was an emotional, unconventional, somewhat insolent, rather poor-spirited, but lively-mannered young modern woman, obviously quite unfit to live a day alone without being overtaken by blackest misery, who pursued a conceited, unattractive young man with childlike frankness for years, refused him when her chance came, and then relented, of course. It is alf very natural and ordinary. The best part of it is certainly the lovers' quarrelling, which is well done. The next best is the photograph of the slangy, utterly commonplace, good-hearted Ted. His language is indescribably barbaric; and we fear it is correctly reported. There is no other very striking portrait in the book. Aunt Esther and Mrs. Keeley are caricatures. Paul is represented by a veil which hides something-god or bully. Katharine, as the young woman who does not know what she wants, who is always attempting sacrifices she would not have the strength to carry out, is cleverly suggested. Indeed the whole story is unmistakably clever, but just a trifle aimless.

REVIEWS OF NEW BOOKS. NVarrative of a Y)chtl- 1oyage in thet lftditerra- I )neall dbUrimg tihe Years 1840, 1841. 2 vols. J. Murray. IUP with the anchor ! Yo, heave yo! Flap go the sails, rattle goes the tackling, splash goes t the how, and offwe are in a fine yacht schooner, c thei Dolphin, of 217 tons, on a twelvemonthi's S cruise in the blue 'Mediterranean. We stil c troin Plymouth on the 2(1 of October, IS1l() s (see log); and on Nov. 10, 18 11, accor(ding to t ditto, we are back, and landed safe and sountl in " Old England again." Of course you would like to know something of our party and crew ; r anmd we may therefore tell you that the owner, the Earl Grosvenor, his Lady and four childrtn, attended by a maid and man-servant, were the passengers; and that the crew, including calptain, mate, &c., aniounted to sixteen hands. 'The3e are the broad facts of the voe age, which it is the office of the Literary G(tzette to review. To review a regiment, or even a batallion, is a comparatively easy every-day work; but to review a yacht and its evolutio, -, especially to I at landsman, is no sinecure. - ?aking generally, or rat her, in such a cast , admirally, we I "ight observe that yachitingT appears to he a I peculiarly fitting- pursuit for an Englishman. A great naval island laden with glories from the sea, the sight of the fair, noble, anti wealthy sharing that as a healthful pleasure which is accompanied by so much of toil and danger to those who are engaged in the same manner in the career of commerce, or the service of their country, is at once a gratification anti a stimuItS. It reconciles the merchant to his privatilUq, and the sailor to his sacrifices; cheers the waking nighlt, and lulls tIme roaring storm. There (dashtes away the Earl in his little craft vwhy should they repine ? Jael hitchies upl his trousers, and turns heartily to his (luty. In a national point of view, therefore, we lhave ever thought well ol yaclititg; thoughl it must be confessed that our admiration has been limited to thre shore or port, or at farthest to tlte river, from London to Sheerness being, the extent of our navigation in any vessel ot this class. With regard to horse-racing, also a heneficial national pursuit, it is liable to be so deformned and corrupted by fraud and gamlbling, thlat whilst we look to its good results iii the iil)orovenient of the breeds of the useful anrd splendid animial, we are reluctantly coi- I pelled to admit of the disgracetilt drawbacks which seem to be so inscparably connected with the system. Not so in vyachting. 'There is nothing sordid nor contaminating in tltat nainly and thoroughlly British recreation ; and wltetlter it is the peer, the gentleman, or the i merchant, whiom we see " ruliig the waves" tnrder the red-cross flag, we hIail thiem as true sous of the ocean-cradled isle, antd the setters of excellent example to the rest of its amphibiutts people. " A tossinug slip and a rolling sea," the noble writer tells us in her preface, are not the most convenient adjuncts to journalising; but as we itever experienced any such inconveniences on hoard Mr. 11. lBoyd's beautiful Wanderer in the '[hanies, we trust thlat we shall be able to journalise our part in a satist'actory way. As the soti r says-poor I! old Dibdin !- a Wve lived tt' jolyv tars w e loved buimbo and 1ii i But *ve did Inot like r.,'kiii. about,'' 'Tile tone in which the volumes are inscribed f to the Right Hlonourable Thomas Grenville, at s once p)repossessetl us in their t ivour.

To such ani individual, the author, Lady Grosvenor, writ.,s:* I must remnind you that not having staved t any where long enoug ft to make observations i ' of' mucihl research aild consequiitt v'alue, imy only lhop)e canl be to ive yo aUA few !hoIr.' anusement, Without attempting to add a voW nine to your liibrary.

Whatever is sai(l of these places is written in a very a treeable style. 'Thc recollections ofatncient hiistory are periw mlobg enoug h for tlhose previousily aeq1oai it-1 withl thein, thlouglh they are *eVl I calclated( to interest the ltiss of' readers; but, tO us, tile accounts ot existilia circumstances .;id lhre'.ct~ anecdotes, all vviniinge tih best feeling ;nid taste, are the chiet' tharims of the " N irrtive ;of' which we shIa!l nox offer a few brief' examples. Lishon and Cadiz were the first ports at i which tile Dolphin anchored; andl fromn the latter, tile atitltor ascendled theL ( Coal(l liuivir to Sevillfe. 'lihe silver river does not shine very brillianttly in ler ndescription. "' 'The distanize from ('adliz to Sevillo bv thle Guadalquivir is about seventy miles. 'lTit, IIrilles were stopped to ao ) tlit a luiarter of' ait hlour to wait for thle clearing away ot' a fog, previous to passriug shallow bar of s.tnd cl .CIO i tile mIouith of' the river. At some distance is , the port of St. Lucar, vwhere we stopped a few, ',minlutes to disenmbtark and taLe ill p issengers. F*ine orange-groves, witlh a hew pIlitt-trees in flower, were growing in tile bare sanl( oUil the banks. As we pr'oceedled, the siles of tlte river were abSOlttf Iy hideous, exhtihititig )ct'fectly flat antd boundleiss districts of hb rdlind iMiud, with a few largc droves of cows anidl horses grazing on a very scanty veggetptiat : it altosgether gave thle idea of the hanks of the Nile tafter the inundation. 'The ntumtihr of birds iwas something prodigious; lherons, plovers, ducks of various kinds, snipes, kites, eagles, and flocks of unknown species. The water ot the river is very mnuddy; and in winter it overilows it banks, which become to a great extent one larage swamp, as could easily be perceived from their present condition. There were several sinall I English merchantiten, chiefly schoonrrs, at anchor in the river, a few miles blilow Seville. waitingl ftr a supply of oranges, %%hich grow ripe iui the course of the winter, but were not as yet qluite ready for .xportation. They do iiot, ho1wever, give them titne to arrive at mlaturity, as the early oranlg-s are packed hile still quite green, and ripen durinir their vo;izre to England with the hothouse action of tit ir cases. We reached Se-ville at half-past tftir ;.M. an(, after a punctiliouis examination of the hair-age by the custom-house officers, klikernnibrle'd near tile lorre del Oro, an old tower, said to be Roiwan, with twelve sides. 'l me ;.pproachl to Seville from mile river is disappointinur, as you hardly h;erceive even the towcr of La (iiralda till you are very near it and the town bhein- on a llat, there is no vininunce or distinguishing point to mark; it; anti it ia not till voti enter the gates thiat its old Iriandeur, and its still existilmi lsin'rularitv and charmn, ar1 discovered.."

If they would eat loss, a4id adhere to their national costume, nothing, could be prettier or more graceful thian the ir general appearance, shrouLed under the black mantilla." Front Cadi, our yacht visited Tang.i r, Gibraltar, and Mlalaga; the party making anl excursion from the latter over tile mountains to Granada. The journey is not Withlout great fatigue and risk from tile lawless habits of the population; but our travellers got safely through and alive, to hear the tale of a singular tragedy in Granada itself, as thius related bv thle consul: Mr. Annesley told us tlie following story of an event which happened here on the 2 Ith of October, 1839); and as lhe was personally concerned, it shall be repeated ill his own words: -* An Englishman had for sonie time resided in Barelona, who taught English, and gave lessons to my children; he was associate] with a Frenchman, who also instricted several families ; and these two lived together in a house with a Swiss jeweller; theli had no servant, and none but these three occupicd tih manlsion. 'hlie jeweller suddenly disappeared ; lie was no where to be found, and no trace remained of him, and there was no appeal to the police, as they never take any trouble in such cases. One morning the uig lishinan came to my house, and begged to see me. I found h im hardly able to speak; and what lie did sav was so incoherent, I faincied lie had either been drinikiny. or had lost his senses. Ile stated that what lie had to impart was so dreadtul, he could not bring himself to relate it. However, by degrees, hlit became more intellizible, and after a great maity small details, I collected that in the room lie occupied with the Frenchman there wa9 a small closet, with an opening in it to admit light fron tile room near the ceilingt. The nigit before, as lie was sitting alone, he fahcied lie perceived a disagreeable smell in tiat lpart of' the room ; lie tried to open the door ot the closer, hUt fo0Und it locked; lie then climbed upon a chair, and With a cand(le looked in at the little opening,, and, to his lhorror, saw a corpse in frazinenits on the tlor; part of a leg in one place, n.ii arm in another, and a large sledge-hainnier lyiig by tieni ; lie nearly dropped with horror; and at that nioment (it was just twelve o'clock) lie lhard tlhe knock of tie Frenchman at tihe door. As they were alone in the house, lie had no resource but to appear as calm and easy as tf lie lidl seen nothinr. h'ilen lle let h;imu ;Y1, lie re. marked that lie w*as late that nigilt, as li had to begin giving his lessons early the nxt inorning-, which was Motid1V ; the other answered, Oh, it does not happen otten, never itindt;' and they wenlt to bed. 'Their two beds were so close that they were only sepirated by a little division at the head. The nian said that the agony in wiich lie h)assel t'wi night w:as indescribable, as, in addition to the original lhorror of tinding the dead bodv, lie dreaded tiat the Frenchman would suspect his heingr aware 'if it, and mntirder him also ; and t- re was no escape from tile house, nor means to call fir help. In this dreadful state'lie remnaitted till morning, vwhene thme Frenchman Oilln r Out to give his lessons, tie other rushled stiaight to iny house to apprise mie of what had happeted. I was muh l puzzled whlat to do, as the police, I knew, would give very little assistance. However, after taking down his statemient shortly in writing, I applied there. They said they could have nothing to do wvitlt it; nndL as tile supposed criminal was Frentch, I niust go to tile French consull. AIl thev %otduil do was to give ele a little liuml)-m:Lked lunau, to assist iu catclhing tle mnurderkr. I went to the French CoTistil; and atter conferring with him we procceed(l to.,ethtr, with our humnp-hacked comallioii, tn the hiouse where the El tig IshmanI lived. We went up-stairs, and tfouil the Frenchman at his door. W'e told hdim there was a little mnatter to be settled with tile police, on which lhe answerod Alt oui ! pour la contrehande, n'est-ce pas ' (lie had a good deal to do with the contrabandista concerns), and rushed to a table, pulled, open a drawer, from whence we saw him extract a pIair ot pistols, which proved to be loaded ; lie, however, seemed to lose his hlead and be (1uite bewillered, saying, I II s'agit de ces pistolets, n'estce pas ' ils sont Fraittais, et tie la contrebande.' lie then put his hland tartiler into tile drawer, and was dra-intr out a sword, when my colleague and I spran'g upon and seizeti him. The hump-backed man then said it was rnot that we wanted, but that we must have him open the door of the closet he turned (leadly pale, and drawing himself uip with a )eculiar emphasis and theatrical air, exclaimed, ' Trts volontiers, monsieur.' lie then instantly rushed to the open window, and from the balcony (lashietl himself to the ground ;-it was a fourth story, and lie (lied in twelve hours after. lie would nmIke no confession ; but frejiientl v repeated, j in a sort of delirium, ' 11 est coupe en petits morceaux.' The investigationl of t'tb Mutilated corpse, which l)roved to be that of the jeweller, was dreadful. Under the coat of the Frenchimnan was found, close to his side, a small hatciet and an enormous knife, with which. lie must have lacked and hewed tie dead body, to carry portionis of it from the houise when lie went out, as the only way in which lie could dispose of it. It was supposedl he had killed the man witil the sledge-hammer which was found in tie closet. None of tim jeweller's property was ever found or heard of'.' Tlhe D)olphiin's next loft was at Barcelona, at present but too famous, In IS 1I we are told of a very diitlerent sort of scene:In tIme evening, we returne( to tile general's garden, and bv a long- alamieda to the wvallIs. There was -reat excitement ini thii: part ofthe town, cieated by inimense flocks of turkeys, which were promenadin- about on some waste gzround, each flock directed anl occasional lv thrashed bv six or sEvemi peasants (tile number being proportioned to tme size of the flock), woO, surrounded by crowdls of peoIple, were adnonishmitig their chargre witih lonbu caties.

Mr. Pisistratus Broicn, M.P., in the Highlands. OUR LIBRARY TABLE. (Macmillan & Co.) The hero of these lively and amusing chapters is a quiet middle-aged member of the majority in the House of Commons. He has left the affairs of the nation to take care of themselves rather too soon, and is recruiting his health in the Highlands under the pretence of studying the grievances of clerks in the Customs. Of course the papers on that subject are never seriously opened, and the hon. member's constant allusions to them merely serve as fresh excuses for idleness. In the company of a Conservative M.P. (with whom he has most probably paired), Mr. Brown shoots deer, grouse, and a solan, and has many other adventures. We have an amusing description of a " corpulent little figure dancing a wild fandango of delight" after a successful shot, and on other occasions the excitement into which Mr. Brown is betrayed imparts much spirit to the volume. Having performed the marvellous feat of shooting a stag through the hind legs, Mr. Brown rushes up to the prostrate animal and strikes wildly at its head with the butt of his friend's rifle. There is another laughable scene, when a discussion between the two members about the House of Lords is interrupted by the appearance of a solan. Mr. Brown breaks in upon his friend's argument by a hurried exclamation; his friend does not resent this lack of courtesy ; all eyes are turned upon the huge bird, which flies slowly towards the yacht, and is soon floating dead on the water. But the climax of the whole book occurs when Mr. Brown is tempted to put on a kilt, and when a dog, shocked at " the unusual spectacle of his niilkwhite calves," flies at him with fury. We are happy to say that Mr. Brown manages to escape this danger, and that he returns to England none the worse for any of the incidents of his trip. By this time he may possibly have mastered the Custom - House grievance, and we hope that the speech he will make on bringing that question before the House will be as amusing as this record of his adventures.

Thc Hrorks of Robert Burns. (Continued from Vol. XXIX. p. 409. New Arr.J JDURNS arrived in Edinburgh in the month of November, 1786. His reception in thc capital of Scotland was highly flattering. The literary and the fashionable world united in teftifying their admiration of his talents. Among thofe who cheriihed the rustic basel by their countenance and Support arc enrolled the refpectable names of the late Dr. Robertfon, Dr. Blair, Dr. Gregory, Mr. Mackenzie, Mr. Frazer Tytler, and though laft, not thc leaft in well-earned fame, Mr. Dugald Stewart. Though the fociety of thefe excellent characters mu ft have tended to enlarge the Sphere of Burns's knowledge, and to cultivate his tafwe, the benefit which he derived from this fignal .advantage was unfortunately more than counterbalanced by the intemperate indulgences into which he was betrayed by the thoughtless and diflipated, who deemed the participation of the luxuries of the table a fufficient recompenfe for the company of a man of genius. Burns was naturally prone to excefs in feftive indulgences; and the unceafing round of diflipation ld which he was introduced in the gay circles of the Scottish metropolis, gave lilli more Seductive chasms to thofe intemperate pleafures, whofe lefs-refined allurements had too frequently overpowered his virtuous refolutions. They were certainly not very confiderate friends of the future excifeman who gave him a r eli (li for the gilded vices of genteel life. In a pecuniary point of view, Burns turned his journey to Edinburgh to good account. He took advantage of the rifing tide of popular favour to publish a new edition of his poems, the profits of which enabled him, as his biographer fays, 4 not only to partake of the pleafures of Edinburgh, but to gratify a defire he had long entertained of visiting thoSe parts of his native country moft attractive by their beauty or their grandeur.' Accordingly he Set out on the 6th of May, 1787, on & tour through that part of the G?mntry which is waffled by the Tweed, which may be juftly denominated the daffie ground of Scotland. Having Spent three weeks in this excurlion, he vifited Northumberland, and returned by way of Carlisle and Dumfries to his humble dwelling at Mofseiel. 4 It will eafily be conceived (Says Dr. Currie) with what pleafure and pride he was received by his mother, his brothers, and lifters. He had left them poor, and comparatively friendlefs; he returned to them high in public estimation, and ea fy in his circumstances. He returned to them unchanged in his ardent affections, and ready to Share with them, to the uttermost farthing, the pittance that fortune had beftowed.' Vol. i. p. 167. After a Short refidence with his relations he again proceeded to Edinburgh, whence he immediately Set out on a journey to the Highlands. From the Highlands he returned to Ayrshire, where he Spent the month of July. In Augult he again vi. Sited the metropolis, where, after two more excursions, the one through Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire, the other into the Highlands, he fixed his refidence during the winter of 1787-8, eagerly renewing his intercourse with the learned and the dilii pated. Dr. Currie has recorded the moft interesting occurrences which happened during theSe various peregrinations of the bard; but as they are not fit Subjects for abridgment, wc muft refer fuch of our readers as wilh to trace the footfteps of native genius, to the work itfelf. In the month of February, 1788, Burns, upon fettling his accounts with his publisher Mr. Cicech, found himfelf maftcr of nearly five hundred pounds. Two hundred pounds of this furn he advanced to his brother Gilbert, who had taken upon himfelf the Support of their aped mother. With the remainder he determined to cftablifh himfelf in a farm. He alSo looked forward to the poflibility of increasing his income by tile emoluments of an exciseman's office, which liberal encouragement he had been led to expcCl from the munificent patronage of Caledonian aristocracy. Exhilarated by thefe bright profpeCts, 4 his generous heart,' fays his biographer, 4 turned to the objeCt of his moft ardent attachment, and, liftcning to na considerations but thofe of honour and -affection, he joined with her ina public declaration oi* maniage, thus legalising their union, and rendering it permanent '{or life.' After quoting an interefting extract: from Burns's common^ place book, which gives a detail of his views and refolutioiW at the period of his marriage, Dr. Currie thus proceeds. 4 Under the impulfe of thefe reflections, Burns immediately engaged in rebuilding the dwelling-houfe on his farm, which, in the iiate he found it, was inadequate to the accommodation of his family. On this occasion he himfelf refumed at times the occupation of a labourer, and found neither his ftrength nor his fkill impaired. Pleafed with furveying the grounds he was about to cultivate, and with the rearing of a building that fliould give fhelter ta his wife and children, and, as he fondly hoped, to his own grey hairs, fentiments of independence buoyed up his mind, pictures of domeftic content and peace rofe on his imagination; and a few days paffed away, as he himfelf informs us, the moft tranquil, if not the happieft, which he had ever experienced.' Vol. i. p. 196. But, alas! the airy vifions of future happinefs were foon diflipated. With an eye at once gifted with the penetration of philofophy, and fuffufed with the tear of fenfibility, has the biographer of Burns investigated the progreSs oS his imprudences and of his misfortunes. May the ardent fons of genius profit by the melancholy tale?Felix quern faciunt aliena pcricula cautum. At the time when Burns entered upon his farm at Ellifland, Mrs. Burns was obliged by her situation (being near the time of her delivery) to remain in Ayrfhire. 4 It is to be lamented (fays Dr. Currie) that at this critical period of his life, our poet was without the fociety of his wife and children. A great change had taken place in his situation; his old - habits were broken; and the new circumftances in which he was placed were calculated to give a new direction to his thoughts and conduct. But his application to the cares and labours of his farm was interrupted by Several visits to his family in Ayrfhire; and as the distance was too great for a (ingle day's journey, he generally Spent a night at an inn on the road. On fuch occasions he Sometimes fell into company, and forgot the resolutions he had Sormed. In a little while temptation affailed him nearer horne. 4 His fame naturally drew upon him the attention of his neighbours, and he foon formed a general acquaintance in the district in which he lived. The public voice had now pronounced on the fubjedt of his talents; the reception he had met with in Edinburgh had given him the currency which fafhion bestows; he had furmounted the prejudices arising from his humble birth ; and he was received at the table of the gentlemen of Nithfdalc with welcome,, with kindnefs, and even with refpect. Their focial parties too often feduced him fr6m his rustic labours and his ruftic fare, overthrew the unfteady fabric of his refolutions, and inflamed thofe propenfities which temperance might have weakened, and prudence ultimately Supprefled. It was not long, therefore, before Burns began to view his farm with diflike and defpondence, if not with difguft. 4 Unfortunately he had for feveral years looked to an office in the excife as a certain means of livelihood, fhould his other expectations fail. As has already been mentioned, he had been recommended to the board of excife, and had received the inftruCtion neceSlary for fuch a fituation. He now applied to be employed; and, by the intereft of Mr. Graham of Fintry, was appointed excifeman, or, as it is vulgarly called, gauger, of the diftriCt in which he lived. His farm was after this, in a great meafure, abandoned to fervants, while he betook himfelf to the duties of his new appointment.* Vol. i. p. 197. 4 The confequences may be eafily imagined. Notwithstanding the uniform prudence and good management of Mrs. Burns, and though his rent was moderate and reasonable, our poet found it convenient, if not neceffary, to refign his farm to Mr. Miller, after having occupied it three years and a half. His> office in the excife had originally produced about fifty pounds per annum. Having acquitted himfelf to the fatisfaCtion of the board, he had been appointed to a new diftriCt, the emoluments of which rofe to about Seventy pounds per annum. Hoping to fupport himfelf and his family on this humble income till promotion fhould reach him, he difpofed of his Stock and of his crop on Ellisland by public auCtion, and removed to a fmall houfe which he had taken in Dumfries, about the end of the year 1791. 4 Hitherto Burns, though addicted to excefs in focial parties, had abstained from the habitual ufe of Strong liquors, and his conftitution had not fuffered any permanent injury from the irregularities of his conduCt. In Dumfries, temptations to the fin that fo eafily befet him, continually prefented themSelves; and his irregularities grew by degrees into habits. TheSe temptations unhappily occurred during his engagements in the buSineSs of his oSfice, as well as during his hours of relaxation; and though he clearly forefaw the consequence of yielding to them, his appetites and SenSations, which could not pervert the dictates of his judgement, finally triumphed over the powers of his will. Yet this victory was not obtained without many obstinate Struggles, and at times temperance and virtue Seemed to have obtained the maftery. Befides his engagements in the excife, and the fociety into which they led, many circumstances contributed to the melancholy fate of Burns. His great celebrity made him an objeCt of intereft and curiosity to Strangers, and few perfons of cultivated minds paSTed through Dumfries without attempting to fee our poet, and to enjoy the pleaSure of his convection. As he could not receive them under his own humble roof, thefe interviews paSTed at the inns of the town, and often terminated in thofe exceftes which Burns Sometimes provoked, and was feldom able to resift. And among the inhabitants of Dumfries, and its vicinity, there were never wanting perfons to (hare bis focial pleafures; to lead or accompany him to the tavern ; to partake in the wilded-failles of his wit; to witnefs the ftrength and the degradation of his genius. 4 Still, however, he cultivated the fociety of perfons of tafte and of respectability, and in their company could impofe on himfelf the reftraints of temperance and decorum. Nor was his mufe dorsnant. In the four years which he lived in Dumfries, he produced many of his beautiful lyrics, though it does not appear that he attempted any poem of considerable length.' Vol. i. P. 204. Though the tide of ministerial bounty has certainly in modern times flowed into Scotland with no fcanty ftream, yet we have found that the patronage extended to the moft energetic of her fons was limited to the paltry Situation of a gauger. How indignant mutt be the feelings of every admirer of genius on being apprifed that even this vulgar boon was clogged with an implied ftipulation, that the acceptor, whofe mind was qualified and delighted to range through the widest field of 'intellectual difcufiion, fliould not prefume to differ in politics from the ruling powers. And that this was the cafe is evinced by the following narrative. 4 Burns had entertained hopes of promotion in the excife; but circumftances occurred which retarded their fulfilment, and which in his own mind deftroyed all expectation of their being ever fulfilled. The extraordinary events which ufhered in the revolution of France, interested the feelings, and excited the hopes of men in every corner of Europe. Prejudice and tyranny Seemed about to difippear from among men, and the day-ftar of reafon to rife upon a benighted world. In the dawn of this beautiful morning the genius of French freedom appeared on our Southern horizon with the countenance of an angel, but fpeedily affumed the features of a daemon, and vanished in a fliower of blood. 4 Though previously a jacobite and a cavalier, Burns had (hared in the original hopes entertained of this aftonifliing revolution by ardent and benevolent minds. The novelty and the hazard of the attempt meditated by the firft or Constituent Affembly, Served rather, it is probable, to recommend it to his daring temper ; and the unfettered Scope propoSed to be given to every kind of talents, was doubtlefs gratifying to the feelings of confeious but indignant genius. Burns forefaw not the mighty ruin that was to be the immediate confequence of an enterprife, which, on its commencement, promifed fo much happinefs to the human race. And even after the career of guilt anel of blood commenced, he could not immediately, it may be prefumed, withdraw his partial gaze from a people who had So lately breathed the fentiments of univerfal peace and benignity, or obliterate in his bofom the pictures of hope and of happinefe to which thofe Sentiments had giv^n'birth. Under thefe impreffions, he did not always conduCt himfelf with the circumSpeCtion and prudence which his dependent Situation Seemed to demand. He engaged indeed in no popular aflociations, (o common at the time of which we Speak; but in Company he did not conceal his opinions of public meafures, or of the reforms required in Abe praCtice of our government: andfooietimes, jn his Social and unguarded moments, he uttered them with a wild and unjustifiable vehemence. Information of this was given;to the board of excife, with the exaggerations fo general in fuch caSes. A Superior officer in that department was authorised to inquire into his conduCt. Burns defended himfelf in a letter addrefled to one oS the Board, written with great independence oS Spirit, and with more than his accuftomed eloquence. The officer appointed to inquire into his conduCt gave a favourable report. His Steady friend,;Mr. Graham of Fintr.y, interpofed his good offices in his behalf; and the imprudent gauger was fuffered^ to retain his fituation, but given to underftand that his promotion was deferred, and mufi depend on his future,behaviour. 4 This circumstance made a deep impj-efflon on the mind of Burns. .Fame exaggerated his.mifconduCt, and reprefenfed him as a&ually diSmifled from his office. And this report induced a gen* tleman of much reSpeCtability to propofe* a Subscription in ?his favour. The offer was refufed Ipy our poet \q a.letter of great elevation of feptiment, in which, he gives an ac^opnt of the whoje of this tr^nfaCtion, and defends himfelf from the imputation of disloyal Sentiments on the one hand, and on the o^her from the charge of having made fubmiffions, (for the fake pf his office, unworthy of his character. 44 The partiality of.pty.countrymen," he obferves,, " has brought me forward,as a man <*f genius, and has given me a character to Support. In the poet I hpye avowed manly andindependent Sentiments, which I hope have been Sound in the rpan. ReaSons of no lefs ..weight than the fupport of a wife nnd children tyave pointed out my preSent occupation as the only eligible line of life within rrjy reach. Still my honeft fa,me is my deareft concern, and a thoufand times have I trembled at the idea of the degrading q>ithets that. malice or mifreprefentation may affix to my name. Often in blading anticipation have J liftened to fome future hackney Scribbler, with the heavy malice of favage Stupidity, exultingly afferting that Burns, notwithstanding the fanfaronade of independence to be found in his works, and after having been held up to public view, and to public estimation, as a man of fome genius, yet, quite de* ftitute of refources within himfelf to fupport his borrowed dignity, dwindled into a paltry excifeman, and flunk out the reft of his insignificant existence in the meaneft of purfuits, and among thc loweft of mankind. 44 In your illustrious hands, Sir, permit me to lodge my ftrong difavowal and defiance of fuch slanderous falfehoods. Burns was a poor mah from his birth, and an excifeman by neceflity: but? I will fay it! the Sterling of his honest worth poverty could not de* bafe, and his independent Britifli fpirit oppression might bend, but could not fubdue." 4 It was one of the laft acts of his life to copy this letter into his book of manufcrspts, accompanied by fome additional remarks on the fame fubjett. It is not furprifing, that, at a feafon of univerfal alarm for the Safety of the conftitution, the indifcreet expressions of a man fo powerful as Burns fliould have attracted notice. The times certainly required extraordinary vigilance in thofe entrusted with the administration of the government, and to enfure the fafety of the conftitution was doubtlefs their firft duty. Yet generous minds will lament that their meafures of precaution fliould have robbed the imagination of our poet of the laft prop on which his hopes of independence rested, and, by embittering his peace, have aggravated thofe exceiles which were foon to conduct him to an untimely grave.* Vol. i. P. 213. The reader mufi be wholly devoid of a difcerning taite who is not fenfible of the manly fpirit diffufed through this epiftle of the indignant bard, ana of the elegant and affecting ftyle in which the unhappy tranfa&ion is narrated by his biographer. Within a (hort period after this investigation of his political conduct, the mighty fpirit of Burns ceafed to give umbrage to the jealoufy of ministerial underlings^ From October, 1795* to the January following, an accidental complaint confined him to the houfe. When "he wras at length able to go abroad, his habitual imprudence expofed him to a new acceffion of diftemper. After struggling with a complication of diforders during the Spring, he determined, in the Summer of 1796, to try the effect of Seabathing. From this he derived no benefit, and 4 when brought back to his own houSe in Dumfries, on the 18th of July, he was no longer able to iland upright. On the 22d of the Same month the Sufferings of this great but ill-fated genius were terminated, and a life was clofed, in which virtue and paflion had been at perpetual variance.' We are confident that we fhall merit the thanks of our readers by laying before tilda Dr. Currie's discriminative character of Burns. 4 Burns, as has already been mentioned, was nearly five feet ten inches in height, and e>f a form that indicated agility as well as ?strength. His weil railed forehead, {haded with black curling hair, indicated extcniive capacity. His eyes were large, dark, full of ardour and intelligence. His face was well formed, a,ntl his countenance uncommonly interesting asid expressive. His mode of drcffing, which was often Slovenly, and a certain fulnefs and bend in his (boulders, characteristic of his original profeflion, difguifed in Some degree the natural Symmetry and elegance of his form. The external appearance of Burns was moft strikingly indicative of the character of his mind. On a firft view, his physiognomy had a certain air of coarfenefs, mingled however with an expreffion of deep penetration, and of calm thoughtfulness, approaching to melancholy. There appeared in his firft manner and addrefs perfect eafe and (elf-pofleffion, but a (tern and almost fupercilious elevation, not indeed incompatible with opennefs and affability, which, however, befpoke a mind confcious of fuperior talents. Strangers that fuppofed themfelves approaching an Ayrshire peafant, who could make rhymes, and to whom their notice was an honour, found themfelves fpeedily overawed by the prefence of a man who bore himfelf with dignity, and who pofleiTed a Angular power of correcting forwardnefs, and of repelling intrusion. But though jealous of the refpect due to himfelf, Burns never enforced it where he Saw it was willingly paid; and though inacceffible to the approaches of pride, he was open to every advance of kindnefs and of benevolence. His dark and haughty countenance easily relaxed into a look of good-will, of pity, or of tetidernefs; and as the various emotions fucceeded each other in his mind, affumed with equal eafe the expreffion of thc broadeft humour, of the moft extravagant mirth, of the dcepeft melancholy, or of the moft fublime emotion. The tones of his voice happily correfponded with the expreffion of his features, and with the feelings of his mind. When to thefe endowments are added a rapid and distinct apprehenfion, a moft powerful understanding, and a happy command of language?of strength as well as brilliancy of expreffion?we (ball be able to account for the extraordinary attractions of* his converfation?for the forcery which in his focial parties he feemed to exert on all around him. In the company of women this forcery was more efpecially apparent. Their prefence charmed the fiend of melancholy in his bofom, and awoke his happieft feelings; it excited the powers of his fancy as well as the tendernefs of his heart; and by restraining the vehemence and the exuberance of his language, at times gave to his manners the impression of tafte, and even of elegance, which in the company of men they feldom pofleiTed. This influence was doubtlefs reciprocal. A Scottish lady, accuftomed to the belt Society, declared with cha ra ct er itt ic naivete, that no man's converfation ever carried her.S) comple'e'y off her feet as that of Burns; and an Engl fli lady, familiarly acquainted with Several of the moft dilliciguiftied characters of the prefent times, allured the editor, that in the happieft of his focial hours there was a charm about Burns which (lie had never feen equalled. This charm arofe not more from the power than the versatility of his genius. No languor could be felt in the foe set v of a man who paffed at pleafure from grave to gay, from the ludicrous to the pathetic, from the Simple to the Sublime; who wielded all bu faculties with equal Strength and eafe, add never failed to imprefs the offspring of his fancy with thc ftamp of his undemanding. *" This indeed is to tfcprefent Burns in his happieft phafis. In large and mixed parties he was often filerit and dark, Sometimes fierce and overbearing1; he was jealous u? the proud man's Scorn, jealous "to an extreme bf the infolence of wealth, and prone to avengie,' ev^n oil its innocent poffeflbr, the partiality of fortune. By riaimfe kViidt, brave, Sincere, and in a Angular degree tomp&fiionate, he Was, on the other hand, proud, irascible* and vindictive. His vjrtii^s and #his failings bad their origin hi the extraordinary fenfibiIfty of his mind, and equally^partobkibf the chills and glows of fehttrrtehtv His friendships were liable tb interruption from jealoufy or difguft, and/ his^ennrfities died away under the influence of pity or felf-accufetibn* His underftantiing was equal to the other powers of his(mind# and his deliberate oplriioris were Angularly candid and juli; but'iike other men of great and irregular genius, the opinions whicji fte delivered in converfation were often tihe offspring of tempbrary feelings, and widely different from the calm decifions of his judgement. T-Jrn Va? not merely true refpeCting the characters of Others, but in regrircl to Tome of the moft important points of humati fbecubtion. 4 On no f'ubj^ did-he^grve a more Striking proof of the Strength of hi^underftaoding^ljin1 rn the corrcCl eftimate he formed of himfelf. He kfie\V his1 pwri failings ; he predicted their confequencej the melancholy forebGdWg was? never long abfent from his mind; ,y?this pa (Ti Ons'carried him down the ftream of error, and fwept him over the precipice he farw tiredly in 'his courfe. The fatal defed in his character lay in the comparative weaknefs of his volition, that Superior "faculty of the mind, which, governing the conduCt according to the dictates of the underftandihg, alone entitles it to be de? nominated rational; whfch is the parent of fortitude, patience* and fe!f-deni 1; which, by regulating and combining human exertions, may bc Said to have effected all that is great in the works of man, in literature, in Science,'or on the face of nature. The occupations of a poet are not calculated to ftrengthen the governing powers of the mind, or to weaken that Sensibility which requires perpetual controul, fince it gives birth to the vehemence of paflion as well as to the higher powers of imagination. Unfortunately the favourite occupations, of genius are calculated to increafe all its peculiarities; to nourifli that lofty pride which difdains the littlenefs of prudence, and the restrictions, of order; and by indulgence, to increafe that fenfibility, which in the prefent form of our existence is Scarcely compatible with" p^ace or h.ippinefs, even when accompanied with the choicelt gifts of fortune!'

Happier to him than idJeneSs? were the condition of the peafant, earning with iriceflant labour his Scanty food ; dr that of "the, Sailory though hanging'oh tHe yard-arm, and wrestling with thfe; Hurricane. / 4 Thefe oblervatjons might be, amply iUuftrated by the biography of men of genius of* every denomiriation^ aiVd Vrtore'especially by the biography of the jboets'. Of this laft:deferipiio'rF of men, few feenvto have enjoyed the ufual portion oS bapprnefs that falls to the lot of humanity, thofe excepted \vho have cultivated poetry as an elegant amufement iii the hours of refax<Vtior) from other occupations, or the fmall nUrriber who have engaged with SucceSs in the greater or more arduous attempts of fhe ftVuSe, in which'all the faculties bf the mind have lbc;en fully and permanently employed. Eveii taite, virtue, and cbmparattve independence, do not feem capable of beftowing on men df geiiius ?>eace and tranquillity, without Such occupation as maJy give regular and healthful exercife to the faculties of bodv4 and mind. The arniable Shenstone has left 'us the "records of his imprudence, of his indolence, and of hisunhappihefs,'rftmdjri the (hades of the Leafowes; and thp virtues, the learning, and trie gemsJs^or* Gray, equal to the loftieft attempts of the epic !mufe,' failed to proCur^f 'him'in the academic bovvers of Cambridge that' tranquillity and that rcfpect, which lefs fastidiousness of taite, and greaser conftancy and vigour of Exertion, would have douBtlefs obtainect ' '? 4 It Is'more heceffary that n1eh of genius fliould be aware of the impofr^nctf of fetf-command* and of exertion, becaufe their indolence is^pepuliarly .expofed, not trWely to Uhhappinefs, but to difeafep'of mind, and to errors' of conduct, which are generally fatal. This'iritefefting Subject deferves a particular inveftigation; but we mufi coateh^urfeivel5 with orie or two curfory remarks. Relief 1$ fometimes fought from the melancholy of indolence iri practices, which fora time footh and gratify the fenfations, but which in the end involve the Sufferer in darker gloom. To command the external circumstances by which happinefs is affeCted, is not in human power; but there are various fubftances in nature which operate on the fyftem of the nerves, fo as to give a fictitious gaiety to the ideas of imagination, and to cher the tffeCt of the external impreffions which we receive. Opium is chiefly employed for this purpofe by the di Sci pies cf Mahomet and the inhabitants of Afia; .but alkohol, the principle of intoxication, in vinous and fpiriruous liquors, is preferred in Europe, apd is univerfally ufed in the Chriftian world. Under the various wounds to which indolent Sensibility is expoSed, and urider the gloomy apprehensions reflecting futurity, to which it is fo often a prey, how Strong is the temptation to have recourfe to an antidote by which the pain of theSe wounds is fq* Speuded, by which the heart is exhilarated, ideas of hope and of happinefs are excited in the mind, and the forms of external nature clothed with new beauty!' Vol. i. p. 246. * It is the more neceflary for men of genius to be on their guard againft the habitual uSe of wine, becaufe it is apt to Steal on them inS'enfibly; and becaufe the temptation to excefs uSually prefents itfelf to them in their focial hours, when they are alive only to warfn and generous emotions, and when prudence and moderation are often contemned as felfifhnefs and timidity. 4 It is the more neceflary for them to guard againft excefs in the ufe of wine, becaufe on them its effects are, physically and morally, in an eSpecial manner injurious. In proportion to its Stimulating influence on the Syftem (on which the pleasurable StnSations depend) is the debility that enSues; a debility that deftroys digestion, and terminates in habitual fever, dropSy, jaundice, paralysis, or inSanity. As the Strength of the body decays, the volition fails; in proportion as the SenSations are Soothed and gratified, the fenfibility increaSes ; and morbid Sensibility is the parent of indolence, becauSe while it impairs the regulating power of the mind, it exaggerates all the obstacles to exertion. AClivity, perseverance, and Self-command, become more and more difficult, and the great purpoSes of utility, patriotifm, or of honourable ambition, which had occupied the imagination, die away in fruitlefs refolutions, or in feeble efforts. 4 To apply thefe observations to the fubjeCl of opr memoirs would be an ufelefs as well as a painful tafk. It is ipdeed a duty we owe to the living, not to allow our admiration of great genius, or even our pity for its unhappy deftiny, to conceal or difguife its errors. But there are fentiments of refpeCt, and even of tenderneSs, with which this duty fhould be performed 5 there is ap awful Sanctity which inverts thc manfions of the dead; and let tfyofe who mo* ralize over the graves of their contemporaries, refleCt with humility on their own errors, nor forget how foon they ms*y themfelves require the candour and the fympathy they are called upon to bellow/ Vol. i.

Like Burke, too, lie felt all the influence of the spells lhe cast on ottiers, and his own heart trembled at the images of dhread or beauty which lhe conjured up from the depth of his imagination. Professor Y . was scarcely known as aIn author. I believe lhe published nothing but a Contiutiation of Jolinson's Cr. ticismi on Gray, a jeu (l'csj)wit rather too volu. luinous to be very lhappy,-and a Translationiof the Odes of Trrtweus. This is problbly not exactly the l)ortrait I should have drawn (of this eminent person had I known him in niaturer vears, and been capable of exercising a cooler and snore discriminating judgment oil his chaisracter; but such is the impression he left on nmet, and that impression is indelible. " Under Professor J- I was initiated in the niore simple and elementary principles (rf metaphysics; and the year in which I lbecame his puplil, I have ever looked back upon as the greatest intellectual era of my life. Until 1r. ' assulnmed the chair of logic, I lielieve the studlies of the class had been exclusively de. voted to the acquisition of the Aristoielian pihilosoidhy, a branch of knowledge nlot ini itself very generally useful, and in the mode of teach. ing it not fraught with any peculiar adlvantage to the studenit. Of all men, Professor J- is perhaps niost entitled to be called a radiesd Weformer. He saw at a glance the deficiency of the systeni which till then had existed. lie knec' that the mneans were every thing, and thi e idt comparatively nothing ; that it was little to acquire a knowledge of the phi. Josophy of Aristotle, but all in all to bring into full action and development die dormant faciulties of otithful minds, lie did nilut hesi. i tate, therefore, at once to overthrow the whole systern followed by his predecessors, and to introduce a course of study in its place, marked throughout b)y practical good sense, and an extensive and thorough knowledge of the hunian jhind. No success WIas ever more brilliant and decided a and I believe I mav sa ely say, thlat the logic class is nowy admittedl by all who have, like nivself, experienced its ibenefit, to lbe paranmount in importance to every other in the circle of acadlemical study. Professor J_, I believe, has outlived Isis Contemiporaries, and still survives. Like the last oak of the forest, lie stands the sole relic oft a generation which. lhas lpassed away. He too is socin destined to fall, but surely siot ulhonoured.'' Unhappily, the last of this illustrious triumvirate nio lo;iner survives. Full of years and IIonours, Protessor J. hlias been gatliered to hlis fathers since thie author penned the concluding sentence of the grateful tribute which we have just (Iuoted. .1 (Jlasgowv dinner, or rather detauch, is no very attractive affair even now ; blit it seems to have beers a truly grotesque concern somne quarter of a centilry a wone.

8 " It is Nsver Too Late to Mend." A Matter of Fact Romance. By Charles Reade, Author of 4 Christie Johnstone,' &c. Three vols. Bentley. This is a book of considerable mark, being a novel written with unusual vigour and intensity of feeling. But as a novel it has two artistic faults, one at the surface, one at the core. At the surface there lie certain eccentricities of stylo and even of punctuation, as for example an economy in the use of commas, which are meant to increase strength, but are in truth traces of weakness. At the core lies a fault of construction, in the interruption of the plot for a very long time during a dramatic exposition of a case of the abuse of prison discipline, once very familiar to newspaper readers. Mr Reade seems to have been writing his book at the time, to have felt very indignant, and to have filled up a large part of his novel with an eloquent protest, in which the solitary system of imprisonment, which may be very bad, is visited with the sins of a particular jail governor; for which it is not very clearly, though no doubt it is in a certain indirect way, to be made responsible. Having said this we have ended our complaint, and we may justly modify what we have said by adding that the story within story is not by any means unwelcome to the reader. It is so told as to excite strong interest, and the book, be its story well or ill constructed, commands the reader's unbroken attention from the first page to the last. The interest arises in the same way from each section into which we may consider it split. While the heart is everywhere knocked at for human sympathy, the head is everywhere amused by the moves in a game between two contending factions who are wrestling with their wits against each other. In the main story it is Mr Meadows and his lawyer Crawley, besides other pieces for the black chessmen, against the hero and heroine, the old Jew Levi and their set, to represent the white. In the incidental story, illustrating prison discipline, it is a contest of wit, move against move, between Mr Hawes the cruel governor, Fry and the other gaolers for the black men, and the heavenly chaplain, Mr Eden, one repenting gaoler, and some prisoners for the white men. In the prison story Mr Hawes is at last checkmated. In the main story Mr Meadows is checkmated, but in each case the game has many fluctuations, and the run at last is close. It is not often that we get a novel so distinctly and so formally constructed on the principle of having two sides that make moves against each other. In a less able and original writer the effect of this must have been to some extent common-place and conventional. Here it is made throughout tho source of intellectual interest. We follow moves, but we have also our hearts concerned about their issue. When the story opens we have George Fielding, a young farmer, pattern Honesty, who has a London thief for a lodger, with a rival in the love of his Susan in the shape of a respectable man, Mr Meadows, who is ready to do evil to win ber. He is plotting against Fielding, but in the course of his proceedings contrives to make an enemy of an old Jew, Isaac Levi, who is enormously clever, and who undertakes quietly to play on Fielding's side. George has a rival in his brother William, but he is stout-hearted, and gulps down his love. It is a result of plotting that George Fielding is not to marry until he has earned a thousand pounds. He has an opportunity of going to farm in Australia, and undertakes to go there for it. Ho is going: ' And now/ faltered George, * I feel strong enough to go, and I'll g?-' He looked round at all the familiar objects he was laving, as if to bid them farewell; and last, whilst every eye watched his movements, he walked slowly up to his grandfather's chair. 4 Grandfather,' said he, * I am going a lon/- journey, and mayhap shall never see you again: speak a word to me before I go.' Tbe impassive old man took no notice, so Susan came to him. 'Grandfather, speak to George; poor George is going into a far country.' When she had repeated tim in his ear their grandfather looked up fora moment?* George, fetch me some snufffrom where you're going.' A spasm crossed George's face; be was not to have a word of good omen from the aged man. 4 Friend?,' said he, looking appealingly to all the rest. Meadows included, ' I wanted him to say God bless you? but snuff is all his thought now. Well, old man, George won't forget your last word, such as 'tis-' In a butch near the corner of the house wai William's pointer Carlo. Carlo observing by the general movement that there was something on foot, had the curiosity to come out to the end of his chain, and as he stood there giving every now and then a little uncertain wag of his tail, George took notice of him and came to him and patted his bead. * Good-bye Carlo,' faltered George; ' poor Carlo?you and I shall never go after the partridges again, Carlo : the dog shows more understanding than the Christian ; bye, Carlo.' Then he looked wistfully at William's dotr, but he said nothing more. William watched every look of George, but he said nothing at the time. ' Good-bye little village church, where I went to church man and boy ; good-bye churchyard where my mother lies; there will be no church bells, Susan, where I am going j no Sunday bells to remind me of my soul and home.' These words, which he spoke with great difficulty, were hardly out of young Fielding's mouth when avery painful circumstance occurred; one of tho*, things that seem tbe contrivance of some malignant spirit. The church bells in a moment struck up their very merriest peal! George Fielding started, he turned pale aid his lips trembled. ' Are they mocking me ?' he cried. * Do they take a thought what I am going through this moment the hard-hearted?* ?No! no! nol' cried William: 'don't think it, George, I know what tis?III tell ye.' 4 What is it?' ?Well it is-well. George, it is Tom Clarke and Esther Borgherst married to-day ; only they couldn't have the ringers till the afternoon. 4 Why Will they have only kept company a y?*r, and Susan and I have kept company three years; and Tom and Eather are married to-day; and what ar* George and Susan doing to-dsy? God^help met Ob, God help mc! What sfatf I do ? What thall I do V And the stout heart gav* way, s?*t| Qootfe FMdsBf covored his koo with hi* hands ami burst out sobbtaw sod crying. eSusan flung h?r anns round Ms neck?'Oh! G*orge, Bay pride is adi goo*; dont go* don't think to go; have pity on us beth and don't go.* Aad sh* dung to trias?her boonot tall*** ott, har hair <lisbevelled---and they sobbed and w*pt in oo* another's uttoo. Meadowa writhed with the jealous anguish this sad sight gav* bia, and at that inomeot he could have caned tbe whole cra*tma. H* tried to fly, but he was rooted to the spot. He kened skk as deaath against the palings. George and Susan cried together, and then they wiped one another's eye* like simple country folk with one pockert-handkarchief; and then they kissed one another in tua), and mod* **ch other's tears flow fast again; and again wiped one another's eye* with on* handkerchief. Meadows griped the palings convulsively?hell was ia his heart. 4 Poor souls, God help them!' said .William to himself ia his purified heart The silence their sorrow caused all around waa suddenly invaded by a voice that seemed to come from another world?it was Grandfather Fielding. 4 The autumn sun is not so warm as she used to b* f Yes, there was the whole map of humanity on thst little spot in the county of Berks. The middle-aged man. a schemer, watching th* success of hb able scheme and stunned and wounded by its recoil. And old age callous to noble pain, all alive to discomfort, yet nun to the last?blaming any one but Number One, cackling against heavenly bodies, accusing the sun and the kitchen-fire of frigidity?not his own empty veins! And the two poor young things sobbing as if their hearts would break over their first great earthly sorrow. George was the first to recover himself. * Shaine upon me!' he cried; he drew Susan to his bosom and pressed a long, burning kiss upon her brow. And now all felt the wrench was coming. George with a wild, half-terrified look, signalled William to come to him. * Help me. Will 1 you see I have no more manhood than a girl.* Susan instinctively trembled. George once more pressed his lips to her as if they would grow there* William took her band. Sbe trembled more and more. 4 Take my hand ; take your brother's hand my poor lass,' said he. She trembled violently ; and then George gave a cry that seemed to tear his heart, and darted from them in a moment. Poor Susan uttered more than one despairing scream, and stretched out both her hands to George. He did not see her, for he dared not look back. 4 Bob, loose the dog,' muttered William hastily, in a broken voice. The dog was loosed and ran after George, who he thought was only going for a walk. Susan was sinking, pale and helpless, upon her brother's bosom. 4 Pray, sister/ said gentle William; * pray, sister, as I must.' A faint shiver was all the answer; her senses had almost left her. When George was a little way up the hill something ran suddenly against his legs?he started?it was Carlo. He turned and lifted up his hands to heaven ; and William could see that George waa blessing him for this. Carlo was more than a dog to poor George at that cruel moment. Soon after that George and Carlo reached tke crown of the hill. George's figure stood alone a moment between them and the sky. He was seen to take his hat off and raise his bands once more to Heaven, whilst he looked down upon all he loved and left, and then he turned his sorrowful face again towards that distant land, and they saw him no morel That extract is long enough to show how well the book is written. George in Australia gets into difficulties, and while he is gone bis old lodger, the thief, gets into the mismanaged prison. There he suffers much, is reformed by the heavenly chaplain, and, bringing the reader to the prison with him, introduces us to the discussion, put in a dramatic form, on prison discipline. Tbe views enforced by Mr Reade we find thus stated in tbe form of light-headed talk by the heavenly chaplain, who has, in playing his game against Mr Hawes, at a most critical point been prostrated by fever. But one day it so happened that he was light-headed and greatly excited, holding a conversation. His eye was flashing, and he spoke in bursts, and then stopped awhile and seemed to be listening in irritation to some arguments with which he did not agree. The enthusiast was building a prison in the air. A prison with a farm, a school, and a manufactory attached. Here were to be combined the good points of every system, and others of his own. ?Yes,' said he in answer to his imaginary companion, of course, there shall be both separation and silence for those whoa* moral case it suit*!?for all perhaps at first?but not for all always. Away with your Morison's pill-system : your childish monotony of moral treatment in cases varying and sometimes opposed.' ' Yes but I would. I would allow a degree of intercourse between such as were disposed to confirm each other in good. Watch them ? why of course?and closely too.' ? Intelligent labor for every creature in the place. No tickets-ofleave to let the hypocritical or self-deceiving ones loose upon the world.' 4 No, I test their repentance first with a littl* liberty.' 4 How ? Why fly them with a string before I let them fly free!' 4 Occupation provided outside the prison-gates ; instead of ticketof-leave let the candidate work there on parole and come into tbe prison at ni(*ht.' ' No, not all of them. Some will break parole and run away? *AI1 tbe better. Then you know their real character. Telegraph them. You began by photographing them, send their likenesses to every town?catch them?cell them. ? Indeed! And pray what would these same men bav* don* had you given them tb* ticket-of-leave instead?' ? By tbe present plan your pseudo-convert commits a dozen crimes before his hypocrisy b suspected ; by ours a single offence warns you and arms you against bim. ' Systems avail less than is supposed. For good or ill all depends on your men?not your machinery.' 4 We bave got rid of tbe old patch that rotted our new garment. When I first was chaplain of a gaol?-' His mind had gone forward some yearr. ? Then we were mad?thought a new system could be worked by men of the psst, by gaolers and turnkeys belonging to the dark and brutal age that came before ours.' ? Those dark days are passed. Now we have really ? governor aad warders instead of gaolers and turnkeys. Th* nation has discovered these are high offices, not mean oners.* ? Yes Lepel, yes! Our officers are men picked out of all England for intelligence and humanity. They cooperate with me. Oar gaol is one of th* nation's eyes?it is ? school thank heaven it is aot a dungeon ! I am in bad V With these last words he had come to himself, and oh, th* sad contrast ! Butcherly blockheads in these high places, and himself ryiag sick snd powerless, unable to lift a hand for the cause be loved. The sigh tbat burnt from him aeemetd to tear his veryhewrt; nwt th* very nest moment be put his banda humbly toother aod said ? God's will b* don* !' Yet one big tear gathered in bia lion eye, and spite of all trickled down his cheek while he said ?God's will be done.' The chaplain conquers after mighty toil, throughout whioh Mr Reade takes care that the reader follows him with a ftrtrnga-rjiiipetty though he does sometimet tty more timm tbe pareen whom be it aMreteiog ?would atoll Hmm etty to hear. Would Mr Hewet, tor example, bave ttayed to the end of what it said to him in VoL II, pp* 111-11$? The reformed thief, tent to Australia with ticket-of-leave, and there releaaed, it recommettded to keep company with HoMety in the person of George Fielding. He begins with backsliding, it saved by an iistei^ontkm of Providenoe, horries to George Fielding, and i*nda him at a criticalJmur, alone and at the point of death. Theyfarm; they A The tmef, Thomas Robinson, hat been in California, he knows the aspect of a gold country, and he discovert gold. The story peases then to a graphic description of the opening of the Australian golddiggings. Mr Meadowe at home, who intercepts and reads bit letters, it alarmed at thia good fortune in hit rival, who it not to come home with a thousand pounds. He sends out bia creature Crawler, who associates at the diggings with certain ruffiant, and plays against George and Robinson a deeperate game, like Jew Levi it on tbe spot aa moneychanger. Plots become thicker and thicker; interest deepens,?but it is not our business to tell the tale. Let ut quote thit Australian sketch instead. 43 Prvjudie* he hanged, thb is a lovely land.' ' So ftia, Tom, so tb. But lit tell you what puts me out a little bit; nothing is what it sets up for here. If you see a ripe pear and go to cat it, it b a lump of hard wood. Next comes a thing the very sight of which tuns your stomach, and that b delicious, a loquot for instance, There now look at that magpie ! well it is Australia?so that magpie b a crow and not * magpb at all. Everything pretends ta be *eas* old friend or other of mme, ead turns out ? stranger. Here b nothing but surpriser* and deceptions. The flowers make a point of not ssB#lr?ng, aod the bushes thst nobody eipects to smell or wents to saaetl they smell lovely.' ' What does it matter where the smell comes from so that you get lt?' 'Why, Toro/ replied Georjre opening hb eyes, 'it makes all tbe difference. I like to smell a flower?flower is not complete without saaetl?bot I don't oar* if I never smell a bosh till I die. Then the biru* thsy laugh snd talk like C*hrbtian*; they make me split my sides. God Mses their little hearts: bat they won't chirrup. Oh dear no, bless you they leave the Christians to chirrup, they hold eonversations aad giggle, and laugh and play a thing like a fiddle?it is Australia 1 where everythinf b inside oat and topsy turvy. The aninub have four legs so they jamp on two. T*n foot square of rock lets foe a pound a month; tan myres of grass for a shilling a year. Boasted at Chrbtmaa, shiver o' cold on Midsummer-day. The lakes at* grass, and the rivers tarn their backs on tbe sea, and run into the heart of the land; and tb* naen would stand on their heeds, but I have taken a thought, aad I've found out why they don't.' ?Why?' ' Beewar** if they did their heads would point the same wsy a man's head points in England.' - Robinson laughed, and told George he admired the country for thee* very traits. * Novelty fer me against the world. Who'd come twelve thoasand mile* to see nothing we couldn't see at borne? Hang the sam* old story always ; where are we going, George ?' ' Oh, not mnch farther, only about twelve miles from the camp ?' ?Whereto?' 'To a i*arr*er I know. I am going to ahow you a lark, Tom,' said Georg*, and bis eyes hennaed bsmevol*nc* on bis comrade. Bobtneon stopped dead short. 4 George,' said be, * no! don't let us. I would rather stay at home and read my book. You can go into temptation and come mit pure: I can't. I am one of those that Sf I go into a puddle up to my shoe I must splash up to my middle.' * What has that do with it 1' * Your proposing to me to go in for a lark on the Sabbath-day.' ' Why Tom, am I tbe man to tempt you to do evil ?' asked George hurt. 'Why no t but you proposed a lark.' ' Aye, but an innocent one, one more likely to lift your heart on high than to give yon ill thoughts.' 'Well thb is a riddle;' and Robinson was intensely puzzled. * Carlo,' cried George suddenly, * come here, I will not have you hunting and tormenting those Kangaroo rats to-day. Let us all be at peace if you please. Come to heel.' The friends strode briskly on, and a little after eleven o'clock they came upon a small squatters house aod premises. * Here we art*,' said George, and bis eyes glittered with innocent delight. Tbe house was thatched and white washed, and English was written on tt and on every foot of ground round it A furze bush had been planted by the door. Vertical oak palings were the fence, with a five-barred gate in the middle of them. From the little plantation all the magnificent trews and shrubs of Australia had bean excluded with amazing resolution and consistency, and oak and ash reigned safe from over-towering rivals. They passed to the back of th* house, and there George's countenance fell a little, fur on the oval grass-plot and gravel walk h* found from thirty to forty rough fellows, most of them diggers. ?Ah well,' said he on reflection, ? we could not expect to have it all to ourselves, and indeed it would be a sin to wish it you know. Now Tom, come thb way; here it is, here it ia-there.' Tom looked up, and h) a gigantic cage was a light brown bird. He wes utterly confounded. ? What is it thb we came twelve miles to see 1 * * Aye! and twice twelve wouldn't have been much to me.* ' Well but where b the lark you talked oft' ' Thb b H.' 'Thb? Thb is a bird.' ' Well, and isn't a lark a bird 1' 'Oh, ay! Ieee! hal ha! ha! ha!' Robinson's merriment waa interrupted by a harsh remonstrance from several ot* th* diggers, who were all from tbe other end of tbe camp. 1 Hold your-cackle,' cried one, *h* is going to sing;' and the whole party had their eyes trsrvted with expectation towards the bird. like aioat stagers he kept them waiting a bit. But at bat, just at nona wheo th* aristi-as* of thc hooee had warranted him to sing, tb* tittle ssath*red exile began aa it wet* to run* his pipes. The savage Bssa gathuwd round th* sag* that moasent, and amidst * dead stillness the bird utteiwd ssa** vary m*ne*rtain chirps, but after a white he ecssaed to r*vhre hb tsmtsonen, aad call Ids endent cadetieea back to bim aa* by om, and string therm sotto voce.

How desperate a game Mr Meadows plays, and how unwilling he ie to be beaten, we may judge from his behaviour, ea detailed by Mr Reade, when he is at last checkmeted.

There is melodramatic exaggeration in this book, and it contains many an error of taste, but no reader can tail to understand, while he reads it, that he is submitting to the spell of one who is no mere confectioner of novels, of a man with real originality of thought, shrewd in invention, powerful in expression, and unquestionably able in due time to bring hit faults into subjection, and take his place as a first-rate novelist.

.1 Voyage to i4Jlrica, twith some account Oif the Mlarbnners and (Justonms of the Dahomian People. by John M'Leod, M. D. Lo)fndion, 18fo.i. 121iio. pp. 162. This seeins to he a sN)ortive little Ismok, by the author of the Narrative of the Voyage of the Alceste*. Dalzel's I iiswry of Dahomy, Murray's Voyages, lo)brtsio's useful " Notes on Africa," (of % hichi wve intend very shortly to rendt r in account), and several other publications relatike to that ('ontinent, hade intirely surpersedled the call for this new work on the groun(d of any intbriation it could furnisil ; and, indeed, its fiweetiiIS author does not pretend to othfr any ; but in(we 1presume) an iromuical advertiseniment, pretends %vith (droll grav'iv to state hi~i facts atnd personal al% cititcs, with a view to promote the n i% ilizatiou of Africza ! ! Th'le origin of such a pnerforitiice we vould fathcy to ov, that a Iiierry gentleman, who hill Ibeen Ion the (oast of Atrica sixteen or .2venteen years a;o, having read Mou*Iich's woniderrunl travels il Ashautte, s.hioldn say, " E-ad ! I was in D)ahiomiy iiiyself OlIoe, ali(l could idalso tell inmin' IMarvellonus stories about ,v wat I sa; and did tlivtre: ilnstea(d of a p)onlderous three 'tainitea quarto, I vill sihewv you whL z (an be (lone wvith a five and sixpenny dQlluodecihno.-D)evil take the hinidsliOt ; here goes !--and away Dr. M'Lcodl scampers, curvettiii, in a manrier that leavte tus iiinem h in doubt 1whether he is laughing at his readers or not. The stfle belongs to a elass whichi has lately become rather too fashionablebut,to be sure,the wvriters are fashionable tfoks-the mere slip)-slop) of gay conversation among the pseudo literati of tile book-shops, such as Mr. Rose or (Coum Sittndhial exemplify in their Itulian lucubrations, Mr. 'urner (though imiore slightly) in his Lt-ranting, an(l the Literary (iazette in so designating this manner of e:isy ftamiliarity and tea.table slang. For example, take the followving fromt our author's 1athlomian sketches. A good nimone of astimishidng a tiger (astoni-thing I ?yger .') uas p patised with Plief ess 4 Wingls mlyP stay her8. At loadced *1 Se Literary (azctte, Nos. 42 and 43, Notv. 8 andl 1:, 1 7. miusket 'vaw tirmly afflixed in a horizontal position, about the height of his head, to a couple of strakes driven into the ground; and the piece being cocked, a string from the triguer, fitirst leading a little towards the butt IIIti then turnbig through a small ring forwards, was attached to a shoulder of inutton stwiek on the muzzle of the mnusquet, the act of drugging off %vhieh drew the trigger, aiid the piece, loadc(l with two balls, discharged itself into the plunderer's rmouth, killing him,, otn the spot. Mr. Robert.son, in his notes on Africa, nientionzs a very ancient, but ingenious and aatural mode, b)yv which the natives obtain possession of the young cubs. " The mein in their excursions," hke says, " often find the dens of the leopard, and invariably bring away thie y-oung. Shmould the dtain miss them, in tiiie to overtake them, they throwv one of tile eulbs down, wvhich arrests her progress, as sihe .urries it back to the den, an(l sometimes returus in pursuit of the remninder; blut immure frequently remnnaims with the one sthe lhiii s(etred. XJke Hornet, (he says) one of the traders at Caivalla, brought inC two of these cubs, and ot'lred themu as a very valuaWde present ; very justly oliservingthat 'there %%as mucnh trouble and fear in stealing Tigers' *iblys; anil that it was only for good friends that peolple would ruu the risk of obtainiing them.' F'roin a production such as we have described this to ie, wve need not occupY miany of our columns ; a few niiscellanea vill suffice to showv how our good-huinoured traveller, anno 1803, acq(juits his memory of African recollecoiuns. III l)alloyll'I lme groun(l, to the greatest depth vet exaumfimmed, is a strog rdcolourede ruloa ; tnld, gtrammge to say, not only are rocks unknown, hut there is not eveni a pebble of the size of a walnut to le found in the whole coutrv. in sqiwh a soil, and untder time influence of a tropical stin, it is not wonderful that vegetation should appear in its richest and most luxuriant form. Alanv of the trees are of such gigantic bulk that canoes (which they use on their lakles only) capablec of containing wit Ih ease, from seventy tu an hundred inen , have beexi formed from their trunks, and their iminense height, added to the great spread of their branclies, has a very noble appearance. The sugar cane when it is raised here, grows vigorously to an uncommon size. The yarns, corn, and eallavalaces,.whichl they plant in alternate rows, give a very delightful aspect to their fields. D~ahoiny produces, iiu great perfection, all the immense variety oF fine fruits found within the torrid zone, vith some peculiar to itself, and among others one of a most singular quality :-It is not unlike a ripe coffeeberry, aud does not at first appear to have a superior degree of sweetness, but it leaves in the mouth so much of that impression, that * Canoes are mentioned by unquestionable authutrity, wvhich navigate the rivers farther to the epstV1d, of much greater dhimensions than evellthese, and mounting a gfln in the prow. a1 glass of vinegar tastes like sweet wine, and the sourest lemon like a ripe orange: sugar is quite an unnecessary article in tea or coffee; in fact, the most nauseous drug scenes sweet to whoever chews this ftuit; and its effet is not worn awav until after sevcral meals. It is generally ettlled the miraculous berry, but Mr. Dalzel has applied to it the tern Cerastts Oxz'glyc es. Whoever eats tbis berrv in the niorning, must he content at least for that (lay, to forego the natural flavour of every kind of flood, whether animal or vegetable, for all will he alike saecharine to the palate; and the inost ridiculous effect is often produce(l by playing tricks upon those who are not aware of its peculiar property. Mlr. Dalzel (who had been Governor at Wlhydalh, and ul. tianately Governor in Chief of the Company's service,) attempted to carry the shrub which pro(hlces this fruit to thel *est Indies, but it flied on the passage. He likewise cideavoured to preserve the berries, hut in every mode of preparatioa they lost their extraordinary (quality. The government of Dahomv is in the fullest sense of the vord, despotism. It is a monarchv the most umlimited and uncontroled on the face of the earth: there meing no lauv but the king's will, who may chop oft as many heads as lhe pleases, whenever lie is " i' the vein ;" and (ldispose of his subjects' property as lhe thinks fit without being accountable to any human tribunal for his conduct. Hc has from three to four thousand vives, a proportion of vhom, trained to arms, un(ler female officers, constitute his body guards. As may naturally be supposed, but a few of these wives engage his particular attention. The successor to the throne, is not announced during the king'.s lifetime, but the anomnciat his (lecease is known ; this proclamation is mleade with all possible despatch by the proper officers, for til is murder, anarchy, and confusion in the palace, until it takes place; the wives of the late king not only breatking the furniture and ornauments, lint killing each other in order to have the honour of attending their husband to the grave. The choice usually falls on the -ldest soIn of the late sovereigin's greatest favoutrite, provided there exists no particular reason tfr setting him aside. An instance of thlis sort occurred however at the demise of the late king Whenoohew, where the cider soni's right of primogeniture was disallowed, because one of his toes from some accident orerlapped the other; anld his next brother, the present king, who, with respect to form, is ertainly " a marvellous proper wan," was elected in his stead. There seem to be no rank or privileges annexed to any branhesw of the royal family; the king iii his own person absorbing the midivided respect of the people. Those of his relatives wvhom his majesty may deign to patronize, vill, of course, he more noticed by their fellow slaves; but all are alike the slaves of the king. A person wvhose father had been so well supplied with wvives, must naturally have an extensive connexion in the -way of half brb- thers aud sisters ; atn it might not, perhaps, bIe convnient to allow all to participate in the royal rank. His palace at Aborney, is wvallcl round, and consists, according to the reports of Miessrs. DaIzell, Norris, and Abson, who haad frequent opportunities of visiting, its interior, of numerous courts coutmected %with each other, occupying in the whole a space full as large as St .Jaines's Park. The first urinister is called the Tne 'qn, and he is the only man in the country whose head the king cannot cut off at pleasure. By some ancient regulation, he who attains this rank has that very esseutial part of his -person secured to hinm, perhaps that hc may honestly speak his mind to the king without fear of consequences. The second(, or 3A/nnt, is the master of the ceremonies, whose office it is to receive anul intro(luce all strangers, whether black or white, annl also to take care of them during their stay at court, ard to see them well fed and lodged, with all their attendants. The third officer ill the state is the Yatougala/ of Whydah ; and the fmirth is the Jao/ou or muaster of the horse, who is likewise the chief executioner, and has the dinty of superintending the numerous decapitationis which in vurious ways ocecur. The Agaoir is the commander in chief of the army, and has under himn divers subordinate general officers. There are entertained about the court a number of king's messengers, called Halfhends, because one side of their heads is always shaved, whilst the hair on the other is allowed to grow to its full length. They are men who have distinguislhed themselves in hattle, and wear as the badge of their office, strings of the teeth of those enemies they have actually killed with their own hands, slung round their necks, fike the collar of an order. These extraordinary looking conriers whenl sent on1 any mission, are never perInittetl to walk, but run at full speed, and arc relieved at certain distances on the roa(l, by relays of others, who pislh 0on in the same mallner oln receiving their orders, which they transfer front one to the other wit i the greatest exactness. (To oe concluded in our next)

I Journal of the Derbyshire ArcJiaeological and Natural History Society. Vol. II. (London and Derby : Bemrose.) The volume opens with a good paper by Mr. S. 0. Addy, modestly en- titled a "Contribution towards a History of Norton." He speaks of putting together but "a few ort-s and scraps," but has in reality added considerably to our knowledge of a place in which Derbyshire men have more than one reason for taking interest. Mr. Bailey continues his paper on "Old Houses in Derby." The illustrations, though not admirable as works of art, are useful as preserving portraits of buildings which will probably soon be swept away. The old house at Hilton is a remarkably good example of a half-timber building. Something of the sort might well be reproduced in those parts of the world where wood is still sufficiently plentiful to permit it to bo used profusely. Mr. Davis gives us a paper on Derbyshire place names. He ovidontly .comprehends the manner in which our local nomenclature has grown up, and is, therefore, yery much farther advanced than most of the people who write on such things. Though his system of interpretation is the true ono, there are several instances in which he does not seem to apply it rightly?e.g., Dunston is quite as likely to mean the town of Dun as the town of the hill. Dun was not a common Anglo-Saxon name, but he will find in the Chronicle a Dun, Bishop of Rochester. Mr. J. C. Cox has printed the minute-book of the Wirksworth Classis. This is an important document, not only for local history, but also as an additional help towards understanding the stato of feeling in England during the Interregnum.

LITERATURE Mary Stuart. By John Skelton, C.B., LL.D. (Paris, Boussod, Valadon & Co.) Eistoire du Regne de Marie Stuart. By Martin Philippson. 3 vols. (Paris, Emile Bouillon.) Either " Mary Stuart was a saint," or else " Mary Stuart was a Jezebel." There is no third alternative, for a third alternative is impossible according to grammatical purists, and according, with rare exceptions, to writers on Mary Stuart. Mr. Skelton belongs to the hagiological faction; M. Philippson is one of the exceptions. Their two works are both important ones ?important, however, on widely divergent grounds. Vast as has been the Marian literature, it may be safely affirmed that for splendour of illustrations and of typography Mr. Skelton's volume stands unsurpassed and unrivalled by any of its innumerable predecessors. The thirty portraits here Drought together are, as a whole, of inestimable worth to the student of history. The exquisite facsimile of Janet's famous miniature of Mary is a treasure in itself; and the portraits of James V. and Mary of Guise, of Moray, Morton, and Catherine de Medicis, are only less valuable. With some of the others we are scarcely so well satisfied; the selection might have been better. Edward VT., Charles IX., and Henry III. might perhaps have made way for Chastelard, Buchanan, Bess of Hardwick, and Shrewsbury, who had much more to do with Queen Mary; the Calder House portrait of Knox is now almost universally discredited; Mr. Skelton himself has cast doubt on the portrait of Maitland of Lethington; and tor the portrait of Darnley, "from an engraving in the British Museum," we should greatly have preferred any one of the halfdozen portraits in the Stuart Exhibition? for the " Execution of Mary, from an engraving in the Bibliotheque Nationale," the Blairs portrait itself. For engravings should only have been used where originals were not to hand. Much the same may be said of certain of the views. Bothwell Castle gave title to Bothwell; otherwise he had no connexion whatever with the place. For it and for Orleans we would have suggested Inchmahome, Dunbar, Lochleven, or Hermitage Castle. And on one point we are positive : that there should have been some account given, however brief, of the pictures. Thus of Janet's miniature we should have been informed that Vanderdoort describes it in his catalogue of Charles L's collection; and of the " Darnley Cenotaph " to whom "and to what year it is ascribed, and whom the five figures stand for. Even the curt titles that are given might have easily been improved: " from Slezer's ' Theatrum Scotiae' " would have been little longer, and ten times more satisfactory, than " from an old print." It is not too late even yet to remedy this omission; a fly-leaf might be issued to subscribers to be bound up with this sumptuous volume. It is fully worthy of the extra trouble. We pass from the illustrations to the text, which, coming as it does from Mr. Skelton, may not be dismissed as mere letterpress. For twenty years Mr. Skelton has been known as a prominent Marian; it was reasonable to expect that in this his magnum opus he would give the world a final and authoritative statement for the defence. But we cannot accept as such his 'Mary Stuart.' It tries to prove too much, and proves too little; it ignores not only the weaknesses, but also often the strong points of his case. Take the amazing statement, for instance, that " Mary, according to Knox and Buchanan, was an abandoned creature for exactly six months. She maintained a stainless repute both before and after this period." " Six months !" woidd cry Knox and Buchanan, if they could now read those words; " say rather forty times six months." For scandal attached to Queen Mary in connexion with the death of her first husband (1560), with Chastelard (15G3), with Darnley (April, 1565), with Rizzio (March, 1566), with Bothwell (July, 1566), with George Douglas (1568), and with the Earl of Shrewsbury (1583). There is no good in ignoring the existence of such scandals; on the contrary, it were easy to demonstrate their falsity, and to argue that the men who were capable of such monstrous inventions are unworthy of credence in matters where it is harder to expose them. Take, again, Mr. Skelton's denial that Mary returned to Scotland with a fixed desire to restore Catholicism : what does he make of her letters to the Cardinal of Lorraine and to Pius IV., that are quoted from Labanoff by M. Philippson (vol. ii. pp. 33-41, 203, 213, &c.) ? We have room for one extract only, from her letter to the Pope of January 31st, 1563 :? "Il a 6t4 toujours dans notre intention d'employer, comrae nous l'avons deja fait, nos efforts, pensees et fatigues et les moyens qu'il a plu a Dieu de nous donner pour ramener dans la bonne voie, apres notre retour dans ce royaume, notre pauvre peuple qu'a notre tres grand ddplaisir nous avons trouve- e'gard et enfonce* dans les nouvelles opinions et damnables erreurs, qui," &c. Mr. Skelton's ' Mary Stuart' would seem to have been taken in hand after vols. i. and ii. of M. Philippson's ' Histoire' had made their appearance; but though Mr. Skelton refers to M. Philippson, it is only to his earlier scattered essays. Has he, one wonders, read the 'Histoire' yet? and if so, does he retain the same admiration for M. Philippson's "ease and grace and lucidity"? We fancy not, for that' Histoire' goes a long way to stultify Mr. Skelton's main argument that if the Casket Letters can be shown to be forgeries, Mary Stuart was obviously guiltless of all complicity in Darnley's murder. M. Philippson believes no more than does Mr. Skelton in the genuineness of the Casket Letters; still, he does not believe that Mary was immaculate. There are a host of other circumstances which have to be taken into account, but which Mr. Skelton either slights or wholly passes over. There is the Craigmillar Conference, our knowledge of which is based on the statement of two of Queen Mary's supporters. Admit that nothing more passed there than Mr. Skelton himself allows ; was Mary such a dullard as to attach no darker import than divorce to this speech of Maitland of Lethington ?? "Madam, fancy ye not we are here of the principal of your Grace's nobility and council, that shall find the moyen that your Majesty shall be quit of him [Darnley] without prejudice of your son. And albeit that my Lord of Murray here present be little less scrupulous for a Protestant, nor your Grace is fora Papist, I am assured he will look through his fingers thereto, and will behold our doings, saying nothing to [against] the same." This was in December, 1566, and in the following month Mary permitted Morton and others of Eizzio's assassins?men whom Darnley had basely betrayed?to return to Scotland; Darnley, it seems, was alarmed by this amnesty. Again, it is hard to understand how the fact that some great peril was menacing Darnley should nave been known to Mary's half-brother, Lord Robert Stuart, to Archbishop Beaton (then at Marseilles), to the Spanish ambassador in London, and to others, and Mary alone should have had no inkling thereof. It is still harder to conceive that Mary should not have suspected Bothwell of Darnley's murder, or should not at least have known that suspicion attached to him. Not even Mr. Skelton pretends this last; but he does defend Mary from the " calumny" of having taken Bothwell with her to Seton a week after the murder on the plea that she had "left him at Holyrood in charge of the young prince " ! Of Darnley's mean obsequies Mr. Skelton wisely says nothing; nothing also of Bothwell's appointment to the governorship of Leith; nothing of the fact that, though Mary at Borthwick was freed of Bothwell's presence, she should yet, in* a page's disguise, have fled to rejoin him; and nothing, lastly, of the anguished parting at Carberry. These points?and there are many others? demand explanation; Mr. Skelton explains it all by "a temporary collapse of will..... The manifold vivacities of a strangely interesting character had been petrified into stony immobility." There is a sonority about that which might well appeal to the British juryman; still, there does not seem to us much stony immobility in the saying ascribed to Queen Mary by the " chivalrous " Kirkcaldy (Mr. Skelton's own epithet), that she " cares not to lose France, England, and her own country for him [Bothwell], and will go to the world'send in a white petticoat ere she leaves him."' Mr. Skelton, as is his wont, seldom furnishes an exacter reference than " a brilliant historian " or "an unfriendly writer"; most often he gives no reference at all. This is unfortunate, at least for the reviewer. For Mr. Skelton of course may be right where he seems to us to be wrong, e.g., in such statements as that "when Pinkie Cleuch was fought, and for some years afterwards," there were no traitors in the Scottish camp (i.e., that the " assured lords " from Solway Moss were honest men); that Knox's iconoclastic campaign began at St. Andrews; that " Queen Mary had seen a good deal of Bothwell at one time or another since she was a girl"; that Edinburgh in 1561 had a " great cathedral"; that Bothwell's marriage with Lady Jean Gordon was subsequent to the murder of Rizzio; that "it is possible that after that marriage Mary may nave fancied that age had sobered him " (Bothwell then being not yet thirty); that Jedburgh in 1566 was an "obscure BordeT hamlet"; that Darnley was believed to have died with the pathetic words of the fifty-fifth Psalm on his lips ' (there must, then, have been reporters in those days); and that a certain " Shaftesbury " was one of Queen Mary's gaolers. Mary may have gardened busily at Inchmahome; for the five months of late autumn and of winter that she spent there may have been exceptionally mild. Her " most impressionable years" may have largely been passed in a "chateau in Lorraine" (Mr. Skelton does not say what chateau), " among devout women who stood severely aloof from the follies and frivolities of the Court." This, if correct, shows the worthlessness of the Baron de Ruble's ' Premiere Jeunesse de Marie Stuart' (1891), from which one might rashly infer that among those devout women were Diane de Poitiers, Lady Fleming, and Catherine de Medicis, and which devotes five pages to fixing Mary's different places of abode during 1559-59: Fontainebleau, SaintGermain, Blois, &c, but never that nameless chateau in Lorraine. Rizzio may have been the mere " vain, foolish, ostentatious Italian" that Mr. Skelton says he was ; and Bothwell an " unmannerly, unlettered, unscrupulous scamp," a "truculent Borderer,"a " blundering Borderer," a " blundering and blustering Borderer." To us he had seemed by no means always to have blundered; and we have seen books stamped with his book-plate that might argue him far from unlettered for a noble of the sixteenth century. Anyhow, Mr. Skelton should have furnished references; and he should also have read Mr. Swinburne's great essay on Queen Mary. We have left ourselves scant space for M. Philippson; ton times that space would hardly do adequate justice to his merits. His work is lacking in outward adornment, and has little of the inner grace of style. He is often diffuse and occasionally meagre; the Casket Letters are curtly dismissed here in a foot-note, with a reference to " mes Etudes, citees plus haut." He is much too fond of explaining everything; the explanation of Darnley's return to Scotland is no explanation at all. He is prone to set too high store by contemporary tittletattle ; there were liars even in the sixteenth century. His initial chapter is a most ill- advised attempt to compress into sixty Eages the first fourteen centuries of Scottish istory. It in especial, but the whole work generally, is disfigured hy many misstatements, which a little more care would have easily avoided. There is no great plain in Scotland extending from the Cheviots to the Grampians; as neither are there mountains in Caithness. Jedburgh is not in the western, Dumfries in the eastern, Marches; and there was never a "lord Erskine of Dun " or an abbey of Roxburgh. Buchanan was not Queen Mary's tutor in France, nor was John Knox ever professor of philosophy at St. Andrews. M. Philippson is invariably (yet most variably) wrong as to the value of Scots money; and his pages are freely besprinkled with such misprints as "Saint Rothan" (Abbey St. Bathans), "Leight" (Leith), and "Sanchieburn" (Sauchieburn). Yet in spite of all these defects the work is the most important on the subject that has been published for many a day. It is a marvel of erudition, research, and painstaking ; it brings together a mass of fresh documents, English and foreign, not a few of which have a high historic value. There is, for example, the process of divorce between Mary and Botnwell (August 24th, 1575), from the Vatican archives, which sheds a good deal of new light on Darnley's murder, " the incidents of which tragedy are," according to Mr. Skelton, " familiar to every schoolboy." The work is above all an honest attempt to arrive at the truth, so fair in tone, so free from bias, that it is impossible to determine from it whether its author is a Catholic or a Protestant. Admirers of Knox and Buchanan, of Moray and Lethington, of Elizabeth and her ministers, will be loth to accept its conclusions, for them it condemns; neither will it prove acceptable to Mariolaters, for it does not acquit Queen Mary. It shows her as a woman of high ambitions. One of these was to bring back her kingdom to the faith ? a laudable ambition, as we take it; for toleration, though a virtue nowadays, was not a virtue in the sixteenth century. Another aimed at the possession of the English crown, straightway or presently, by fair means or by foul; and Mary saw her chief means towards that end in her projected marriage with Don Carlos. The negotiations extended over more than two years, and then were most reluctantly abandoned. Love cannot have been the mainspring here; and love had not been the mainspring of her marriage to Darnley ? she had contemplated that marriage months before she set eyes on him. True, she learned to love the "long lad"; and had he requited her love, had he proved himself half a man, her reign might have been fortunate and glorious. But of all the scoundrels that surrounded Mary, her husband was the vilest and most abject. His open infidelity towards her, his filthy suspicions of her fidelity towards himself, the brutal murder of her trusted secretary, the consequent peril to herself and her unborn babe?that were enough to revolt a tamer spirit than Mary's, in an age less bloody than hers. There never was a woman, let alone a queen, worse used by her husband than was Mary by this young fool. She forgave him at Jedburgh, when she thought she was *n her death-bed, and one knows how he ? warded her forgiveness. So she ended-a* we hold, with Mr. Swinburne, M. PhilimT son, ay, and Archbishop Beaton himself-ifo consenting to his death, and by rewarding his murderer with her passionate devotion Is she, therefore, to stand utterly con-' demned? or may not some measure of that forgiveness be extended towards her that is extended to King David for the far more shameful murder of Uriah ? Ab, well' she has found her advocate in Mr. Skelton and the devil his (a very able one) in M Philippson. '

FICTION THE REPENTANCE OF DESTINY. By SHWAY DINGA. Duckworth. 6s. This Anglo-Burmese story is a very capable piece of work, and a novel of no little interest. The author, we must suppose, is a Burman, unless he be Indian. He writes with a polished cynicism almost Willyesque in its light bitterness. The tale has as its burden the liaisons between English Civil Servants and Burmese young women, which we are given to understand are, or were, the usual thing in Burma. In a way the book is a revelation, for it gives a criticism of our Imperial civilisation from the point of view of a refined and sensitive member of one of our dependent races. The author makes no definite attack, nor does he labour any point. His criticism is merely suggestive, though not exactly helpfully so. One has a suspicion that the brutality of the Englishmen in the book is exaggerated, as perhaps is too the Parisian chic with which the Burmese ladies seem endowed. But The Repentance of DestinyEasterns somehow can never keep the word destiny out of their titles is a novel to read.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEMOIRS OF THE LATE MRS. ROBINSON. ( Conludedfrom- age 234. J M RS. ROBINSON had not thought of literaMb]L ture as a resource, either against the tedium of life, or for its wants, since the little attempt she had made when her husband was in prison. On her return to England, which was in 1738, she began those literary employments in which she contizued to be engaged, till within a very few weeks before her death, with a constancy, a spirit of en-terprize and a degree of success, that cannot fail respectively to excite our astonishment, when we contemplate the disadvantages of a life, at one time too rudely pressed with misfortune, at another too much enervated with the refinements of luxury. To the first edition of her poems, Mrs. Robinson had a subscription, that at once does honour to herself and the patronage she received. Six hundred persons of the highest rank or talents were her subscribers: many of whom took several copies, and others assisted her greatly beyond the amount of their subscriptions. Mrs. Robinson's beauty was still admired; her engaging manners were still remembered; her talents had already gained her that name, which men of genius often confer by conversation in literary circles, long before the favoured subject of their praise is known through the medium of publication. Mrs. Robin. Son, at this period, was little less an object of attgntion, a theme of fashion, than in the momentof her entire ascendancy in the 'gay world; and for this distinction she was indebted solely to her fas. cinating charms and genius, since her power was fled, and she was even then falling into the disre. pute of comparative adversity. There exists a literary anecdote that deserves to be noticed, as it marks most distinctly the adulation universally paid to Mrs. Robinson at the time we speak of. When the first edition of Mrs. Robinson's poems (those in two volumes) appeared,' the Review bestowed on them a praise, not above their merits, but agreeing altogether with Mrs. Robinson's fashion and currency at that monient. When a subsequent edition appeared, their tone was lowered; but it had this consistency in it, that, though it was now below the merit of the work, it was on a level with the declining fortunec of Mrs. Robinson. Let us reviewof some of'the literary productions of Mrs. Robinson.-The Poems, in t'wo 2So 'volkmes>, which may justly be called Mrs. Robinson's first publication, are almost in every part characterized by the effusions of a ridh genius, the sweetness und elegance of a polished taste; and the genuine language of sensibility. Among the most vigorous poemsin that collection, are the following :.-Lines dressed to him 'wbo -will understand them! replete with passion.-A poem beginning with Bounding iblo-ws cease thy motion; often named with admi.. ration by a gentleman who is at once among the inest of our poets, and the greatest of our orators. -And that most beautiful poem The Maniac; whose merit led the celebrated author of The Minstrel to seek an iptroduction to Mrs. Robinson, at Bath, where- they both happened to be soon after its publication. The Legitimate Sonnets are remarkable for their tenderness, and the harmony of their versification i but have not the strength of most of Mrs. Robinsin's other poems; The little volume containing the three poems entitled, Sight; the Ca(avern of Wpoe; and Solitude ; has several passages of the purest fire, the boldest thought, and the richest imagery. But the Lyrical Tales are, perhaps, the most delightful of Mrs. Robinson's compositions. Almost every poem in that small volume is a treasure to the heart of the imagination. The Haunted Beaci is to be distinguished for poetic imagery, and the excellence of the tale. After the cause of the beach being haunted is unfolded, in the murder of a shipwrecked sailor by a- fishennan, tempted by the gold he had about his person, and- a specter'd band (the drowned companions of the sailor) are descrihed as surrounding the fisherman's cottage, or iollowing him in his occupation, the poem cog- chides with the following verses; which) for terror, and for the consequent moral, are not sur. passed' in the English language. "' And since that hour the fisherman Has toil'd -and toil'd in vain! For all the night, the moony night Gleams on the specter'd main! And when the skies are veil'd in gloom The murd'rer's liquid way Bounds o'er the deeply yawning tomb, And flashing fires the sands illume, Where the green billows play! Full thirty years his task has been, Day after day more weary, For Heaven design'd his guilty mind - Should dwell on prospects dreary. Bound by a strong and mystic chain9 He has not pow'r to stray; But destin'd mis'ry to sustain, He wastes, in solitude and painA loathsome life away." The Alien Boy is an instance of the sublime. Itis impossible by description to do justice to the merits of that poem. One touch 6f the finest art we cannot forbear to give in the following lines" -.-------Yet he lives, A melancholy proof that man may bear All the rude storms of fate, and still suspire: By the rude world forgotten!" This is said of one abandoned to all extremities of wretchedness. And for the perfect insight into the human heart, with which it is said, we appeal-to all who know its workings. The Deserted Cottage is a fine example of the simple and pathetic in writing i and the two conclud-Ing verses deserve to be quoted for the refinement ot their feeling, and the, delicacy of their moral 4aste. " And now behold yon little cot All dreary and forsaken ! And know, that soon 'twill be thy mt To fall, like Jacob and his race, And Icaye on time's swift wing no trace, Which way their course is taken. Yet, if for truth and feeling known, Thou still shalt be lamented! For when thy parting sigh has flown, Fond MEM'RY on thy grave shall give X tear-to bid thy VIRTUES live!. Then-smile, AND BE CONTENTED." te Poor singing Dame is also a pathetic tale; which, though equally true to nature, is the copy of nature in her plainer garb.l The Trumpeter, an old Englisb Tale, affords an example of another kind. It is a satire, expressed with all the acumen of its species; and it has beside the merit of being a well-tld tale, whose images pass in vivid succession before the eyes. The Widow's Home, though possessing less of the. fire of genius than some other poems in the volume, is an instance (to which we wish to refer our rea. ders), of that most excellent moral feeling that peculiarly marked Mrs. Robinson's ebaracter.. The prose compositions of Mrs. Robinson are. greatly below her poetry. Not thather novels and romances (of which they chiefly consist) want invention; but that she wrote with a haste that did not permit her to be choice in the selection of incidents, or to weave an artful web in the relation. She was accustomed to write from the impulse of the moment; and the facility with which she wrote her poems, spoiled her for the drudgery that belongs to every work of great extent. Of her facility we could relate examples that appear incredible. Wlany of the longest pieces in her Lyrical Tales, were written in one moniing.. The Lascar, cow- sisting of 312 lines, was written, revised, and com. pleted, in less than eight hours; and the- beauties of that poem may challenge works more laboured. The Lyrical Tales was the last of Mrs. Robinson's poetical publications. The last work on which she was employed, was the translation of The Picture of Paermo; from Dr. Hagar. For some months previous to her death, Mrs. Robinson had much to endure. Her health was dedining i pecuniary embarrassments pressed closely upon her; and her heart was swoln with inijuries. Amidst- all this, her conduct was marked chiefly with fortitude and cheerfulness. It was only the few who saw her in the closest retirement that perceived the symptoms of a broken spirit. Yet her debts (which was partly the cause) were comparatively small, o2001. we have been told, would have paid them ; and Mrs. Robinson had recently adopt_ ed plans of economy, which would have enabled. her in a year.or two, to, have satisfied every pecu. niary claim upon her. Her fate, in this respect, must be deemed cruel; and the more so, as she had often released others from the danger of a prison, with which she .was threatened in her very last. moments. Mrs. Robinson, was not, however, de. stitute of friends, had she chosen to have applied to them. The Duchess of Devonshire, Lord Moira, and the Nvlarquis and Marchioness of Hertford, with many other distinguished characters, had been liberal patrons, and continued to be warmly attached to her. In the course of this last summer, Mrs. Robin-g son had retired almost from the world, to a beautiful cottage belonging to her daughter on Englefield Green, near Windsor Forest. Here the encroachments of disease, mental and bodily, gradually, overpowered every effort of human skill; and. alter iulgering OMar this months, notviithsta4ia-. the unexampled attention of Drs. Pope and Chandler, she expired on the with day of December, 18oo. On the body being opened, by the express wish of the physicians who attended her, the immediate cause of her death was found to be an accumulation of water on the ehest, together with six large stones contained in the gall bladder, a circumstance which, had she been able to take the exercise of walking, would long since have accelerated that event which is now the subject of regret to her friends. In the last hours of her existence, Mrs. Robinson was not deserted by that fortitude and strengtk of mind which had ever distinguished her. She gave directions for her funeral; and expressed many wishes relative to her death with a spirit perfectly resigned. - By her own'desire, she was buried on the north side of Old Windsor Church Yard. Her funeral was plain. The last melancholy office of attending her remains was performed by two literary and valued friends. A monument, on a simple and elegant model is preparing by her daughter's orders, and is intended to be erected over the place of her interment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Only a JMgger. By Edmund Mitchell. (Chatto & Windus.) A frankly sensational story this, in which the interest is very fairly sustained, and the probabilities are not, upon the whole, unduly strained. The hero is a mild Hindu: a medical authority of world-wide renown, who rejoices in the possession of " delicately chiselled features of classical regularity," a "great, dome-shaped forehead," a "soft melodious voice," and other advantages seldom perceived in men of his race by writers who know India intimately. But Mr. Mitchell is sound enough in matters racial; only a little swayed by the insidious sentiment which inspired the author of ' Mr. Isaacs.' Naturally, the Hindu man of science of this story loves an English maiden?she is Scotch, to be exact?but, though he woos, does not win her, and in the end, we regret to say, this failure moves the learned man to commit suicide, having bequeathed his fortune to the lady of his unsuccessful suit, with the request that his ashes be conveyed to sacred Mother Ganges. But before his death the Hindu serves his mistress with knightly fidelity by rescuing her brother-inlaw from the clutches of an Italian secret society, whose emissaries chase, with daggers and poison, the poor man all over the habitable globe, even after (with the melodious Hindu's assistance) he has apparently died and been buried in the Red Sea.

r<t Experiments on Living; Living within w Means, Living up to the Means, and Living ? hyondthe Means. London, Parker. ??!? title of this reprint of a little American '-i-. sufficiently indicates its nature and im?'t. and that perhaps constitutes its greatest ;?? It does not answer thus to put a book '?its moral in the close relation of a sermon ^_text. In works of fiction, more especially, ?Memoires o.c l'Aradt-inie 1 niperiale des Sciences de St. ?ttrtbouig, 6me. strie, t. 1.1832. all such attempts to thrust forward upon the surface a point of doctrine, detract from the likelihood of the story. They combine events by an order, which is not that of nature, an order forced on the xvriter "by the exigencies of his illustration." They do also an equal violence to the personages, which are, for the same reason, drawn without due regard to moral probability, and made to act as human beings under the circumstances xvould not do. The only graceful and appropriate moral in imaginary compositions, is that xvhich arises unbidden from a well conceived and xvell told tale. Every such story must be a faithful portraiture of nature, and there is no combination of events in real life, important enough for narration, but lends to some ethical conclusion, obvious to those xvho are disposed to search for it. Even the best j writers have not unfrequently failed in the osten- | tatious lesson they have designedly put forward. The contrast between Blilil and Tom Jones, for instance, is in itself a false moral, and is moreover ill understood by the majority of readers; ' Sheridan's contrast between the two Surfaces, which is stolen from it, is still more mischievous. But what admirable lessons of prudence and of virtue may be extracted from the incidental circumstances and observations, both of the nox'el and the comedy?lessons the more serviceable, ; because they sink into the mind unobserved, and i therefore unresisted. Advice, xvhich is too obj viously administered, will, on the contrary, be ; pretty sure to nauseate; especially when the I reader is looking for amusement. It is this ' general indisposition of mankind to be lectured, j that explains the little elfect produced by works ? of such sterling merit as those of Miss Martineau. I Her lessons of political economy, despite her i great skill, and all the interest she has throxvn ? into her tales, detract too much from the ap' parent truth of the story, and leave her proi tagonists little more than abstract representatives j of a dogma. The disguise, therefore, is too j palpable, and the austere truth that is seen j through it, is taken in ill part by the reader, who I has been entrapped into perusal. Works however of the kind now under con- ; sideration have increased, sire increasing, and, if i they ought not precisely to he diminished, should j at least be placed under the control of a sounder J discretion. If thc pavement of Tartarus bc indeed ! of the kind imputed to it, its condition in these j days need not be less than good, on account of any | deficiency ofthe material; neither can we complain that the material is not properly macadamized ; the good intentions of the present times being, for the most part, of the smallest possible dimensions, however otherwise excellent their quality. It is not that the ' Experiments on Living' do not unfold an important truth too much neglected by "the low ambition" of thousands of estimable families, whose whole life and utility to society are marred by the perpetual dread in which they live of some Mrs. Grundy. The ne te ijiucsireris extra is as applicable to the common household cares of life, as to the highest points of exalted morality. The vanity, more especially, of contending with those above us in wealth or station is to h^ found working its misery alike in back garrets and in the mansions of Belgrave Square, wherever education, and especially female education, has been neglected. There is no station in society that is exempt from it; and it is curious to observe that the evil seems to beset American more than English life, although, in England, it harmonizes so much better with the general feelings and prejudices of the people, whijIi all breathe of aristocracy. Neither would we say that the author has not worked out his problem, and fully exposed, in his little drama, the multiplied evils that may fall upon persons, even of superior intelligence and virtue, from this one little weakness; but we xvould contend?as wc have more than once contended, and shall continue to contend on every available occasion ? that thc peddling morality which deals in specialities, and disports itself in monographs of virtue and vice, is altogether below the occasion ; that its teachings are adapted only to infants, and to those children of a larger growth xvho cannot or xviii not think, and upon whom all lessons are alike thrown away. Temperance tracts, prudence tracts, and honesty tracts (like the '? sinful Sallys" of sectarian religion) are the petty means of petty intellects, and partake more of cunning than of\visdom,orof atnie knowledge cf human nature. Philanthropists of the microscopic class, xvho delight in such compositions, to use the words of Dr. ("nanning, "expect a people to think and act wisely in special cases, ;:lthough generally wanting in intelligence, sound judgment, and the capacity of understanding and applying the principles of reason. But this partial improvement is a vain hope. To do men permanent goo.l, xve must act on their xvhole nature, and especially must aid, and foster, and guide their highest faculties, at the first period of developement.?Benevolence is short-sighted indeed, and must blame itself for failure, if it do not see in education the chief interest of the human race." These are the words of perhaps the soundest philosopher of the day?the Franklin and the Socrates of the pulpit,?but better still, they are the words of truth itself. It is only by raising the entire character of the people, by enlarging their views, and elevating the general standard of national morality, that a community can be cured of its vices and improved in happiness : all the rest is sheer quackery.?often false and erj roneous; and even when most correct, deficient in all the dignity and manliness of real virtue.

Thc Crovm Ward. By Archibald Boyd. 3 vol3. (Bentley.)?This story is laid in Scotland, in the reign of King James the Sixth;?it is interesting, although it cannot take rank as a firstclass historical novel. There is evidence of careful reading to get up the characters, manners, costumes, and contemporary history, which are all used easily and naturally for the good of the book, not for the vanity of the author ; indeed, there is a remarkable and praiseworthy absence of all pedantry and useless display. The descriptions of scenery and of the different localities are fresh and graphic. The characters are less successful?and the story lacks body and reality. It is too full of stage business and melodramatic arrangements,? neither is it well built up. The main action of the story is allowed to stagnate in long-drawn interviews and conversations, which have no relation to the matter in hand. A mysterious stranger, disguised as an Italian jeweller, is the individual who plays the part of Providence throughout. He appears in the first scene, and keeps the stage until the last; for no other purpose, apparently, but to find out everybody's secret, and transact everybody's business?except his own, which indeed is not very clearly defined. The hero and heroine have not much to do, and are passive, albeit grateful, objects, of the mysterious Italian's good offices in their behalf. King James is well drawn, and has a great look of being a life-like portrait; his Queen, although elaborately described, is not so successful;?the character which will, we fancy, find the most favour with the reader is Willie Armstrong, the Moss Trooper. His escape from Carlisle Castle is not only a stirring incident graphically described, but it is quite true. The book will be a welcome addition to circulating libraries, and will, we have no doubt, be in request, for it is pleasant reading, and though the story is laid in times so long ago, the interest is fresh, and requires no effort to get it up ; this is no small praise when speaking of an historical novel, which generally requires some courage to encounter.

REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. T.afAJ OF my LANDILOIID. Second Sc- I ries. Collected and arranged hy Jededialh Cleishbothani, &e. Edinburgh, 1818. 4 rols. The author of this Novel will have no one to accuse so much as himself, if the criti al julgiment passe(l u1)o11 it should not be so favourable as he wishes. lie has raised the standard by which such pioductions are tried so high, that it is not surprising that eveen he should sometinies be foun(l to fall short of it. In a word, we think The Heart of' Mid-Lothia, for such is time title of the story w\hich occul)ies these four volumies, inferior in almost every respect to the preceding works from the same source, in(luding the Waverley series with that designated as Tales of my Landlord. It appears to uls that tuis hnew PubliCation has less ot the h)ortraiture of national manners than the best of its precursors, while it has mnore of the nnfolInflon inicidents (onUonUo to the class of writings to which it belongs. It produces an inferior effect from delineating, and that in a fainter mnanner, the characteristics of a sect (Camieronians) neither so important nor so interesting as the Covenanters, personified in Balfour of Burlev, old Mrs. I Iealdriagg, and their teachers andll plrtisais. Its actors are of too low an or(ler, an(l the scene of a gaol, with the adventures of its inmiates of thieftakers, prostitutes, rogues, rol)hers, an(l murolerers, does, we conceive, furnish a had foundation for a narrative of this length. The law %%ith 1%hich the volutmes aboun(l, thou.,h sometimes Witty and generally wh imsical, is bv far too prolix; and the endless definitions of Air. Saddletree, an artisan prone to attendin- the Court of Session, become really tedious, especiaily when, superadded to I leadings and opinions of cotullsel as long and ininute as if the case, instead of a fiction, were really one of life and death. ro conclude our objections, there are more evident symptoms of carelessness in this composition than we remember in any of the former ; antI though the author cannot write ill, nor what would fail to be entertaining, he has upon the whole permitted as much alloy to creep into these pages as we could have anticipated at his hands. Notwithstanding thlese defects, how- ever, there are many parts of deep pathos ; there is great spirit and truth in the drawing of most of the characters; the fabulous p)ortion of the story is admirably conineeted with the history of Captain Porteous' death, and its conse(illeilIS; and( the catastrophe is dreadfully just, though perhaps the mnoral lesson instilled hv the lives of Euphemia Deans afnd George Robertson, is rather calculatedl to prodluce evil than goo(I. Novels are to us the most difficult things to review in a satisfictory manner. Neither a (Iry outline of the l)lot, nor an extract of any particular psart, suffice to convev an ade(lquate idela of the .ulbject in hanln(, anld our limits do not admit of going more at large into illustration. As far as we may go we now pIroCee(d to a1nalyze ' The leart of MidLothian.' T'he uarit ol' iMid-Lothuiamn, then, is uic 'r'oibootih, or Newgitte of Ldinburgh, and it is ficetiously declared to be a sad heart, a close heart, a wicked heart and a pioor heart, a stron-' heart and a1 high heart. At the execution of one Wilson, in Sept. 1736, for robbing a Cmutomhouse olbicer, some tumult arose, and Porteous, cal)tain of the town guard, fired among the mob, I)v which several personls were killed. For this offence he was tried, anold coiioiemiiied to death, but reprieved by Queeii Caroline on the day appointed for his doom. The pl)opllace were infuriated by this biaulk on justice, ;Ls they considereol it, an(i at night the extraordiniary spectacle was seen of an organized multitude disarming the sob diery, securing the gates, breaking open the p~rison, drag~iig forth the prisoner, and hanging him near the usual place for carrying into etfect the sentence of the law. No disorder of any kind accomnpanied this tumultuous rising, i wvhich )olitics were deeply concerimeh. But the murder of Captain Porteous is too generally known to reojuire further elucidation ; and while we give the author credit for having detailed thie whole affair in an aninmated way, we conceive he miight advantageously have abridged it, so as not to occup)y, as it does, almost all the first volume. The fiction woven upon this real incident is thus managed. In the Tolboothi, at the p)eriod of Porteous' mo0), is a girl name(l Effie Deans, accused of childmurder, an(h at least of concealing the birth of a natural child, which was a ca- pital offence by the then laws of Scotland. She is the youngest daughter of David Deans, a cow-keeper, near Edinburgh, a rigid Dissenter of the sect of Camieronians. Rteuben Butler, a poor young schoolmaster in holy orders, and attached to Jeanie Deans, the elder sister, is forced by the nmob to officiate ; chaplain to Captain Porteous; and it turns out that an accomplice of Wilson's, who acted a consl)icuous part in this riot in a feimale dress, is the seducer of poor Effie, and the father of her lost child. 'T0 rescue her is one of his inducements to undertake this desperate exploit, but she refuses to escape when the doors of her dungeon are opened to her. Robertson is obliged to fly, and figures in half a dozen Jonathan Wild sort of adventures; one of which is to persuade Jeanie Deans to swear that her unhapp)y sister had not concealed her i reinancy fromuc her, which would do away with the capital charge against her. lThis perjury the religious and virtuous Jeanie refuses to commit, and Eflie is consicted and condemned to die. Jeanie now determines to walk to London, and solicit her pardon from the Queen; and through the mediation of the great Duke of Argyle, she obtains an interview of Her Majesty, and miraculously carries her point. In her journey, however, she encounters some strange obstacles. She is made captive by an old gipsey of the name of Murdockson, who, with her mad daughter, are the parties that disposed of Effie's child, out of revenge for the seduction of the daughter bv Robertson. She also encounters lRobert-son himself, who turns out to be the son of Mr. Staunton, a dignitary of the Church, and of a very ancient family. IHe is nowv reclaimed and repentant. Having accomplished her purpose in London, Jeanie returns, marries Butler, who is presehltedl to a church by the Duke of Argyle; and David Deans, being appointed a kind of overseer at the same place, the whole family settle comnfi)rtably on the borders of Dumbartonshire. Effie, when released, elopes from her father's house, and is secretly united to her lover, who gets her polished by a few years residence upon the Continent, and returns to England and to large property wvith his wife, whose history is confined to his own bosom, and that of her sister. Theylive in splendidwretchedness. while the humbler branches of the I)eauzb ennection enjoy comfort and hapitie..

Old I)avid D)eans is gathered tA) his tfathers, and the Butlers live b)eloved and die lamentedl. Such is the general outline of this Novel; but there are subordlinate elarneters of considerable originality, '%%ho till up the canvas, an d often stan(l oii tie foreground. Of these the chief nre, the Laird of Dumibiedikes, a selfish Natural, and a suitor to Jeanie Deans, though his mode (of courtship is exceedeingly egurious nnd tneiturn. liartholine Saddl(IIetree, the law-devotedl artisan, of whom we have alrenadly spoken, and his wife.

'rhe trial scene of 1flie Deans is extremely affecting, but its length forbids cxtrdct: the prev'ious meeting of the sisters in the prison, is also touching in a powerful degree; we can only give u very l)rief exam)le of it:" 0, Effle," said her elder Sister, " how coulld vou conceal your situation from me ! (0, womian, had I deserved this at your hand? hadl ye spoke but ae word -sorry we might have been, and shamed we might hae been, but this awfu' dispensation had never come ower us." ' And what gude wad that hae dune?' answered the prisoner. ' Na, na, Jeanie, a' was ower even ance I forgot what Iproiuised when I faulded down the leaf of my Bible. See (she said, producing the sacred volume) the book opens aye at the place o' itsell. 0 see, Jeanie, what a feartu' scrieture.' *Jeamne took her sisters Bible, and found that the fatal mark was made at this inpressive text in the book of Job: " He hat,, strippedl ime of my glory, and taken the crown fromn m head, li bath destroy. ed ns oa every side, and I am gone. And mine hope hath hel removed like a tree." " Isna that ower true a (loctrine ?" said the prisoner-" Isna my crown, may honour removed ? And what am I but a poor wasted wvan-thriven tree, dug up by the roots, anl flung out to waste in the highway, that man and beast may tread it under foot ?

'0, if ye had spoken a word,' again sl)bcd Jeanie - - - - - She then explains that the conse(quence would have been to clear her of the capital crime, and a dialogue resemMing that between Florio and IsabeUa, in Measure forAleasure, ensues, in which the wretched Eflie implores her sister to (lo a little iwrong to save her life, and avows her unchangeable love for her seducer. The interview with the Queen is one of the happiest efforts of the author. Jeanie commits several blunders, such as observing, that there were many places besides Scotland, where mothers were unkind to their own flesh and blood(the disputes between the King and Prince of Wales were then at their height, and the blame was pretty gene- rally laid upon the Qtieen ;) expllning the use ot the stool of repentance tor light lite and( conversation, antd for breaking the se% enth commandment, to Lady Suffolk, thle King's mistress, &c.

Thunberg, also pubbsbi d neatly thirty ye irs since, (both of which works are now of extreme rarity), there is not, we believe, any authentic account of the Japanese Empire extant. 'I fie Dutch merchants, as Capt. (iolowniu justly observes, who trade to Nangasaky, have doubtless, from tin ir know \< dge ot the Japanese languagi , hail the opportunity of collecting' much inti roting information, notwithstanding tln-ir communications y? ''i the inhabitants aie wry limit'- '. i i oin the jeal.u-v ol commerce, how .wt, l tn > !iav e studiously ht pt their kno.y!' u\re to themselves ; m? that, ;.l though hey an- t' e nlv I'Uiopeau people, v? i: ?? h ii ve for a long tune had admission .??.Japan, no account ol that island is ti be Spieled from them. I nih r j these circumstances; the narrative ot Capt. (lolovvnin possesses peculiar iii- | terest ; and though his situation a.s a captive necessarily circumscribtd his mean* of observation tm many points, yet bis \\or!v contains a great fund ol curious and valuable information relative to that couiparativi ly unknown Ktupire. In ISO.j, the nresetit emperor of Russia dispatched the chamberlain Resanoff, to Japan, in order to open a commercial interi nurse with that country. Tins atteinit having failed, Resanolf sriih d to Aim nea, in one of the American Company's sin ps, under the coinmaud of Lieutenant Chwostofl, and returned to (Jkotzk. Chwostofl, however, put to sea awaiti, ami attacked the Japanese villages on the Kurile islands. We shall not detain our readers with a detail of the circumstances of Capt. d.'s voyage to visit the southern Kurile islands, whither he was despatched in in the Russian Sloop, Diana, in 1811; but shall take up his narrative from his captivity; prt mising only that he was enticed on shore, with two other officers, four sailors, and a Kurile pilot, in all eight persons ; the whole of whom were made prisoners. They were tied together in a most painful manner, with cords round their breasts and necks, their hands being firmly secured together ; and after being marched to various places for hfty days, the captives were conducted to a prison in a city called Chakoihide. Here they underwent several tiresome examinations ; and Capt. G. being deprived of paper and ink, had recouise to the following singular mode of keeping a journal :? When any thing agreeable happened to himself and his ?companions, he tied a knot on a while thread, which he drew out of the lull tri his shirt ; and when any tiling i nphisant occurred, be made a memorandum nf it by tying a knot on a thnad ol" black silk, taken out of his link handkerchief. Other circumst.uicts, that were of an indifferent nairne, he recorded by kinds tm a thread of i;reen silk, which he extracted from the lining of his uniform coat. These knots he l'iequently counted over, in order to recall to mind the events which they served to denote. At hugill they were conducted to Matsinai, the capital of an island of the same name, and literally confined in cages. Our author has given the following description of their prison :? lt was a quadrangular wooden building, tweuty-liw pa< < s loni!', ffftttu broad, anti twelve ft ct high. Three sides were complete wail, without anv aperture whatever; but the south side was formed of strong spars, four inches squ ire, and pl,iced at the distance of four inches, also, from each other. ()u the side winch consisted of these spars, there was a gate, anti a little dour, both of which were, howevci, kept fast lot ked. lu the middle were tw01 ages, formed of spits, similar to I hose tm the south side of the prison. The\ were so placed, as to leate a passage between each, and also passigts I (tween them and the walls of the prison. One cage was *ix paces square, and ten feet high ; the other was of an equal breadth and height, bot was eight paces long. We three officers were put into the former ; the sailors and Alexei, were confined in the latter. The entrance to the cage was so low, that we were obliged (o ercep into it. The door was formed of massy spars, ami vvus fastened by a strong iron bolt. Above the door was a small hole, through which our food was handed to us. A small water closet was constructed in the further end of each cage The sides of thc cage next each other were bounded in such a manner, that we could see the sailors, but they could not perceive us ; a skreen was also placed between the closets, for the purpose of obstructing the view from the out* to the other. \ guard-room was placet] against the spars, which formed the entrance side of tin- prison, and which was occupied hy two soldiers in the service of the Itupeiial (loveriiiiie nt, who wire constantly on guard ; they could see us all, ami seldom turned their eyes aw av from us. The whole building was surrounded, at the distance of from six to eight paces, by a high wy)l or fence, with shaip pointed woollen stakes, and m which there was a door exactly opposite that of the prison. Around the first wall was a second but less high ?Vnce, nu hiding a considerable space, withal which were, on one side of the gate of tue gnat wall, the cooking room, and an ipiitinent tor the workmen, and, on the other Mile, a puard-house. The outer quarti consisted of soldiers belonging lo tiie Prince of Tzyngar. They were not allowed to tome near us, nor even to piss within the first feni'e, but patrolled the rounds every half hour. During tin: night they hail fire and struck the hours with two boards : the imperial soldiers on the j contrary visited us every half hour, walked roiintl our cages ami looked through tin spars. The whole structure was situ at ed between au abrupt and deep liol low, through which a stream flowed, a. ii the rampart of the castle, from which i' uai separated by a road of no great breath li. At night this prison was most horribly dismal ; we hail no fire ; t night limp supplied with fish oil, and plated in a paper linfern, was kept burning in the piard-room, but the feeble glimmering hijht which it shed between the spars, was 'rarcely capable of rendering any object visible to ns. The clanking noise made every half hour by the moving of thc locks and bolts when the soldiers inspected us, rendered this gloomy place still more disagreeable, and did not allow us to enjoy a moments repose. Several long and tedious examinations msued, but without any indication tbat they would be liberated. At length, weary of confinement, Capt. Golownin and five, of his companions in misfortune attempted to make their escape. But after suffering extreme hardships, and wandering for ten days in the country, they were recaptured, and agaiu conducted to their prison. A similar course of examinations ensued ; and at last, after being confined for two years, two months, and twenty-six days, they were liberated, in consequence of the successful negociations of Lieut. ftikord ; who, on ascertaining their seizure by the Japanese, had returned to Okotsk. Having procured satisfactory official documents, condemning the conduct of Chwostoff", above noticed, he returned to the Harbour of Kuuashier, and ultimately succeeded in liberating his countrymen. The details of Captain Golownin's examinations are very curious; and the narrative of the attempt to escape, cannot be read without the deepest interest. .Many notices respecting the manners anti principles of the Japanese, are scattered through these volumes, from which we select the following particulars :? The Japanese beds consist, according to the circumstances of the owners, of large silken or cotton quilts; these quilts are lined with thick wadding, which is taken out previous to their being washed. The Japanese fold their coverlets double and spread them on the door, which, even in the humblest cottages, is coveted with beautiful soft straw mats. On retiring to rest, the J ipauese wrap themselves in large nightdresses, with short full sleeves; these are likewise either of cotton or silk, and are thickly watlded. Instead of pillows, they make usc of pieces of wood carted iii various forms. The common people place under their heads a piece of round wood hollow at ont; end, and, from custom, sleep as soundly on this as on the softest pillow. The higher or richer classes make use of a very neat box, about eleven inches high, to the lid of which un oval cushion is affixed, from six to eight inches in length, and from two to three in breadth. This box contains articles which they make use of at the toilette, such as razors, scissars, pomatum, tooth-finishes, powder, Ste. In this Island, as well as in China, tea is an article of prime consumption. The Japanese have tea of native growth, both black and green j the former is how - ? vcr very bad; is is like the Chinese tea <>nlv ni colour, but bears no resemblance to it in ti Jr ni smell.

They ire fond of playing for money, and will stake their last piece upon a game, They were taught to play at cards by thc Dutch sailors, who were allowed free in- tercourse with tin' inhabitants, and inNangasaky were permitted to visit taverns ami women of a certain character; who, m Jap in, tarry on their trade of prostitution under tin: protection of the laws. The cards wt re at first known to the Japanese by their European names, and there were fifty-two ina pack. Owing, however, tn the pecuniary losses and fatal disputes to which cacti playing give rise, that amusement was strictly prohibited in Japan. In order to evade the law, the Japanese invented a pack of forty-eight cards, wliicL are much smaller than ours, and which are generally used. Their game at draughts is extremely complicated and difficult. They u.ake use of a very large draught!.o nd and f iiir hundred nun, which thc. move a!:, ut in iinny diH'eieut direction*, md y\ iin b ari' Inible to be taken in vannin .yass. Our sailors played at draught* ar - lording to the usual Iairopeui ^,iy j thr Japanese im:ut diatcly imitateil them, ri ml th" game was soon generally known throughout the whole city, anil the Hus si,io tel ins were adopted in playing it. A singular division of tiim- obtains among his people They divide tlie lav into Uve'.ve hours, from sun-rise to -uu-set, and an equal number from sunet to sun-rise ; consequently the hourn ? in- led always equal ill length. When the d iv is loiigi r th..11 the night, the 11sl:'11 hours are longest, and vice versa. In or!, i ..i !..tasuie time, they employ a s'l.di be mi nf wo.ul, the upper part ol' which i i-oviieil with glue and whitewash* ,,; i n n row gionve is math' mille u!u,' :,nd ti:it il with a vegetable powder wini li huro> v< rv slowly ; tm each hide 01 tins gi?.ove, it eerlain distances, there art holes lorna il for the purpose of nails beni!, put into tin in. Ivy these hole**, the length of the day and night hours is determined i'm' 1 he space of six months, from tht; spring lo the v inter equinox. During the other sis mon hs the rule is inverted, the day becoming night houri:, anil the night, day hans. The Japanese ascertain ihe length ol a day I om, and mark "t tiff' with nails; li ev then fill the groove with powder, set light to it at noon, and thus measure their time. The beam is kept in a box, which is laid in a dry place; but the changes of w Mlicr have, notwithstanding, a great inti .iee on this kind of time keeper. lit Jap niese day begins at midnight, at which time the clock strikes nine, after having given three strokes, as it were to denote the being about to strike. These three strokes precede every hour. One hour after midnight, the clock strikes eight, the next hour seven, at sunrise six, then jive, four, ami at noon again niue. One hour after midday eight, two hours after mill day swen, at sunset six, Ihen Jive, ami finally four. At midnight the new day commences. The hours are struck in the following manner : first, one stroke ; in a ininiute null a half, a second stroke, anti immediately a third. These three warning stroke* announce that the hour is about to he struck. In the space of a minute ami a half after, the striking of the hour begins. The strokes succeed each tither at intervals of fifteen seconds, except the two last, which follow more rapidly, as if lo notify that thc hour is struck. Though bigotted to their own religion, ?lu Japanese allow ample toleration to various sects, besides permitting the public profession of the Kurili; religion; hut they are quite intolerant against Christianity, on account of tin- troubles it has occasioned among them, consequently the laws are. extremely rigorous against teachers of the Christian faith. The Catholic priests, who formerly lived in Japan, ami enjoyed every possible freeilom, preached thc Christian faith, and converted a great number of the natives ; but, atlast, the progress of the new religion gave risc to a dreadful civil war. For this reason, after the complete extirpation of the Christians, the following inscription was placed at the head of the stone tablets of laws, which are fix eil up in all public places, and even in the streets:?"Whoever knows any individual who has taught Christianity, ami can convict him thereof, shall receive a rewanl of five hundred silver piece*."??There is, likewise, a law winch prohibits masters from hiring servants, until they receive from them a written assurance of their not being Christians. In Nangasiky, where Christianity had malle the greatest progress, there is a stair> ase, on the steps of which are laid various ornaments and utensils of the Catholic diurc.li, anil on thc first step a crucifix. On new-yen r's flay, all the inhabitants of Nan;,r8saky are obliged to ascend these steps ; ind, as n proof that they fire not Christians, trample on the articles. The interpreter assured ns, that many Christians who live uNangasaky comply with this regulation from interested motives. During Captain Golownin's residence m Japan, two warehouses filled with ,roods, and shortly after a house, all belonging to the same merchant, were burnt down. There was every reason lo believe that they were wilfully set on fire, but the perpetrators of the crime could not be discovered. Occurrences of this kind, he was assured, are by no means uncommon, although incendiaries are by tht; law of Japan condemned toa terrible punishment. The offender on fiting conducted to (lie plate of execution, which is usually without thc walls of the city, is stript anti tietl to a stake, round which,at a short distance, piles of lighted wood ait- plo ttl. The criminal is thus slowly burnt to death, and endures the most unspeakable toittirc. Ort the dames being extinguished, a tablet, on which are inscribed his name, ami an account of the crime for which he suffered, is nailed to the stake, and his body is abandoned ns a prey to the wilt! beasts ami bird*. Wilful setting fire to a building is, according to the laws of Japan, the crime next in enormity to parricide. In cases of fire, assistance is promptly and efficiently given tm such occasions. Both officers and soldiers wear a particular dress, which ?ve had now au opportunity of seeing. It exactly resembles their military uniform; consisting of coats of mail, sleeve cases, &c. But the whole is composed of light varnished leather, so that this armour is not buitbt nsonie to the wearer, and cannot be injured by the sparks which issue from thc fire. On the coat of mail the rank and office of the wearer are described. To extinguish a fire is regarded a most glorious achievement among thc Japanese. When a fire breaks out in the capital, where there are numerous corps of troops, the commander who first proceeds to extinguish it, fixes his standard near the spot, anti it is deemed exceedingly offensive if another officer lend* liis assistance without being invited by him who lias, by his early arrival, obtained possession of the ground. In former times, oreuri cutes of this nature frequently gave rise to duels between the princes and grandees, and sometimes battles, in which their respective adherents engaged : even now, serious contentions often arise when one oft.'cer shews au inclination to deprive another of thc honour of having extinguished a fire. Many other interesting particulars concerning the Japanese are introduced in this interesting work, which we could with pleasure have extracted, had our limits permitted. Notwithstanding: the disadvantages under which Captain CJolowtiin necessarily laboured, from his captivity, he fias collected a gnat number ot curious facts relative to that comparatively unknown people ; and the manner in which lit has related bis imprisonment is such as cannot but awaken the deepest sympathy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samuel Richardson. By Austin Dobson. ".tinglis- Men of Letters." (Macmillan &Co.) Ix this little book Mr. Austin Dobson traverses ground long familiar to him and, of recent years, tolerably well trodden. Since the appearance, at Jena, twenty-seven years ago, ot Mr. Erich Schmidt's ' Richardson, Rousseau, und Goethe,' critical studies or ' Lives' of the novelist have been published by Sir Leslie Stephen (1883), by the late M. Joseph Texte of Lyons (1895), by Miss Clara Thomson (1900), and, in October, 1901, by Miss Ethel McKenna; while of the literature dealing indirectly with the subject may be mentioned the late H. D. Traill's witty 'Dialogue between Fielding and Richardson,' in the 'New Lucian' (1884), and Mrs. Andrew Lang's vigorous essay, ' On Morals and Manners in Richardson' {National Review, November, 1889). Though on a fairly well-worn subject, Mr. Dobson's sketch is, however, freshly and brightly written; and if it will not materially advance its author's reputation?if, on the whole, it fails to reach the high pitch of excellence exemplified in the 'Johnson,' the 'Southey,' and the 'Keats' of this admirable series?it may yet claim the merit of a faithful and genial delineation, while it exhibits some of those minute accessory touches?out-of-the-way details, remote allusions, novel and curious illustrations?with which the writer's wide knowledge of the period enables him to vivify and, so to speak, to date his eighteenth-century portraiture. In 1804 Mrs. Barbauld prepared for (Sir) Richard Phillips, of the Monthly Magazine, a selection of Richardson's correspondence in six volumes, prefixing thereto a critical biography, which to this day remains the chief source of information about him. The letters (originals and transcripts), to the number of eight hundred and fifty?including, of course, many omitted by Mrs. Barbauld?are now in the Forster Collection at South Kensington, where they occupy "no fewer than six vast folio volumes, of which the aspect alone is sufficient to appal the stoutest explorer." Burrowing through this immeasurable sand-heap, Mr. Austin Dobson has disinterred some novel and interesting particulars concerning the little printer of Salisbury Court aud his friends. The two chapters headed ' Correspondence' are, indeed, much the liveliest in the book. Of the earlier correspondents (1739-48) the most entertaining is Laetitia Pilkington, an impecunious epistolary artist of the first rank, whose letters Mrs. Barbauld has, to the credit of her editorial sagacity, printed in full. " Your ever obliged, and most truly acknowledging servant, while this machine is Letitia," is a sample signature of this female Micawber, whose son, John Carteret Pilkington, by the way, was the hero of Goldsmith's white mice incident (see Mr. Dobson's 'Life of Goldsmith,' p. 84). Of Lfctitia?or, as she sometimes signs herself, "Tristitia"?Mr. Austin Dobson has, however, nothing new to tell; but of the versatile and voluminous Aaron Hill, who combined the part of poet with that of critic (did he not write ?TheFanciad; or, Go to Bed, Tom'?), he produces some fresh details. The vicissitudes of Pope's quarrel with Hill (who ingeniously contrived to hang over the head of the poet the threat of future criticism, flattering or otherwise, according as Pope should behave himself!) are here recounted at length. It is Hill who records the effect of ' Pamela' on the faculties of that early-ripe six-yearold, Master Harry Campbell?the same, doubtless, who in manhood witnessed the printer's last will and testament. Master Harry had, it seems, assisted at a seance where ' Pamela' was read aloud, grew insatiable, and, like another more famous urchin, clamoured for "more"! Needless to say, the simple author was delighted, and the "infant phenomenon" was promptly rewarded with a copy of * ^Esop's Fables,' adorned with "copper cuts,"andfurnished by Richardson himself with an elaborate index and an appendix of " morals and reflections adapted from Sir Roger 1'Estrange." Another enthusiast, the Rev. Samuel Lobb, tells Richardson that as soon as his son?his Billy?could read, he should give him 4 Pamela ' " to teach him virtue." Daudet, Mrs. Andrew Lang reminds us, dedicated 4 Sapho' to his sons for a similar purpose. One wonders whether Harry and Billy ever mot and, like the augurs over their solemn rites, exchanged a quiet wink of mutual understanding. The fact is that the little printer's vanity was always laying him open to the wiles of interested flatterers. On May 2nd, 1754, one " B. F." writes to Richardson from the Fleet, " to announce his conversion from libertinism, owing to the improving influence of Sir Charles Grandison, and the salutary monition conveyed by the dreadful catastrophe of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen.For the future, virtue and honour are to be the standard and governor of all the writer's actions. This ingenuous effusion may, of course, have been bond fide. But, in all probability, it was speedily followed by some liberal gratuity from the fluttered and flattered author. .Another unpublished * admirer,' who occupies a considerable portion of two of the Forster folios, is a Warwick attorney, one Eusebius Sylvester. Mr. Sylvester is ' B. F.' of the Fleet 'writ large.' He begins by nattery and applications for moral counsel. These latter eventually take the form of requests for pecuniary aid, which Richardson rather unwillingly gives, as loans, tempered by advice, and the final non-payment of the money brings the correspondence to an angry and undignified termination. This Sylvester episode exhibits Richardson at his best and at his weakest, by showing how readily his native benevolence became the dupe of his morbid appetite for what, upon this occasion, he comes to qualify bitterly as the 'undesired and officious Applause of his Writings,' forgetting that in his earliest communication he had welcomed it as ' kind and generous Approbation.' The spectacle is scarcely edifying ; but it is by no means uncommon." Of the barrister Thomas Edwards, of Turrick, "next to Young [of the 'Night Thoughts'] the most important of Richardson's male correspondents," an interesting account is also included. Edwards, whom Miss Clara Thomson justly places amongst the pioneers of the romantic revival, was the author of the ' Canons of Criticism' ?an attack upon the Shakspearean lucubrations of Warburton which Johnson, Warburton's friend, damns with faint praise in the preface to his edition of the plays. Edwards also wrote sonnets in the Miltonic style, to one of which (the point is overlooked by Mr. Austin Dobson) ? that addressed to his nephew Joseph Paice, Lamb's early patron at the South Sea House ? flattering reference is made in the Elian essay on ' Modern Gallantry.' Richardson's friendship for Edwards was, it is to be feared, in some measure due to the intense distaste exhibited by the latter for Fielding. On reading the ' Voyage to Lisbon,' Edwards writes " with much indignation " to his gratified correspondent: ? " That a man who had led such a life as he [Fielding] had, should trifle in that manner when immediate death was before his eyes, is amazing. From this book I am confirmed in what his other works had fully persuaded me of, that with all his parade of pretences to virtuous and humane affections, tho fellow had no heart. And so?his knell is knolled." Richardson's persistent efforts to disparage his easy-hearted rival?of whose genius, in truth, he stood in a perpetual tremor of jealous dread?exhibit him in a light which, if half odious, is wholly ludicrous. When ' Tom Jones' is published he turns for sympathy to his worshipful admirers, the Misses Astnea, Minerva, and Urania Hill. What, he inquires, is their opinion of this " coarse-titled " tale, with its " spurious brat " ? He has not found time to look into the trash himself. To his dismay, the triad report favourably on Mr. Fielding's work; they find in it "a double Merit, both of Head, and Heart." In the course of the story, they aver, " Sincerity is rewarded, Hypocrisy exposed and punished, Pity and Benevolence shown in amiable Lights, and Avarice and Brutality in very despicable ones." The horrified Richardson rejoins by flatly charging them with critical perversity; they have, he roundly asserts, discredited their judgment by commending "a work of Evil Tendency"?. which, be it remembered, he has not read. In their surrejoinder the wounded nymphs express the hope that, whenever their correspondent should find time to peruse the book in dispute, he might discover "a Thread of Moral meaning " in it. Richardson's rebutter pronounces " Fielding a very indelicate, a very impetuous, an unyieldingspirited Man," but hints that, should occasion smile, he may yet "bestow a Reading " on ' Tom Jones':? " Whether he eventually did so, it is difficult to decide. But in a letter to another correspondent dated January, 1750?a letter in which he continues to harp on ' the weak, the insipid, the Runaway, the Inn - frequenting Sophia' and her ' illegitimate Tom'?he professes, as before, to speak on hearsay.But he must, at least, have had his consolations. One Solomon Lowe, the author of a ' Critical Spelling Book,' gravely assures him that all Europe would ultimately ring with 'Clarissa,' ' when a Cracker, that was some thousd hours a-composing, will no longer be heard or talk't of.' Mr. Lowe's letter is to be seen at South Kensington, and Richardson has gravely endorsed it with his own hand?' Cracker, T, Jones.'" Amongst the questions discussed in the book is that of the authorship of a coarse but trenchant skit on ' Pamela,' which, under the title of " An Apology for the Life of Mrs. Shamela Andrews.By Mr. Conny Keyber," appeared in April, 1741, some five months after the publication of ' Pamela.' The evidence points to Fielding as the perpetrator; but Mr. Austin Dobson shows? and this is important ? that the writer, whether Fielding or another, seems to have associated the authorship of ' Pamela' not with Richardson, but rather with Colley Cibber, against whom Fielding had a longstanding grievance:? "If Fielding really associated Colley Cibber with ' Pamela,' it accounts in some measure for the association of Shamela's 'Apology' with ' Conny Keyber'?a surname he had already applied to Cibber in the * Author's Farce ' ten years earlier." If, then, we may set aside ' Shamela,' as aimed not against Richardson, but Cibber, there is little to call for censure in Fielding's attitude towards his peevish rival. True, ' Joseph Andrews' betrays a certain smiling, half - humorous contempt for the prudery, the snobbishness, the sickly sentiment of ' Pamela'; but, as Mr. Dobson is careful to note, the connexion of ' Joseph Andrews' with Richardson is in reality but small :? " When Parson Adams makes his appearance in chap. iii. the author's original purpose begins to be forgotten, and after chap. x. it is practically shelved, only to be recalled at the end of the book for the sake of coherence." And when ' Clarissa' appeared no one was louder or more cordial in its praise than Fielding:? "' Such Simplicity,' he writes in the 'Jacobite's Journal,' 'such Manners, such deep Penetration into Nature ; such Power to raise and alarm the Passions, few Writers, either ancient or modern, have been possessed of.'" Perhaps the least satisfactory part of MrAustin Dobson's book is at the close, where he deals with Richardson's influence abroad?a subj ect too important to be adequately handlea in four pages. For this, however, probably not the author himself, but the limits imposed upon him, should be held responsible. A needless interpolation in the line quoted on p. 123, Sage Palemon knows [how] to heal, seems to argue either a defective ear or an unfamiliarity with a fairly common poetical construction. The line is, technically, a trochaic dimeter catalectic : it consists, that is, of three trochees and a long or accented syllable over. And Mr. Austin Dobson must surely remember? Who would not sing for Lycidas? He knew Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhjme.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE HEART OF A MAN. Bv Richard Aumerle Maher. 6s. (Pitman.) "The Heart of a Man," is in every way a " big" book. It is the story of the eternal battle between capital and labour, wherein the poor are for ever crushed between the power of wealth and knowledge on the one hand, and the forces of cold and hunger on the other; a book full of great thoughts and powerful situations, through which breathes life itself. Written very evidently by a member of the Roman Catholic Church, of necessity it presents only one side, although that is a deeply interesting and illuminating side, of many questions; and one must remember while reading Mr. Maher's splendid appeal for the workman, that an employee frequently has not enough restraint to succeed as a capitalist, or the kind of courage required to deal with financial risks. The scene of the story is laid in 'Milton, " a one-mill town" in the Adirondack foothills, where the townspeople slave day and night in a machine milling plant for the privilege of living, in order to fill the pockets of John Sargent, the owfner, " a dynamic power over men and machines.'' You realise each detail of the strike of the workers whose every claim is ignored, and the famine they suffer in consequence; for the author paints fine descriptions, wherein each word is a vivid bit of colour applied by a sure brush. You feel upon terms of intimate friendship with John Loyd, the leader of the people; and Dean Driscoll the Catholic priest, whois so endearingly human, and yet so great a power for good; and Sargent who, devoid of principle,w\ill ruin or kill whoever hinders his plans, yet in the end-but I will leave vou to find out for yourself howv wonderful a thing the heart of a man, even of an obviously bad man, may be.

Vol. III.from ART to .BAT. IN the volume before us the biograpIhical articles appear to be more numnerous, and to occupy a larger proportion of the whole than in the preceding volumes. We are sorry to observe this not that wye think meanly of biography' in general, or of these articles in particular, which are for the mnost part very respectably executed, but that in a workl expressly devoted to the illustration of the arts and sciences personal history should be sparingly introduced, and be confined to thowe eminent characters who have miiaterially contributed to the advancement of knowledge. The geographical and historical articles fire numerous, and of various merit: in general, however, the shorter ones are the best. 'the account of Bata'via is very satisfactory, and, thougrl long, is by no means tedious: a similar but 1higher praise is due to Babylon, which. exhibits both good sense and profound. research. The topography of ancient and modern ALisens, and the history of the extraordinary people by -lwhom it was oince possessed, are derailed with all the impartiality and interesting minuteness that the subject requires. The Atlantic Ocean both deserved and would have affordied ample matter for a very curious and striking article, but is dispatched with an idie quotation of a few lines from a paper of Mr. Kirwani's in the Irish Transactions. relative to the formation of this great receptacle of wvaters by the deluge. The writer of the article ACia seems to have consideredl Siberia as the most important division orf this continent, by far the greatest part of the article being occupied wvith a detailed account of the Russian discoveries among those wild, almost uninhabited deserts, which are subject to the court of Petersburgh. In anatomy, the only very important subject treated of in the present volume is artery, which furnishes a neat but rather dry article. Badagc in surgery contains much excellent practical matter, and both asthma and ascaris are reputable specimens of the medical department. The articles in the mathematical department are few, but drawn tip with great judgment. The article arsiwra?:ce particularly deserves attention, and contains as muich of that difficult branch of science as the lmits of the work allow. Astronomy is confined chieflv to its history ; and the physical part is not treated so fully, and with that care to mark the progress of discovery, as we could have wished. We wvere surprised to find, that in enumerating the works to which the reader might apply for more particular inlformation on the authors and writers upon this science, the Bibliographie by Delalande, by far the Inost copious and useful work, was forgotten. Under the term ans;,pote, twvo curves are said to be as3ypmtotical lwhen they continually approach without a possibility s" of meeting, and thus two parabolas, whose axes are in the same right lines, are asymptotical to one another." That parabolas of this kind never meet each other is certain, but that they do not approach to each other is equally certain, and consequently, according to the definition, are not entitled to the epithet asymptotical; for let two parabolas have the same common vertex, the parameter of the one being four times the magnitude of that of the other, then the ordinate of the exterior parabOli Will be double the ordinate of the interior parabola when the abscissa Is the same to both ordinates: consequently the dis.ance between the extremities of these two ordinates, or the distance between two points of the curves where the ordinates meet them, is equal to the ordinate of the inner curve, and this ordinate increasing as the abscissa increases, the distance between the curves continually increases, and this distance wills increase to a magnitude greater than anv that can be assigned. Now suppo: the two curves not to have a common vertex, and the principal parameter of the outer curve being to that of the inner curve in the ratio of m to n, then if the distance between the vertices of the two parabolas is called a, the ratio of the ordinates at the same point of the axis is that of .,;-. a, +- to x,/ and consequently the distance between their extremities or two points of the curves is to the ordinate whose parameter is m as n/nz a + x m V/nax is to Vnx. When 'Via: a + X can V'/7X is equal to Va, then the two curves cut each other, and from that time the distance between the curves constantly increases, and if rnz. a+ is always greater than flux, then the distance between the curves may diminish beyond any assignable limit. Thus, let mz be equal to n- and x be great. er than any assignable magnitude; consequently ' ;rn. a+x is nearer to 'II.s than by any assignable difference; and the distance between the curves is to the ICsser ordinate in the ratio of an indefinitely small to an indefinitely great quantity, or the distance between the curves is in this case indefinitely small. We have then asymptotical parabolas agreeable to the definition, but not all parabolas formed on the same axis are asymptotical, according to that definition. The error in this article may be easily corrected under the article parabola. Under the article attraction, -in which that of large masses is well explained, and reference is made to Boscovich, we expected an ample account of his system, and that it would have been shovwn upon what principle he explained the communication of motion by one to another without contact, as also the impossibility of contact in nature. Perhaps it is intended that this should appear under the article lBoscovich in biography, which deserves a considerable degree of attention, and in which we hope to find a full account of a philosopher whose researches have been very much slighted by English mathematicians. AItmosphere is valuable as far as it goes, but the theories and observations of some modern writers of great merit are not noticed. Aurora borealis contains a very full, complete, and methodized account of the state of knowledge relative to this beautiful and curious phenomenon. Barometen is composed in the exhaustive German style, and will be resorted to by authors of less research as an invaluable treasure. There are some agricultural articles in the volume before us, which although written, as an American would say, lengthily, possess, however,'much intrinsic merit. The question concerning the effect of ashes as a manure is remarkably wrell discussed: the cultivation of barley, and the construction of barns, are also ably and usefully treated of. 'i% mineralogy there is no article that particularly demands notice; and the only chemical subjects of importance are azot and balsams. Bark in vegetable physiology is an interesting subject, and is noticed with adequate minuteness. Under the head of antiquarian topography and history are the British remains at Aevebuty, which arc particularly described. Barrow is an entertaining, though not a very profound article. B',rd is very superficial, and very erroneous: the writer quotes Mac Pherson's Ossian as true historv. The most original and instructive article, however, in the 'whole volume, and which exhibits most decidedly the hX-4nd of a master, is tasso-redievo. ElWe have little hesitati6n in attributing this to the taste and scielice of MIr. Flaxnmau. After defining the term, the author proceeds to trace the history of this branch of art. Acquiescing with the writer of the article in the Encyclopedie, that basso-relievo owes its birth to filgured or hieroglyphic writing, Mr. Flaxman proceeds to characterize the Egy ptian bassorelievos as being the oldest: " in these the figure is sunk in such a manner that the surface of the ground forms an enclosure or, outline whose greatest depth is equal to the greatest projection of the figure." We find in the Egyptian figures, compounded of different aulinlals, that each part Is a coopy of nature. In the human figure, ihe body- and limbs were represented ill geacral forums. Thefa. :e, as being the most interesting part of the'person, wvas more mi.,utely expressed. The form of the face woas a rounded egg, lines of the evebrows and lids, simple curves, inclining, upwards from the marc, the bottom of the nose and the line of the mouth inclined upwards in the same direction with the eves. The eyes were full, nearlv on a level wiih the forehead and cheeks, ai~d the lines of the eve-brows, lids, and borders of the lips, maried with precision. The chin appeared small and bony, the neck round, the shoulders high and broad, except the marking of the breast, little distinction of the muscular forms in anv part of the bodv' and lhinbs, the loins narrow, the limbs round, rather straight and slender, their joints slightly indicated, the hands and feet rather flat, the fingers and toes rounded, without the appearance of joints, aud nearly of the same length." The quadrupeds on Egyptian monuments are represented in profile, and in the simplest attitudes. The parts of which those are composed are fewer and more general than tlose in the hunsanfigure. This is one reason whv the Egyptiah's excelled ih their animals; the mechanieal manner in which the shoulder is drawn of the lion and sphlvnx (vwhere they have displayed more anatomy than in any other part) presents a simple, but not jtst account of the structure of that member ofthe bodv : these observations apply to the state of sculpture before the time of Alexander the Great after wLhich period, it partook of the imaprovements introduced by Its Grceian' conquerors." From the Egyptian the author pro. ceeds to the Indian and Persian basso. relievcs, and then enters upon an examination. of those of Greece. The Greeks seem to have -iakcn up the art nearly where the Egyptians left it, there being a very striking similarity between the earliest Gi eek basso-relievos an'9. the best of the Eli ptian ones. The Etruscan gems, as thev are called, are shoNva with high probability to have, been executed bh Greek artists. The style of the basso-relievos of Greece prior to the time of Peticles is then analysed, and illustrated by references to examples; from which we learn, first, their method of representing the gods; secondly, their manner of drawing the human figure and its actions; and, thirdly, the distinguishing characteristics of the draperies, &c. The age of Phidias then passes in review, as far as concerns the exquisite basso-relievos which were executed bv the hands or under the direction of this great master, and which even now, in the mutilated state to which they have been reduced by time and barbarian violence, are objects of despairing imitation to the best of our mo. dern artists. {' The execution of these works is equal to the conception; the sentiment is elevated and fit, the composition is noble, full, and various; the gods are sublime and beautiful, their positions present dignity and repose; the heroes are vigorous and active, and an admirable simplicity reigns through the whole; whether vou are roused bv the terrific engagemen t of a Centaur and aLapitha, or captivated by the modesty of the virgin chorusses. In the battles, thc figure is shewn in those elastic curves and varied movements, those uncommon but advantageous situations, which equally excite surprise and adiniration; every part is intelligible; they occupy such spaces of the ground as leave sufficient blank to render the outline distinct; and their quantities are so distributed, that one part is not bare while another is crowded; the lines themselves also become an ornament. The stories are told by- one plan or ground of figures; and, like the principal characters in the tragedies of _Eschvlus, Euripides, and Sophocles, their effect is weakened bv no under-plot of inferior heroes. The drawing of the figures is of the finest style, the outline and forms are chosen, the greater parts boldlv expressed, the lesser parts delicately indicated, but not more than necessary The account of the basso-relievos of Italy is introduced by the sculptured tomb supposed by D'Ankarville to be that of Tarquin the elder: the tri. umphal arches and columns, and sarcophagi, are then noticed, and the gradua7 decline of the art till the age of Constantine. The revival of this branch of sculpture is dated from the year 106S, when the cathedral at Pisa began to be built. The works of Nicolo Pisano and his scholars in the thirteenth century are mentioned with merited praise; and the gate of the baptistery of St. John in Florence, of which Michael Angelo said that it deserved to be the gate of Paradise. Mr. Flaxmnan then shows that the Christian religion presents personages and subjects equally favourable to sculpture as are to be found in the ancient classics, suggests some very judicious hints on the choice of subjects, and the manner of treating them, and concludes this very interesting article with an enumeration of the finest antique bassorelievos which are to be found in the cabinets of England. The volume before us is further enriched with two architectural articles of merit, namely, bas.lica and bath; and with a long account of banks, and the bank of England in particular. The last article is tattalin, which is treated of with all the minuteness of the regulation book, as if it was drawn up by some volunteer officer for the use of his parish association.

Every little, watei-ingr-place has its favouritk tourist ; pens, ink and papler are among the, inldispcnsa_ ble neceSsaries of at travclling equipage; landlor&l are la-id under contributioni for amusing anecdotes, and cham. bermaids for interestim.u lacc6; every stage-coach con. tains an adventutre and(l everv cottagre furnishes a den ouument.

The object of this Expedition wvas to discover, as the title pale declares, a passat, by the w ax of the AMiss(ouli and ColurIdfia rivers to the Pacific Ocean, -and thus to fill up that chasm in the topographical knowledge o f North America, w''Vhich had been lef t unexpQored by the labours o f IIca.rne and Ml'}'lenzie. The former of these gentle MentI 11tider the direction of the Hudsol's-bay Company, J)roceeded in the y-ear 1771., from the Prince of Vakex.*s I"'ort on the Churchill river to the mnouith of the Capperimine river. a tract which lies between thre latitudes of 5W, tand 720 N. and exst, ndqs froli the longitude of 9YP1 to 11 EL. of Greenwich.

After stating the day on which the. ex)editionl conmnenced (viz. the 14th of iMay 1803), and the number of men em'ployed1 in it (viz. 43 men inclidingr Captaini Clarke and Captain Lewis, wvho were to coflmlzan(l the cxpecdition, part of the remrular troops of the Unlited Statt-es ad(l part encg(ged for this l)rticulIlar cnte'p1)rizc), %ve meet vith little more than accounts ol the Nweather ntIId statents of the lhuiiters' succes.:, tw o very imiportiant objects no (Ioubt to travellers exploring, an unknowvn country, but not very interestiicr to readers, wheo' meals succed(l with thle utost regularitv, and the warmith of whose roomns is regrilafcd by a barometer, till ouir adventurers have proceeded 2.300 miles on the Missouri. Here MNlr. Gass casts at retrospective eye on the counitrv *hich he has passed, and as the sul)ject is interestino, and desci'ibcd( Nvith more aninatiol) than our traveller cvince n in atty other part of his narrative, we shall not scruple to lay it lbfore our realders. F From the mouth of the M1issouri to that of the river Platte, a distance cf more than six hundred miles, the land is generally of a good quality, with a sufficient quantity of timber; in many places very rich and thel country pleasant and beautiful. From the confluence of the river Platte wvith the Mlissouri to the Sterile desert (which our travellers entered at the latter end of June 1805), a distance of upwards of fifteen hundred miles, the soil is less rich, and, except in the bottoms, the land of an inferior quality, but may in general bc called good second-rate land. The country is rather hilly than level, though not mountainous, rocky or stony. 'The b ills in their unsheltered state are much exposed to be washed by heavy rains. This kind of country and soil which has fallen rnder our observation in our progress up thic Missouri, extends, it is understood, to a great distance on both sides of the river along the Missouri and the waters which flow into it; cotton wood and willows are frequent in the bottom and islands; but the upland is Ulmost entirely without timber and consists of large - }t'.h.

Of the three branches wo hlad just left, they called the north l'i~sdo, the south Philanthrop.)y, and the wvest or middle fork, along which1 we continued our voycaLe, retained the name of Jefferson." The three classes of nmen, who seek instruction as vell as annitseinent in the perusal of works like the present, are the naturalist, the commercial inan, and thre Ohilosopher. Of these the first two will find very scan-fy information in Mr. Gass, and even the last will not feet himself overloaded with discoveries.

Two Little Wooden Shoes
Ouida
-------------------------------------------------------------
IT is not easy at first sight to say why it should be considered a reproach to call a novelist sentimental, and a compliment rather than otherwise to call him (or her) impassioned. Novels are supposed to be chiefly valuable as representations of different varieties of human nature, and sen. timent is as real an element in human nature as passion, and perhaps a rather more common one, so that it might seem to have at least an equal right to representation. The source of the prejudice is to be found, probably, in a vague but not quite baseless belief that sentiment is more likely in pro. portion than passion to find an unreal or false expression. The representation of passion is subject to control or verification by the necessity of giving a credible account both of the person by whom the passion is felt, and of the object by which it is inspired; for it is only when both these are made clearly conceivable that the relation between them, or the passion itself, appears real and natural to the spectator. If the circumstances described are those which in real life would stir deep emotions, to which the characters in the romance appear insensible, the work is commonly sensational; if, on the other hand, the writer succeeds in representing men and women in considerable agitation of mind, without provocation, or upon pro. vocation which would naturally induce a different kind of agitation from that exhibited, the work may be called sentimental, as fairly as if it had been deliberately intended for a representation of sentiment, which is simply passion unattached, a disposition to feel strongly about something or other, with a degree of obtuseness as to the comparative claims, of the different things about which human beings are supposed to be capable of feeling, to excite the sentiment which the author chances to be able most easily to re. produce. Iu Two Liftle Woo)den Shoes, Ouida, as usual, does not get beyond a kind of sentimentalism, which is, however, sufficiently effective to make it worth while to ask why, on reflection, the effect is always felt to be tricky and unsatisfactory. The reason, we inmagine, is, that the author aims directly at exciting in her readers the sentiment which she conceives to be appropriate to the situation (always the same) which she pre. fors to treat, instead of representing the situation itself with such commanding tiuth and power as to ensure a response of some kind, even in readers who may take a different view of the situation from herself. The consequence is that the situation is never realised at all, even by the author, and that which is realised by her, and more or less effectively communicated to a con genial reader, is a sentiment, wandering at large amongst impossible occasions, and therefore never more than half true tolifeand nature. In the present instance, the sentiment to be communicated is one of Ianguidly reproachful acquiescence in the order of nature, which causes a dreamy little flower-girl to come to an untimely end, like one of her own rosebuds; or, as the author puts it, having confidence enough in the theory to lay it down with epigrammatic generality: "M Men are true children and women are their rosebuds." Now Ouida, notwithstanding a genuine fondness for children, which is one of the pleasantest traits in her writings, has never made the discovery that a healthy child is the most unsentimental of beings, exactly because all its experiences are concrete and particular; and if she had further been able to believe that, in this respect, the child is generally father to the man, her heroes would have less of the appearance of being created a priori, as the purely ideal correla-. tives of a natural disposition on the part of flower-girls and novelists to be very much inpressed by what they do not understand. Lady novelists especially are apt to imagine that they are realists as soon as they have 1 summoned up courage to disregard-or, i better still, to invert--the old-fashioned rules of poetic justice; but it is evident that something more is needed to complete the I portrait of a sinner than an assurance, on i the last page, of his impenitence and im. ' punity-though this may be true and plau. X sible enough as far as it goes. Ouida, however, I never knows anything more of her heroes than < that they are very wicked, very clever, very t handsome, and cause a great many flower. c girls and others to drown themselves for t love of those superlative qualities; but the f latter part of the process which the novelist - describes is not reckoned amongst the evii dence of the hero's diabolical fascination . and craft, because the sentiment of fatal awe a and admiration which attends his steps preI supposes a magic in his presence quite apart 3 from anything he can be made to do or say ) on the stage. In one way the present volume gains in veracity by its slightness, be. cause Flamen (a luxurious artist who wishes to paint a Gretchen), is not in evidence long enough to display qualities actively incompatible with the sentiment of which he is the shadowy object; but then, as his loyal worshipper, B6bee-who wears her little wooden shoes into holes by walking from Brussels to Paris when she hears he is ill-is something of a genius as well as a good and industrious little girl, it is hardly fair to suppose her to be fascinated by a lay figure without any individuality at all. The scenes descriptive of the quaint fancies and lonely businesslike life of the pretty young orphan amongst friendly villagers before Flamen lends her Paul and Virginia, are pleasantly drawn, but as we advance the style becomes senti. mental in the same vicious sense as the matter, and meaningless refrains with a pathetic sound are used at intervals as a kind of warning that these are the places where it is desirable to feel as tearful as possible. A good deal of sound virtuous indignation has been expended, we cannot but think unnecessarily, in denouncing the moral tendency of the fictions of this author and her school. An admiring critic in the Revue des Deuv Mlondes, who gives Ouida credit for a daring imagination rare in this country, quotes her as silencing prudish objections by the assurance "Je n'6cris pas pour les femmes, j'ecris pour les militaires;" in which we should be tempted to see a piece of profound cynical self-criticism if the slightest touch of humour in her works would allow us to suppose that she is herself not altogether imposed upon by the heroes who are probably admired by no living X men, except perhaps very young officers in X regiments of higher social than literary I repute. However this may be, the Little : Wooden Shoes will certainly not do any i harm to any one who does not make the X mistake of thinking the writing really fine; I whilst anyone who is capable of making a such a mistake deliberately, must have a 1 mind too impervious to literary influences i to be in much danger of suffering moral X deterioration from anything in print.

A Tale of Love and Conspiracy
Cotton, Robert Turner
-------------------------------------------------------------
A Tale of Love and Con. spiracy. By Robert Turner Cotton. Second Edition. 3 vols. (London: 1H. S. King & Co., 1874.)  Mr. Robert Turner Cotton's ideal of mas. E culine perfection has much in common with E that of Ouida, but, perhaps out of regard to I the degeneracy of the age, he displays it less I crudely and, as it were, symbolically. He s has a generation of young men who are t comparatively possible and prosaic; but they ( have a few surviving ancestors who in their r youth fought duels, drank, gambled, and v made love on an heroic scale, while, towering r above the heads of even these distinguished f persons, there appears the real hero, Mr. a Carington, who arranged for them whom c they should shoot, marry, disinherit, or d otherwise provide for, while he was himself f4 too distinguished even to condescend to take r part in those aristocratic diversions which b he superintends in a grandly providential .manner. We are told that Mr. Carington, i when he could not find a good novel to read, used to send to the circulating library for the silliest of the season, and generally de. Lrived amusement from it.

Transmigration
Collins, Mortimer
-------------------------------------------------------------
| Transmiyration.. By Mortimer Collins. (London: Hurst & Blackett.) Perhaps Mr. Cotton was not uninfluenced by this pecu. liarity of his hero in writing what is more like a burlesque upon ordinary novels than a lserious attempt to achieve something more imaginative than even Mr. Mortimer Collins's Tranemigration. It is true that both these Iworks are supposed to have really but one i author under different names, the chief i reason being that in both all the characters have a habit of eating lobsters with enthusiasm at all hours of the day or night, and that in both the poetical mottoes which abound are taken from "The Comedy of Dreams," which we gather to be an unpub. lished trilogy in which things earthly and celestial do their best to look as if they were standing on their heads, but have some difficulty in keeping in recognisable shape, because they are released from obedience to the laws of gravitation as well as from the minor canons of probability. We believe there are some people besides Mr. Carington who do find novels amusing in which a great many things happen for no reason in particular, and every one talks animatedly and with an air of deep con. viction about nothing; who prefer, in fact, a magic lantern to dissolving views, and both to a panorama. Mr. Carington may be read without the sustained mental effort requisite to follow, for instance, a cunningly devised plot of Mr. Wilkie Collins, and yet it con. tains, if possible, more of marvel and mystery in the same space, because none is wasted upon explanatory details or futile attempts to fill in the missing links of causation. There is a Russian Prince, who is so very wicked that nobody but Mr. Carington can keep him in order; and there is a Russian secret society, of which the late Emperor Napoleon III. was the head-it is impossible to guess why, as the final cause of the society seemed to be a desire to do something rather dreadful (as soon as it could settle what) to the Russian Prince. The Foreign Office of course knows nothing about all these transactions till they are explained to a discreet subordinate by Mr. Carington, who, we are given to under. stand, puts an extinguisher on the society by carrying off into Cumberland, and marrying to a friend's son, the Italian lady who acts as the Emperor's second and aide-de-camp. It does not appear that the "love and con. spiracy " have any thing more to do with each other than is implied in the business of both being looked after at the same time by Mr. Carington. If we had to choose, we should, on the whole, give the preference to the conspiracy half of the production, for Mr. Cotton's ladies are nearly as bad as Ouida's men, though, to do him justice, he is content with traducing their manners, and introduces no immorality to speak of that is less than fifty years old. One young lady who, we are told, is a comical imitation of a stage chambermaid, answers sufficiently well to the description; but the real heroine, Elinor, for whom the author professes unbounded reverence and admiration, does not succeed in so demeaning herself as to make his boisterous assurances that she is the perfection of noble grace and gentle breeding appear as impertinent as such express statements would do if made concerning "the absolute perfection of womanhood." To say that the ideal lady is perfect, shows a want of faith in the self-evidence of her perfections, but to praise her in so many words for being ladylike is a positive insult, or a confession of innate vulgarity; for it is not more mar. vellous for the ideal to be innocent of pert. ness (which, by the way, she is not) than of pocket-picking. The hero of Transmigration has three lives, one to each volume, of which the first and third are spent on earth, and the second in the planet Mars, the gere. ral result of which seems to be that, wherever lobsters and pert nymphs of erratic habits may be found, man may enjoy moments of contentment; but that for solid, durable happiness, it is necessary to be a school-boy, subject to flogging. The book is not amusing, because the author tries to play with his fancies before they are full grown, and seems not to be quite sure but what, if they were allowed to grow, they might develop into a serious contribution to philosophy. Still, the second volume is the least tiresome of the three, though we cannot commend the modesty of this new Dante who summons the great Estese from the shades to act as his guide, philosopher, and friendly co-devourer of lobsters; the change of planet, however, seems to have moderated the length as well as the depth of the Coleridgian harangues.

A Chronicle of the Fermors: Horace Walpole in Love
Mahony, Martin Francis
-------------------------------------------------------------
A Clhronicle of thie Peirnots: Iorace Wal(pole in Love. By AI. i'. M1ahony (Matthew Stradling.) 2 vols. (London: Sampson Low.) The Chronicle of the Ferniors is a chapter of domestic romance from the last century, with the scenery carefully got up from contemporary memoirs and correspondence; but the only justification for the second part of the title (Horace Walpole itn Love) seems to be the assumption that Horace's way of being in love would be to give no signs of the fact until the lady appeared to favour some other suitor, in which case he would begin to satirise her mother. There are no means of disproving the first part of the hypothesis; but the second seems to prove too much, for Horace Walpole can scarcely have been in love with the daughters of all the ladies of whom he has something spiteful to say in his correspondence. The author scarcely succeeds in showing that he took more interest in Lady Sophia Fermor than in any other famous beauty, who was expected to marry one Lord (Lord Lincoln) for love, and was consoled for her dis. appointment by the elderly, but illustrious Premier, Lord Carteret. There is an anachronism in some of the political wisdom which the Duke of Newcastle is supposed to bestow on his nephew Lincoln, who is to be consoled for the loss of Sophia by the prospect of the government of Ireland, which has the advantage, observes his Grace, of requiring neither skill nor knowledge. It may be doubted whether the idea that skill or knowledge might be expected by a troublesome population from their rulers had so far taken shape in the ducal mind of the period as to be. worth noticing even as a fallacy.

Romance and Reality. REVIEWS liv L. I*!. I.., Author ol''The linprovisatriotY ive. ."{sols. London, IS ol. Colburn cv' JJeiilley. AVr, wore alway** of opinion that Miss Landon's poetry failed in giving a just estiiiiate of Miss Landon's ])(>svi-rs. Glowing with imagery, radiant svith bright words, seductive with loud fancies, Tull of carviiiR strange anil sweet, Ml made out ol"tin* carver's bruin, Fur a lady's cliatuln-r Duct,? picturesque, arabesque, and romanesque, it vet lacked vigour and variety?often abounded ju carelessness, and dealt too much in the ?superficial. It bore too groat a resemblance to Thalaba's palace in the desert, ii structure lliat Mr. ('anning probably had in liis mind svhen ho said of all splendid but uvubstanti;d creations, ''they rose in the mists of the morning, but dissolved in the noonday sun."' Sand often contains gold, yet sand makes a sorry foundation, and sse have often svished that L. K. L. would dig till she reached the rock. So far from agreeing with the objections brought by many grave and corporate critics against the superabundance of" Love"' in her verses, we have wished for more that could really deserve the name,-?taking leave to think that the sparkling sentiment which has idleness and self-will for its parents, and an impersonation of moonlight ami a st-ronado for brideinaids, bore passing small resemblance to intense yet rational feeling; real, yet not ungovernable energy of soul. Again, without going the length of other " robustious periwigged" objections raised against her landscape drawing, sve have ventured td wish her on moro familiar tel ms with lady Nature; and, finally, a** she has undoubtedly founded a poetic school, we have unfeignedly svished that sin- would whip sonie dozeii of her scholars. The faults of an original may bo merged in tho light of his beauties; but the faults of a copyist call for tho wot sponge of annihilation. What made its think that Miss Landon possessed ''powers that she had never used," were occasional lines and passages manifesting, not merely thought, but a capacity for speculating upon thought?-a deeper looking into man's heart and destiny?and loftier aspirations afier all *' that is very far oil'," than might beseem troubadours and improvi.satrici. ' Erinna,' notsvithstanding its incorrect versification, proved that there svas iron in tho rose ; the 4 Linos on Life' breathed wisdom born of tears and nursed of truth; whilst tho majority of her later poems have proved her in possession not only of tho genii of the lamp, but of tho master of tho genii; not only of fancy, thal builds with gold and gems, but of truth and thought, that bring tho living spirit to inhabit. In that most convenient of places?soiuetehi re, wc remember to have read an apologue, wliii'li, ns nut inapplicable, tie shall narrate. 'When the Queen ol'Sheba went to prove King Solomon with hard questions, she appeared one day before him with two wreaths ol'Howers, the one natural, the other artificial, but both so apparently alike as to render her request that be would distinguish them at a distance, somewhat difficult of performance. The wisest of men and best of botanists was puzzled?but, observing a bee outside one of the palace windows, he ordered its admission and watched its movements. The little honey merchant was neither to be deceived nor allured by the bright hues of thc artificial wreath, but guided the monarch's decision by settling instantly on the one really composed of the roses of Sharon and the lilies of the valley. Would that all poets allowed a bee (sympathy) to discern for them the diH'erence between the false and true?Miss Landon lias done so of late, and if her verses have not glittered quite so much Aiith diamond dust, or exhaled so much of the spice islands, the absence has boen well supplied by fresh dews and natural brightness, lt is a flower-garden beside a fairy tale. But it was to the prose work intended to proceed from her pen that Ave looked with most expectation, as the test, trial, and, if the truth must be told, triumph of .Miss Landon, and of our own particular opinion of her mind. The work is here : we have read it with as much attention as if it had been theology, and as much excitement as if it had been treason. To call it a novel is incorrect ; plot, incident, and narrative of all kinds, would go into a nut, or, to be literally correct, into a walnut-shell. Let no lover of history and mystery, no demander of event and catastrophe, no old-fashioned believer in its being equally the duty of governments to put donn plots, and of novelists to purvey them?no person who reads a book merely to knott" what happens in it, sit doun to ? Uomance and Keality.' If they inquire of us," n ho or what is the Romance I"?" who or what is the Reality.'" we cannot answer, for the very primitive reason of not knolling. Those who care little about story, or who can wait for it till the third volume, will find real and delightful occupation in its pages. The correct title of the work Aiould have been ' Maxims and Characters'?for it is composed of essays, criticisms, sketches of life, portraits living and dead, opinions on manners, descriptions of feeling, all served up willi so much wit that the authoress might never have been sad,?with so much poetic and moral feeling that she might never have been gay. Perused as a work of fiction, it is too desultory and incorrect to be satisfactory; it must be read as a brilliant, and sometimes profound commentary on the life ol' thia " century of crouds"?as the result of keen and varied observation and reflection : in this vietv ive cannot but esteem it a remarkable evidence of talent. Wv ask the poetry of the authoress, where, till nov,, dwelt the brave good sense?the sarcasm biller willi medicine, not poison?the remarks that, beginning in levity, die ott' into reflection?-the jicrsijlat/e that is only a feint to conceal love of the beautiful and longing after the true.' and the ' Improvisatrice,' the 'Troubadour,' and the ' Venetian Bracelet,' answer- - '? Where ,'" I low much there is that poetry cannot or must not convey. As the Lt trick Shepherd says, "Blessings cm the man who first invented sleep"---so we suv, " Honour to the patriarchs, who undoubtedly all wrote in prose !"' But for i Romance and Reality' in prose, half our island might never have awoke from their dream that L. L. L. was an avatar of blue eyes, flaxen ringlets, and a .susceptible heart! The counter conviction, that her genius is infinitely more like an arrow, barbed at one cud and feathered at. the other, will dismay a thousand fancies, the cherished growth of albums and sixteen. Take for example the following outline of a domestic dav and a domestic savage ; we are heathens if they would not be recognizable at the foot of the Pyramids. " Monday and two o'clock funnel Lindy in Harley Street, rather sooner than slie was expected, as was evident l'roin that silken ru-tle which marks a female retreat. A discreet visitor on such occasions advances straight to tho window or the glass : Emily did the latter; ami five minutes ol' contemplation ascertained the fact that her cu/iote would endure a slight tenilency to the lett. She then tock a seat on the hard, or, as they say ol'hounds, the liide-lxuuul sofa?the live minutes lengthened into twenty, and slie sought for amusement at a most literarylooking table. Alas! she had read tile* novel.*-; ?for treatises she had no taste?and two (iernian volumes, and three Latin, together with a scientific journal, gave her a cold chill. "W'liiK* thus employed, a red-faced, loiul-voiceil servant girl threw open the door, and howled, ' If you ].lease, ma'am, Master Adolphus luis thrown the Library ot' I'.ntertaining Knowledge at Master Alfred's head, because he tore the Catechism of Conchology *,' but before Miss Arundel could express her regret ai such misapplication ol' knowledge, the girl lind vanished in all the dismay ol' a mistake. " At last Mrs. Smithson appeared. ' My dear Lindy, you have waited?I forgot to tell you that 1 devote the early part ol' the day to the dear children?I never allow my literary and domestic-duties to interfere: you cannot commence the important business of education too soon, and 1 am but just emerged from thc study.' " This was a little at variance both with the servant's appearance and her own laboured toilette, whose want of neatness was the result of hurry and bad taste, not of after-disorganisation, lt is amazing how oppressive is tho cleverness of some people, ns if it were quite a iluty iu sou to he clever too?or, as I once heard a li ti It- child say, 'Oh, "liamma, I always speak to .Mr.-.. S. in such dictionary words!' ?' ? Slowly and sadly' did the morning pass. Alas ! lor the victim ol' friendship, whom sentiment or silliness seduces into passing a long day . The upright sittin*.*; on the repulsive sofa ? -the mental exhaustion in searching alter topics ol' conversation, which, like the breeze in Myron's description ol' a calm, 'conic not'? the gossip that, out of sheer desperation, darkens into scandal; if ever friends or feelings are sacrificed under temptation too strong to he resisted, it is in the conversational pauses of a long day; and worst of all, a long day between : people who hiive scarcely au idea or an aci_uaint- j ance in common, for the one to he exchanged, : or tin- other abused?communication or cou- , deanialion eipially out of the ipiestion. Mrs. ! Smithson secretly pitied herself for wasting her | colloquial powers on that social non-entity, a I young lady : and Miss Arundel svas somewhat I jht-iviiiicreil by the march ol' her former friend's intellect. Divers of those elegant harmonies, ' which make musical the dight of time in London, verified the old rhynie, that Come what may, Time and thu tide wear through the roughest day. "The mufhn-boy announced three o'clock? the pot-boy clanking his empty pewter ssas symptomatic ol four?the bellman tolling the knell of the post announced five?and, at length, a heavy haul-hearted rap proclaimed thc return of Mr. Smithson ; a gruff voice was heard in tho passage?a ponderous step on thc stairs?tho door and his boots creaked, and in came the author of the treatise on bats and beetles, followed by a blue-coated, nankeentrousered young man, whose countenance and curls united that happy mixture of carmine and charcoal which constitute the Apollo of a Compton Street c.Mititir. Mr. Smithson was e,pially milleu and solemn-looking, with a mouth made only to swear, and a brow to scowl?a tyrant in a mil.Il way?one who would he arbitrary about a hash, ;uid obstinate respecting an oyster?one ol' those tempers which, like a domestic east wind, 'spires neither man nor beast,' from the unhappy footman that he cursed, to the unlucky dog that lie kicked. " A minute specimen nf humanity, in a livery like a jealous lover's, of ' green and yellow melancholy,' announced dinner. Mr. Smithson stalked up to Emily, Mr. Perkins simpered up to the hostess, and they entered a dismal-looking parlour, whose brick-red walls and ditto curtains were scantily lighted by a single lani]), though it was ol' the last new patent?to which a dim lire, in its first stage of infant weakness, gave small assistance. " Mr. Smithson, who, as member of a public office, thought that chinch and state ought to be supported,?which support he conceived to consist in strict adherence to certain forms,? muttered something which sounded much moro like a growl than a grace, and dinner commenced. " At the top svas a cod's shoulders and head, svho-e intellectual faculties were rather over much developed; and at the bottom was soup called Mulligatawny?some indefinite mixture of curry powder and ducks' fe. t, t!v* first spoonful of winch called from its master a look of thunder ar.il lightning up the table. To this succeeded a couple of most cadaverous fowls, a huge haunch ol' mutton, raw and red enough even for an Abyssinian, Hanked by rissoles anti oyster patties, which had evidently, like Tom Tough, seen ? a deal of service:' these were followed by some sort of nameless pudding? and so much for thc luxury of a family dinner, which is enough to make one beg next time to be treated as a stranger. " Conversation there was none?Mr.Sniithson kindly sparing the lungs of his friends, at the expense ol' bis own. First, the tire was sworn at?then, the draught from the door?then, the poor little foothoy was encouraged by the pleasant intelligence that he was the stupidest blockhead in the world. Mr. Perkins sat preserving his silence and his simper: and to the lady ol' thc house it tins evidently quite matter ol' habit?a sort of accompaniment she would almost have missed. " The truth is, Mr. Smithson had just married some twenty years too late?with his habits, like his features, quite net, and both in a harsh mould. Young Lady! looking out for an establishment?meditating on the delights of a house ol' your own?two maids and a man, over whom you are set iu absolute authority? do anything rather than marry a continued bachelor?venture on one who has been successful with seven succeeding wives, with ten small children ready made to order?walk off with some tall youth, who considers a wife and a razor definitive signs of his growth and his sense ; but shun the establishment of a bachelor who has hung a pendulum between temptation and prudence till the age ot'-; but of all subjects, age is the one on which it is most invidious to descant. " The cloth was removed, and sudden commotion filled the passage: At once there rose so wild a yell Within that dark and narrow dell, ?S.e. -Vc. -S-ic and in came Master Adolphus and Master Alfred in full cry, having disputed by the way which was to go first?also a baby, eloquent as infancy usually is, and, like most youthful orators, more easily heard than understood. The boys quartered themselves on the unfortunate strangers; and Mrs. Smithson took the infant, which Linily duly declared was the sweetest little creature she had ever seen. On going up stairs, Linily found Mlle. Hyacinthe shivering?for, ti ith the usual inhumanity ol' friends, there was no lire; and it was one of those wet, miserable evenings, gratis copies distributed by .November through the year." i.l'J-3. Certainly, reading the two first volumes of ' Romance and Reality' is exceedingly like reading a volume of Horace Walpole's Letters (only that the names and news are newer), or, if acquainted with literary London, like passing an evening with half your acquaintance. In this respect the hook answers to a magazine, saves postage, and, if carried on extensively, might do away with the necessity of newspapers. On this topic we commend tlie authoress to the fatherly care of that most delightful person, Dr. Folliott, whose opinions, as found m ' Crotchet Castle,' we here transcribe :? "Mr. Eavesdrop.?Me, Sir! What have I done, Sir, that I am to be poisoned, Sir I I " The. Rev. Dr. Folliott.?Sir, you have pubj lished a character ol' your facetious friend, the Kev. Dr. I'., wherein you have sketched otl'nie; me, Sir, even to my nose and wig. What business have the public with my nose and wig i " Mr. E.?Sir, it is all good-humoured : all in Imnlio/itmie : all friendly and complimentary. "Her. Dr. F.?Sir, you have been very unfacotious. You have dished nie up like a savory omelette, to gratify the appetite of thc reading rabble for gossip. The next time, Sir, I will respond with the argitntcntitm baculinum. Print that, Sir: put it on record as a promise of the Rev. Dr. F. which shall bc most faithfully kept with an exemplary bamboo. " Mr. E.?Your cloth protects you, Sir. " Rev. Lr. F.?My bamboo shall protect me, Sir. 4- Mr. Crotchet.?Doctor, Doctor, you arc growing too polemical. " Ree. Dr. F.?Sir, my blood boils. 'What business have the public with my nose and wig ?" L. E. L.'s "takings" aro for tho most part -' friendly and complimentary"?nevertheless, some are so caustic, that, unless she omits thom in a second edition, it might be well to publish a literary copy of tho advertisement to Rowland's Kalydor, particularly that part which states its soothing qualities for " gentlemen whoso chins arc tender after shaving.' Against her second edition, too, or, rather against her next work, sve svould remind her, that what has boen said of bagpipe music, may bo said of witticisms where too numerous?" the ono half would sound better for the other half not being heard." The first volume is as full of points as a packet of needles, and, as the writer snys of someone's attitude, fails ol' being easy hy being elaborate. This over-abundance of repartees, similes and epigrams, becomes tiresome to thc dull, and tcazing to tho quick ; makes svit look too like hard svork, and tho author too much resemble a vivacious juggler?a Katerfelto, with his hair mt end At his own wonders, wondering for his bread. Wo think we dare read this riddle: to bo natural, earnest, and quietly dignified, even as an author, requires no less moral courage than to bo so in daily life. Ridicule is so-> cioty's fear of (ind, and entertainment its ?' pearl of great price." An author of the bean mantle puts svit in his lirst volume to purchase leave to throw heart, truth, and sentiment into his last. Miss Landon's third volume is exempt from all the faults of thc two others ; there is no want of story, which is so concentrated in its pages, that, with a little introduction, and the entire smothering of the Higgs' family, it might bo printed separately, a perfectly true, pure, pleasant specimen of fiction, lt is effective, svithout effect being strained after, and contains passages full of power, beauty, and simplicity. Thc epigrammatic style is dropped; the narrative flows ssveetly yet sadly along; and tho history of tho grave and noble IJoatriei?of the selfwill and ropentings of tho loss firmly strung Emily, svould redeem an Almack's of young ladies, and " a wilderness of monkeys." Wo give ti specimen from this part of the svork:? " No one person in a thousand is capable of a real passion?that intense and overwhelming feeling, before which all others sink into nothingness. It asks for head and heart?now, many are deficient in both. Idleness and vanity cause, iu nine cases out of ten, that state of excitement which is called being in love. I have heard some even talk of their disappointments, as if such a word could be used in the plural. To be crossed in love, forsooth?why, such a heart could bear as many crosses as a raspberry tart. | " But Beatrice loved with all the vividness of unwastcd and unworn feeling, and witli fill tho confidence' of youth. Proud, earnest, and enthusiastic, passion ssas touched with all the poetry of her own nature. Her lover was the idol, invested by her ardent imagination with all humanity's 'highest attributes.' Undegraded by the ideas of flirtation, vanity, interest, or establishment, her love was as simple as it svas beautiful. Her life had passed in solitude, but it had been the solitude of both refinement and exertion. She svas unsvorldly, but not untaught. She had read extensively and variously. Much of her reading had been of a kind unusual to cither her sex or age; but she had loved to talk with her father on the subjects which engaged him ; and the investigations which were to analyze the state of mankind, and the theories which were to ameliorate it, became to her matters of attraction, because they were also those of affection. "Natural scenery has no influence on the character till associated with human feelings: the poet repays his inspiration by the interest he flings round the objects which inspired it. Beatrice had early learnt this association of nature with humanity. She was as well acquainted with the English literature and language as with her own; and the melancholy and reflective character of its poetry suited well a young spirit early broken by sorrow, and left, moreover, to entire loneliness. The danger of a youth so spent was, that the mind woidd become too ideal ?that mornings, passed with some favourite volume by the dropping fountain, or beneath the shadowy ilex, would induce habits of romantic dreaming, utterly at variance with the stern necessities of life. " But Beatrice had been forced into a wholesome course of active exertion. Obliged to think and to act for herself?to have others defieiident on her ell'orts?to know that each day mingin its employment, her mind strengthened with its discipline. The duties that excited also invigorated. The keen feeling, the delicate taste, were accustomed to subjection, and romance refined, without weakening. ? * * * " Beatrice was grave; silent, except when much interested; reserved, save when under the influence of .some strong feeling; with manners whose refinement was that of inherently pure taste, and much mental cultivation, touched, too, with the native grace inseparable from the very beautiful: self-possessed, from self-reliance, and with a stately bearing, which?call it prejudice, or pride, or dignity?spoke the consciousness of high descent, and an unquestioned superiority. The pride of hirth is a noble feeling. " Lorraine, on the contrary, waa animated? more likely to be amused thin excited?it ith a general expression of indifference not easily roused to interest. His manners had that line polish only to be given hy society, and that of the best. His thoughts and feelings were kept in the back-ground?not from native reserve, but from fear of raillery?that suspicion of our hearers which is one of the first lessons taught in the world. His habits were luxurious?hers were simple; he was witty and sarcastic?she scarcely understood the meaning of ridicule j his rules of action were many?as those rules must bc on which the judgments of others are to operate?hers were only those of right and wrong. A whole life spent in society inevitably refers its action to the general opinion. Beatrice, as yet, looked not beyond the action itself. * * * * ?" Some slight chance usually rivets the attention ; it did so now. On one of the tablets were inscribed various names of an apparently large family, the dates of the different deaths singularly near to each other. Linily felt as if her own solitary situation had never weighed upon her thoughts till now. ' Many are kind to me, but none care for nie.' Youth, with its affection an impulse and a delight, judges others by itself, and exaggerates its claims. " Strange it is that people (unless in the way of ostentation) never value the blessings they possess. But if life has a happiness over which the primeval curse bas passed and harmed not, it is the early and long-enduring affection ol' blood and habit. The passion which concentrates its strength and beauty upon one, is a rich and terrible stake, the end whereof is death; ?the living light of existence is burnt out in an hour?and what remains.' The dust and the darkness. But thc love which is boru in childhood?an instinct deepening into a principle?retains to the end something ot' the freshness belonging to the hour of its birth: the amusement partaken?the trifling quarrel malkup?the sorrows shared together?the punYlilnent in which all were involved?the plans l'or the future, so fairytale-like and so false,in which all indulged: so true it is that love's slightest links arc its strongest! " There is something inexpressibly touching in the story of Ishmael, the youth who was sent into the wilderness of life with his how* and his arrow, 'his hand against every niau, and every man's hand against Iii m.* Even in our crowded, busy, and social world, on how many is this doom pronounced! What love makes allowances like household love??what takes an interest in small sorrows and small .successes like household love .' (iotl forgive those (and I would not even say forgive, were not Divine mercy illimitable,) who turn the household altar to a place of strife! Domestic dissension is the sacrilege of the heart." iii. Sf)-?117. With these extracts wo close ? lioiiiance and Reality'?trusting, nay. believing, that Miss Landon's next prose work svill cxliibii all the merits of this, matured, and ail its faults avoided. To conceive some irlinlc in ii strain of high mood, consecrated by high purpose, and crowned with high reward, is not more than she is capable of?not moro than she ought to cflect:? Shadows of beauty, .shadows ol power, Itise to jour duty - This is the In,ur.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TALES BY THE O'HARA FAMILY.* The Irish have tried to make themselves heard and known by this country in every possible way?nearly every form of truth and fiction has been tried in vain?orators have pleaded, poets have sung, historians have narrated, and pamphleteers have argued, abused, lamented/ ? Three Vols. 12*po. Simpkin and Marshall. and reasoned by turns. It is now the tum of the novelist, and we should not be surprised if he contributes more effectual iud than any of his predecessors. The Scotch novelist has made his countrylttein the fashion. Irish English may soon become as necessary an ingredient in romance &s Scotch English?to cross the Channel to Dublin and Belfast as vulgar a* a trip to Edinburgh and Glasgow. The materials of character and incident are dearly as abundant in Milesia aft in any other the most unfortunate country ever cursed with oppression and rebellion. Nothing is wanting but the mind?the genius of some Great Irish Unknown. When' "Xe grand Inconnu," as he is called in France; shall arise in a mtet from some Irish bog, and overspread the land with his fecundating wings, then Ireland and Irishmen may expect to live on unebccis&l potheen, and die with skulls entire. In the mean time, much good may be done by such artists as the author of To-day in Ireland, and the Tales by the O'Hara Family* The fifrst is decidedly a very eleve^ antt titefift' work; and the other, though inferior in some respects tov thfe?:T8-(3te^ in Ireland, is still well worth reading. It is tfar Su$&io!r 1P4Si& vulgar novel of the circulating library, though its chfef fault ia/fhitffi' cemtains too much of the staple commodity of LeadenhMl^sttefet.11 lt# theptfoduct of much ill-managed talent, and much uncultivated mind.' With perhaps higher powers thati the author of To-day hi Iifelanfl,* he has made a much less entertaining and instructive work. He niust'ctol* tivate his judgment; write not in haste, consider his flota, and Strike tint oiie half of Ins manuscripts after he has come to the conclusion of' the 1pr& dative part of his labour. If the auihot likewise intends td b^nefl^Ks1 aative country, he must pay a little attention* to some severer MbdiebtKm pirating %nd poetry?^of all political science he is as guatlbs^afe tile pririfcr'd devil.' Thfe to olie who writes ofIrelaAd audits evrhm fe^H tWugh it is common to all Irishmen,^ i^holmve-fW a century aodfe'fil^,, elteth&fc&we a furious *nikft^ Of poetry; eldquenc^ and foKy, to'behalf of their beloved Emerald Isle. The author of these TaleSy Wtth'htt^ knowledge of character, his knowledge of Inland,^^ wi^kho^%dgeof another kindy and his dramatic j^Wehs,ntight ijibhM a&to his^ufiferihg country tlianChsdl a'do^^Gm^orator^ -.. ? ? ?'* r These Tafes,* Wfcitfh4#^ fe^^feiHsrfi^#' WalterScott's aWurdiotro** ductions and prefaces, are as absurdly represented to be the composition of some O'Hara family, are three in. number. The first, Crohoore of the Bill-hook, is the most elaborate, and on the whole the best. The fable is artful, and tolei^ the latter end the story is wound up with a great deal of huddling and hurry. Some chafacfcemoocur which ara weU conc^vedvaoid fbrriblyr thrown: oat*there aird several stones of interest; said n^uoh ;*felk?ia^aged dialogue* Has, however, greatly disfiguuei by the authors low of tM false, raper* nafcujak~a constant attempt to frighten his reader mitk what ie intends presently to explain in the most natural way in the world.?The second, The Fetches, is a story of the true supernatural. You are given to understand that previous to death the shade or form of the person about to die presents itself to his dearest friends; why, or wherefore, does not appear. This tale is decidedly the worst of the three; it is painful, disagreeable, false in almost every respect, and unredeemed by any decided merit.?The last, John Doe, is perhaps as entertaining as any of the three?it is very spirited in parts, but as a whole is ill-conducted, improbable, and confused. Many scenes are, however, drawn with vigour; the Irish character, that most extraordinary phenomenon in human nature, is well and truly exhibited?and the state of manners in one division of the country is pretty faithfully delineated. We exhort the writer to go on?we wish to see more from his pen?though not more Tales by the O'Hara Family. Let him trust to his observation more, and to his imagination less.

The English review,  1908-1937 10 :  187 - 187
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
BROKEN ARCS. By DARRELL FIGGIS. Dent. 6s. In a first novel one expects to find only a careful attention to detail masking some lack of experience or imagination. And if one finds exactly the reverse, as in this case, one knows that it is a work of considerable import. Thus it would be easy to condemn Broken Arcs superficially: to begin with, in its central theme of suffering beauty and purity issuing from sordid bucolics, in the walkings of agonised mortals under the stars, to mention nothing more, it invites comparison with the greatest English novel of our time, Tess of the D' Urbevilles: few indeed can keep us breathing comfortably if they go out of their way to remind us of those magic uplands of Wessex. Secondly, Mr. Figgis writes a preposterous style, and we have no hesitation in abusing him for it because it is obviously artificial: sometimes he is carried away by his own emotion and writes pages of clear and beautiful description: sometimes his imagination tires, he forgets to cover the gap with grammatical gymnastics, and falls into banality. Banality and the clichb are the result of a lazy or tired imagination which prefers to take its details ready-made. Now a good style is a natural function of the mind; yet we find Mr. Figgis occasionally spoiling with his worst extravagance scenes which are clearly conceived and deeply felt: we conclude therefore that he adopts it deliberately. Yet in spite of these drawbacks, Mr. Figgis has written a novel remarkable as a whole for architectonic dignity, and embodying some force of fearless and clear thought about the complex of experience.

VICTIM! IA. (>X Monday this bouse le-opened, under the so\e allspices, as Mrs. Deputy Butts {Orger), in the Water Pur.'y. has it, ol' .Air, Abbott: upon whom the Herculaneum (same authority) task of management has. if we may judge from his earliest efforts, not unworthily devolved. In the iirst place, the interior of the theatre has been newly decorated and painted with great taste. The green of the box tiers, relieved by graceful ornaments, is extremely pleasing to the eye; and imparts an air of coolness quite refreshing at the close of a summer-day. when people seek the relaxation of the mimic drama to relieve the toils and anxieties of busy life. And the entertainments were of a character to enhance the prepossessions which the sight inspired. The Lores- nf the Angels presented .Airs. AVaylett in the full gush of song ; and she was neve;- heard to greater advantage than in this theatre, which is peculiarly adapted to the iiiie transmission of sound. She was consequently applauded io tlie echo, not only in the music ol' this piece and of the Four Sisters. in which she also acted charmingly, but in the sweet ballads ol' ?* Kate Kearney" and ?? Away to the mountain's brow," and a new Scotch ballad, composed I'or her by A. Lee. called *? What's a' the steer, Kimmel'r" This she gave very naturally; and reminded usof *? l'p, an' waur them a', Willie," ina style tis pleasant tis possible. The other immortals were well sustained by Miss Horton. Itttbi, and Miss Fane, a pretty little girl, Maleeft ; while their mortal mates, the daughters of Morath, were represented with like effect by Miss P. Horton. Miss Norman, and Miss Forster. Abbott. Forrester, and J. Webster, played their mortal lovers, and Chippendale and Mitchell, the elders?all in high burletta force; so that the Luces of the Angels lost nothing of its old popularity. In thi! Water Party. .Airs. Orger was superb; and well supported by Miss P. Horton, as her daughter A'vry; Williams (whose return was heartily welcomed), as her husband ; Miss Somerville, .Miss Norman, and Chippendale, tis the Jiggins Family; and Latham, Hoss, J. Webster, ."vf. in the other parts. On Wednesday Liston appeared here for the iirst time on the Surrey-side of Thames, and has not for months been seen to such advantage as with .Airs. Orger, in Kill or ("ure. Ile was in great force, and a liner piece ofthe broad comi'jue was never witnessed than be| tween the two, ably played up to by Miss Horton, Williams, and .Mitchell. The house | was kept iu shouts of laughter ; and we were glad to observe that, as on the two preceding nights, it was fully and fashionably attended. j The Knglish Opera House is at present one of the sights of London to parties who are lucky enoiigh to procure tickets to see the interior. It will not, we believe, open i/nitc so soon as was hoped, but certainly in July ; and we had the pleasure, two evenings ago, of hearing a partial rehearsal of the opera with which the campaign is to begin. It is the Frances of A'uiirjubud, from airs. Sheridan's sweet tale, ' produced by .Air. Arnold some twenty years j ago, tis a drama in three acts, tit Drury Lane, ', ami now converted into a sterling English j opera. The music is hy Loder, and what we heard ol' it extremely pleasing : we have no doubt from the samjde hut that the whole itlively and interesting. Phillips and Wilson need only sing as they rehearsed to make it highly popular

HI. The Soldier's Family, and other Tales. l2mo.pp.l79. Harris. THIS little volume, which is also by the same Author, is equally com? mendable, it contains Three distinct Tales, each pleasing and instructive. " The Soldier's Family" is a strik? ing proof that integrity and regular conduct in the lower departments of life are rarely unrewarded. The scene of the second, " Leoore and Lieschen," is in Holland ? and it contains some well-drawn characters. The third, <' Tbe Relations," can? not fail of exciting a very proper de? gree of emotion in the mind* of youth. FOREIGN

44. Ellen the Teacher, a Tale for Youth, by Mrs. Holland; Author of1* The Of? ficer's IVidow, " Son of a Genius," and other IVorhs for young People. 2 vols. \1mo,pp 357. Harris. THOSE who have admired the former productions of this Lady, will open with interest the present little Volumes, in which, judging by our own feelings, we venture to promise that they will not be disappointed. In exciting young people to virtue, it is necessary that they should be taught to respect it for its own sake t and the touching examples introduced by Mrs. Holland are well calculated to promote that effect. In the his? tory of the forlorn Ellen are many affecting incidents, tending to awaken the best sensibilities of the heart; and teachers, as well as pupils, might find half an hour not ill-bestowedon this simple,yet entertaining Narrative.
