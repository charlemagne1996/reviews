LITERATURE The Life of John William Colenso, B.D., Bishop of Natal. By the Kev. Sir George W. Cox, Bart., M.A. 2 vols. (Kidgway.) This ponderous biography by one who knew the Bishop of Natal well embraces two great subjects in which Dr. Colenso felt a deep interest, the Pentateuch and the welfare of the natives of South Africa, especially the Zulus. It will be easiest for a brief review to deal with them separately. A commentary on the Epistle to the Homans was the first work that drew general attention to the bishop, hitherto mainly known as a compiler of school-books. This was soon followed by the first part of a critical examination of the Pentateuch and Book of Joshua, which excited great indignation in many quarters, 'for it disturbed traditional notions, and offended most of the dignitaries of the English Church, although welcomed by not a few of the laity. This volume (1862) was followed by six others, each increasing in size, so that the seventh and last occupies upwards of seven hundred pages. It did not appear, however, till the year 1879. The bishop's views expanded as he proceeded in his studies and his knowledge of Hebrew advanced. He developed much critical power ; his confidence in himself increased; and he settled down at last in views akin to those of Graf and Kuenen, Kalisch and others, whose work has been taken up and elaborated by Wellhausen with much ingenuity, and by Kuenen himself in a more negative spirit than he at first exhibited. These Biblical studies, prosecuted with great patience and desire of truth, led the bishop, much against his will, into conflicts both harassing and costly. The battle with Dr. Gray in Africa, who pronounced sentence of deposition upon his fellow bishop after a one-sided trial at Cape Town, was not the only contest into which he was dragged in self-defence. Most of tho bishops in England, in signal contrast to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who met him in a friendly spirit, intrigued and wrote against him, though none of his opponents could fairly answer the arguments he used, for he was a better Hebrew scholar than any of them. In the liberty which he enjoyed after legal judgment had been pro- nounced in the case of ' Essays and Reviews ' he had an advantage over his opponents, and they could only denounce him and not depose him. But denounce they did, heaping upon him opprobrious names and injurious epithets. In the field of Biblical criticism the antagonists of Dr. Colenso made a poor figure. The ' Speaker's Commentary,' the most substantial result of the agitation, the bishop examined in extenso as far as the Hexateuch was concerned, showing its superficiality, its evasion of difficulties, and its failure to set aside the results which he had arrived at. The latter part of the bishop's life was devoted to self-denying exertions on behalf of the Hlubi tribe, the defence of Langalibalele and of Cetywayo. Here he had to do with political and civil matters; but they were within his proper sphere as also most important to the interests and good faith of England. In this harassing work too he encountered powerful enemies, and his attitude made him unpopular with the white colonists as well as with English governors and their subordinates. Yet he was ever on the side of justice and humanity. It is saddening to peruse the record of almost superhuman efforts on behalf of the aboriginal races?his endeavours to prevent them from being oppressed, robbed, and murdered by those who, though professedly civilized, behaved to their fellow creatures in a cruel and unchristian way. These labours did not interfere with his purely clerical work. He preached in his cathedral, baptized and confirmed, published sermons, and ordained clergymen. He was opposed with much persistence by Dean Green, who tried to exclude him from the cathedral, but in vain; most of his own clergy disagreed with him, and much evil report he had to endure on all sides. However, he never wavered in hiscourse, supported by a good conscience and the justice of his cause. The reader of this biography will be struck with the bishop's self-denial, his philanthropic zeal, his calm judgment, his trust in God, his confidence in the ultimate victory of right, and his sensitive regard for truth. Two classes are unsparingly condemned by Sir George Cox in these volumes ?English officials who had to do with affairs of Southern Africa, and ecclesiastics of the High Church party. As far as the bishop came in contact with either, he found that their use of power was not marked by straightforwardness or justice. The behaviour of the Bishop of Winchester (Wilberforce) especially caused him deep annoyance. The treatment of the Zulus and their king by Sir Bartle Frere and Mr. John Shepstone may be said to have hastened the bishop's death. The following, part of a letter written after the publication of the first part of his examination of the Pentateuch, shows what he thought of his English brethren on the bench:? "On Saturday I received a round robin from the Archbishop and Bishops except Hereford (Hampden).My answer is in preparation and will be calm and decisive. I tell them that I have no intention of resigning; that the 'scandal' they complain of is not caused by me, but by those who maintain a state of things in the Church opposed to the plainest results of modern science. The fact is that these ' round robins' have become ridiculous, through their famous attempts in that line upon the ' Essays and Be* views' and Sabbath questions. There is not a man among them ; but they are obliged to flock together, like sheep running through a gate, when one leads the way." The bishop's commentary on the Epistle to the Romans is of a Maurician type; it was written in the days when he was under Maurice's influence, and it contains some just and excellent comments. Still as an explanation of the epistle it is insufficient. The roots of the Calvinistic system cannot be removed from that letter either by the bishop or his biographer. An analysis of the bishop's works on the Hexateuch is presented by Sir George Cox in three or four long chapters in the first volume. The further the writer proceeded in his examination the more negative became his criticism. In the end he relegated the priestly legislation in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers to the time of the captivity and after, pronounced Joshua a mythical character, and Chronicles a fictitious story, written for a special purpose. Such conclusions need cautious sifting, as do other statements in the seventh volume of his Biblical work. To be consistent he should have made the Elohiet subsequent to the Jehovist, as Kuenen does; and his hypothesis of two Jehovists is obviously erroneous. The idea of the Deuteronomist writing both copies of the Decalogue, that in Exodus as well as that in Deuteronomy, is equally incorrect. The language the bishop uses respecting Chronicles is a great deal too strong. The writer, though inaccurate, certainly intended to promote edification. The greater part of the second volume is occupied with an account of the trial and defence of Langalibalele, which led to the bishop's second visit to England, and with the English dealings with Zululand and the treatment of Cetywayo. The bishop always urged the Zulu king to trust to the good faith of England; but the result of this was a grievous disappointment to the confiding savage. Well might his adviser write, " I am deeply grieved, and as an Englishman ashamed that I ever gave him such advice, though it was the only advice I could give him." The following letter shows the perplexity of poor Cetywayo after his return from England to his own country and the agreements made in London. One-half, and that the better half, of his territory had been taken from him:? " I am at a loss to know where to put the Zulu people, and I am at my wits' end. My trouble is greater than that which I felt when imprisoned. I might say that I was better off when I was in bondage than now. And I complain greatly of Mr. John Shepstone. All this trouble is brought about by him. But I ask now, such a law as this, is it an English law ? Did it come from over the sea ? Has ever a thing been done among yourselves such as this which is done to me ? To me it seems as if I were out on the hillside. It is as it was before; for then he would not agree that I should be brought back, and now he is eating me up in the dark by stealth.Ask for me, I pray, the country in which I am to live? where is it ? For my people are wandering about (homeless) with me. They are homeless, and why ? Because, whereas it was said that they do not wish for me, they are now without a place to live in through wishing for me. What now is the meaning of this? Speak for me I according as you see it, and inform those who are I with you over the sea that I am digging uproots by-the river (meaning that they have no food), while my cattle are with John Dunn. I am not asking for those which were taken in the war time. No ! I mean those taken afterwards from the people in Zululand. And I say that I cannot be at all satisfied, and the Zulu people too cannot be satia6ed with this law which has been made by Mr. John Shepstone." It is obvious that had the bishop's principles been acted on in the treatment of the native tribes much blood and treasure would have been saved; the cruelties perpetrated by the whites would not have happened, or have been insignificant; much tortuous policy would have been avoided, and the prestige of England remained unsoiled. The future historian of South Africa will find ample materials for forming an impartial judgment respecting English deeds there; and we cannot do otherwise than believe that the bishop's views will be found justified. The high-minded Christian counsellor will occupy a conspicuous place for his self-denying and disinterested toils on behalf of justice between man and man. Dr. Colenso was eminently fitted for the office and work of a purely missionary bishop, and he would willingly have resigned his post at Natal and accepted that position. It is to be regretted that obstacles prevented the project from being carried out. Living amongtheZulus, his influence for good would have been great among them. Their king would have looked up to him for advice and gladly followed it. One who had compiled a Zulu grammar and Zulu-English dictionary ; who had translated the books of Genesis, Exodus, Samuel, and all the New Testament into the Zulu language ; who prepared no fewer than eighteen books for the use of missionary students and native scholars, was admirably qualified for the work of instructing the people in the principles of Christianity. But even as Bishop of Natal he was in a sense a missionary bishop, and will ever be remembered as such. The story of the persecutions he endured, the obloquy heaped upon him, the calumnies circulated against him, the groundless accusations of bitter enemies, is full of lessons. None can deny now that he was a remarkable man, possessed of noble qualities. Such fearless love of truth and justice, such calmness of temper, such charity, such clear judgment and purity of motive, are rare. His Christian teaching was summed up in the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, and he tried to exemplify it in his own life. The biography proceeds from an able friend, who has done ample justice to the bishop. It is a full and comprehensive record, occupying upwards of fourteen hundred pages. The letters of Dr. Colenso are numerous; his memorandums, statements, answers to questions, suggestions, are carefully recorded. We could have wished that the work had been shorter, and it could have been made so without detriment to the bishop's fame. It was hardly necessary to devote a chapter to the ' Commentary on the Epistle to the Homans,' or to go through the volumes on the Pentateuch and analyze their contents. Sir G. Cox has defended and enforced the opinions of the bishop in a style both simple and open, calling things by their proper names more plainly than the courteous bishop would have ventured to do in writing. Occasionally there is a touch of exaggeration, more especially in the preface, but also in the body of the work, as when Sir George pronounces the Levitical legislation to be later by many centuries than the Babylonish captivity. And he never suspects that the bishop can have been guilty of an erroneous interpretation of Scripture, repeating, for example, such a one in Isaiah xxxiii. 14. Yet he shows himself a good theologian, a lover of truth, a hater of falsehood, one who values liberty of thought and abhors the persecution of good men for opinions honestly entertained.

The Bride of the Wilderness. By Emmerson Bennett. Piper and Co. A red-skin novel, and by no means a bad one. If there be any among our readers who are enjoying the young age of literary gluttony, who have tracked the trapper to his death, and are hungering' for more forest fights and blockhouse sieges, this is the book for them. We could fill a few pages pleasantly with extracts; but our space iB precious, and the book is cheap.

The Drummer of the Dawn. By RAYMOND PATON. I (Chapman and Hall. 6s.) ALTHOUGH "The Drummer of the Dawn" is a little unequal and crude in construction in one or two situations, it has a great human charm. The story opens with the doings of two Bohemians: one Reginald Chambers, an actor; the other Mr. Robert Aping-Ayres, a dramatic critic whose weakness is drink. There enters into the life of Roberto a preternaturally clever and yet very human child, Philip Gray, who is christened by Roberto " Tinwhumpinny," which means in some remote part of the world a beater of a drum. The sudden death by fire of Philip's mother, sister, and aunt, with whom he lived, throws the child quite unaccountably on the world, and Martha, his nurse, as the last resource, takes him from starvation to our friend Roberto, who makes himself responsible for his future. Their struggles for even the necessities of life form quite an interesting part of the story until the influence of the boy makes itself felt, and Roberto starts a new life from the ashes of his own old one, and prospects grow brighter for both of them. A sojourn in Morocco brings the story to the end, which is a sad one, but full of lessons. There are one or two minor mistakes in the text. Bougainvillia is wrongly spelt, and surely the Scripture knowledge of the author is at fault when it is stated that Naaman the Syrian and Bathsheba are the only persons mentioned in the Bible as taking baths. John the Baptist certainly did, also the poor man at the Pool of Siloam, the Ethiopian official, and others. However, let this pass, and let us thank the writer for the good book he has written, which we hope will be followed by many others. Pure boyhood and its stimulating effect on what looked like a wasted life cannot but be good-tragic though its ending-and evidently such a memory is the foundation on which the story is laid.

The Odyssey of Homer Books I.-XII. Translated into English Verse by the Earl of Carnarvon. (Macmillan & Co.) So wide are the ways of Homeric translation, so manifold the riches of that large heroic world, that each new translator is welcome, and none the less if, to our comfort, he reminds us that, in spite of Mr. Matthew Arnold, even our " upper classes" are not yet wholly " barbarized," and that an earl may yet be faithful to the best tradition of his order, and love things Greek with the faith and taste of an Elgin or a Derby. For this, at least, our thanks are due to Lord Carnarvon, and we further owe him a full recognition of the purity and simplicity of his style, which shows the power of Greek literature to chasten and refine. It is only a pity that this negative influence has been pushed too far; while anxious to remember that for the Greeks virtue lay in tho mean, he has almost forgotten that there is another mean in which lies mediocrity. He has doubtless aimed at, and certainly attained, a uniform level of work; but it is the level of the plain, not of the mountain lands of Homer. It is small comfort that a translator seldom sinks if he never rises. Lord Carnarvon has made a primary mistake in his metre, and from beginning to end illustrates to the full the dangers of blank verse to a writer who has little ear. So glaring is this deficiency in his case, that he once or twice has overlooked lines a foot short (Book vi. 217, ix. 115), an irregularity which is but imperfectly compensated by a line of six feet (xi. 585). After this it seems almost hypercritical to complain that we find unconscious rhymes (xi. 178-9, 479-80, 542-3), or that only by ingenuity and counting of syllables can such lines be scanned as viii. 521-3, "Then the wise chief cut from the chineof a white-tusked boar a goodly morsel," the right division of which may be left as a riddle for the curious. Of merely weak and ineffective rhythm it is useless to speak. Lord Carnarvon's eye must be almost as illpractised as his ear. Such forms as " Hephaestus," " OZooa," are not compensated by "_7Echalian"for OZchalian; and "Syren" is not what we should expect from a scholar. Probably it is to a misprint for " ill-seemeth " ?though it is curious that it should have been overlooked?that we owe the strange form in the final couplet of the volume :? For it meseemeth me to tell anew A tale which I already have made plain. But we will leave further criticism to quotations. Any ten lines taken at hazard will fairly represent the style and manner of the whole:? So on we sailed grieving at heart, and came Unto the Cyclops' land?a lawless race And headstrong ; they nor sow nor till, Mut trust their harvests to th' Immortal Gods. The corn, the barley and the clustering grape Grow of their own sweet will; Heaven's kindly rain Gives them their increase. They know not of law Or ancient usage, nor grave council hold In parley for the State; but in deep caves They dwell upon the hill tops, and they rule Their households, nor does each of other reck. ix.113-123. As when the huntress Queen on mountain-side Adown Taygetus, or on the ridge Of lofty Erimanthus, speeds the chase Of boar or hind, and with her the wild Nymphs, Daughters of Zeus, the a?gis-bearing Lord, Their pastime take, and Leto's heart grows glad, As above all with head and lofty brow Most easy to be known the Goddess towers ; So fairest far of that fair company The peerless maid outshone her maidens all. vi. 115-124. And when by craft or in fair fight thy foes Lie dead before thee in thy palace halls, Then get thee forth again, bearing in hand A well-shaped oar, and journey till thou come Unto a country distant far from sight And sound of ocean, where men's homely fare Is void of salt, where neither painted ship, Nor oar that moves her like the bird of heaven, Stir [sic] the sea wave. And this shall be thc sign? When with an oar across thy shoulder thrown Some wayfarer shall meet thee in amaze At thy strange burden, and shall deem it is Some rustic implement: then fix that oar Fast in the ground, and to Poseidon first Fay all thy dues?a ram, a bull, a boar, The father of the herd ; next wend thy way Homeward, and to the Gods in order due, The dwellers of High Heaven, make sacrifice. There rest thee, till arising fioui the deptlis Of ocean, painless death with gentle touch Shall steal upon thee in a blest old age, And midst a happy people. I have said. xi. 131-132. Here the whole point of the sign given by Tiresias, </>//>/ d6i)pi)\oiybv c^ttr ai-u </jguo7/'w ('Vt*' is shirked in the paraphrase " a rustic implement." However, the translation is throughout so very free that it would be unfair to attempt to criticize too closely points missed or perverted.

The House on the Moor. NXW KOVXLS. By the Author of 'Margaret Maitland,' &c. 3 vols. (Hunt & Blackett)?-This work does not need the touching apology put forth in the Preface. ' The House on the Moor' is superior to Mn. Oliphant's later works. The story is very interesting, and the interest deepens as the story proceeds. In the first volume the germ of hate, and the morbid brooding over a long-past injury, are seen beginning their deadly growth. There is a quiet tragic power in the picture of the lonely house, the joyless fireside, the unloving household, which is better than anything we remember by the same author. It is perfectly life-like and unexaggerated. The dark shadows are relieved a little by the old servant, and the young girl, so patient and gentle in her hard, comfortless lot, and the ever-present bitterness of her domestic life. The sympathy of the reader is, in spite of himself, awakened for the bitter, brooding father, always occupied with the injustice to which he is the victim, till all human feeling has been choked out of him, leaving nothing but an insane hatred to his son; who, like himself, bsa only been the sport of an old man's malicious caprice. The terrible evil wrought in the son, by the father's perverse and wicked enmity, developes itself with a simple and powerful truthfulness, which tempera the reader's disgust with the "milder grief of pity." This shows great skill in the author; for though both father and son are as detestable as they well can be, yet the reader is not allowed to hate either of them ; the wrongs and perverseness which have driven both wrong are kept fully present to the reader's sympathy. The climax to which evil thoughts, enmities and malice lead a man, is carefully and firmly worked out. The last scenes of the father's death-bed and the son's remorse are extremely well done, with a quiet veracity that adds to their power. In contrast to the misery worked to themselves by father and son, stands the pure, gentle, loving nature of the daughter, Susan,?showing that no outward circumstances can work any real harm to a human being unless he consents to it himself,?unless he lets evil and bitter feelings into his own heart. The old Colonel, the good genius of the book and the pendant to the misanthrope, is not so vigorous in its handling, nor effective in its result. He is good?very good, indeed?but there is not the knowledge of human nature shown in his character, nor the same delicate shading, as in those of the evil-natured men in the book. The minor characters are well done in their respective ways, and the underplot is cleverly made to bear upon the main current of the story. It is a well-compacted, well-managed story; and though the final end is rather more huddled than a thorough novel-reader would desire, still there is much to be thankful for, as the. reader will agree when he reads for himself.

8 " It is Nsver Too Late to Mend." A Matter of Fact Romance. By Charles Reade, Author of 4 Christie Johnstone,' &c. Three vols. Bentley. This is a book of considerable mark, being a novel written with unusual vigour and intensity of feeling. But as a novel it has two artistic faults, one at the surface, one at the core. At the surface there lie certain eccentricities of stylo and even of punctuation, as for example an economy in the use of commas, which are meant to increase strength, but are in truth traces of weakness. At the core lies a fault of construction, in the interruption of the plot for a very long time during a dramatic exposition of a case of the abuse of prison discipline, once very familiar to newspaper readers. Mr Reade seems to have been writing his book at the time, to have felt very indignant, and to have filled up a large part of his novel with an eloquent protest, in which the solitary system of imprisonment, which may be very bad, is visited with the sins of a particular jail governor; for which it is not very clearly, though no doubt it is in a certain indirect way, to be made responsible. Having said this we have ended our complaint, and we may justly modify what we have said by adding that the story within story is not by any means unwelcome to the reader. It is so told as to excite strong interest, and the book, be its story well or ill constructed, commands the reader's unbroken attention from the first page to the last. The interest arises in the same way from each section into which we may consider it split. While the heart is everywhere knocked at for human sympathy, the head is everywhere amused by the moves in a game between two contending factions who are wrestling with their wits against each other. In the main story it is Mr Meadows and his lawyer Crawley, besides other pieces for the black chessmen, against the hero and heroine, the old Jew Levi and their set, to represent the white. In the incidental story, illustrating prison discipline, it is a contest of wit, move against move, between Mr Hawes the cruel governor, Fry and the other gaolers for the black men, and the heavenly chaplain, Mr Eden, one repenting gaoler, and some prisoners for the white men. In the prison story Mr Hawes is at last checkmated. In the main story Mr Meadows is checkmated, but in each case the game has many fluctuations, and the run at last is close. It is not often that we get a novel so distinctly and so formally constructed on the principle of having two sides that make moves against each other. In a less able and original writer the effect of this must have been to some extent common-place and conventional. Here it is made throughout tho source of intellectual interest. We follow moves, but we have also our hearts concerned about their issue. When the story opens we have George Fielding, a young farmer, pattern Honesty, who has a London thief for a lodger, with a rival in the love of his Susan in the shape of a respectable man, Mr Meadows, who is ready to do evil to win ber. He is plotting against Fielding, but in the course of his proceedings contrives to make an enemy of an old Jew, Isaac Levi, who is enormously clever, and who undertakes quietly to play on Fielding's side. George has a rival in his brother William, but he is stout-hearted, and gulps down his love. It is a result of plotting that George Fielding is not to marry until he has earned a thousand pounds. He has an opportunity of going to farm in Australia, and undertakes to go there for it. Ho is going: ' And now/ faltered George, * I feel strong enough to go, and I'll g?-' He looked round at all the familiar objects he was laving, as if to bid them farewell; and last, whilst every eye watched his movements, he walked slowly up to his grandfather's chair. 4 Grandfather,' said he, * I am going a lon/- journey, and mayhap shall never see you again: speak a word to me before I go.' Tbe impassive old man took no notice, so Susan came to him. 'Grandfather, speak to George; poor George is going into a far country.' When she had repeated tim in his ear their grandfather looked up fora moment?* George, fetch me some snufffrom where you're going.' A spasm crossed George's face; be was not to have a word of good omen from the aged man. 4 Friend?,' said he, looking appealingly to all the rest. Meadows included, ' I wanted him to say God bless you? but snuff is all his thought now. Well, old man, George won't forget your last word, such as 'tis-' In a butch near the corner of the house wai William's pointer Carlo. Carlo observing by the general movement that there was something on foot, had the curiosity to come out to the end of his chain, and as he stood there giving every now and then a little uncertain wag of his tail, George took notice of him and came to him and patted his bead. * Good-bye Carlo,' faltered George; ' poor Carlo?you and I shall never go after the partridges again, Carlo : the dog shows more understanding than the Christian ; bye, Carlo.' Then he looked wistfully at William's dotr, but he said nothing more. William watched every look of George, but he said nothing at the time. ' Good-bye little village church, where I went to church man and boy ; good-bye churchyard where my mother lies; there will be no church bells, Susan, where I am going j no Sunday bells to remind me of my soul and home.' These words, which he spoke with great difficulty, were hardly out of young Fielding's mouth when avery painful circumstance occurred; one of tho*, things that seem tbe contrivance of some malignant spirit. The church bells in a moment struck up their very merriest peal! George Fielding started, he turned pale aid his lips trembled. ' Are they mocking me ?' he cried. * Do they take a thought what I am going through this moment the hard-hearted?* ?No! no! nol' cried William: 'don't think it, George, I know what tis?III tell ye.' 4 What is it?' ?Well it is-well. George, it is Tom Clarke and Esther Borgherst married to-day ; only they couldn't have the ringers till the afternoon. 4 Why Will they have only kept company a y?*r, and Susan and I have kept company three years; and Tom and Eather are married to-day; and what ar* George and Susan doing to-dsy? God^help met Ob, God help mc! What sfatf I do ? What thall I do V And the stout heart gav* way, s?*t| Qootfe FMdsBf covored his koo with hi* hands ami burst out sobbtaw sod crying. eSusan flung h?r anns round Ms neck?'Oh! G*orge, Bay pride is adi goo*; dont go* don't think to go; have pity on us beth and don't go.* Aad sh* dung to trias?her boonot tall*** ott, har hair <lisbevelled---and they sobbed and w*pt in oo* another's uttoo. Meadowa writhed with the jealous anguish this sad sight gav* bia, and at that inomeot he could have caned tbe whole cra*tma. H* tried to fly, but he was rooted to the spot. He kened skk as deaath against the palings. George and Susan cried together, and then they wiped one another's eye* like simple country folk with one pockert-handkarchief; and then they kissed one another in tua), and mod* **ch other's tears flow fast again; and again wiped one another's eye* with on* handkerchief. Meadows griped the palings convulsively?hell was ia his heart. 4 Poor souls, God help them!' said .William to himself ia his purified heart The silence their sorrow caused all around waa suddenly invaded by a voice that seemed to come from another world?it was Grandfather Fielding. 4 The autumn sun is not so warm as she used to b* f Yes, there was the whole map of humanity on thst little spot in the county of Berks. The middle-aged man. a schemer, watching th* success of hb able scheme and stunned and wounded by its recoil. And old age callous to noble pain, all alive to discomfort, yet nun to the last?blaming any one but Number One, cackling against heavenly bodies, accusing the sun and the kitchen-fire of frigidity?not his own empty veins! And the two poor young things sobbing as if their hearts would break over their first great earthly sorrow. George was the first to recover himself. * Shaine upon me!' he cried; he drew Susan to his bosom and pressed a long, burning kiss upon her brow. And now all felt the wrench was coming. George with a wild, half-terrified look, signalled William to come to him. * Help me. Will 1 you see I have no more manhood than a girl.* Susan instinctively trembled. George once more pressed his lips to her as if they would grow there* William took her band. Sbe trembled more and more. 4 Take my hand ; take your brother's hand my poor lass,' said he. She trembled violently ; and then George gave a cry that seemed to tear his heart, and darted from them in a moment. Poor Susan uttered more than one despairing scream, and stretched out both her hands to George. He did not see her, for he dared not look back. 4 Bob, loose the dog,' muttered William hastily, in a broken voice. The dog was loosed and ran after George, who he thought was only going for a walk. Susan was sinking, pale and helpless, upon her brother's bosom. 4 Pray, sister/ said gentle William; * pray, sister, as I must.' A faint shiver was all the answer; her senses had almost left her. When George was a little way up the hill something ran suddenly against his legs?he started?it was Carlo. He turned and lifted up his hands to heaven ; and William could see that George waa blessing him for this. Carlo was more than a dog to poor George at that cruel moment. Soon after that George and Carlo reached tke crown of the hill. George's figure stood alone a moment between them and the sky. He was seen to take his hat off and raise his bands once more to Heaven, whilst he looked down upon all he loved and left, and then he turned his sorrowful face again towards that distant land, and they saw him no morel That extract is long enough to show how well the book is written. George in Australia gets into difficulties, and while he is gone bis old lodger, the thief, gets into the mismanaged prison. There he suffers much, is reformed by the heavenly chaplain, and, bringing the reader to the prison with him, introduces us to the discussion, put in a dramatic form, on prison discipline. Tbe views enforced by Mr Reade we find thus stated in tbe form of light-headed talk by the heavenly chaplain, who has, in playing his game against Mr Hawes, at a most critical point been prostrated by fever. But one day it so happened that he was light-headed and greatly excited, holding a conversation. His eye was flashing, and he spoke in bursts, and then stopped awhile and seemed to be listening in irritation to some arguments with which he did not agree. The enthusiast was building a prison in the air. A prison with a farm, a school, and a manufactory attached. Here were to be combined the good points of every system, and others of his own. ?Yes,' said he in answer to his imaginary companion, of course, there shall be both separation and silence for those whoa* moral case it suit*!?for all perhaps at first?but not for all always. Away with your Morison's pill-system : your childish monotony of moral treatment in cases varying and sometimes opposed.' ' Yes but I would. I would allow a degree of intercourse between such as were disposed to confirm each other in good. Watch them ? why of course?and closely too.' ? Intelligent labor for every creature in the place. No tickets-ofleave to let the hypocritical or self-deceiving ones loose upon the world.' 4 No, I test their repentance first with a littl* liberty.' 4 How ? Why fly them with a string before I let them fly free!' 4 Occupation provided outside the prison-gates ; instead of ticketof-leave let the candidate work there on parole and come into tbe prison at ni(*ht.' ' No, not all of them. Some will break parole and run away? *AI1 tbe better. Then you know their real character. Telegraph them. You began by photographing them, send their likenesses to every town?catch them?cell them. ? Indeed! And pray what would these same men bav* don* had you given them tb* ticket-of-leave instead?' ? By tbe present plan your pseudo-convert commits a dozen crimes before his hypocrisy b suspected ; by ours a single offence warns you and arms you against bim. ' Systems avail less than is supposed. For good or ill all depends on your men?not your machinery.' 4 We bave got rid of tbe old patch that rotted our new garment. When I first was chaplain of a gaol?-' His mind had gone forward some yearr. ? Then we were mad?thought a new system could be worked by men of the psst, by gaolers and turnkeys belonging to the dark and brutal age that came before ours.' ? Those dark days are passed. Now we have really ? governor aad warders instead of gaolers and turnkeys. Th* nation has discovered these are high offices, not mean oners.* ? Yes Lepel, yes! Our officers are men picked out of all England for intelligence and humanity. They cooperate with me. Oar gaol is one of th* nation's eyes?it is ? school thank heaven it is aot a dungeon ! I am in bad V With these last words he had come to himself, and oh, th* sad contrast ! Butcherly blockheads in these high places, and himself ryiag sick snd powerless, unable to lift a hand for the cause be loved. The sigh tbat burnt from him aeemetd to tear his veryhewrt; nwt th* very nest moment be put his banda humbly toother aod said ? God's will b* don* !' Yet one big tear gathered in bia lion eye, and spite of all trickled down his cheek while he said ?God's will be done.' The chaplain conquers after mighty toil, throughout whioh Mr Reade takes care that the reader follows him with a ftrtrnga-rjiiipetty though he does sometimet tty more timm tbe pareen whom be it aMreteiog ?would atoll Hmm etty to hear.

The reformed thief, tent to Australia with ticket-of-leave, and there releaaed, it recommettded to keep company with HoMety in the person of George Fielding. He begins with backsliding, it saved by an iistei^ontkm of Providenoe, horries to George Fielding, and i*nda him at a criticalJmur, alone and at the point of death. Theyfarm; they A The tmef, Thomas Robinson, hat been in California, he knows the aspect of a gold country, and he discovert gold. The story peases then to a graphic description of the opening of the Australian golddiggings. Mr Meadowe at home, who intercepts and reads bit letters, it alarmed at thia good fortune in hit rival, who it not to come home with a thousand pounds. He sends out bia creature Crawler, who associates at the diggings with certain ruffiant, and plays against George and Robinson a deeperate game, like Jew Levi it on tbe spot aa moneychanger. Plots become thicker and thicker; interest deepens,?but it is not our business to tell the tale. Let ut quote thit Australian sketch instead. 43 Prvjudie* he hanged, thb is a lovely land.' ' So ftia, Tom, so tb. But lit tell you what puts me out a little bit; nothing is what it sets up for here. If you see a ripe pear and go to cat it, it b a lump of hard wood.

Who'd come twelve thoasand mile* to see nothing we couldn't see at borne? Hang the sam* old story always ; where are we going, George ?' ' Oh, not mnch farther, only about twelve miles from the camp ?' ?Whereto?' 'To a i*arr*er I know. I am going to ahow you a lark, Tom,' said Georg*, and bis eyes hennaed bsmevol*nc* on bis comrade. Bobtneon stopped dead short. 4 George,' said be, * no! don't let us. I would rather stay at home and read my book. You can go into temptation and come mit pure: I can't. I am one of those that Sf I go into a puddle up to my shoe I must splash up to my middle.' * What has that do with it 1' * Your proposing to me to go in for a lark on the Sabbath-day.' ' Why Tom, am I tbe man to tempt you to do evil ?' asked George hurt. 'Why no t but you proposed a lark.' ' Aye, but an innocent one, one more likely to lift your heart on high than to give yon ill thoughts.' 'Well thb is a riddle;' and Robinson was intensely puzzled. * Carlo,' cried George suddenly, * come here, I will not have you hunting and tormenting those Kangaroo rats to-day. Let us all be at peace if you please. Come to heel.' The friends strode briskly on, and a little after eleven o'clock they came upon a small squatters house aod premises. * Here we art*,' said George, and bis eyes glittered with innocent delight. Tbe house was thatched and white washed, and English was written on tt and on every foot of ground round it A furze bush had been planted by the door. Vertical oak palings were the fence, with a five-barred gate in the middle of them. From the little plantation all the magnificent trews and shrubs of Australia had bean excluded with amazing resolution and consistency, and oak and ash reigned safe from over-towering rivals. They passed to the back of th* house, and there George's countenance fell a little, fur on the oval grass-plot and gravel walk h* found from thirty to forty rough fellows, most of them diggers. ?Ah well,' said he on reflection, ? we could not expect to have it all to ourselves, and indeed it would be a sin to wish it you know. Now Tom, come thb way; here it is, here it ia-there.' Tom looked up, and h) a gigantic cage was a light brown bird. He wes utterly confounded. ? What is it thb we came twelve miles to see 1 * * Aye! and twice twelve wouldn't have been much to me.* ' Well but where b the lark you talked oft' ' Thb b H.' 'Thb? Thb is a bird.' ' Well, and isn't a lark a bird 1' 'Oh, ay! Ieee! hal ha! ha! ha!' Robinson's merriment waa interrupted by a harsh remonstrance from several ot* th* diggers, who were all from tbe other end of tbe camp. 1 Hold your-cackle,' cried one, *h* is going to sing;' and the whole party had their eyes trsrvted with expectation towards the bird. like aioat stagers he kept them waiting a bit. But at bat, just at nona wheo th* aristi-as* of thc hooee had warranted him to sing, tb* tittle ssath*red exile began aa it wet* to run* his pipes.

There is melodramatic exaggeration in this book, and it contains many an error of taste, but no reader can tail to understand, while he reads it, that he is submitting to the spell of one who is no mere confectioner of novels, of a man with real originality of thought, shrewd in invention, powerful in expression, and unquestionably able in due time to bring hit faults into subjection, and take his place as a first-rate novelist.

Pro Patrid. By Max Pemberton. (Ward, Lock & Co.) With the best will in the world, we find it impossible to regard 4 Pro Patria' as a satisfactory tale of adventure. There is a certain amount of ingenuity, it is true, displayed in elaborating the scheme by which England is to be invaded by France, but the motives which animate the plotters seem hardly adequate, and there is a haziness about the part played by the fine old French colonel which detracts from the strength of the narrative. All through a feeling is latent in our mind that the whole business is a got-up job for the purpose of letting Mr. Pemberton describe a number of hairbreadth escapes. That is not the way of a good tale of adventure: however impossible it may appear if looked at calmly, it at any rate convinces the reader for the time being. Then the hero and heroine, as always with Mr. Pemberton, are intolerable : if he would give them no character at all it would be better, but he gives them a horrible i smug grocer-like self-righteousness which i entirely alienates our sympathy.

Of the next witticism we take some credit to ourselves for having seized the spirit, al. though it is worded so as to avoid the eve. This peerless femiale, becoming pensive, envies the rougher sex their freedom " to rove through the wilds and tamnes of the vorld." Now, half the peruisers would, we dare swear, lie satisfied withl the prinia facie happiness of this phrase-so are not we.

In one instance, her ladyship's sister acquaints her ladyship, that "' luring her first spring in toWIn, she muist stand cap in hand, in the market-place, to secuire the most sweet voices of the people, wozerth knowing."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
East and West Tom FuTuRz O, EAsT AND WzS. By SR F=zDuczc WHYTe. (Sudgwick & Jackso 3s. 6d.) SIR FREDERICK WHYTEmS skilfully condensed survey of the past and present relations of East and West brings him finally to the conclusion that " Geneva or Moscow? is the sum of the queries which are written on the whole landscape, from Riga to Tokyo, from the Arctic Ocean to Singapore." His book is, m effect, an eloquent plea for harmonious co-operation between Europe, America and Asia, "towards an agreed end upon generally acceptedprnciples," withtheLeague of Nations inthe backg as the source and mainstay of that co-operation. Contemplti the whole mundane scene in serene perspective, Sir F ic finds a working hypothesis in the threefold conclusion that (I) Europe remains the central political area of the world; that (2) its old preponderance has been greatly lessened by the new power of America, and that (3) the East comes now to supply a new and weighty element necessitating the establishment of a new equilibrium for the whole. Looking to the future, he perceives that if America and the Far East do not "come in " to complete the " perfect round " of co-operation, or" if the existing organs of the League of Nations are inherently inadequate for Eastern purposes," there will be ground for serious apprehension Yet in the general outlook he finds promise of appeasement and retains undiminished the Fabian faith, that " the common achievement which awaits all the many families of mankind, is to take their differences to the high ground of a new world order, and there compose them in peace." This little book is, in fact, an able exposition and vindication of the ideals of international pacifism and, as such, should find favour with those who are able to persuade themselves that Hinduism can be brought to " look upon itself with fresh eyes and remould its doctrine to meet the needs of a more complex and more social order," or that " Western influence has familiarized the educated Chinese mind with the idea of the State, in the political conception known to Europeans." His whole thesis is couched in the language which has become stereotyped amongst " Liberal thinkers " since the great war; nevertheless, his conclusions are not of a nature to convince any serious student of history or political economy, inasmuch as they ignore the fundamental truth that the type of a social structure can only be changed by slow processes tending to modify the character of the individuals who compose it. Meredith Townsend estimated that it would require at least three centuries for the idea of government by law, in lieu of government by human volition, to filter down to the Indian masses and waken them out of their torpor. Owen Lattimore, an eminently scientific observer, considers that the dominant instinct of the Chinese to-day seeks, not to become Western, but only to adopt Western methods as weapons, in the hope of deliverance from the West. Sir Frederick Whyte's conception of the future of East and West is admissible only on the assumption that Asia is being, and must be, rapidly Westernized, probably the most widespread and profound of all the illusions prevalent in present-day politics.

311   8849383   The Son of the Czar: an Historical Romance.
Feb 12, 1898  ENGLISH LITERATURE - 19th Century|ENGLISH LITERATURE - 20th Century
The Athenaeum  : 3668 213 - 213
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sun of thc Czar: an Historical Romance. HISTOniCAL ROMANCES. Uy James j?i. uranam. ^narper isrotners.;? The writer of ' The Son of the Czar' (a lady, if we mistake not) attempts to relate the miserable career of Alexis, the son of Peter the Great. Probably this episode is too revolting to be capable of artistic treatment in a romance or on the boards. The Tsarevitch, take him at his best, was a poor, cowardly knave, who showed his illustrious father that he was bent upon upsetting all his plans and reducing to a nullity the whole purpose of his life. Peter had something of the Oriental despot in his nature, and cared little whom he struck down, if he were an obstacle in his path. The stupid boy?himself full of brutal instincts, as he showed by his treatment of his wife?was doomed to perish, although, perhaps, the exact manner of his death will never be known. The writer has drawn an ideal portrait of Peter, making him habitually use high-flown rhetoric, whereas we know from history that he was a man of few words and of almost brutal frankness. The same is the case with the uneducated Catherine, his wife, who is here made to talk with the sententiousness of tho mistress of a boardingschool. The poor Princess Charlotte of Wolfenbiittel is dragged in, and made an archduchess, a title to which she had no claim whatever. The adventures of Alexis in his flight, both to Vienna and Naples, aro described at length. The miserable fate of his Finnish mistress Euphrosyne furnishes some pages of horrors, but fortunately there is no historical warrant for believing that she met with her death at the hands of her own brother. According to one story she lived thirty years after her lover's death. Generally speaking, we think that the writer has not enough acquaintance with Russian customs and modes of thought. How would it be possible for Alexis to take interest in the Latin churches which he saw in his travels, and to believe in St. Januarius'( The writer has clearly never heard of the Russian views on the Latin heresy. Again, Alexis is often spoken of as a handsome young man, whereas he was very much the reverse, as a glance at his portraits would show. He is introduced as reading ' The Imitation of Christ,' a book of devotion unknown to the Orthodox ; we find stained - glass windows in Russian churches ; and the ignorant Muscovites of that time are described as being well acquainted with what happened in the West and having Western ideas generally. The word teran (from tho Greek Ttpefiva, the woman's part of the house in ancient Russia) is in several passages treated as if it were identical in meaning with a harem. To mention minor details, we constantly find the chief actors in the story drinking champagne. We should imagine that at that time it was a wine practically unknown in Russia. In no account of Peter the Great do we find him spoken of as drinking it. In the anecdotes told of him it is Hungarian wine that is mentioned. So, also, the use of coffee is made far too common. The beverage had only come into vogue at the end of the previous century, and is very little mentioned in Russian books of the time. Then we have the unusual expression "Emperor of the Romans " for the German Emperor. We have heard of the King of the Romans, but hardly of the Emperor except in a Latin form. The spelling of the Russian names seems to show that the writer is not acquainted with the Russian language. Thus, what are we to say of " Czeremetov" for Sheremetiov ? And how could Maranoff be a Russian baron, a title unknown in the country at that time'. But it would be useless to pursue these minutia; further. If we allow the writer of an historical novel to modify the facts a little for his convenience, as Scott did, we cannot pardon him for being ignorant of tho manners of the time and of the local colour. There are several chapters in John Gilbert, Yeoman, by Mr. R. G. Soans (Warne & Co.), that place the book above the average of fiction in the class to which it belongs. As a romance of the Commonwealth it gives a vivid and often interesting account of rural life in Sussex, with occasional excursions to the metropolis. The dramatis persome include fewer characters known to history than is usual in such works. Cromwell appears on the stage towards the end of tho book, and there is an occasional glimpse of Lady Claypole. The writer borders on tbe ridiculous when Cromwell writes to the hero, " The only impediment to your marriage being done away with, I doubt not but that you will find an early date for the consummation thereof"; and still more quaintly adds, "at which, by your leave, I would fain be present." The proposition might involve a nice question of delicacy. In other respects the book is written with caro and rarely without skill. In The Gown and the Man, by Prester St. George (Digby, Long & Co.)?a story of the struggle between the King and the Parliament, and of the Commonwealth ? there is little to interest the general reader. The book is artless in construction, and, though the writing is that of a scholar, it is very far from being the work of a student of history, and unequal as a whole.

Mar 6, 1875  ENGLISH LITERATURE - History and Criticism - 19th Century
Examiner  : 3501 276 - 276
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Italians. By Frances Elliot, Author of ' The Diary of an Idle Woman in Italy,' &c. In Three Volumes. Hurst and Blackett. We confess that, on first taking it up, we expected to find ' The Italians' a lightly written diary of travel, such as ladies frequently publish nowadays on their return from a continental tour. But never did we make a greater mistake. It is a bond fide three-volumed romance, a wonderful exercise of the invention, a mixture of exquisite improbabilities with geographical, architectural, and uphblstering minutiae. Its heroine is a pretty little Lucchese, by name Eurica; and Miss Elliot dedicates her story, with a sweet simplicity, " to the real Eurica, with the author's love." We will not go quite so far in our cynicism as to quote the immortal Betsey Prig, when she told Mrs. Gamp that she (lidnlt believe there was no sich person. All we (lo say is, that, granted that the real Eurica is at the present moment in the falli enjoyment of life and vigour, Miss Elliot's aswful representations, both of the said Eurica and of her fellow Italians, are enough to make each particular hair of that young lady's head stand on end. We commiscrate the "real Eurica." Again referring to the title of Miss Elliot's novel, are we not at least justified in expecting her dramatis personce to be typical Italians of the present day ? But we should be sorry indeed to think that many Italians were such wretched specimens of humanity as are represented by Miss Elliot. Her characters are either childish or maniacal, and in either case are likely to prove utterly uninteresting to the modern British reader. Miss Elliot spends much time and care in describing Lucchese scenes, streets, buildings, and ancestral splendours; she also takes immense trouble with her pathetic and angry passages. We know that Italians are, as a rule, impulsive, energetic in word and gesture. But did ever such a chamelion-like personage exist as Count Marescotti, of whom Miss Elliot says: " In the space of a few moments he had greatly changed. Suddenly he had grown worn and weary-looking. His eyes were sunk into his head; dark circles had formed round them. His bloodless cheeks, transparent with the pallor of perfect health, were blanched; the corners of his mouth worked convulsively." We are glad that we have no evidence in favour of the existence of a "real Marescotti !"

The Crusade of the Excelsior. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. By Bret Harte. I 2 vols. (White & Co.) ' The Ckusade of the Excelsior ' ia Mr. Bret Harte's first complete failure. Except in some passages of description of the scene of action at Todos Santos, a remote spot near the extremity of Lower California, it is almost impossible to recognize the author of ' The Luck of Roaring Camp' or ' Left out on Lone Star Mountain.' Once or twice it appears that Mr. Bret Harte must have been trying his hand at imitating the analytic school of American novelists, and at times he sinks so low as to amuse himself with "American humour." Where, one must ask, are the terse vigour of his imagination, his keen apprehension of striking contrast, and his strong genuine pathos? The story in its 'mere outline had suggestions for excitement, but it is told ineffectively. The wily contrivances of the disguised generalissimo of an obscure republic, his seizure of the vessel, the absurd adventures of the mystified passengers with the benighted authorities ashore, and the miniature revolution seem to offer not bad materials; but though Mr. Bret Harte is the author it cannot be denied that the story is tedious. It must be set down to the fog which hangs for ever over Todos Santos, and which seems to have extended further.

A Mere Accident

A Mere Accident. By George Moore. (Vizetelly & Co.) ' A Mere Accident' would hardly deserve notice if it were not by a writer who has made a name for himself by the vigour and originality of his former novels. In this instance Mr. Moore has pieced together some very ill-assorted studies. These are pictures of a commonplace domestic lady and of a vacillating young man of ability, sketches of Sussex landscape, stray notes and comments on mediaeval Latin literature with specimens, and a wantonly cruel exhibition of the mental state of an innocent girl outraged by a tramp. The revolting incident is introduced without even the excuse of a purpose in the story.

Friend Sorrow

-------------------------------------------------------------
Friend Sorrow. By Mrs. Austin. (Burns & Oates.) If it were not for an indiscreet indulgence in alien tongues and the mingled ineptitude and inaccuracy of her references to music, Mrs. Austin might have earned unqualified approval for her slight but graceful story. But the almost unfailing incorrectness of her quotations from the French and other languages is a serious obstacle in the way of the reader's enjoyment. Chaperone, pusioni, debonair, dilletanti, stella matudina, grain le Kuste?such are the solecisms with which the pages of ' Friend Sorrow' are thickly studded. Music is made, unfortunately, to play a rather prominent part in the story, and what Mrs. Austin lacks in precision she supplies by help of rhapsody. Thus Luigi Pastorini plays a difficult concerto of Beethoven's single-handed, while we are told on the same page that the Abbe Liszt "held his hearers spellbound by the marvel of his execution and the sweetness of his reed-like touch." If novelists only knew how they exasperate readers who really care for music by this treatment of it, they would discreetly avoid the subject. With these deductions ? Friend Sorrow' is a pretty story, pervaded by a spirit of pleasing melancholy, and conveying an excellent moral without being aggressively edifying.

Walter Ellithorne. By A. S. Melville (Stock.)  "'Seriously, Walter, I never could understand the laundry item. I have not at any time seen the details, which might be interesting. The strangest part of the matter is this, that I have reduced my requirements in this respect tu the lowest possible limits consistent with cleanliness, but the item has gone on increasing by pennies until it has reached the fair amount you see.'" The foregoing extract is a fair specimen of the dialogue in 'Walter Elli thorne,' which, like the names and characters of the dramatis persona and the incidents of the plot, is of unintermittent and paralyzing dulness.

REVIEWS. The Standard Bearer. By S. R. Crockett. (Methuen.) The great mass Who are not purists in art, and who like a quickly moving story with a dash of love-making and a dash of swashing blows and a dash of picturesque scenery, might find very much worse mental fodder than Mr. Crockett's easy-going romances provide. The 5resent specimen, for all its name and a bloodthirsty beginning, oes not contain a very large proportion of actual fighting. The " Standard Bearer," Quintin MacClellan, bears a spiritual banner, the blue banner that is the sign of the Cameronian hill-folk. He has become a minister in the Established Kirk after the Revolution, but leads the protest of a small minority against the Erastian domination of the State, and is consequently expelled from his living. But Quintin's troubles with the Presbytery really play a lesser part in the book than his love affairs. There are two women in his story. One is haughty Mary Gordon, whom Quintin saved from the persecuting dragoons when both were children, and who, long wooed in vain, becomes in the end his bride. The other is Jean Gemmell, languishing and consumptive, whom Quintin, out of pity rather than love, marries on her death-bed. More attractive tuan either of these maidens is Alexander- Jonita Gemmell, the Amazonian breaker of horses, vigorous of speech and true of heart. Alexander- Jonita falls to the lot of Quintin's brother, Hob, and this is an episode from the wooing: "' Will you let me be your friend P' I said, impulsively taking her hand. ? I do not know,' said Alexander-Jonita; ' I will tell you in the morning. It is over-dark to-night to see your eyes.' * Can you not believe in me P' said I. ' Have you ever heard that I thus offered friendship to any other maid in all tiie parish P' ' You might have offered it to twenty, and they taken it every one, for aught I care. But Alexander-Jonita Gemmell accepts no man's friendship till she has tried him as a fighter tries a sword.' ' Then try me, Jonita! Try me and prove me P' I cried eagerly. ' I will,' said she promptly. 'Rise this instant from the place where you sit, look not upon me, touch me not, say neither good-e'en nor yet good-day, but take the straight road and the ready over the hill to the manse ox Balmaghie.' The-words were scarce out of her mouth when, with a leap so quick that the collies had not even time to rise, I was over the dyke and striding across the moss and whinstone-orag towards the house by tiie waterside, where my brother's light had long been burning as he sat over his books. I did not so muoh as look about me till I was on the heathery crest of the hill. Then fora single moment I stood looking back into the clear grey bath of night behind me, where the lass I loved was keeping her watch in the lonely sheepfold. Yet I was pleased with myself too. For though my dismissal had been some deal swift and unexpected, I felt assured that I had not done by any means badly for myself. At least I oould call Alexander-Jonita my friend. And there was never a lad upon all the hills of heather that could do so muoh." Mr. Crockett has not chosen a very ambitious theme in The Standard Bearer or handled it with very great elaboration. But the book is written easily and fluently, and there is a wholesome out-door tone about it. The thread of the story, too, is better kept than in some earlier writings, whioh have irritated us by their devious and episodic course.

Nt) wonder, then, that her present:! work is au obvious improvement on its prede'?essiir. 3lrs Hall was always skilful in the construction of her plot ? .she had a nice tact1* m managing a mystery; but here the story is : "I ;i higher order of invention, and penetrates inure deeply into the springs of humanity.

" As he passed across the lawn he stooped, ?mil picket up a pebble, which he flung at a ?'Hired window that jutted out in one of those "'i;'.,onal towers which are sometimes seen -Unking, like gigantic sentinels, the corners of old country-houses. The rose-coloured damask remained unmoved: he threw another ? then a third ? and at the last summons the curtains l\u\v apart, as if by magic, and a fresh, animated face was pressed close to the wintlow. At the same instant, the lattice sprang back, and that countenance, sunny and joyful as a midsummer morning, laughed a blithe good morrow to the baronet's salute. Rosalind Sydney was not beautiful, if her claims to beauty were determined by the standard generally received and acknowledged ; but her great fascination consisted io a play and expression of feature which ti limner would have found it impossible to convey to his canvass. Her eyes were dark, her teeth white and even, her brow high timi polished, her skin and complexion of marvellous purity, both of quality anti colour, and her hair of the true bright nut-brown, rich, curling, and abundant; it was her many moods ? the rapid succession of thoughts anti feelings, the lofty, yet affectionate tone of her impassioned mind, that rendered lier face the dial of her true heart's thoughts and wanderings ; whatever she felt was told forth by her mobile features?joy, sorrow, hope, disappointment, scorn, respect, pleasure, pain, chased each other over her countenance with an earnestness that made those who loved her tremble for her future late. Rosalind's person was full timi well formed, graceful withal, and dignified ; her clear, soft voice harmonised with the trees, and shrubs, and melody of a ."May morning ? to nothing else can 1 liken the joyousness of its sweet and expressive music." We will also give the first appearance of the hero, for so the outlaw must be called. '? At the moment four or live nuns hurst open a dour leading to ii long passage communicating with what was termed the public chapel. They crowded round the abbess like a llock of frighted sheep; others speedily followed ; and their mingled voices, uttering cries iiml prayers, together with a confused noise, which appeared to come from the outside, gave the prioress sufficient cause for alarm. Some prayed, many wept, and all appeared bewildered. Suddenly the convent-bell tolled loudly; anti the father confessor to the priory?a tall, thin, pallid mau ? entered, looking, from the fact of his having just quitted either his siesta or refectory, extremely disturbed and sleepy. The blue-eyed abbess cast upon him a look of severe displeasure, anti inquired repeatedly, but ineffectually, what occasioned the commotion. The ?1 iii without increased ? the nuns called upon their patron saints ?the friar withdrew the sprig of holy myrtle from the still more holy water, and thing the precious drops that rested on its leaves over the terrified females; then, muttering a benediction, he followed the prioress, who walked firmly into the chapel: many of tilt; nuns clung around her, and all entreated her not to proceed ; but the lady lacked neither courage nor decision when it was needed, and she passed on fearlessly to ascertain the cause of the tumult both within and without the walls. She was not sniffled to remain long in suspense; the cause of that commotion was easily explained. Ec-lore the altar, which was adorned with all the various ornaments of Catholicity, his hand r. sting on the holy place, stood a tall and most noblelooking man. considerably past the meridian of life ; his high forehead was bald and bare, and a quattlitv ot' thick grizzled hair .shaded his temples, and waved around his neck ; his tl ress was plain and travel-soiled, torn io many places, not decayed : he was evidently under the influence of btrong excitement, but lear < would seem to him as a tinny; unknown. The wide door opposite the altar, leading to the public road that skirted the priory, had been at the instant burst open, and outside and within were groups of peasants, and a (nw soldiers, who appeared doubtful whether they should advance or retreat; yet his bold eye dared the crowd, and he stood like a proud forest-stag at bay. The nuns had all held back at their gallery-door, and Rosalind only followed the abbess into the centre of the chapel; she clung to the lady's robe, and was too much interested in the scene to withdraw. It had been the custom of the house to leave this chapel o|K"ii for the benefit of the pious poor of the neighbouring country, and a veiled gallery was appropriated to such nuns as chose to attend 1 what w;is called public prayers. To this gallery the ladies flocked ; for retirement gives a ? wonderful edge to curiosity, and no matter how terrified they might be, they wished to see the termination of this most strange and unlookedfor tumult. ' Lady,' said the stranger, ' 1 claim sanctuary within these walls, and at this altar ! Wilt sutler it to be violated?' He spoke in a deep stern voice, and with a powerful aspiration, as he had run fast and far. The abbess started ; perhaps she bad heard the tones of that voice before; and it was singular to observe that, notwithstanding the fierce tolling of the bell, the noisy, querulous voices without, the whisperings and suppressed shrieks of the nuns iii their shrouded galleries ? still the appeal of the hunted stranger came clearly to the ear of every individual present. ' Von see, he has taken refuge here,' said the abbess, drawing her veil over her face, which had hitherto remained uncovered, and addressing the sergeant in command, " therefore withdraw to the outside; no one claiming sanctuary at the altar of our blessed Lady of (irate can fail to obtain it.' * Uut he is a heretic, an incendiary, au outlaw,' replied the hound, who had often licked the blood of the true-hearted ; ' he was tried and condemned at Dorchester by Chief Justice ?Feffrcys, and escaped by the devil's means ; for no human help could have saved him. Since then a price has been set upon his head, and Colonel Kirke would give twice the sum to have the hanging in his own hands. Forward, my boys?there he stands!' The rufliaii was about to proceed ; and it was observed by many .'in anxious eye that the Outlaw neither quailed nor trembled, but grasped his pistol more li linly with his right hand, while his left still rested on the altar. "At your peril !' exclaimed the abbess ? and Rosalind saw her bright eye flash beneath her sombre veil?' at your peril ! What' violate the sanctuary of our Lady of "-?race! ? spill blood, or take prisoner, within these walls ! Uy holy Mary and this blessed doss I swear, that if ye do not withdraw, 1 myself will cite ye before his majesty and his holiness's nuncio, now at London, and see ye feed the ravens of this rebellious Lind. Out, I say !' She seized a crosier that rested in a niche close to where she stood, and advanced, armed with the holy symbol of her order, towards tin; crowd, that retreated before her. " I call you all to witness, good people,' exclaimed the sergeant, stepping bink, " that we traced this outiaw from Setley Wood, across the ford of Lymington, through the marshes ?>f Heathy Ditton, then into the heart of the forest, and lastly to this Heaulieii ; and here, because he chooses to claim sanctuary, that niitd woman obstructs us in the discharge of our duty.' Hereupon a huge outcry was raised by the nuns and the Catholic retainers and inhabitants of the town, who had crowded tu the con vent, fearing some disaster from the tolling of the hell; and the pet lamb of Colonel Kirke stood a chance of being roughly handled: the doors were closed-to outside by some good Komanist, and the prim ess, assisted by Rosalind, placed the night-bar across tho entry. 4 The E.nly .Mary i'owis,* said the stranger, sinking, from exhaustion and over-wrought excitement, upon the steps of the altar that had afforded him so brave a sanctuary in his great peril, ? tin.- E uly Marv I'owis hath not for-J i;')L'- i. ;,rr..i:/f: " ' } The above scent' will give an idea of the animation of the narrative. lint what we would still more impress on the reader's attention, are thc numerous beautiful touches which pervade the whole?thc high principle, and the elevated sentiment.

HUNGRY HEARTS. By Ahzia Yezierska. 7s. 6d. (Fisher L IIWIII.) These stories of immigrant Jews have a point of view and it is well put. When it becomes propaganda we regret it, for the stories themselves accomplish the writer's aim. America, she says, asks for strong hands and does not realise that the Jew brings with these an emotional nature and a warm heart. The construction of the stories shows that the writer is either deficient in a sense of form or is a beginner. It is a question whether the Jewish storyteller, though alwavs interesting, is not as a rule deficient in this qutality. His stories seldom show a sense of line, they are exuberant, filled with warm emotion, witness Zangwill, (Cournoi, Hergesheimer, bunt apparently the Jew cannot sit patiently working away until un(ler his hands the piece of art takes on the perfect shale. In - Hungry Hearts " is a fine storv-one-" The Fat of the Land.." It is the hard fortune of the woman who, having had to work hard for her young children, finds she cannot be happy in the idleness that prosperity' brings. The story has been written before, but Anzia Yezierska handles it anew and with considerable power.

* " Cornish Granite." By Lord Courtney of Pensith. Selected by E. C. M. Stewart and E. Satterthwaite, with an Introduction by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch. 6s. net. (Leonard Parsons.)-" Emotion in Art." By Sir Claude Phillips. 1 5s. net. (Reinemaun.)-" Beyond Wife." By James Branch Cabell. 7s. 6d net. (Bodley Head.) BEYOND LIFE.* Two of the three volumes in the present list are posthumously published, and the third is one which the author would assuredly die happy to know that the world was to be reminded of him by it hereafter. Therefore it hardly matters that he has preferred to publish it in his lifetime. " Beyond Life" is well worthy of being a posthumous work anyhow, and not only because of its suitability in the small affair of a title. The personality of the authors of " Cornish Granite" and " Emotion in Art" lives after them; and one feels while reading these admirably edited collections that nothing essential of their literary work has been interred with their bones. In a manly and modest introduction to the little anthology of writings by Lord Courtney of Penwith, his fellow-Cornishman, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, pays tribute to that fine Radical's natural greatness of character, and the writings which succeed it are an amplification of the opinion. He is revealed by them as a thinker not far from greatness in ideas also, except when he comes to consider such advanced philosophies as that of Socialism-a rock on which so much greatness comes to grief. Lord Courtney stumbled at what Socialists themselves would regard as a merely elementary difficulty, but which he characterised as " the greatest difficulty of organised Socialism." A passage from the essay in which the subject is discussed may be worth quoting because it admirably exhibits the author's argumentative and yet dignified style: " The moral obstacles are overcome; the common good is the paramount aim of all; but where is the brain to order, direct, modify, control the working of the great machine ? It is just possible to believe, looking back on the past, that some of the greatest discoveries would, with more or less hindrance, obtain acceptance-the application of steam power, the economic use of electricity, the introduction of running lines of iron or steel-though it must be remembered that each of these would have had to overcome the lethargy of a national board, instead of first obtaining the support of a few, and then, through the force of demonstrated fact, the acceptance of the many. " But it must be remembered that the progress of industrial improvement has depended, and must depend, upon the continuously increasing introduction of alterations, many of them apparently minute, which have cumulatively abridged the labour and economised the time of industrial process. The socialised community would be a slowly moving, if not stagnant organism." Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch nevertheless applies the best touchstone to all that Courtney wrote, when he declares him to be " a good man, strong in many ways, but above all a valiant advocate of peace through justice, reason and good will among the nations." This suggests (and indeed actually means) a breadth of interests in which art and letters can only hope to have a narrow representation. Sir Claude Phillips's interests, on the other hand, are exclusively artistic. He was the critic of painting for the Daily Telkgraph from 1898 to the time he passed away last year. " Emotion in Art " is a selection of his most typical articles, and they deal with a fine variety of subjects. " The Quality of Emotion in Modern Art," " What the Brush Cannot Paint " and " Great Painters by Themselves" are three most excellent examples. Then come a series on Children, Spring, Joy, Music, Dancing, Love, Death and the Sublime as subjects for the painter, and how they have been treated by painters in the past. Delectable subjects ! . . . Sir Claude writes sensibly, thoughtfully and sympathetically, and his attitude to art is conveyed in the following passage from his enthusiastic essay on Richard Wagner: " Some of the most exquisite enjoyments that poetry and the plastic arts afford to those who are open to their influence are contained in the happy moments in which they join hands, and joining, are married to music, as the chief factor and exponent, to produce a whole, the beauty, the power to impress of which is not to be accounted for even by the beauty, the imaginative power of the component parts taken singly." Mr. James Branch Cabell, I need hardly explain, is not without honour already on his own side of the Atlantic. But English readers, for all Mr. Hugh Walpole's enthusiasm, found little to their liking in the novel by which he was first introduced to this country, and their prejudice (they found the book distastefully reminiscent of Rabelais, therefore tedious) is taking time to live down. However, Figures of Earth," his delicious " comedy of appearances," did much to help him into the considerable place his transatlantic admirers (and Mr. Walpole) claim for him, and " Beyond Life " will do more. Very different in conception from his earlier books is Beyond Life." It is a volume of essays, and after reading it one feels that the author might, if he so wished, step into the vacancy created by the loss of Anatole France. For Mr. Cabell is a new master of irony, a spendthrift of romantic wit, and withal human and charming. In the space of ten essays he offers us a complete philosophy of life-or rather beyond life, for he is incorrigible in his romanticism, and romance for him is " The expression of an attitude which views life with profound distrust, as a business of exceeding dullness and of very little worth; and which therefore seeks for beauty by an abandonment of the facts of living. Beauty, and indeed all the fine things which you desiderate in literature-and in your personal existence, I suspect-are nowhere obtainable save in imagination " Astutely putting his views into the mouth of one John Charteris, at whose feet he is supposed to be sitting, Mr. Cabell is able to speak freely about contemporary events and persons, and we are consequently being regaled on every other page with a beautifully devastating and sometimes outrageous estimate that contributes great spice to the general wisdom and sanity. Thus he defines the Saturday Evening Post as a widely circulated advertising medium which prints considerable fiction, and " the most popular author typewriting to-day is Mr. Harold Bell Wright." Also he says some fine things about Dickens, religion and love. Only now and then does " John Charteris" betray his exclusiveness, his failure to keep abreast of developments outside his study windows. He finds nothing unreasonable for example in " the irrationality of patriotism" because: " Getting nourishment from mother earth, that soil whereon our cattle graze goes steadily to the making of plants, and thence becomes incarnate in our bodies; until we ourselves seem but a many agglutinate and animated particles of that land we love, with such partiality as we may not rouse toward those cool abstractions, equity and logic, but reserve for our corporal kin. For in battling for the honour of one's birthplace each hand is lifted in defence, not merely of opinions, but of the very field in which it once was dust." The logical conclusion of all this argument escapes the man who makes it, simply because he is unaware that economic necessity has forced us to feed ourselves almost entirely on plants and cattle reared on some other " coign of earth " than that which we cherish as our first heritage. Still, the virtues we happen to be searching for in " Beyond Life," as in " Cornish Granite" and " Emotion in Art," are literary, and one's appreciation is consequently indepen- dent of the soundness or otherwise of arguments about other things and about.

Reavinq the If hirlivind. A Novel. By Mrs. McKenzie Daniel, author of ' After Long Sears," "M Airiam's Sorrow,' &c. Three Volumes. (N ewby.) -FROMt thc titlo of Mrs. McKenzie Daniel's new novel one would naturally expect that he was about to commence reading a tale of terrible interest-of hulnan frivolity and sin followed by overwhelming shame and suffering-of cruelty and wrong, triumphant for a time, but overtaken at last and clutched by the dread avenger. But, instead of passion, we have piety-instead of license unchecked, we have tutored lives running carefully in the most conventional grooves; and " the whirlwind," so far as we can see, has yet to be reaped. The saints in Mrs. McKenzie Daniel's novel are many; but the sinners, indeed, are few. There is not a good thorough-going scamp in the whole book; and the little fair-haired, clever, German girl, who does the flirting, and is, for her very pardonable love of admiration, supposed to "' reap the whirlwind," is, thrown among a set so intensely proper and milk-and-waterish that we regard the poor thing as more sinned against than sinning. Mrs. Daniel's books will always be welcome at the Dorcas Society, and often read aloud, no doubt, to the members thereof much to their edification; but, if she wishes to address that wider audience which is called the public, she must make her books more human; and the first step in that direction would be to make her country rectors men as well as parsons. Here is an outline of the story. Mrs. Beamish is the widow of a country clergyman, and, not being left particularly well off, she agrees that her two daughters, Gertrude and Ethel, having finished their education, should open a boarding-school in the large house at Lindenhurst, which the generosity of a friend had enabled them to take. With this end in view, arrangements had been made with their German cousin, Meta Kauffman, for her coming over to England and joining them in the labours of the school. The two sisters have not yet finished their own education, when they receive a letter from their mother announcing the rather sudden arrival of this German cousin, and soliciting the return of one or other of them, immediately, in order that the stranger, in a strange land, might not be without a companion. This letter rather puzzles the sisters at first; but the younger of the two, who is the teller of the whole story, guesses very properly to this effect :-" It is simply, as it seems to me, that Meta Kauffman has turned out to be a young lady of sufficient personal and mental attractions to make a dangerous 1ete-a-tete companion, day after day, for our sensitive, if not susceptible brother; and Mamma, who is easily frightened, catches hold of the first straws that she sees floating towards her in this dire extremity. If Aleta had only been content to remain in her happy Fatherland a few weeks longer, Guy would have been safe at Cambridge, and you and I quite free to devote ourselves to the young person's entertainment." By the time Ethel arrives, however, the mischief is done, and her impressionable brother Guy is the adoring slave of the goldenhaired Meta. The cousin, moreover, never joins in the school, but accepts a situation as governess in a neighbouring family, to which she is recommended by Mrs. Arnott, a lively young widow, whose acquaintance she has converted into a friendship. The fascinating manners and wonderful singing of the new governess gain the good opinions of every one, and it is even whispered that young Edmund Hallam, heir to the earldom of Clinton, thinks more of her than he does of Alicia Clarkson, the young lady to whom lhe is engaged. In the meantime the two sisters open school with three or four pupils, among whom is included little Maggie, the delicate child of the new rector. His visits become frequent, and result in his engagement to Ethel. He is a grave man of middle age, superhumanly modest and saintlike in his piety. Ethel's affection for hi'n is also of the supernal kind. She does not so much love as worship him. Meta Kauffman's engagement as governess at the Vivians' ends abruptly, and she returns to the sisters in disgrace. It is now that the Rev. Harold WVyke sees her; and, looking at her for the first time, and much to his astonishment, he recognizes in Meta Kauffman Mrs. Alan Beresford, to whose dying husband, at Heidelberg, he had administered the last sacrament some four years ago. On discovering the frivolity of her nature he had very soon repented of his marriage, and, in order that lie might ultimately shake her off, he had persuaded her that that marriage was an irregular one, and their little boy illegitimate. This he told the clergyman when dying, and that that same little boy, whom he had placed with maiden aunts of his in Devonshire, was the real heir to the earldom of Clinton. It was for seducing the affections of Edmund Hallam, the supposed heir to the earldom, that Meta was disgraced; and, now that she discovered that she herself was the mother of the future earl, she loses no time in writing to the man whom she had betrayed, disclaiming all future connexion with him, and starts at once for Devonshire to recover her lost boy. This journey into Devonshire, where we pur. posely leave the reader, and the discovering of "Alan, Earl of Clinton," is by far the most powerfully written part of the 1ook, and perhaps the most touching thing Mrs. Daniel has yet written. The various scenes with Maggie, too, are all genuine transcripts from nature. So, no doubt, -re the tea-parties; but the eternal twaddle of a v;' tage, the gossip of the old maids, and the visits u the parson, are not exactly the things with which a three-volume novel, with any pretensions in it, ought to be filled. "Reaping the Whirlwind" is an advance upon "Miriam's Sorrow," which we reviewed some time ago; but, if Mrs. Daniel means to become a real artist, she must broaden her canvas and work for the world at large.

Merry Andrew. By Keble How ard. (John Lane, (is.) Keble Howard runs the risk of writing much and badi}', but so far we are well pleased with an author who furnishes much agreeable distraction. Here he combines criticism with amusement, attacking the low phases of scholasticism and journalism. The hero of this novel will get, and, we admit, deserves, little sympathy. If he had been unlucky enough to inherit money or otherwise had had his path made easy for him, imagination boggles at the possible openings for mischief his lack of wit would have found. As it is, we watch him go from failure to failure, assured that his author will not allow him to take leave of his audience on that note.

"REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS. The Life of the lice. Howland Hill, A.M. thc Keir. Kdwin Sidney, A.M. Hvo. jip. 44-j. Lindon, 1834. Baldwin and Cradock. Or tlie particulars ofthe lilt* of this eccentric luit atilu mid good man, any minutia* would lie the repetition ola ten-times told tale. That lie was ot'the ancient and honoiirahle family of the Hills of Shropshire is known to every one; ami that in his early years a sincere conviction ot'the truth of peculiar religious principles in. (hired him to heconie an itinerant preacher of the Gospel is equally notorious. His studies, his difficulties, and his linn devntedness to white his conscience dictated as the line of his saored duty, form an interesting picture; hut we think we will helter consult the tastes of mir readers in general, if, instead of going thrungli with dates and analysis, we, in this j instance, select a cento from tlie most striking j matters extractable from this very acceptahle volume, and lay these literary, aneuilotieal, and \ mural specimens hefore them, as a fair indica- j timi of its maimer and contents. We begin '? nilli Rii'vlaud's infancy : ? j ?? Once, when yet a child, he was hrought into the room to his father and mother, and their company, when somehody said to him playfully?? Well, Kowly, and what should you like to he?' He looked archly towards his faller, who was sitting in an arm-chair, and ; t*.iid, ? I should like to he a baronet, and sit in a (s'reat chair;' an answer altogether the reverse of his untiring activity in after-life." An anecdote of the celehrated Whitfield is clituai'teri.-tic:? j " .Mr. Whitefield lind so often heen deceived Iv his < recruits,' that he had become very ! ('unions as to receiving them ; and without! lither something striking in their replies to his ' questions, or in their appearance, or a strong; reoimnu'iidation, they were not easily received hy him. His friend Cornelius Winter tells us j that he dismissed a tailor with, * go to rag-fair ] -.nd hay old clothes;' nor did he readily take1 any person into his contidence. The late cele- j hrated Hubert Hall was often obliged to act in j the same way, and once said to a shoemaker,' who would fain have become a minisUT hy his j intlneuce, and urged on him as an argument, J fiiat lie ought not to keep his talents concealed \ inanapkin?* the smallest pocket-handkerchief j )'"U have will do, sir.' I recollect telling this j story to .Mr. Howland Hill, who laughed heartily, and replied. ? I remember when ?-caine to j "ie, and talked about not hiding his talents, I J imld not help telling him, that, for my part, I j **'?*.i'ht the closer he hid them the better.' " ?As Mr. Hill advanced in years his powers; wearne more strongly developed .*?? j '' He w.as, soon alter his ordination, often preaching by dawn of day, and the shades of! evening would close over'him engaged in the. same exercise, at a distance, perhaps, of in.ny "wes from the some of his morning labours', "hen night came, instead of being tired, his sP'fits seemed, to rise to their greatest height, ttiid lie allowctl tlicni lull vent in tim overflow ol his animated conversation. .Alter a dav'.*, exertions, wliicli wimlil liave completely pros. trated the strength of an ordinary mau, he appeared nncoiiscions ol'the slightest fatigue; anil xi-lien supper was at an cud, he liei'iinie unusually communicative anti entertaining, and , i wonhi till ot' his preaching adventures, declare; I the experience ot' his own mind, and enliven; tlie social circle with remarks mitl anecdotes.' given in a manner suth a> those only u hu' knew him in reiiremeiit can imssil.lv conceive ; j j and this, perhaps, aller four sermon** pr. ached! I to assenihlcd thiiii-*uiids, with au energv ol j tiianiiei* iiiid power ol voice of the ii mst t-xtiajordiiiarv nature. Sittliteiily, wlien all iliejiirtv j were raised to the hit/best pitch of intetest, he asked.1- What's o'clock?' anti, finding it was j late, he would -exclaim. ' Dearest me, only 'think of that!?it is time for all .Methodist : preachers to be in hid, I tun sure':' then, after I his night's rest, lu; began the next day with the ; same ardour as ever in the service ol God.'' | *? Sheridan used to say of him, ' I go to hear | Howland Hill because his ideas come red-hot ! from the heart.' Never xv.is there a truer (le; scripiioii of the preaching nf any minister; he spoke as he felt; and the tears lu* shed, ami the smiles that beamed upon his countenance, soon ' wakened up their fellows' ill the listening thrum; that heard him." " Oh another occasion, Dr, Milner, the celebrated dean ol' Carlisle, xvas so xvorked upon, that he went to him anti saitl, * Mr. Hill, .Mr. Hill, I felt to-day?'tis this si.p.dash preaching, say what they will, that does all the good.' " j Among other exclusions he preached for a season in Wales; and his biographer says:? ! ** Nothing nia-.lt' him so angry as the enthusiasm of the jumpers, whom lie called the caricaturists of religion. Once, moved hy the energy of his manner, numbers ol' them rose in the chapel and began to jump; ht* cried j |aloud, * Let us have no mort! ot' this miimmei'v and nonsense.' Notwithstanding this rebuke, las .Mrs. Hill anti he were sitting together in I 'the inn, two men asked to speak to him about j jhis sermon; but on entering the room they I I began to jump like madmen. * If you xviii, j have such nonseii.se, you may have it to your-1 j selves,' he said ipiietly, and retired till the | jumpers went away. He could not endure any I thing bordering on fanaticism," j *' About half au hour before service, lie might be seen watching through a telescope his approaching flock, as they descended into the [valley, and making his remarks, to those near i j him, on the seriousness or levity of their man- | | uer. Sometimes he gave a hint of the latter in j his sermon; and they who were conscious of its ? application wondered hoxv he knew it. Some; of them used to say. * Wu must mind what wei do, for Master Hill knows everv thing, bless him!'" '? The reports that were in circulation of his odd sayings in the pulpit brought not a lew into his chapel, where they heard, instead of ob. servations to excite their mirth, an awakening appeal to sinners, that sent them as trembling and weeping penitents to a throne of grace. .Most ofthe anecdotes told of his eccentricities in the pulpit are incorrect, though it is certain that at times he did illustrate his meaning by introducing into his sermons what he often ac* I . kinmlcilgt'd afterwards he had better have left . ? out: * but,' he would add, ? the queer thought . . c.ime into my head, and out it came, ami I .' coiilil not help it; I wish it had kep* in, ?_ (hough.' It almost always happened, that ; j whenever he h.ul given way to his natural disI; position for the ludicrous, ur had been more j than usually eccentric in his manner, there followed .1 Inline*.*, of spirits; and he then acknot. U-dged the rc-iet lie felt at having been led away by any levity of mind while engaged in the solemn service of the pul).it. A gentlt'iiiin of his Hcijiiauiiance once met him at Bi iulilon. where he beard him preach a sermon, in which lhere was such a mixture of the humorous th.tt the congregation were excited hy it to a considerable degree of laughter. This was full.in cd hy such an awful address to their consciences, and a pathos so deep and inching, that there was scarcely an individual present who did not weep." " .Mr. Hon land Hill was a great observer of the different modes of preaching, and once drew up, in his peculiar style, a string of characteristics of the various kinds of pulpit orators. JI? thus describes them: ? Hold manner, 'i'he man who preaches what he feels without fear or diffidence. ? Self-confident. A man who goes by nobody's judgment hut his own?Hash. A preacher who says what conies uppermost without any consideration. ?. Rant' lliuij. A man that says all that pops in his mind without any connexion.?A'.///. One who pins himself down to think and speak hy rule, without any deiiation. ? Powerful. The man who preaches from the bottom of his heart the truths of the Gospel with energy to the consciences of his hearers. ? Finical. Minces out line words with nothing in them.? Soler. The mau who lulls you fast asleep. ? Elegant. The mau who employs all his brains upon dressing words, without ever aiming at the heart? Conceited. Vainly aims at every thing, and says nothing. ?. Welch manner. A mau that bawls out very good things till he can bawl no longer. ? Methodist. .Splits the heads of his sermons into no many parts, that he almost splits the heads of his hearers.?Affectionate. The happy man who feels for souls tenderly, preaches Christ affectionately, and yearns over souls in the bowels of Jesus Chvht.?Doymatic. A man | who goes hy his own brains, right or wrong.? j Peevish. One who picks into every body's {thoughts, and thinks no one right but himself, i Fanciful. One who, instead of being led by I wisdom, runs after a thousand visionary whimsies and conceits.? Self-important. Thinks nobody like himself. ? Noisy. A loud roar, and nothing in it.? Genteel. The vain fool that is J fond of dressing up words without meaning." ** ile once said of a mau who knew the 'truth, but seemed afraid to preach it in itt fulness. ' He preaches tl e (in-pcl a-, a donkev milllll.ICa a tliistle. very cnuliriif.li/. Ile iou,il not entliire any tl,in*,' like lanitx in a minister.

BETTER DEAD.* This is one of the cleverest skits we havo read for a considerable time. It satirizes in a brief space at once the career in London of the hungry Scot, the blatant aspirations of the self-seeking democrat, tho boredom of celebrities, and the characteristics of certain notables. Its plot is very slight. Andrew Riach, a needy prig from the north comes to London with tho intention " to become private secretary to a member of the cabinet; if time permitted he proposed writing for the press ;" he falls in with the president of the S.D.W.S.P., a "Society for Doing Without Some People," which compasses the extinction of persons condemned by the committee, for their own indisputable advantage. After a series of ironical adventures he is rescued in spite of himself from the consequonces of his actions, and returns to wed the minister's daughter who has always loved him. Occasionally the style reminds us vividly of Mr. Gilbert; let the following passage witness :? " During this period of gloom Classic wrote him frequently long and tender epistles. More strictly the minister wrote them, for ho had the gift of beautiful sentiment in letters which hud boen denied to her. She copied them, however, and signed them, and they were a great consolation. The love of a good girl is a priceless possession, or rather, in this case, of a good minister. So long as you do not know which, it does not make much difference." We are here forcibly reminded of " Engaged.'' Specially telling are the scenes where Andrew declaims his own testimonials in the streets, and where he observes the eccentric and absorbing avocations of Lord Randolph Churchill. Very trenchant too is the episode about Mr. Labouchere. Not least in the scale of excellence is the last?and this is high praise. " Domesticated and repentant he has renounced the devil and her works." We hope to hear more and much of Mr. J. M. Barrie. , * "Better Dead." By J. M. Barrie.

NEW NOVELS. The Dayspring. By William Barry. (Fisher Unwin.) This is a long story of the period of the Commune in Paris, having the following passage from Ruskin, with a verse of the iEneid, for motto:? "The real war in Europe, of which this fighting in Paris is the inauguration, is between these (capitalists) and the workman, such as these havo made him. They have kept him poor, ignorant, and sinful, that they might, without his knowledge, gather for themselves the produce of his toil. At last a dim insight into the fact of this dawns on him, and such as they have made him he meets them, and will meet." There are thirty - seven chapters, and through them all the author maintains the sort of lyrical enthusiasm of romance which one usually associates only with youthful writers. So far, then, it is a living story, and a good one. But it is rich in the sort of faults which go with these merits. It is not very coherent, it is not compactly knit, its interest is not evenly sustained, and its texture is singularly uneven. There are genuinely poetical passages in the book, but its unshapen diffuseness will bore the average practical man more than it interests him. And this is a pity, for there are vivid pictures of deeply interesting historical scenes and events in these pages, and thoughtful generalizations regarding them, which are generally pertinent and worthy of consideration. The hero is a young Irishman of genius, whose personality the author intends to be fascinating. Ile is "wanted" in England for murder, and during all his adventures in Paris, which the story depicts, there hangs over him this cloud of danger and suspicion. The author finds very much in common between the Gallic and the Celtic temperaments, and writes as an enthusiastic lover of Ireland and of France. We do not find his principal character very convincing, but some of the lesser figures in the book are admirable, especially those of the spiritualistic charlatan and the ladies who are his willing dupes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles Dickens. By G. K. Chesterton. (Methuen & Co.) MR. CHESTERTON'S book, which appears in good type with ample margins, is singularly one-sided and irritating, but of value as a critical study of Dickens; for study of the sort has not been made of late years, gossip concerning details of identification in the novels and sentimental laudation of a typical English figure being much preferred by the public. Dickens is a typical English figure, and it is on this side that Mr. Chesterton's study is illuminating. It abounds in side-lights thrown by a somewhat mystical optimism and uproarious spirits on the Gargantuan feast of good humour provided by the master. The real misfortune of the book is that the author seems unable to check his propensity for wild paradox, and cherishes a growing habit of exaggeration, which leads to false emphasis and essentially obscures the issue. Mr. Che'terton's writing resembles the oratory of a street-preacher, who would persuade the crowd to stay by mere verbiage, the cramming of statements into parallel sentences, the use of unexpected adjectives, and an alliteration which is apt to sacrifice truth and logic. Is it necessary to shout in order to be heard, or to be violent to show that you are in earnest ? Our author clearly thinks that exaggeration is a virtue. But when a man is hideously and repeatedly didactio-feels a mission, in fact, to instruct the worldwe think that he might take the trouble to say what he must say in a way less calculated to mislead. We think, too, that he might be liberal enough to state his own views of life and politics without abusing the class and party to which be does not belong. Mr. Chesterton's sallies would be good talk; his divagations might be amusing in debate, but in a book they seem to us otiose, if not intolerable. It is a pity, because Mr. Chesterton is a seer in his way, believing and rejoicing where many poor moderns can only doubt and tremble. Still, in spite of these serious drawbacks, the book has good points of an unusual kind. Everywhere the author shows the courage of his convictions, and he has an acute perception of some of the main merits and defects of Dickens, which have been ignored or slurred over by others. His account of the irritability and restlessness of the novelist is a remarkable piece of insight. It might have been supported by quotation, for did not Dickens write in his letters ? " I shall never rest much while my faculties last, and (if I know myself) have a certain something in me that would still tbe active in rusting and corroding me, if I flattered myself that I was in repose." We should fill pages of this paper if we started out to refute a tenth of the extraordinary positions and statements to be found here, and we see no particular 'reason for following up hints and clues which have much more to do with our author's philosophy of life than with Dickens. We give a specimen of his zeal for parallels. He tells us that " the fighting of Cobbett was happier than the feasting of Walter Pater." This is an ill - considered antithesis, though both nouns begin with the same letter and have the same number of svllables. Cobbett was a born fighter, and combat was his natural element: we have yet to learn that Pater was a born feaster, or, indeed, -a feaster at all. Really, Mr. Chesterton l reminds us of a celebrated Dickensian character who was in the habit of rounding off a sentence with anything that sounded well, without much regard for its meaning. His sweeping generalizations lead him into all sorts of irrelevant questions; he has ,democracy on the brain, and must, of course, explain that it is " not demo'cratic." He sees in Dickens many things that are applicable to his own personality and views. Still, his exposition of Dickens *as democrat-the main purpose of the 4 'book-strikes us as veracious and valuable: "Dickens did not write what the people wanted. Dickens wanted what the people wanted. And with this was connected that other fact which must never be forgotten, and which I have more than once insisted on, that Dickens and his school had a hilarious faith in democracy and thought of the service of it as a sacred priesthood." ' Dickens was in his day the most popular I ;author, but we doubt if " the people " of X the present year of grace has not a higher 1 appreciation of penny stories and other 1 lurid stuff which deals with the supposed c habits, names, and pleasures of the anstocracy. " The people" means several 8 things; in the case of readers of Dickens it e means more often the lower middle classes than those who can afford none of the t ordinary comforts of life-except, possibly, " the halfpenny newspaper, if that is a d -comfort. c t The fantastic side of Dickens has never t miet with such wild laudation. We can n imagine the ghost of the master in the Elysian fields smiling over this praise of Mrs. Nickleby:"If Mrs. Nickleby is a fool, she is one of those fools who are wiser than the world. She stands for a great truth which we must not forget; the truth that experience is not in real life a saddening thing at all. The people who have had misfortunes are generally the people who love to talk about them. Experience is really one of the gaities of old age, one of its dissipations. Mere memory becomes a kind of debauch. Experience may be disheartening to those who are foolish enough to try to co-ordinate it and to draw deductions from it. But to those happy souls, like Mrs. Nickleby, to whom relevancy is nothing, the whole of their past life is like an inexhaustible fairyland." Mr. Chesterton has to meet the criticism that Dickens's splendid and unequalled gallery of comic figures consists of people who simply go on being comic, present us (to use the language of the lower stage which the democracy fosters) with a series of " turns " which delight us, but give no impression of being living characters, cannot be conceived as young, or as dying, or, in fact, as being anything but comic figures. To say that " Dickens's art is like life because, like life, it is irresponsible, because, like life, it is incredible," is unconvincing. The more elaborate excuse proffered for this deficiency is that "Dickens was a mythologist rather than a novelist; he was the last of tfie mythologists, and perhaps the greatest. He did not always manage to make his characters men, but he always managed, at the least, to make them gods. They are creatures like Punch or Father Christmas. They live statically, in a perpetual summer of being themselves. It was not the aim of Dickens to show the effect of time and circumstance upon a character; it was not even his aim 1 to show the effect of a character on time I and circumstance. It is worth remark, in I passing, that whenever he tried to describe change in a character, he made a mess of it, as in the repentance of Dombey or the apparent deterioration of Boffin. It was his aim to show character hung in a kind of happy void, in a world apart from time 1 -yes, and essentially apart from circum- l stance, though the phrase may seem odd in 1 connection with the godlike horse-play of I I Pickwick."' i That Dickens had any such visionary aim t we do not believe, any more than that he e was free from the ordinary desire of any < respectable novelist, which is to show l character against time and circumstance. t 'Pickwick' is picaresque, and differs in r character from the other novels. We r know that Dickens was driven in these a away from what he felt to be reality and justice for his creations by fear of what his I public would think. This was plain il cowardice in one who combined, as Mr. a Chesterton rightly points out, singular e sanity on many points with the wildest 5 extravagance. We note an excellent passage on Dickens's tendency to be theatrical. He was " sensitive, theatrical, amazing, a bit of a dandy, a bit of a buffoon. Nor are such characteristics, whether weak or wild, entirely accidents or externals. He had some false theatrical tendencies integral in his A nature. For instance, he had one most un-u fortunate habit, a habit that often put him in the wrong, even when he happened to be in the right. He had an incurable habit of explaining himself." It is a habit which many reformers of to-day share. We note as fair and not frequently made the admission that Dickens was English in his indifference to foreign art, in his humanitarianism, and, we might add, generally, in his Philistinism. His extraordinary sense of the romance of the streets, the dignity and fantasy underlying common things, could meet with no more fit exponent than Mr. Chesterton, who has more than any one else of our time a similar endowment. But we are inclined to despair when we see how that endowment luxuriates in oddities of every kind, including a great deal of advice. Our author would have us believe seriously that " in the vacillations of Toots, Dickens not only came nearer to the psychology of true love than he ever came elsewhere, but nearer than any one else ever came." He would have us believe, too, that Dickens did universal things in fiction, whereas Thackeray and others did not. These latter were merely occupied, it appears, with " realism, the acute study of intellectual things," which " numerous men in France, Germany, and Italy were doing as well or better than they." Protesting, as we do, against this stupid and stale depreciation of great writers because they are not Dickens, we may point out that there is a " universal " figure (one of the few subjects of the perpetual English jokes which exhilarate the democracy) which Dickens has bungled and Thackeray has done supremely. The Campaigner stands out once for all as the type of the mother-in-law. Dickens has attempted a similar sketch, but it is so feeble that no one speaks of it. We suppose that Mr. Chesterton must continue, like his great exemplar, to work in his wild way, which is the only way for him. He gives us the impression of breakneck speed in writing, and a fluency like that of the popular novelist who believes in words more than anything else. We know that Mr. Chesterton does believe in much else, so that this impression is unfair. But it looks as if he did not take enough trouble with his work, and set out to teach the world with impromptus. He does not believe, at any rate, in the unpopular qualities of conciseness and moderation. Are they qualities worth neglecting ? The educated man has one answer, the street-preacher another. The book includes two portraits of Dickens at different periods, and also an index. It reaches a higher level of accuracy in names than some recent examples, but Mr. Chesterton has made Miss Podsnap into Miss Lammle.

THE DARK ISLAND. By V. Sackville-West. 7s. 6d. (Hogarth Press.) The critic who elects to devote any of his space to the wrapper of the book he is reviewing will almost certainly be labelled " superficial." Yet so often a great deal of thought and care goes into the production of the book wrapper; and when a distinguished artist undertakes the designing of the jacket it may well serve as a statement of the book's significance. Len Lye's cover for Robert Graves's " Good-bye to All That " is one example of the significant book wrapper, and Ben 'Nicholsorn's jacket for " The Dark Island " is another. As soon as the present writer's eye fell on the photo of the gull's wings spread in light against dark, he had a private revelation that there were going to be many things in Miss Sackville-West's novel dear to what the moderns call " the secret heart." And he was not disappointed; certain descriptions, such as those of Port Breton with its wild coast and the hot gorse in the sun, hot and scented, are as exalted as the soaring gull. But the narrative-plot never lives up to the hopes that are raised by Ben Nicholson's end-paper drawing of the Island of Storn. At first the suburban life of the Wilson family seems slightly overdrawn. When Miss Sackville-West, speaking of Mrs. Wilson, writes, " for there are few things that her cheaply cantankerous nature enjoyed more than a good wrangle," one cannot help thinking " cheaply cantankerous" a redundancy. Then the annual holiday takes the Wilsons to the inevitable Port Breton. Shirin Wilson encounters the young Ranger of Storn and they pay a surreptitious visit to Andromeda's Cave complete with iron rings which " tradition says that some old le Breton put there originally to chain up his woman because she'd been unfaithful to him." That is a fair enough promise to the reader that the book is " working up to something," but perhaps it scarcely prepares him for the night when Shirin, now grown to womanhood and married to the Ranger, loses her soul to the accompaniment of a thunderstorm and an off-stage organ playing the " Liebestod." It is true of course that our modern novels suffer from anawmia, and that a touch of " blood and thunder " is all to the good, but blood is an essential ingredient of the medicine, while thunder produced by machinery, however carefully constructed, has not the authentic ring. " The Dark Island " will deservedly find a large public, but it leaves Kenneth Macpherson's " Gaunt Island " as the unchallenged apotheosis of tales (both symbolic and romantic) of island magic. 0.

TlHE first of our bateli of nove'; for the fortnight is the production of Sir Elwar(l B-1lcier, an officer so well knswn for his long anl iLnportant services, andi for his late voyage in the Arctic Seae, that anything fromn hii pen which is at all likely to eml)ody any pDrtion of Ills perso)nal experiences was sure ot-'o a larty wvvlcome.

Renm-mberi:ng this, ve must confcss to a slight feelini of disappointment on colnpleting the p.ru~al of thik novvl. It licks I drain itie interest, it lacks skilful levtlopmnent of the story, and, worse th:n all, it lisplaVs nothing like a good style of ivritinz. It is impossible tu overlook the f.ict that thl ir'rk is intenled to c.':ivey the opinions of its anutior unon ni)'IN2 ni tters pertaining t' " the seruico," alun it is equally clear that many of the incilents I are drnwn from his own persondl experiencein-leed, it the ver confiencenienlt of his rreface, lie declares tLat the story is ` filledl with details of thle tl, u zhuts anl feelings oif huan I' lives which have reaflv existed. lThis renders us, poerhap, more cxacting than usual ill estimating tile result of so much adventure and] SO much experience. W'e cannot peruse the dry sunumarv of Sir El ward 1l;clicr's career, as set forth in the 'Naval D)ictionarvy, without at once percelving that lhis life has he'en a imost eventful i one. lie his not, thi-rfnore, like other novelists, been driven to Ills o"wnl invention entirely for the i p1ot and details of' his story. hle materials I should )lave been abundant and ready to his i lind(], aln] all that remained for him to do was to I selcet with judlgnment and relate with ta~te. Our E disappointment is therefore great at finding in i the work the most flagrant and abindant evi- i (dences of either great want of skill or great i W ant of care. If Sir E. 1Belleher cannet (lo better ' than tllii, novel-writing il evid-Antiv not his r vocation, and lie only supplies an addlitional r instance that some men find it easier to act a (I novel than to write one. I In turning over Captain 'Mavne Reid's pages a we feel as if we are breathing a new atmosphere. t Although lie expressly premises that the work is (I a romance, and that lie hiulself is not the hero c (alluding, we suppose, to sonme absurd report re- ii specting a former production of his pen), and n although the incidents are, for the most part. far p more imp;robable than in Sir E. IBlelher's storry. v still ie leel as if nature had something to do with t the circumstances which are brought round us. c The fact is that in novels we r quire improbable a facts, with probable personages to transact them. t. Tile hero of T1h Q(ladroowl, Edward lRuthierford, c is blown up in a Mississippi steamer, stabbed ni irith a bowie knife, stuig by a rattle-snake, In hsunted by sleuth-houids, anld is ,wi:huin an ace of r leing strung-up by the sentence of Mr. Justice n Lynch-a very suffi lient cathloguc of "lmoving c accidents by flood aud field " f)r one young n gCutleman, it must Le confessed-vot from the p beginning to the end of the story lie neither does nor suffers anything that is not at least possible, and even in the most violent situations the naturalness of the character is preserved throughout. For the story itself, it is placed among the plantations of sunny Louisiana. Rutherford saves from the steamer the young proprietress of a plantation, Eugenie de Besanron, young, pretty, accomplished, and supposed to be rich. Ile, however. falls in love with her slave, Aurore, tIme prettiest quadroon on the shores of the Mississippi. Thle affitirs of Mille. Besancon are, of course, in the hands of a villanous guardian, one Monsieur Gayarre, who is also in love with Aurore. Equally of course, this worthy cheats the fair young slave-owner, and reduces her to loverty. Aurore is put up to auction, and, after a smart competition between Rutherford and Gayarre, she is knocked down to the latter; whereupon the former, not being able to pay a sufficiently high figure for his lovely mistress, concludes to run away with her. Of course there is a flight: the fugitives tracked through a swamp ; one of those exciting pursuits in the description of which Fenimore Cooper so excels; the interest heightened by the sombre figure of a protecting negro, a sort of African Leatheretocking or Pathfinder ; finally, the liscoverv that Gavarre has cheated and forge(d, anI the restitution of Aurore to freedom and Eug:nie to her defrauded rights. iThie scenes of slave life are strongly and vividly drawn ; but the author disclaims any "' intention in writing it. 1" The book (says lie) has been writtrn neither to aid the Abolitionist nor to I lorifv the planter. Tlme author does not believe that by such means lie could benefit the slave, else he would not fear to avow it. On the other haul. hle is too true a Republican to be the instrument that would add one drop to the bad bloodl which, unfortunately for tile cause of human freedom, has already risen between North' and ' South.' " Altogether, we think this is one of time best of Captain Mayne Reid's novels, andl that is no light praise. Spirited, imaginative, eloquent, and always writing like a gentleman, Captain Mayne Reid is the Marryatt of the forest and the prairie. HIelen Linicoln is a story developing no very remarkable power, and yet exhibiting no very great incapacity. An old I)attern worked up in a moleratvl good style. A young husband, in the prime of lite andI the lhevday of wealth, is cut of, and leaves a wife and child to the storms and troubles of the world. The sudden sinking from opulence to poverty, time struggles with the neglect and injustice of the world, the gradual victors over all difficulties, and the final triumph which is the novelist's reward for patient, v.rtucsuch is the plan of I1lh1 Lincoln. Not very new, the reader will say; yet told, we can assure him, with sufficient power to beguile a fevw hours on a weary da(N, -bfilc de Ynicrux. Paulo r jmora canamfWus .' Mr. Reade's novel, with the quaiit anl proverbial title It is Never too Late to M.f d, is not only the best novel which we hlive read this season, but also one of the very few first-rate works of fiction which we have met wvith in our life. Generally speaking, we do not like those novels which are written at a system; tile bias is too predominant. the purpose is too glaring throughout every part of the tale, and prejudice too commonly occupies the place which 8hould be consecrated to the imagination. These drawbacks generally take front party or, more properly, principle-novels all that charm of nature without which the web of fiction becomes (lull and uninteresting. But this is not so with Mr. Reade's novel. it is a principle-novel; it is aimed against a system, and that system one of the most crying evils which afflict mankind and disgrace humanity; it attacks that code of discipline which converts error into crime. crime into madness-which makes pick-pockets burIglars, and burglars murderers-which, under the pretence of philanthropy. inflicts tortures beside which the most cruel refinements of the Inquisition -ere as gentle mercies-whichi treats the criminal as a machine to be systematised, and not as a soul to be saved; it is levelled at the solitary, separate, and silent systemn of treating criminals. It is evident that the atrocities committed at Birminghalm Gaol have supplied Mr. Reade with the text for his sermon. The htorrible revelations which resulted from tile inquiry made into tIme discipline of that Inferno are closely copied throughout-and, in(leed, they I neededl no exaggeration to reach the higlest possible limit of horror. They are copied, we say, incident by incident. The re. fined cruelties of the crank labour, faisely weighted, and taxing human nature beyond all powers of endurance in its fatiguing and monotonous work; the cruel tortures of tbe 'punishment jacket," an instrument which corn bined the iron collar and "the scavengers daughter " of the old torturers; the water dashes over the poor fainting wretch; the salt cramnied! down his parched and burning throat by hand. fuls the dark cells which drive the stoutest iuiad: the degrading whip; the food cut down to starvation point; and lastly, the mental and bodily torture by all these horrible means so accumulated and aggravated that poor, weak, ignorant human nature sees and finds no other escape from its tortures but suicide;-all these things are related by MIr. Reade as taking place in - gaol, under the reign of Governor Hlawes and his familiars, just as credible witnesses proved upon oath before a commission that they took place in Birmingham Gaol under Lieut. Austin and his myrmidons. All this, however. is but ar. episode upon the main story. This is based upon the loves of a stout Berkshire farmer, George Fielding, and his beautiful cousin, Susan Merton. John Meadows, a prosperous and influential yeoman, also loves Susan, andl has resolved to marry her at any cost. Under the cloak of respectabi. litv this fellow hides as black and knavish a heart as ever throbbed in the bosom of the most hardened criminal. He is the perfection of a deep, vulgar, hard-headed. scheming fellow. No knavery is too great f8r him, provided lhe can only keep his respectability. For this purpose hIe seldom acts directly himself, but employs some base tool to work out his schemes. Fielding is so hampered by the intrigues of this fellow that lie emigrates to Australia, bearing with him a promise from old farmer TMerton that if ever he returns with a thousand pounds lie shall marry his daughter. Meadows schemes to turn the girl's heart-proceeds with the cunning of an lago, supseradded to the method of a man of business of the nineteenth century. The scene changes to Australia: Fielding is joined by Tom Robinson, a reclaimed convict; gold is discovure(l: life in the diggin's glows upon the canvass with all the truthfulness of nature; after various success true love is victorious. Fielding, who wins not one thousand pounds but four, returns to imarry his Susan. Meandows is baffled just w hen his hopes for the consummation of his wishes are at their highest: and the drama ends, as all such (Irainas should, happily for those for whom the sympathies of the reader have been enlisted froin the beginning to the end. The gaol scenes are introduced as incidental to the career of Tom Robinson, who is one of the minor heroes of the tale. Of these we have nlready spoken: they are drawn with marvellous fidelity. and fascinate the reader with a horrible interest, which renders it impossible to lay down the volunie until it is concluded. The dry bones of the Birmingham Gaul Rleport are here vivified into a terrible reality. and our sympathies are perpetually awakened as we perceive the truthfulness of the heart-rending narrative. The gaol scenes, too, give occasion for the introduction of a character which we, without hesitation, pronounce to be one of the very best in the whole range of fiction. This is the chaplain of the gaol. Mr. Eden, a man such as there are, we fear, but few in existence-a man whom, if he lived, would be one of those chosen few whom the Almighty sends upon the earth to soften the lot of poor, erring, miserable sinners-one, indeed, of those very few who constitute, as it were, the salt of the human species. It will be almost invariably found that where the novelist introduces a clergyman upon the scene, he falls into citherone or otherof twoerrors-either he represents him in an unfavourable light, as a canting, worldly-minded hypocrite, whose practices are the very reverse of his professions; or else lie makes a saint of him, without one single feature of humanity in hinm, from theqiloria round his head, down to the soles of his martyred feet. Now Mr. Eden is a man-a man of like passions with us all-a man who feels for another, and sympathises with his weakness, because he knows how weak his own heart is. There is a vitality, a reality about this man which is surprising. Ile is as good as gold; but when we have surveyed his character, we do not fold our hands and say complacently that he is an impossibility, but our hearts beat with high hopes, and we ejaculate, '"Ohm, that there were more like him !" 'Ve fear, however, that there are so few men like Mr. I Eden, that he himself is but the creation of the author's fancy. The pendant character of Mr. Lepel, who is intended, by way of contrast, to represent the systematising, so muelh-per-cent. ctass of chaplains,, is probably a portrait; for lie is introduced as " chaplain to one of thle northern anols," and we fancy we can detect the original from whichl he was drawn. The other characters in the novel are sketched with great power and fidelity. George Fielding and Susan Merton. the central figures in the picture, are charming i!' their contrast ; he a manly, real rustic, she a sinple, loving maiden. John Meadows is also a well-drawn ciaracter, the incarnation of selfreliance and trust in money, unbalanced by anyhing like a conscience or real principle. A perfect contrast to this admirable work is ,Suitshiine and Sliadow, by the anonymous author of * Mtabel."Anytlhing more vapid], more pointless,and more unnatural than this composition it would be difficult to conceive. We suppose that it is intended to belong to that class of fictions which are termned faslionable novels, of which Carlyle has said that they, of all the other productions of literature, miost nearly approach absolute fatuity. The characters are fashioned like dolls, gaudily dressed up in the odds and ends of o0d frippery, and they move about with thle painful elaboration of automata. Yet this is nothing but wrhat we expected when, upon opening the book, our eye was greeted with such itames as Fitzosborne, Captain Trelawny, and Lady Lora Vivyan. The (lay for this style of novel is certainly overpast, and we had entertained a hope that the species was nearly if not quite extinct. Adelaide, Qieen of Italy, like 'Mr. Reade's book, is a principle-novel: lmUt it must be confessed that that is its only point of comparison with that admirable production. It is dedicated to the Archduchess Sophia of Russia, and is intended to support the principles of the Concordat lately concluded between the Pope and the Emperor of Austria ; it attacks the memory of those who attempted to curb the power of the Papacy, and wrested from the hands of the Holy Father that temporal sovereignty which, as Mr. Mac Cabe thinks, he righteously possessed. 'Mr. 'Mac Cabe has, of course, the worst possible opinion of those who atteml)t to effect the liberation of Italy, whose efforts lie speaks of as tending " to fIll Italy with confusion, war, and bloodsAeM." This information will be sufficient for readers to read or avoid the work. as their opinions nmay lead them.

The Life of Benvenuto Cellini. Newly Trans- lated into English by John Addington Symonds. 2 vols. (Nimmo.) The autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini has been so long accepted as a classic that we have reason to wonder that it has met with so few translators into English. Really it has only once been translated, by Thomas Nugent in 1771 ; for Roscoe's translation was only a new edition of Nugent, and the changes made were not for the better. Nugent's style is vigorous, and his work is solid; but an extract from his preface may perhaps indicate his attitude towards his author. Nugent gravely writes:? " It would give me some concern were I to incur any censure for having published the translation of a work, in which many actions are related of the author himself or of his contemporaries, which seem to represent mankind in general in a very unfavourable light.I flatter myself that the perusal of this work will be in some measure inducive to the improvement of youth, by contributing to regulate their conduct and manners; it will incite them to give the preference to a mild and gentle behaviour as best calculated to engage and conciliate the affections of mankind." We have travelled a long way since such a lame excuse was needed for reading Cellini's 'Life,' and the apology sufficiently shows the defects of the translation. It is needless to compare Mr. Symonds's work with that of Nugent-Roscoe. The difference is sufficiently seen by comparing the utterance just quoted with Mr. Symonds's statement that the translator of an autobiography " will have done little short of bringing himself for a while into the personality of another." Mr. Symonds has had this aim before him, and has succeeded admirably. He has reproduced the vigorous and idiomatic, yet careless and spontaneous style of his original. As a piece of workmanship Mr. Symonds's translation deserves to rank amongst the best translations in the English language. Indeed, it may be doubted if anything that Mr. Symonds has yet done merits such unqualified praise. He has reproduced a style whose very simplicity constitutes its difficulty, because while it is vivid and forcible it is not precise. He preserves the ease, the flow, and the individuality of Cellini's narrative, while he has scrupulously attended to accuracy and truthfulness. His task seems so easy that it takes a little reflection to perceive its real difficulty. Moreover, Mr. Symonds has been rewarded for the pains which he has taken with what has evidently been a labour of love. His carefulness as a translator has reacted upon his own style, and the introduction to the 'Life' is a better sample of English prose than Mr. Symonds has yet written. He has learnt to curb his too liberal hand, and write with a reserve which rarely characterizes his work. Sometimes, it is true, he slips back to his former self, and calls Cellini a " potent human actuality "; but this is rare. The general tone of his criticism of Cellini is dignified, strong, and true. How much Mr. Symonds has learnt may be seen by contrasting his introductory essay to this volume with his chapter on Cellini in the third volume of 'The Renaissance in Italy.' There he deals with Cellini superficially, regarding him as an Italian of the Renaissance?an abnormal, we are inclined to say an impossible, creature ; here he deals with him as a man, and recognizes the large elements of his manhood in which his real value consists. In fact, Mr. Symonds seems to give us an account of his own progress when he says that Cellini's ' Memoirs' is the first book which a student of the Italian Renaissance should handle in order to obtain a right direction for his more minute researches, and that it is also the last book to which he should return at the close of his exploratory voyages. Mr. Symonds began by regarding Cellini as a phenomenon, and comes back to find him a man. The Italians of the sixteenth century were not exceptional beings. It is doubtful if Cellini's autobiography shows a greater belief in himself than cfo the Acts of Parliament which record how Henry VIII. preserved his self-respect amid his matrimonial perplexities ; nor was the Providence which presided over Cellini's homicides a much more remarkable production of the human mind than that which guided the English king. The supposition that favoured individuals are outside the ordinary laws of society is far from being extraordinary. All that Cellini does is to give the picture of a life that was lived in the most profound belief of the possession of this immunity. Many lives are so lived at all periods, though few have the frankness to confess it. In Cellini's age ard country it was not necessary to be a king or a noble to claim this privilege; it was granted to a man of genius. Now men of genius have a fatal tendency to talk about themselves, and conditions of life and character are recognized when they are talked about. It is a question which deserves more consideration than it has received, whether or no things are prevalent in proportion to the amount of talk there is about them. Cellini, after all, was an infinitely better man than Gil Blas or Barry Lyndon; yet no one feels much shocked at conceiving a state of society in which such men are possible. We even recognize them as types of a character which is always prevalent. Indeed, the chief feature of Cellini is his entire frankness in acting as well as in writing. He took the world as it was, and did not trouble himself with much reflection about it. He followed his own bent; he was absolutely satisfied with himself; he found that, on the whole, success crowned his efforts ; and he was quite convinced that he could do anything which he chose. He had all the qualities of a conceited young man when he first begins his career in life ; but the extraordinary thing is that experience did not diminish them. What Dr. Thompson called the " infallibility of the junior fellow " of his college remained with Cellini to the end of his life; and Cellini's infallibility was not so much in things speculative as in things practical. He felt no doubt about the soundness of his general attitude towards life, and of the moderation and reasonableness of his demands. He only asked to be allowed to do the work which he knew that he could do better than any one else. He only asked that people should get out of his way and leave him alone. If they crossed his path with their contradictions, their intrigues, their rivalries, and such like pettinesses, he was obliged to sweep them away like so many noxious reptiles. He had enough to do in the difficulties of his craft, and in the practical trouble of dealing with patrons who needed humouring and management. If people would put themselves in his way so that he was obliged to draw his dagger, it was entirely their own fault. Really he was the best-natured fellow in the world, and it was bad luck and man's perversity which had won for him the reputation of a bravo. His memoirs seem to be written, so far as they have any purpose, with the purpose of showing what a reasonable and moderate man he was. Now and then he admits that his passion went too far; when he stooped to elaborate revenge he was ashamed of it?when he simply swept a man away he had no sense of any misdoing. It is scarcely fair to say that Cellini's claims were allowed by those in authority, and that he abused the immunity granted to a man of genius. He was often in trouble, often in danger of his life, and he suffered a long period of imprisonment. Yet experience did not shake his self-confidence or teach him to make any smaller demands upon the world. His strength was in his own breast, and he could call tt, his aid the help of religion and look upon himself as a persecuted martyr. He was quite ready to pit himself against law and order and society; for he doubted if society really believed in itself, and ho knew that he believed in himself. Herein lay his strength: he was a resolute man, with a sense of capacity for some definite work. He had an object in life, whereas most people had none. Society was not sure of the principles on which it rested; Benvenuto had no doubt what he wanted to do. He had no time for hair-splitting about morals, or religion, or any outlying topics. It was not his fault if his lot was cast in troubled times; he certainly had no leisure to investigate their problems. He was the plain man who did the work he had to do; he was not free from faults?who is ??but he had nothing to be much ashamed of. So he makes a clean breast of it; and mankind have been grateful to him for his frankness. For he teaches the lesson that if society is not sure of itself, if it does not consciously rest upon a basis of justice, it becomes a prey to adventurers like Benvenuto. If social organization does not by its pressure make men fall into their ranks, the field is open to the resolute spirit. Cellini shows the strength of such a spirit under such circumstances ; he shows how it can form a rule of lifo of its own on the basis of personal dignity?how it can lose all sense of the rights of others, and can pursue its own course undisturbed by remorse and unchecked by hesitancy. Mr. Symonds has seen this, and expresses in his introduction a consciousness of the large elements of humanity in Cellini which has made his criticism luminous. He does not treat Cellini as a braggart, and he defends his truthfulness. His observation of the natural causes which enabled Cellini to see a halo round his head in his shadow, in the mornings when the dew was on the grass, is new and interesting. In fact, all that he says is much to the point, and serves excellently to illustrate the translation which follows. Cellini's life has long been regarded as an amusing record of adventure, or as an instructive picture of life and society in the sixteenth century. Mr. Symonds's translation makes it intelligible as a chapter in the records of human character.

The Santa Lucia enjoyed a peculiar popularity from her niraculous power over the affections of the young; for auy young main who prayed to her for a wife, or any youmg woman who prayed fur a Iiiisblanid, was Sure to receive the object of such prayer; and if the person praying indi. cated to the saint the individual wvished for, the prayer wvould be granted, provided sulch individual was not already marrie(l. It was Inot surprising that a saint with su1lc extraor1dinary powers, touching so) directly the ten. iderest sensibilities, created a sensation in a place where the feelings, or rather the passions, are particularly turned to love. D)onna Bartola invited uts to accompany her, and, setting out, we called upon a friend of hers. During j the whole visit, a servant girl sat with her lap full of tohacro, muaking Ntraw cigars for mime. diate uise. It vas the first time we had smoked with ladies, and, at first, it was rather awk. ward to ask one for a light ; but we were so thoroughly broken in that night that wye never had alny delicacy afterward. The conversation turned. upon the saint and her miraculous powers; and when we avowed ourselves some. wthat sceptical, the servant girl, with that fa. mniliarity, though not avant of respect, which existts throughout Central America, sai(l that it was wicked to doubt; that she had prayed to the saint l~erhelf, and two mouths afterward sile w.as Married, and to the very man sh1e lorayed for, though at the time lie had no idea oft lcr, and, ill tit7 wnted another g Wirl. With this encouragerent, locking the house, anud aceonpanieit by chiildren and servants, we set out to piyv our hoinage to the saint. Tho sonid 4of a violin and the filing of rockets in. d icated the d irection of her temporary donmicil. She had takei uplt her residence in the hut of a po2 ir Indian in the suburbs ; and, for sonio time lefore reachin, it, we encountered crowds of bothi sexes, and all ages and colours, and in every degree of dress and undress, smoking aud talking, aalnd sitting or lying on the grounil in every variety of attitude. Room was made for our liarty, aid we entered the lhut. It vas about twenity feet sIluare, thatched on the top and sides with leaves of Indiani corn, aolil tilled with at dese maTSS of kneeling, men aind woinien. ()n one side was an alt-ir, about f ar feet higlh, covered. with a cleavn white cotton cloth. On the top of the altar wvas a frame, with three elevations, like ai flIwer. stanld, and o01 the top of that a case, containing a lhaule wax dloll, dresfed in blue bilk, and ornamnenited with gold-leaf, spangles, anld artilicial flowers. This was the Santa Lucia. ;Over lier head was a canopy of red cotton I cloth, on which was emblazoned a cross in ,gull. On the right was a sedan chair, trim. ;med with red Cotton auid gihl leaf, being the travellint, eqluipage of the saintt; and near it jlmlre Iniams il dalf sicerdotal dress, on whose |o digers in e travelled ; featoollni of oranges 11X1,g fromn th roio, ntral the ron.mh iosts Were iuiWrappel with leaves of the su1gar-cane. .At the tfot of the altar wais a naat, otn whicit girls abot lios nere pl:tyinu ; and a little fellowy aboutsix years old, hl~aited iii the picturesqlue co(stimUe of a straw hat, and that only, swas coolly surveying the crowvd. The cerollny of praying had already begui, adll tiheII miusic of it ritm1 imi, a violidn, miuid a Itageolet, undler the di. rection of the Inuid ian master of ceremonies, drowned the noise of voices. D4onna hiartola, who was a wvidow, and the other ladies of our party, lell ou their knees; and, recomineuding myself to their prayers, I looked til wi dolitg any tfling for myself, lilt I stuliel , tentively the faces of those around iue I i, were some of both sexes who could n)Ot t be called young, ; hut they did not, on tldetc Cotillt, pray less earnestly.

But the eventual debacle is caused rather by internal dissension than by any of the efforts of Bogdan's enemies. The story is of the Jules Verne type, the author making up in spirit for what he lacks in his knowledge of aeroplaneswhich, truth to tell, is a good deal. Not that that, however, is of any real moment in a book of this description, especially when its author has the narrative ability of Mr. Gaillard. -The Pirates of the Sky," in short, is a rattling good yarn of adventure.

337   6432989   THE DEAN AND HIS DAUGHTER.
Nov 1887  ENGLISH LITERATURE - 19th Century
Time 17 : 35 637 - 637
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE DEAN AND HIS DAUGHTER.* Mr. Phi li rs'first book, ''As in a Looking Glass," was a gallery of graphic studies, of much originality and freshness ; and not only has he not again attained,still lessexceeded, his own original standard, but each of his subsequent works has been worse than its forerunner. Needless to say there is smart writing, especially by way of dialogue, in " The Dean and his Daughter," and the author is never guilty of entering into the petty, tedious details which almost invariably afflict us in modern fiction. The narrative is told in the direct unaffected style of which Mr. Philips is a master, is entirely free from morbid sentimentality, and teaches a bad lesson. But that is all. The motif oi the story, that a woman who, however innocently, has been the object of her husband's suspicions and is then divorced, has no chance of re-entering society, and is practically forced to turn from purity to vice, offers ready to hand all the materials, the pathos and the passion, which a skilful, delicate novelist might have turned to the best account. But Mr. Philips has entirely failed to gain our sympathy for his heroine, whose passion is not there, and the pathos of whose situation almost rejoices us. * " The Dean and his Daughter." By F. C. Philips, author of " As in a Looking Glass," etc. 2nd Edition,, in 1 Vol. London : Ward & Downey, 1887. The dean, who shares with his daughter the honours of the title page, is a well-drawn character, but he is an old friend, and wa cannot advise our readers to spend too much trouble in making his acquaintance. Altogether, this book is not worthy of Mr. Philips, for whom we have formed perhaps too high a standard, but one that we feel, even now, he can, if he will, attain. We have not said that the book is interesting, but it is the case ; it is more than well, if rather hastily written, and when once commenced must be finished before being thrown aside for ever, for it is frivolous, flippant, and some would say immoral.

Apr 1836  ENGLISH LITERATURE - 19th Century|ENGLISH LITERATURE - 18th Century
The Gentleman's Magazine: and historical review, July 1856-May 1868  :  396 - 397
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Margaret Ravenscroft, or Second Love. B1y James A. St. John, 8tc. 3 vols. WE have had occasion more than once to profit by some works of Mr. St. John's composition; and we give him credit for much knowledge, enriched and rectified by observation and travel. Yet we confess we did not expect to find him directing his talents to the formation of fictitious narratives; we rather supposed him employed in duly digesting the quantity of cotton exported by the Pacha of Egypt; or unrolling a papyrus bought at Mr. Salt's sale; or perhaps making an experiment in his own personwas to whether it is possible in our climate to batch eggs as they do in Egypt, by sitting on them oneself in a pair of warm, soft, feather-breeches. However, tired, we presume, like other people, of the realities of life, he has amused his leisure by indulging in the fictitious creations of his own fancy; -a custom also of our own: but as our thoughts on these subjects are apt to run in a particular channel, we shall beg leave, with permission of the kind public, to keep them to ourselves. The merit of this novel assuredly is not in the growing interest which the plot excites; it is not in any delicate discrimation of character; it is not in any finely complicated train of iDcidents; it is not in any happy novelty of invention; but it must be found in the separate parts, in the individual scenes. There is much pleasing observation; much elegant description; much eloquent and animated dialogue; much that shows a cultivated taste, and a mind stored with information. Speaking honestly, and therefore not according to our wicked craft, there are also many parts of the narrative that we cannot approve: as the whole character of Margaret is to us excessively displeasing; her character inspires no respect; her history is painful; her passions degrading; her end most distressing. Mrs. Bailey is perfectlv hateful. Samber perhaps is the most interesting person: for the qua. lities he is described as possessing, must always interest; but his unnecessary gabble of Anglo-Tedesco is a great bore, and not sufficiently repaid by the humour of the mistakes which his ignorance of a language occasions. The murder of the poor Jew is gratuitous and ruffian-like cruelty. If you must have murders, have them in Mrs. Radcliffe's grand style, or not at all: as for the Zingara, we have had too much of such characters-they are quite out of nature-a fine and bold creation of fancies once-sed repetita displicet. Without other exceptions, there is something too bizarre, too untrue about them, to please. When first introduced into our fictitious personae, the mystery through which they appeared, struck the mind. There was a false grandeur about them,still it was grand: but they should not be too fully revealed, too often seen, too closely approached: it is only in the hand of a most practised writer and a man of genius, that such creations can hope to be successful. We dare say by this time Mr. St. John has formed a very low opinion of our critical judgment; n'importe, we must go to the end of our stage, snarling and growling, as we generally do: so then we shall, in conclusion, observe, that we disapprove in toto of Montague's most unnatural, unmanly, and unchristian conduct after Margaret's death. Is that the lesson which these histories of life are to teach ?Is that the duty they are to inculcate ? -Is that the true portrait of moral wisdom they are to mirror to the inexperienced mind?-Is there real affection, real virtue, real wisdom, in this life of perpetual and unavailing sorrow ?-Is it not selfish, contemptible, and wicked ? It is not agreeable to our nature, our affections, our passions; it is not consistent with our duty, with the purposes of our life. Where it exists, it is from some morbid and vitiated state of the mind; and in Margaret's character, there certainly was nothing to demand such a tremendous sacrifice, as a life of perpetual sorrow, and therefore of sin. Mr. St. John may be sure that his moral is wrong; and it is just that which the majority of his readers or readeresses (for we suppose nine-tenths of novel readers are females) may mistake for what is right. The lover or husband most truly honours his mistress or his wife's memory, and most sincerely shows his affection, 'who drops some natural tears '-but who also 'wipes them soon;' who takes one farewell look at the grave that holds all he once cherished, and then with manly resolution and Christian resignation, turns away to re-occupy his station, re-assert his rights, advance his fortune, and fulfil his duties in the world. If novels teach any other moral than this, let them be condemned: An vitii* carentem ludit imago Vana, quz porta fugiens eburn& Somnium ducit?

From Memoirs of the Marquise de la Rochejaquelein (Routledge). HENRI Do LA ROCHKJAQUELEINFrom the portrait by G. T. Guerin. Mus6e de Cholet. MEMOIRS OF THE MARQUISE DE LA ROCHEJAQUELEIN. Edited with an Introduction and Notes bv Cecil Biggane. I5s. (Routledge.) The writer of these Memoirs, Marie-Louise-Victoire de Donniesan, married the Marquis de Lescure on October 27th, 1791, when the King and Queen of France were already virtually prisoners of the Republicans. At the time of her marriage, the Marquise de Lescure was nineteen years of age. The February after the wedding the newly-married From On Ancient Central-Asian Tracks By Sir Aurel Stein (.Mlacmillan). Rows OF SMALL BUDDHIST CAVE-TEMPLEs. (Seen from the shrine of a colossal Buddha, In Southern group of Thousand Buddhas' site, Tun-Huang.) couple went to Paris, and the descriptions of the scenes they witnessed in the city are real and vivid. After a perilous six months in Paris the Marquis and his wife sought safety in flight, and after very considerable difficulties graphically described, they managed to escape to the district of La Vendee. The remainder of the present edition of the Memoirs is almost entirely devoted to an account of the struggles which took place between the Vendeans and the Republicans, during which the Marquis de Lescure was killed. Subsequently in 1802 the widow married her husband's former friend, Louis Marquis de la Rochejaquelein, who had himself taken a prominent part in the Vendean insurrection. This narrative of the guerrilla warfare in La Vendee has for many years been one of the main sources of information about the period of history it describes, and the Memoirs are quite sufficiently detailed, accurate and even lively, to deserve and repay the attention of the historian. Nevertheless certain allowances must be made for the naturally partisan feelings shown by the writer, who represents the aristocratic leaders of the Vendeans as almost too epically heroic and chivalrous when opposed to the brutalities of the vile and cowardly Republicans. Towards the rank and file of her own partisans the Marquise has the detached attitude of one firmly convinced of the superiority of the aristocracy and their differentiat; 2n almost by kind from the peasants. The Memoirs are perhaps inclined to be diffuse and patternless, but in this they correspond to the Vendean insurrection. In this excellently translated and abridged edition the narrative is always entertaining, and at times contains highly moving passages, as when the Marquise describes the crossing of the Loire, the death of her husband or the hardships which ended in the deaths of her children. Whatever faults the Republicans had to charge against the Marquise-and she was later exiled in Spain-no one could accuse either herself or her friends of wanting courage and the spirit of endurance. Many of the trials she underwent would have broken the spirit of a woman less conscious of the obligations required of her by her birth. Her Memoirs, which Napoleon left in his carriage after the Battle of Waterloo, were appropriate for such a moment of misfortune. G. W. R.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sir Jasper's Tenant. By the Author of 'Lady Audley's Secret.' 3 vols. (Maxwell & Co.) Miss Braddon tells her new tale of to-day as brightly and blithely as if she had just opened her budget. Her stories are always spirited and well constructed, easy to read, and the reader's interest in the characters is well sustained. There is a general resemblance in the structure of her plots, but the dresses and decorations are fresh, and there is considerable variety in the subordinate personages, who are always vivid and characteristic. The heroes and heroines liave to carry so much additional weight in tho shape of cardinal virtues that they have a family likeness to each other, but they are drawn with a kindly touch of sympathetic human feeling, feeling which keeps up the reader's interest in their welfare, and is one main element in Miss Braddon's popularity. The conversations in Miss Braddon's novels are always good and characteristic,?people say exactly what they would be likely to say on the occasion; their peculiarities are rendered with a free touch and a sleight of hand which attests power to catch a likeness. The "makeup" of ner characters is always good, with just enough stage effect to make it tefl. Her powers of observation and natural selection are remarkable. She describes what she has seen with spirit, and puts speeches which she has, no doubt, really heard, into the mouths of her characters; and a little judicious reality is better than invention. The brewer's clerk, Henry Adolphus Dobb, in 'Sir Jasper's Tenant,' and the social evenings at Amanda Villas, on the "Yorkshire principle," are clever; but they are kept in strict proportion, and not allowed to become too long or too loud. Mr. Dobb, the frequenter of music-halls and theatres, who " believed in himself implicitly as an amateur Charles Mathews," and with whom "there was no question however serious for which he could find any language but slang," is the type of a class; and the "attitude-striking, cellar-flap breakdown dancing of the vivacious Dobb " is amusing, though we are inclined to doubt the praises bestowed upon him as a good man of business. Gervoise Catheron, the brokendown scamp of ancient family, "descended from Edward the Confessor," sub-lieutenant of Marines, dazzling the unfortunate Dobb with the glamour of being an officer and gentleman, borrowing his money, leading him into dissipation, and initiating him into the mysteries of the betting-comer, until he well-nigh comes to grief, is a true version of a very old stoiy, whilst the little touches of natural feeling make the reader feel sympathy with the vagabond, worthless as he is, and criminal as he becomes. Miss Braddon excels in scene-painting; with a few words, or a judicious epithet, she can put a place or a person bodily before the reader, without the weariness of a long descriptive catalogue of the items which go to make it up. George Pouncefort's arrival at the Hermitage, and his first evening alone there, is a case in point. The visit to the Abbey, when Mr. Pouncefort goes through the rooms with the housekeeper, is very cleverly managed; the antecedent family story is told; and,without any laboured description, the reader is made at home in the Abbey, and can realize it without the least difficulty. Miss Braddon's stories are plays, and her characters create their own parts. Sir Jasper Denison, with his " favourite Ettys," is very clever; Maria Denison is an excellent young woman; Mrs. Harding, the soi-disant "widow," seen by the aid of her "green moire," "Caboche emeralds," and "pelerine of old point lace," is a siren irresistible to elderly gentlemen with an eye for form and colouring. The Baronet's enslavement was inevitable. As for George Pouncefort, the hero, he is by no means a bore, though he is as melancholy and mysterious as that dismal gentleman known as " The Stranger." He has had cruel griefs, but he made the worse of them for himself; he had married, when little more than a boy, a beautiful, worthless woman, who eventually eloped from him with an old lover. This was a very bad business; but Mr. George Pouncefort threw up all his life, to pursue the faithless woman and her lover for two years without success. When he became unexpectedly the head of the family, coming into an inheritance of many thousands a year, and the representative of an old and honourable name, instead of doing the one thing that would have set him free, i. e. applying for a divorce, he prefers to change his name and become a wanderer in Central Africa and other outlying regions, paying his worthless wife a handsome income to keep out of England and live under some other name. He deliberately sacrifices the greater to the less, or rather he is so self-concentrated that he can see nothing greater than his own personal feelings. He prefers to sacrifice all the duties of his position and fortune rather than confess that he has made a mistake. He blinds himself by the fancy that he wishes to preserve his real name from dishonour. The result is, that a great deal of misery ensues, and much mischief. He is the victim of an audacious fraud, which nearly causes the ruin of Sir Jasper and the life-long misery of his daughter. That all ends well at last,?that Sir Jasper's tenant is able to baffle Mrs. Harding's "little game,"? is satisfactory to the reader who has been interested in the story, and who wishes well to him and Marcia; but it is none the less true that all his martyrdom has been self-inflicted and prolonged folly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA* This book is a perfect, clear bubble of genius. Bright and rare, it floats away on its own, lighter than reality though the mirror of it, a thing of sheer loveliness. It begins with an earthquake in Jamaica and nothing quite like that earthquake has ever been written; perhaps because never before (so far as we are aware) has an earthquake been really told through children's eyes. The children in this particular instance are those of the BsThorntons, an English family having business on the island. It was a stroke of superb daring to begin such a tale with Mr. Richard Hughe.. Author of " A High Wind in Jamnaica " (Chatto & Windus) an earthquake-how, one wonders, having read it, can the interest possibly be maintained without a sense of anticlimax ? But it is maintained, and easily. The Thorntons decide that the children must go to England to school; and most of the rest of the book is occupied with the amazing voyage upon which they are all unexpectedly thrust. They have not gone far when the ship is ransacked by a pirate schooner-ae of the last, in Queen Victoria's reign, to sail the Caribbean Seas. Thence the tale is one of life aboard a pirate vessel; with this difference from all other such tales, that never before were pirates so real and never before were we shown them from the queer particular angle of vision that is a child's. After sundry adventures the children a r r i v e in England and then the book enters upon its last phase; possessed of this extraordinary pack of half-digested experiences, they enter for the first time into the sophisticated life of England. What is vital in Mr. Hughes's novel however is never the separate incidents; what survives, over and above the delight of the actual story, is the feeling that thus does all life, in the end, maul the single simplicity of youth, and brush away the bloom, and bring it at last (with only this precious core of unsharable adventure to remind it) into the market-place of latter life. The whole story is told with perfect objectivity-save for the author's occasional intrusion of some little piece of unnecessary child-psychology. RoBlM HEY.

LITERATURE. Memories and Portraits. By R. L. Stevenson. (Chatto & Windus.) Mb. Stevenson has collected into a Httle volume some sixteen essays, many of which, he tells us, have appeared already in various publications; but, to the present reviewer, they are most ol them new discoveries, and he must ask the reader's indulgence if he calls his attention to what is already familiar. The first essay is on "The Foreigner at Home," by which is meant especially the Scotchman in England. Both the scenery and the manners of the English are strange, it appears, to Scotch immigrants; and to neither do they, even in a life-time, wholly reconcile themselves. Mr. Stevenson describes in several charming pages a Scotch boy's first impressions of English scenery. "The change from a hilly to a level country Rtrikes him with delighted wonder. Along the flat horizon there arise the frequent venerable towers of churches. He sees at the end of airy vistas the revolution of the windmill sails. There are, iudeed, few merrier spectacles than that of many windmills bickering together in a fresh breeze over a woody country; their halting alacrity of movement, their pleasant business, making bread all day with uncouth gesticulations, their air, gigantically human, as of a creature half alive, put a spirit of romance into the tamest landscape. When the Scotch child sees them first, he falls immediately in love; and from that time forward windmills keep turning in his dreams." When he comes to describe the Scotchman's impression of English manners, the English reader will be less pleased with Mr. Stevenson and with himself. With much of his indictment of us there is no disagreeing. There is no doubt that the average of education is far higher in Scotland than in England. The English peasant is undoubtedly "sunk in matter." He has no metaphysical leanings, and little interest in his ancestors. But charges follow which will be read with some dismay. We are, it seems, as a nation, reserved; our speech too often lacking in generous ardour; the better part of us withheld from the social commerce, end the contact of mind with mind evaded as with terror, ow, granting that the English have a 1 perhaps unworthy) delight and capacity for >mall jests, which is not shared by their lorthern brethren, this does not make them ny the less ready to declare their whole mind -hen occasion serves; and, surely to pit the nglish against the Scotch for characteristic loofness is to invert the common experience f mankind. The ordinary Englishman quite 'ecognises the readily expansive type of Scotchman whom Mr. Stevenson describes; ut he knows also that there is another type, quite as widely disseminated in Eo gland, with as remarkable powers of contraction. Certainly in Oxford, if a reviewer may put his own university experiences against those of his author, while there were several brilliant specimens of the cordial Scotchman, reserve was inferred to be a North British attribute. Far more satisfactory, however, than any disquisition on national characteristics, which cannot fail to be overcoloured by personal experiences, are the essays which deal professedly with Mr. Stevenson's own recollections?his memories and confessions. There are, first of all, a series of papers on his college life at Edinburgh, with memories (rather than portraits, say some) of certain contemporary students and professors; an unflattering analysis of a spirit which in those days drove him among the tombs ; and the story of a short-lived college magazine. Then come two sketches of two old friends?a gardener and a shepherd? who may not have been such delightful people to know as they are to read about; and tben recollections of his father and a clerical grandfather. This biographical and autobiographical work is of course beyond criticism ; it is also beyond praise. There remain certain essays, on talking, on the character of dog?, on the juvenile drama, on romance. They are all well written and sparkling, and all very readable, except, perhaps, the first essay on talking. Of the essay on romance we shall have a word to say presently. Meanwhile there is one piece of autobiography to which special notice should be drawn in a literary journal. In his essay on "A College Magazine" Mr. Stevenson lets us into the secret, much as the conjurors do, of how he learned to write. HiB method was twofold. In the first place, he was ever practising description: '' As I walked, my mind was busy titting what I saw with appropriate words. When I sit by the roadside I would either read, or a pencil and a penny version-book would be in my hand, to note down the features of the scene or commemorate some halting stanzas. . . . And yet this was not the most efficient part of my training. . . . There was perhaps more profit, as there was certainly more effort, in my secret labours at home. Whenever I read a book or a passage that particularly released me, in which a thing was said or an effect rendered with propriety, in which there was either some conspicuous force or some happy distinction in the style, I must sit down at once and set myself to ape that quality." In regard to the first part of this method, the reader may remember that on the solitary occasion when the Laureate broke through his admirable reserve, and condescended to explain how he worked, he confessed to the same practice of photographing scenery, as he called it. Probably all capable artists have been in the habit, with more or less intention, of doing the same; though they may not, like Scott and Mr. Stevenson, have carried a notebook for the purpose. In the other branch Mr. Stevenson is probably an originator. The result of this indefatigable imitation has probably been, as Mr. Stevenson himself points out, that great variety of turns of phrase by which his style is distinguished; another is as certainly his very large vocabulary ; but is not a third result a certain want of repose, a touch of the modem malady of self-conscious- ness, the suggestion of an audience, which haunts Mr. Stevenson's essay writing, and is only banished when he is well on the warpath ? In the critical essays with which the volume concludes Mr. Stevenson contrives to say a number of good things. " That heat and height of sane emotion which we agree to call by the name of poetry" seems to me, notwithstanding the alliteration, to be one of them; "the obvious is not of necessity thu normal " is another; " Drama is the poetry of conduct, romance the poetry of circumstance," is a third. Indeed, the whole section which opens with this last aphorism is so happy (except for one barbarous hybrid), that space must be found for some of it: " The pleasure that we take in life is of two sorts?the active and the passive. Now we are conscious of a great command over our destiny ; anon we are lifted up by circumstance, as by a breaking wave, and dashed we know not how into the future. Now we are pleased by our conduct, anon only pleased by our surroundings. It would be hard to say which of these modes of satisfaction is the more effective, but the latter is surely the more constant. Conduct is three parts of life, they sty. but I think they put it high. There is a vast deal in life and letters wbich is not immoral, but simply a-moral; which either does not regard the human will at ali, or deals with it in obvious and healthy relations ; where the interest turns, not upon what a man shall choose to do, but on how he manages to do it; not on the passionate slips and hesitations of the conscience, but on the problems of tha body and of the practical intelligence, in clean, open-air adventure, the shock of arm? or the diplomacy of life. With such material as this it is impossible to build a play, for the serious theatre exists solely on moral grounds, and is a standing proof of the dissemination ot the human conscience. But it is possible to build, upon this ground, the most joyous of verses and the most lively, beautiful and buoyant tales." The essay in which this passage occurs?" A Gossip on Romance "?is all through up to Mr. Stevenson's high-water mark of essay writing. Much of it is excellent criticism; and a good deal that is too much coloured by personal habits and preference to be good criticism is most interesting as autobiography. And this leads to a remark about a habit which Mr. Stevenson shares with one who cast over him, as he confesses, " a passing spell"?Mr. Ruskin. He is too much given to hasty generalisation, especially from his own particular. To appreciate this in Mr. Ruskin's case you have only to open a " textbook" in which dogmas chosen from his writings are arranged for all the days of the year. Each contains the kernel of existence for everybody, the root of the whole matter, the " one thing needful" ; and yet strangely enough, and distractingly enough for him who would frame his life by them, all are different. Mr. Stevenson is less given to formulating the whole duty of man, so that he may escape the fortune of a textbook, but he is scarcely less fond of universal propositions. For instance, "It is not character but incident that woos us out of our reserve " (p. 258). Is it? or is it always, and for all men ? Surely there are people, and they no fools, who find Robinson Crusoe insipid and " Hamlet" engrossing. Or again, " And this is the particular crown and triumph of the artist?not to be true merely, but to be lovable; not simply to convince, but to enchant." Mr. Stevenson develops this univenal from the statement a moment before that he is in love with Dumas's D'Artagnan. Not to end with fault-finding, the reader's attention should be called, in conclusion, to the last paper in the book, entitled "A Humble Remonstrance," and particularly to pp. 283-5. The unphUosophical reader may be puzzled by the use of the word "life" without warning in a disparaging sense, and by an absurd misprint of " discreet" for "discrete"; but these pases are well worth reading carefully.

The Poacher's Wife. By Eden Phill- I Potts. (MNethuen & Co.) MR. PHILUPOTrS has at the back of his temperament a slight weakness for melodrama, which he rectifies in his more considerable books. Now and again, however, he gives way to it ; he indulges himself. In this book he undoubtedly does so. Its opening is characteristic and promising, for it is a conversation in an inn between several countrymen concerning the waywardness of the gamekeeper's son. We are on tiptoe just here, and anxious to see over the hedges. Unfortunately the accustomed eye presently singles out the villain, and after that we are in no doubt as to what must happen; for the villain is a rejected lover of the hero's affianced wife, and the hero is a poacher. From these premises we expect a development in violence, and murder, and wrongful arrest, and we get all in due course. M1r. Phillpotts is, however, not content with his melodrama as it stands: he drafts away his hero to the West Indies, where he has exciting experiences in rescuing his young master from the wicked plots of Obi men; and he returns with a black face as that master's negro servant, and so lives in the Devon household unrecognized by his former acquaintances. This smacks of the old Adelphi stage. We can heartily commend, as usual, the portraits of the Devon people, and of those moormen whom Mr. Phillpotts loves, and whom he has made familiar to us. I

Legends of Number Nip. By Mark Lemon. Illustrated by Charles Keene. (Macmillan & Co.) Old playgoers will recollect how, in the early days of the first of the clever family of mimes, the Paynes, a piece, founded on the famous 'Rube Zahl,' was produced, and had a long run at Covent Garden. What the stage then effected for the " turnip numberer," Mr. Lemon has now done through this very pretty and pleasant book. He has placed ' Rube Zahl,' or ' Number Nip,' in the most attractive form possible before the public. Mr. Lemon has not translated the legends traditionally related by Musajus, but has compiled them " from a translation of Musa-us' works, published in London shortly after his death. The translator introduced much that was extraneous, and more that was objectionable. These errors have been carefully avoided in the present volume." Such work may appear humble, but it really is not so. Its usefulness cannot be disputed ; and there is no want of dignity in the labour which is directed towards dividing what is hurtful to young minds from that which affords them a hearty and refined amusement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MOORDIUS & CO.* Mr. Locke has made a change of late years in the heroines of his fiction. While the middle-aged quixote still plays the beau rage in his plot, while he is still faithful to the shy, nervous recluse plunged into responsibilities and adventures not of his making, the novelist's chief feminine characters grow perceptibly y-ounger. Replacing the woman of opulent charms, well into the " thirties," we have the girl of to-day, fearless, independent, self-willed, resolved to shape her own destiny in her own way, and impatient of any sort of external control. The change is not confined to Mr. Locke, of course; lie only shares a post-war tendency noticeable in many of our romancers, especially those writing for the stage. The jeune fille has come into her own again-a very different jeune fille, to be sure, from her insipid predecessor of Thackeray's and Dickens's days-and your femmue di, treite ains is taking a back seat; in this disillusioned age it is the promise and confidence of youth which absorb our interest. It is well then that a storyteller of Mr. Locke's discernment and tolerance should make his contribution to our understanding of our young folk, more particularly of the modern girl, claiming so much wider a kingdom than her mother ever dared to contemplate in her most reckless day-dreams, asserting her right to all the freedom of speech and thought and movement, of sport and pleasure and experience * " Moordius & Co." By William J. Locke. 75. 6d. (Bodley Head.) Frome a drawiing by WALTER TITTLE. aw? NwfG& which was once the prerogative of a single sex. His latest heroine, Suzanne Chastel, an heiress of mixed French and English parentage-true daughter of the Enlenlewho with a fortune at her disposal is free to travel the wide world over and in her enthusiastic wilfulness mistakes evil for good, and barely escapes marrying a financial adventurer almost fiendish in his cunning and cruelty. is one of the happiest studies of twentieth century girlhood we have had from Mr. Locke's pen. Not that he has set himself in " Moordius & Co." any very serious psychological task; Suzanne's delightful portrait comes in by the way. He is out in his new tale to provide thrills and tense scenes of drama, to weave a complicated plot opening up possibilities of danger for his heroine, to invent a villain of piquantly unpleasant type. Hence while his Suzanne with her sunny heart, her unflinching loyalty, her impatience of advice, is as modern as you please, his technique is as old as that of the " Woman in White," and adopts all the time-honoured expedients of a will with eccentric provisions and the guardian and ward mnotif, Suzanne is left by a grim old uncle a quarter of a million of money to be hers when she is twenty-five on condition that she lives alternately for periods of six months, until she reaches that age, with two guardians-one, Timothy Swayne, an unassuming self-effacing widower, accountant by profession: the other Peter Moordius, a banker with a reputation for gambling. She is not to marry without the approval of both her guardians, and not to marry one guardian without the written consent of the other. Timothy falls in love with Suzanne, she with Moordius, and Moordius's supposed and sulppressed daughter, Valerie, with Timothy (Mr. Locke delights in these games of love at cross purposes), and it is the wretched Timothy's fate not only to watch his ward succumbing to the fascinations of his fellow-trustee but to discover by degrees that this Moordius, become his partner in business as well in the trust affecting the heroine, is a mad gambler only pretending love in order to annex the girl's fortune, as well as a sensualist whose fiercest appetite is an instinct for cruelty. Meantime, of course, he is quite uuable to convince Suzanne as to the correctness of his reading of the character of her lover, and only provokes her anger when he ventures on a warning. How out of such a seeming impasse Mr. Locke works a happy ending, as of course he does, his readers will doubtless prefer to discover for themselves. F. G. BETTANY.

NOVEL NOTES. MRe. BAILEY-MAR'TIIN. By Percy White. Heinemainn. When Mr. Bailey-Martin wrote his autobiography, someone, his candid sister Florence, perhaps, must have hypnotised him into telling the truth. He professes a great regard for truth, and would certainly have given some such account in talking to himself. But, in spite of moral obtuseness, he would, in speaking aloud, have made some slight modification of the facts and reflections, by way, for instance, of not outdoing Rousseau in the nakedness of his confessions. This is hardly offered as a criticism. You need no more than a slight suggestion of outside and truth-compelling influence acting on the hero to grasp the situation with ease, and to begin the enjoyment of one of the cleverest novels that we have seen for many a day. " Mr. Percival Bailey.\lartin, a hyphenated aristocrat and an ex-member of Parlianent," was born in the neighbourhood of his father's shop in a by-street near Charing Cross. The shop soon after blossomed into "1 The Amalgamated Oloptic Stores," and the family migrated to Surbiton, and fought for a place among suburban aristocrats. At Bland's, where he was sent to associate with the sons of the gentry and nobility, in preparation for the Church, he unlearnt-after threats of a kicking -the plebeian and suburban vice of bragging, and made the early philosophic reflection that " to get on in life, not too much swagger, but just swagger enough, is most needed "%X hich reminds one of the late Master of Balliol's advice, " It is a good thing to be a pushing young man, Mr. , but it is not a good thing to be thought a pushing young man." M11r. Bailey-Martin's after-career was worthy of this precocious feat of worldly wisdom. If he fawned, he was also perfectly aware of the advantage of seeming to have an independent temper of his own. It is not the study of a snob Mr. WVhite has given us, but rather the development of a snob. Now, it would be a sad thing were all the snobbery in England to mean moral degradation of this kind. It does not, for many of the folk who read with avidity the biographies of peers' babies, and scheme for introduction into ii good houses," have saving graces. They are honest, kindly folks, some of them, with only a little mental obliquity. But it may also be a symptom of a disease that has captured the system, and then we have a Bailey-Martin, who escapes from the safeguards that even snobbery puts on conduct, and to whom 1o meanness and cruelty are too despicable. But he is a perfectly natural person; it would be difficult to point to a passage where Mr. White has really exaggerated. He has not made his snob too stupid. Your man of the world mustn't be stupid. He must pick things up, and Mr. Bailey-Martin did so, at Bland's, at his public school, at Oxford, at the Bar, at the Celibate, at the Scalp Hunters. No saintly devotee ever took more interest in her progress from earth to heaven than he did in his from suburbanism to the tone of the peerage, and he is patronisingly grateful to the Scalp Hunters, a Bohemian club, because it taught him to unbend. Eminently adaptable, infinitely audacious, sublimely impudent, he can talk unwholesome philosophy with Lady Gertrude, turn his one interview with his noble father-in-law, in which he was all but kicked, into a graceful newspaper paragraph of great benefit to himself, and win over the pious electors of Dich-ster by magic-lantern lectures on the Holy Land. But he is no Uriah Heep. He will always play a bold game; and when after his poor wife's death society cuts him, he takes a proud and spirited stand, which was not the least politic thing he could do. At the end he has Mimi and her villa at Cannes, and the supreme comfort of absolute freedom from remorse. Among the characters of the book there is not a failure; all the Bailey-Martins are good; Lord Righton is excellent, and so are the members of his highly disagreeable family. Such satire is worth writing. It is not flogging dead follies or obscure follies, but follies that are only too familiar. Take away from the average man a little of his affections, and all his responsibilities; add some impudence, and the production of a Bailey-Martin is highly probable. We congratulate 'Mr. White on the vigour, and the vitality ot his novel.

VOTAGES ANM TRAVZLS. A Tour through the Valley of the Meeuse; ? ith thd Legendv. of the W"alloon Country and the Ardenne-. By I)UDLEY COSTELLO. London, 1815. Chapman anu Hall. STEAM on the ocean and steam on the land will, in twenty. four hours, convey the smoke-dried inhabitant of the metropolis of the world to the fine old Flemish city of Liege. Having peeped into the Cathedral, visited the market at day-dawn, sauntered in the Boulevards, greeted the statue of GRETRY, and surveyed the museum, the traveller usually speeds to the train and whizzes away to Aix or to Cologne, anxious to find himself among the scenery of the Rhine, so famous in song and storybeautiful, certainly, but by no means equal to its fame. The summer tourist, seeking a track not trodden by everybody, will feel himself indebted to Mr. COSTZLLO for having discovered a new one, easily accessible, abounding in beauty, uninfested with travellers, who pass it by in happy unconsciousness that they are leaving behind them a district as picturesque as any in Europe north of Switzerland. Instead of hurrying onward to the Rhine upon the railroad, Mr. CosTELLO advises that it be reached by another route which he has explored, and which is the theme of the very agreeable volume before us. As he stands upon the bridge at Litge the visitor sees before him a valley extending between the hills that rise crowned with wood and dotted with villas on either hand. That is the commencement of the valley of the Meuse. From the neighbour-. hood of this bridge departs (daily we believe) a steamer for Namur. There is a choice between that and a highway on th. banks, or he may change from one to the other as his mind inclines him. But whether he prefer steamer, carriage, or his own sturdy legs, the tourist must not omit to step aside from the main route to visit the caverns of Han-sur Lesse and the Abbey of St. Hubert, in the Ardennes. Having seen the wonders of the one and the beauties of the other, he returns again to the river, passes through Arlon and Luxembourg to the city of Treves, which has recently attracted the notice of Europe by the strange spectacle it has exhibited of a pilgrim. age in the nineteenth century, undertaken by hundreds of thousands of persons ti the shrine that boasts the possession of the Holy Coat. Trevcs lies on the banks of the Moselle, and having satiated curiobity there, the traveller will find another steamer ready to convey him down the Moselle to the I Rhine, which he enters at Cobhlenz. Thus it appears that by the route described by MNr.

His tour is amnpli- 5 fied by devices familiar to book-makers. No small part of it a is compilation.

'T'his manner of writing a tour adds more to its bulk di than to its value; a g'uide-bajk, a gossiping guide, and some I acqiuaintance wi ti!, the I t, rature of the land explored, are all a that is needtul for lprodtlillmg aitv number of pages the publisher a) mnay deem tdcir'sle. c Mr. ('teFE1.I.O has used his privilhge to is the fullest extvnmt, anld if he escapes et nsure for too much borrowing, it mill h)e only 1hccauso 1h.- dlls it so agreeably. As in- it, stances of this, it may be stated that he pausfe before Li e to Pt give us its history from the earliest times to the present. 'i'hen h, he dedicates a chapter to the language and literature of the I Walloons, illustrated 1bv translations. The superstitions of the or people occupy a third chapter, and biographies of famous pcr- gr sonages, and legends attached to remoarkable places, are intro- is duced at every opportunity. We do not adduce this by way of a( censure, but simply to exhiibit the true character of Mr. Cos- Pe TI:L LO' volume, andI pcrhap.as prmof how much and Various sit is the information it contains. mi Such a woik cannot be analyzed, nor could we attempt to !thi follow tl e author through his tour so as to preserve a connection mf between the extracts by which we purpose to lhew the character of a publication which deserves an order for the book-club and an, a place in the circulating library. tol A scene at Diinant will eXhibit Mr1. COSTELLO'S powers of lively detscription. the Besides the chances of war, the church has run several risks leg from fire, and on one occasion was almost buried beneath a mass toil of rock which fell from the heights under which it is built. This catastrophe befel when the church was full of people, during the ry- funeral ceremony of one of the principal citizens. ing A few days after our arrival, we found that the apprehension I of a similar accident was entertained throughout Dinant; a deep ty, crack having suddenly made its appearance on the surface of the )n- rock impending over the church and neighbouring houses. To ic- prevent the mass from falling unawares, it was resolved at once of to dislodge the most suspicious-looking fragment; and the whole )s- town was in commotion to witness the operation. The marketias place, the bridge, and the opposite shore of the Meuse, were me crowded with gazers, and eager heads were thrust from every window that could command a view of the spot. The inhabitants )re dwelling on the dangerous side of the church were obliged to h evacuate their dwellings, and the result was looked forward to It with the greatest anxiety. Many wise heads were shaken, and not a few of the alarmists predicted the entire destruction of the ir- church and buildings adjacent. One old woman fell on her knees, or and, with many tears and lamentations, put up prayers for the hI preservation of her abode; and one could not but sympathize with nd r her solicitude, though some who professed themselves acquainted with the precise position of the rock declared that there was no M real danger. We had intended that day to visit the ruins of the castle of be Montaivle, about six miles off, in the district Entre 6ambre et Me Meusc, and stopped on the bridge to witness the engineering exns I periment. At the hour appointed, a workman was lowered by to cords from the parapet of the citadel; and there, suspended over of an abyss some three hundred feet deep, with apparently no rest2. ing-place for his foot as he swung from point to point, he plied of both pick-axe and lever for about half au hour, till the threattloing mass was sufficitntly loosened for the grand coup. He , gave it at last ; and down it thundered an avalanche of stone, e, shivering in its descent into a thousand splinters as it encountered the unequal surface of the rock below, but falling perfectly c harmless, the direction given to it having been well calculated. I! A cloud of dust rose as it fell ; and when that had cleared away, *e the workman was seen standing on a narrow ledge at the foot of ;s the walls of the citadel, busily engaged in smoothing the surface d of the rock from whence the enormous fragment-which, it was t supposed, weighed about forty thousand pounds-had been detached. 'I lie people shouted with exultation ; the devotee clasped her hands and wilped her eyes ; and we ascended the Steep windhing road that led to the heights opposite Dinant, but stopping efrequently to gaze upon the rock, vherethc miner was still un. econcernedly at work. D e Tourists are men; thev must eat and drink, and they are not averse to information what are the good things of the district through which they wiander. Here then is an account of the f FARF AT DINANT. The means of living at Dinant are worth a passing comment. Nothiinir can equal the richness of the milk, the bread and butter tare both excellent, the water is delicious, and the epas and vef getables are plentiful and cheap. The Meuse and the many streams that water the valley s producc abundance of fish,- trout, I gravling, and perch ; and, for those who are fond of them, the ditches yield crawfish of enormous size, the largest being sent to llriissels, and often sold in the market there for twenty francs apiece. HIares, partri(dgcs, pigeons, lrc'ts, ani ft/linoli(s are abundant, and of exquisite flavour; the inutton of the Ardennes vies with its venison, and for the epicure there is one dihll that is incomparable ; this is the jamotnii de BaIotyne, which wve found so good that we begged the chof to give us his receipt for curing it, and here it is :-The haml is cured in a brine of salt, saltpetre, and aromatic herbs, viz. a few bay-leaves, child thynme, a * handful of juniper berries, and a little garlic. It is steeped for about six weeks, and then dried in the smoke of the chimney, over a wood fire. When wanted for dressing, it is buried in the ground for twenty-four hours, and then boiled, with the addition of the same aromatic herbs in the water. After boiling, the bone is taken out, and the ham is pressed under a heavy weight." As a corollary to the dressing, it may be added, that it often happens that the ham, when produced at table, disappears at one sitting. As the late Lord Bilayney did not think it beneath his military dignity to tell how hamis were boiled in hock at Bayonne, this simple notice of the treatment of the ham of- the Ardennes may be permitted here. lIe pronounces the beer of the Low Countries to be execrable, and we heartily agree with him. That of Louvain is the only tolerable drink. To the stay-at-home reader, the most attractive portion of the volume will be Mr. COSTELLO'S ample researches into the legends of the country, and the superstitious and strange customs of the people. For instance, WALLOON SUPSRSTITIONS. Again: the superstitious opinions which are generally held by the Walloon people are common to all the Belgian peasantry, as they originally were to all the nations claiming a northern ori. gin. They believe much in omens, among which several that are local may be enumerated. For instance, to meet a priest when on the way to accomplish any unusual undertaking, is held to be significant of its failure; and the experimentalist inva. riably turns back, looking upon his day as lost. Perhaps this superstition may arise from the supposition that the priest, as a spiritual director, is sent in opposition to the undertaking. The cries of owls, the howling of dogs, the crossing of forks, the spilling of salt, and the number of thirteen at a feast, are here, as everywhere in the north, received omens. There are few who like to throw reeds into the fire, because they look upon them as contributing towards the support of oxen, and an ox was pre. sent at the birth of our Saviour-a scquitlur which might save I many other objects from conflagration ! They are very careful in placing the bed of a dying person, lest the rafters of the room should be in a contrary direction, for they think that if so, the agonies of death would inevitably be protracted. In washing linen they are careful not to say, the lessire "; boils," but that it "plays," otherwise the linen would be destroyed. To take a wren threatens misfortune or death in the family of the captor. The value of a caul is universally recognised, and the child that is ne woffct is looked upon as " born to good luck." Precious stones are supposed to possess, beyond their value in the market, uncommon virtues-the turquoise preserves the wearer from falls and other accidents; the magnet possesses properties still more precious; and the aerite is considered invaluable in the detection of thieves. The mode employed to discover them is by grinding the metal to (lust, and mixing it with bread, which is given to the suspected person, who, if he be " a true thief," is unable to swallow it. Diamonds, emeralds, and pearls-precious stones, indeed, among peasants-were formerly used to detect infidelity-a fact that might readily be supposed if the peasants' wives wore them. On Easter Sunday it was, in many places, the custom to breakfast on two eggs laid on Good Friday, in order to keep off fever. Perhaps if those who frequent the Kermese at Easter were to drink rather less, the result would be no less satisfactory. There are many persons who still abstain from eating meat after Lent, to ward off the tooth-ache: an equal abstinence from swectmcats would (ldoubtless be as effectual. On Christmas-eve the yule clog is burnt, and a fragment carefully kept and put under the bed, to act as a preservative against lightning, in the same way as the willowbranch, blest on Palm Sunday, is kept in a sacred corner. If the custom of affixing formularics against the incursions of rats and mice has vanished, and the prayer Against the wolf has fallen into desuetude, we may easily believe that cats and mousetraps are more useful than heretofore, and wolves less frequent; but the peasants in some remote villages still smear the walls of their houses with chalk in the form of a cross, to guard them against fire. It maybe presumed that those who adhere to this custom have no faith in the efficacy of fire insuranceq, or are unable to PRay for their security. At the town of Fosses, in the province of Namur, a superstition exists which induces the women of the country round, at the period of the anniral fair, to flock thither with osier-wands, with which they touch the image of St. IBridgeta saint highly venerated there. When they return home, they touch their cattle with the same wands, either to cure their ailments or preserve them from the murrain. Al. though the mountainous districts of all countries are the strongholds in which a belief hi the intercourse with the world of spirits finds refuge, there is yet no want of this kind of faith in the lowlands. For instance, at Willsbeeck, Vyve St. iBavon, and other villages near Courtrai, a curious custom is observed which obtains in other parts of Belgium. When a person dies, the clergy of the parish come in procession to couditct the bodly to the place ofinterment. Ifon their way they come to a spot where four roads meet, the bearers of the coffin set down their load, kneel in silence, and utter a short prayer. Their reason for doing so arises from the belief that those who have quitted this world may yet return to it ; but as there might be some difficulty in the dead man finding his way home again, his friends pray for him in the cross-roads, that he may hit upod his path the more readily, and not be misled by evil spirits-" Kwacdegeesten." But at Oostmallen, near Turnhout, a far wore extraordinary custom exists, for which it would be difficult to assign a satisfactory reason. When the husband dies, his widow seats herself astride upon the bier, and in this demonstrative manner accompanies the corpse to the grave ! The ceremony called the Court of the Cuckoo, which used to take place annually at Polleur, was, however, among the most singular observances of the whole country. Polleur is a very ancient village, near the famous castle of Franchimont, at the bottom of the valley watered by the Hagne, lying between Verviersand Spa. Here, on the first Sunday after the 15th of August, was celebrated this remarkable fute ; and the concouree of people who came to it was immense. A mock court of justice was formed, with a regular president, and the members assembled, io the first instance, at the principal cabaret of the village, situated close to the bridge which joins the commune of Polleur to that of Sart. From the cabaret the court adjourned to the bridge itself ; and here were summoned to appear before the tribunal all those husbands whom their wives had deceived or beaten, or who had proved too complaisant in exercising their marital authority, or to whom, in short, wvs attached any ridiculous mark of notoriety. The proceedinvs began with pleadings of the most burlesque deseription,-not very dissimilar, perhaps, to those called "judge and jury" ebibs in London,-and the strangers who looked on werc often appealed to, and absurd questions asked of them, not always of, the most delicate nature, which provoked peals of langhter from the assembled crowds. The accused, who were of course always found guilty, were then condemned topay a fine, the proceeds of which were expended at the cabaret; and now and then, to give variety to the scene, the delinquent was compelled to get into a cart, which was backed off the bridge till it reached a staznant dungpit, where it was tilted over, and the unhappy inmate was half smothered in a bed which was of anv thine but roses. To chose the proceedings out of doors, the last msrried man in the villaZe was brought before the court, and the fact being clearv proved against him, he was very summarily thrown over t!.e iridge into the waters of the lircene; a process which, bowelvr, only inqured him a good ducking. The remainder of the day was passed in the cabaret-lhotr it is scarcely necessary to say. There was another curious feature in the ceremonies of the " (Cour du Coucou :" this was the exhibition of a banner on which was painted the likeness of a monster called " La U te d. Staneux." It represente(l a kind of centaur, half voman and half horse, with the tail of a lion. The hair was long, and floa ed down the back, and the feminine conformation very fully developetd. Tce fi ure held a bow in its left hand, and an arrow in its right. This picture was exposed to view in the cabarets of the %ill;igc, .and continued to be produced in public until 17'9, whe.; the Ete of the " Cour du Coucou " was suppressed. From timle iniemlnorial it had been carefully preserved in the parish church: 1,ut it was only during the last sixty years that the curates had allowed it to be seen beyond its walls. At the same time there was also paraded a figure rudely carved in wood, which ordinarily stood in the porch of the church: this image was burnt. According to the most received opinions, the Meilc de Staneux nzas !upl)osed to represent tihe ancient goddess of the Ardennes, where Diana, under various forms, was worshipped. The peope of 1Polleur have a tradition that the exhibition of the picture was made to commemorate the victory gained by their ancestors over a monster that formerly infested the forest of Staneux, hard by. There was, at one time, scarcely a house in the villaure of Ilolleur that did not possess a small framed picturc of thle lkte de Staneux. Further particulars of these remnants of a pist era lingering in the very heart of European civilization will not he u:iwelcome:The dwvarfs are generally located in caverns and subtcrranreons places: they are called in Flemish IIaelt'u'.evAles atnd Khtttermnanwek'ns-names which sufficiently express t!.eir pre-unmed appearance. The inhabitants of the vil:ge of II -reelt, in the C(ampine, say that a great number of these dw'arfs came into that part of the country on the occasion of a great war; that they duvel-t in holes dug in the ground in the middle of a wvood; and tnat they sometimes came into the villa-e to ask for owc thing or the other, bult never did harni to any one. \Wen ti .wives of these dwvarfs became old, thcir husbands, givinr thcen a small fresh loaf, made them enter a lio!' in the ground, anl crefully closed the apc: tare: the credulolv; peasants nald, thiut thre poor old she-d-warfs wvere quite content to die in this manner. At the village of (;elrode, the country people shcw a hill, called Kahotlerreig, in which are excavated several eaves, and gravely declare that these grottoes were the ahodec of dwarfs, who served the miller who dwelt there ; and that when the latter was desirous of wetting his grindstone, he had oniy to place it at the door of his mill, with a slice of bread and butter and a glass of beer, and in the night a dwarf came, who, for this trifling reward, performted the wvork, and the inillhr found the I stone ready wvhen he wanted it. The same assistance was given him when he wanted to have his linen washed. It is related also, that at a villagre near 'Mechlin, a miller-the fa% oured race, apparently-being engaged in sifting flour, and not having time to finish his task, put off the rest to the followhio day and going home, accidentally left behind him a slice of bread and butter, which had formed a part of his supper. Nesxt morning he was very much astonished to find that the fltur was sifted, and the bread and butter gone. He resolved to repeat the experiment; and the same result cnisued. On the third night, curious to know who the labourer could be who worked at night for such slight payment, be hid himself behind some sacks of flour; and about midnight saw a little dwarf make his appearance, perfectly naked, who immediately set to work. The miller, a modest man (a rarity in Brabant), and moved with pity at the nakedness of the laborious dwarf, added, on the following night, a complete suit of clothes to the unsifted flour and bread and butter; after which, the good little spirit never Chewed himself again without being dressed from head to foot. With one other short extract we conclude. BELGIAN SPORTSMEN. It was on the 3rd of September that we arrived at Dinant-the first day of the shooting season in Belgium-and it was not without difficulty that we succeeded in getting an apartment, the house being full of sportsmen. If we had not been told that this was the case, we might have guessed it from the endless howling of the cdhins (le chasse, who, locked up in their masters' bedrooms, gave utterance to every description of canine melody, rendering sleep impossible till long after midnight, when the festivities of the chasseurs, no less riotous than their dogs, broke up. If there is one thing more than another that distinguishes a modern Belgian from his kind, it is his excessive fondness for m k nga n'nite. No time or place appears to have any influence in subtuing his clamorous tendencies, as if to howl and shout like an enrage were the great aim and object of his existence. These sportsmen, who were chiefly from Brussels, gave us another taste of their quality as sonn as day began to break, and if they exercised their lungs to the same extent when they got to the field, unless the birds were deaf, their sport must have proved a blank.

THE SIGNAL AND OTHER STORIES. By W. M. Garshin. 6s. (Duckworth & Co.) Wsewold Michailovich Garshin is known to Russian literature as the author of some twenty short stories the bulk of which are contained in the volume before us. The translator, Captain Rowland Smith of the British Embassy at St. Petersburg, has done his work well, although we imagine the volume has lost something in translation from a language so complex as Russian. The stories are various in type, but each gives an illuminating glimpse of life as seen through the sensitive, melancholy Slavonic temperament. The opening story, " The Signal," tells in graphic fashion a tragic episode in the life of a linesman on a Russian railway, and in " Four Days " Garshin draws on his experiences in the Russo-Turkish war, and describes the sensations of a wounded soldier overlooked by the ambulance corps. " Coward " is another war story full of the elemental stuff of life. " The Frog who Travelled," a fable, reminiscent of Hans Andersen, is not new to us; possibly some version of this story has been given in English before. Garshin sees life more subjectively than Gorky, but the racial affinity between the two writers is clearly visible. And although Garshin's work is at times slight in texture it is so distinctively national that it will prove a welcome addition to the representative literature of Russia as translated into our tongue.

Bosanquet opens his work on the temperament of the musical scale with the following admirable passage from Kirnberger (I. 19): "Greater certainly would be the gain of Song if we really had the enharmonic intervals in our system. For then singers would accustom themselves from their youth up to sing correctly the smallest enharmonic intervals, and the ear of the listener to appreciate them; and thereby it would be possible in many cases to make the expression of the passions much stronger." Greater still would be the power of expressing the passions by including in our system the larger intervals of the harmonic scale, such as Nos. 7 and ll, as well as the minute quarters and eighths of tones, which are termed enharmonic. The diatonic tone, No. 7, is the true harmonic Seventh, it being the seventh part of a string or pipe, and, in place of it, we have retained the b flat of the Greeks, a poor discordant substitute, which bears no ratio to c, the keynote, nor even to f. The f, No. ll, again, is the true divisor of the minor Third from s to g, and in place of it we have a Greek) f, which is not consonant with c as its fundamental or bass. In other words, it is not the sound of any aliquot part of a string tuned to c. "It is well known," says Mr. Bosanquet, "that if we take a minor Seventh, such as u-f, and flatten it by a small interval, we can ' obtain a Seventh which presents many of the qualities of a consonance, and in which no beats can be heard." The note thus obtained is the true harmonic Seventh to c, it differs only from f by the small interval of. 63 to 64, and it forms No. 21 of the harmonic scale of c. We still omit it, but if we were to employ the true harmonic Seventh to c, it would become necessary as the Fifth to one and Fourth to another. It might be named either e sharp or f flat, if referring to the true f, No. ll, which is also omitted, for there is no difference between the flat of an upper and the sharp of a lower tone in science. The conventional change of name has arisen from the lack of quarter tones in our scale. Thus the violin player sharpens the semitone in ascent, or lowers it in descent, when he wishes to guide the ear more decidedly to the note which is to follow. Mr. Bosanquet approves of the harmonic Seventh in harmony, but hardly so much in melody, and yet no more agreeable melodic passage has been devised than to run up the octave by c, e, g, Harmonic No. 7, b natural, and c. Neither is there any phrase more expressive of energy and decision than d, | ?, Harmonic No. ll, and | 5. If our b flat were to be substituted for the harmonic note in the former passage, the change of harmony would check further ascent in the scale, and the ear would expect an immediate descent to a. If we employed our f in the latter, the passage would lose all force and character. The harmonic f, No. ll, is the exact divisor of the minor Third, e-o. It is that which gives it the bold stride in melody. Among the numberless new inventions of musical instruments, no person seems hitherto to have proposed one constructed upon the only true and complete scale, with its eight tones and eight semitones in the octave. This omission may be repaired within a short time, and the curious may then judge orally of the hitherto unemployed sounds, from a harmonium which was intended for the International Exhibition of Scientific Instruments at South Kensington. Mr. Bosanquet remarks, in his Preface, that " the ratio of the note to its generator arises from the notion of a harmonic scale"; but he adds, " I have not used anything of the kind, and it is incompatible with derivation by division of the octave." True, it is incompatible, but which of the two systems is right? ?'Division of the octave" means to adopt notes which are not true to the harmonic scale, and every note so adopted will be mon or less false and out of tune. Should not, then, the first object of tempering be to modify the three existing false notes, f, a, and b fiat, so as to bring them into consonance t The harmonic scale is simply a scale of aliquot parts and of corresponding multiples as to vibrations. It includes every consonant interval, whether near or remote. The greatest charm of music, whether in melody or in harmony, is the passing through, or the simultaneous employment of, consonant intervals in their cycles of coincident vibration. Mr. Bosanquet devotes his second chapter to the so called "Equal Temperament" by "twelve equal semitones"; and he adds, " These are the semitones of the pianoforte and organ as ordinarily tuned." Surely he must have been misinformed. On inquiry, we find that a tuner equalizes beats, but not the semitones. He tunes by ear, and not by ratios. Such a geometrical system of tempering as twelve equal semitones is utterly averse to music. Truly, there are twelve equal inches in a foot, but there are not even two equal semitones out of the twelve in an octave. The ratios diminish at every step in ascent Thusthe ratio of c to c sharp is 16 to 17, that of c sharp to d is 17 to 18. In the middle of the octave, o to g sharp is 24 to 25, and the top of it. b to c, is 30 to 32, because the interval is, in truth, a tone, b sharp being omitted in our scale. There is a b sharp in the harmonic scale, and its ratio is 31 to 32. This system of tempering is the most singular remedy ever proposed for the defects of a scale. Suppose the semitones to be balanced at the middle one, 24 to 25, or any other, there will be eleven notes of the twelve out of tune, not in one key only, but in every key. This system has re- suited from tuning intervals in a circle, from one imperfect sound after another, without a thought about the stationary bass. Mr. Bosanquet does not point out the manifest objections to the above system, so as to give his readers the benefit of -his knowledge, but we can only assume that they are familiar to him, since he advocates the "Old unequal Temperament, or Mean-tone System." Under that head, Chap. V., the author writes, ?"We saw that four exact Fifths upwards lead to a Third (c-e), a comma sharper than the perfect Third." It is true that we see it in this example, c to e, but not in the former one, quoted at page 7, under the head of *' System of perfect Fifths?Pythagorean System." We demur there to the first " exact" Fifth (o flat to d flat), because upon the infallible authority of the harmonic scale, the ratio of g flat to d flat is 46 to C8, and not to 69. Taking the later example of four perfect Fifths, from c to e, the reason for the excess of the last Fith over e in the octave system is simple enough. From c to o is a perfect Fifth, from a to d is a perfect Fifth, from d to the a, No. 27 of the Harmonic Scale (not our a), is also perfect, but from a to e is not so. This Fifth bas two minor tones in it instead of one, therefore a perfect Fifth overshoots the mark by an eighth of a tone, e is No. 80, and the Fifth, rising from a, passes over to 81. The difference of 80 to 81, called a Comma of Didymus, is exactly the difference between a major and a minor tone. Is it, then, wise to alter a or e for the sake of this eighth of a tone ? If we lower a, we make it a false Fifth and Fourth to the two d's, also a false Second to g. If we raise e, we transform the perfect major Third, c to e, into a Pythagorean Ditone; we also make a false minor Third to g, and thus spoil the common chord, ceg; again, we make e a false Fourth to b, a false Fifth to the b above, and a false Sixth to c. Further than this, let us recollect that a is but the semitone No. 27 in a true scale, and that it ought to be among the black keys of the pianoforte, and not, as it now is, in the front. Tempering has hitherto been the bane of music. The attempts to improve intervals have been so injudicious, and so regardless of coincident vibration, as to have done much more harm than good. No reader of history can question the fact that music now exercises a very diminished influence upon the imagination, especially among uncultivated hearers. Others accept music as a calm sort of enjoyment, a quiet to the mind, and this class far exceeds in number the enthusiasts for the art. On the other hand, tempered music is so unpleasing to some ears as to have caused a revolt, and to have raised up a crusade against street performances, although of superior music, and, in many cases, by a good band of musicians. Threefold time is taken up in the endeavour to learn to sing the intervals from a tempered pianoforte against one to learn to sing them in tune. Mr. Bosanquet would confer a boon upon many musicians if he would publish a set of harmonic scales with his comments upon their consonant and dissonant intervals in various keys, adding to them the scales of our f, b flat, and a. ^ This project may commend itself to his notice, because it would enable him at once to decide upon the roots of all intricate chords, about which he now expresses doubts. Every musical interval tells its own bass. It is not advisable to divide the octave into 50, 53, 100, 30103, or any other fanciful number of parts. The musical number of an octave is 2. It is the half of a string or pipe, and it vibrates as 2 to 1 of the whole length, just as 3, the " Twelfth," is a third of a string, and vibrates as 3 to 1 of the whole length, and as 3 to 2, the interval called a Fifth (but which, being the third of a half, is the sixth of a string), vibrates as 3 to 2 of the octave. From this it follows that the root, bass, or generator of 2 is an octave below, and tbat of 3 is a twelfth below. Thus all the numbers which represent musical scales will be intelligible, and show the double root of our present diatonic scale. When c is 3 (as in 4 to 3 upon f, or 5 to 3 upon a), the root must be f ?not any c?and it will show the impossibility of reducing our compound scale to a Common Denominator. Again, to make these double roots coincide, it seems necessary to start with an f of 22 vibrations to agree with a c of 33. The result as to pitch will be 440 vibrations of a to 528 vibrations of c. This is the well-devised Stuttgart pitch, and tbat of the Society of Arts. The French pitch is impossible?it cannot be used without tempering the bass. Although we have shown reasons to differ from some of Mr. Bosanquet's proposed systems of temperament, wc regard his book as a lucid and ably-written treatise upon an intricate subject.

ENTERTAINMENT?AND OTHERWISE The House by the River. By A. P. Herbert. (Methuen. 8s. 6d. net.) Larry Munro. By G. B. Stern. (Chapman & Hall. 7s. 6d. net.) The Fourth Dimension. By Horace A. Vachell. (Murray. 7s. 6d. not.) HUNDREDS of years hence, we venture to prophesy, the curtains wiU divide and discover a young man in a check suit with a bow-tie much too big for him and a straw hat much too smaU, standing with his back to a glade of yeUowing beech trees and reddening bracken and saying : " A friend of mine came home late one night? early one morning, I should say?and his wife's mother happened to be staying with them at the time. I ought to have mentioned that he hadn't been married longer than you might have expected. . . What are you laughing at ? " Yes, they will be laughing, and at the word " twins " the laughter wiU sweU into a roar. For?and the reasons are many and curious, and weU worth inquiring into?it is the melancholy fact that precious little is needed to amuse and divert people. They are ready to accept almost anything, and really, there are times when it seems that the staler the entertainment the more successful it is likely to be. . . Let the song be?not the same song we heard last time, but a " new " one so like it that we know just when to laugh and beat. Let us be able to recognize the heroine the moment she tosses her bright head, and grant us the flattering satisfaction of never being taken in by the dark but too good-looking young man. The effect upon popular fiction of this easy acceptance is to fill the bookshelves ninety times nine with the old, old story. After all, if the public is content, why bother to give it the new, new story ? And why, when success is so easy, not have it and hold it from this time forth for evermore ? It is not as though the pastime novel were out to teU the truth and nothing but the truth. At this dismal juncture we should like to introduce an exception ; it is " The House by the River," by Mr. Herbert. Here is a novel which does set out deliberately to be an amusement and a distraction, and, at the same time, its author has succeeded in giving a wonderfuUy vivid and convincing portrait of a certain " type " of young man? one Stephen Byrne, a young poet who has the great misfortune to murder the housemaid almost by accident when he is alone with her in the house one evening. We heartily commend this book to the readers of The Athenjeum ; it is exceUent entertainment, and it is, in a way not quite easy to define, " something new." How far does Mr. Herbert intend to deceive us with that high-spirited and rather ordinary beginning ? And then, little by little, just when we imagine we begin to see what the picture is like, with a stroke here, a stroke there, a sharpening of this line, an accenting of that?aU is changed. Stephen Byrne and his wife Margery emerge?real, briUiant ly seen? in the case of Stephen indeed, diabolically real. You see Mr. Herbert's method is to change nothing, alter nothing, present Life in a cultured little back-water just as it is? rather delightful, rather vain ?to keep the surface, in fact, untroubled and yet broken with charming little emotions. And then, just as we are caught in the glow from some old* world dining-room window, we are permitted to see what is happening inside that ideal house for a poet, and there is the poet strangling the housemaid. The affair was easy enough to explain. He had dined very weU, he had come home in a glow himself, and, full of vague kindling fe< lings, he had watched the sun set over the river. Then, because he was not in the humour for writing and there was no one to share his emotion with him, he felt vaguely dissatisfied, and drank a glass of port just as EmUy came downstairs, rosy and uncommonly pretty after her warm bath. He said fatuously, " Had a nice bath, Emily ? " and " he put one arm round her as she passed, lightly, almost timidly." Then he did a thing he had never done before?kissed the housemaid?and she screamed; and the scream startling him back to reality and a consciousness of the neighbours, ..." Playfully almost, he put his hands at EmUy's throat." But the idiotic girl would take it seriously, would make a noise, bit his hand, maddened him, so that when he let go she was dead. What would you do if you, a successful young poet, with a delightful wife, charming home, delicious littledaughter-and-her-rabbits, and a golden future, found yourself in such an incredibly unexpected " hole " ? Couldn't you act weU enough, lie convincingly enough, to deceive the stupid world ? And mightn't the fact that you were an imaginative writer be an immense help ? It nearly saved Stephen Byrne, but then the temptation to see the affair from the writer's point of view, to " use it" as copy (changed, of course, out of all knowledge, disguised as a romance of chivalry, with EmUy buried most beautifully, most movingly in a lonely lake instead of thrust into a sack and tipped into the Thames), was too strong for Stephen. He yielded and was undone. As to having murdered EmUy, that in itself, Mr. Herbert's pen makes us feel, was the kind of thing that might happen to any man. It's the fuss afterwards that matters?the law?hanging?the last morning's breakfast?that can't be got over. . . " Larry Munro" is for other readers. Is this Miss G. B. Stern the author of " ChUdren of No Man's Land " ? In that novel she packed so many talents that it would not hold together ; it flew apart and was all brilliant pieces, but in this! Larry Munro, we repeat, and once again Larry Munro. That is all there is to be said for it. Miss Stern herself strings a quantity of more or less bright little beads in between, but they are scarcely visible for the flashing, aU-a-quivering Larry Munros of which her chain is composed. It is not stupid?it is siUy; not clever?but bright; and it is so sentimental that it makes the reader hang his head. " Within three days she was in the thick of it, slightly befogged but happy. She had told herself she was an outsider, beyond the pale that encompassed these smart London folks. It astonished her how easy it was to get on with them." This is your country mouse arrived at the Castle to help the Duchess with hei theatricals. " Amongst the guests who were not concerned . . . might be found a Cabinet Minister, a famous doctor and a hanging Judge." That hanging Judge, who appears from time to time in novels without his black cap, strikes the key for us. Mr. Vachell plays the famUiar tune. It is entirely without surprises. K.M.

DAPHNE ADEANE. By Maurice Baring. 8s. 6d. (Heine- mann.) Just as the reader is wondering when he is to be introduced to the name-heroine of this story, he is taken to a private view and learns that the portrait of Daphne Adeane exhibited there is that of a woman who is dead. So it is the spirit rather than the person of Daphne Adeane which suffuses the novel. But, in addition to her widowed husband, two of her lovers survive, and these two, Leo Dettrick the author, and Francis Greene the doctor, find in the married Fanny Choyce so startling a replica of their lost ideal that the actual presence of Daphne is not needed. Perhaps Mr. Baring does not fully prepare his reader for Fanny's surrender to Francis Greene, but he does make effective use of the circumstances under which she discovers that she must make a renunciation equal to that made bv her husband in the case of the woman he had loved. It will be divined from the foregoing that this is an unusual novel, but nothing short of actual perusal can convey the quiet distinction of its writing. Mr. Baring holds his pen in restraint, touches in his colours with deft strokes, and so produces a series of portraits which will rank high in his gallery.

The History and Pleasant Chronicle of Little Jehan de SmeUre" and the Lady of the Fair Cousins, without being otherwise named. Now first done into English by Alexander Vance. (Dublin, Moffat * Co.) This ie another of Mr. Vance's translations from the old French chronicles. He is a man with a hobby, and wishes to induce as many readen aa possible to share his enthusiasm. The Chronicle is well rendered into English, with judicious omissions; but the racy fun whioh exists in the original evaporates in the translation, and the Chronicle itself is heavy. It is a scandalous chronicle about the " lady of the fair cousins," who first falls in love with a little Cherubino of a page, and not only instructs him in the whole duty of a courteous gentleman, but also supplies him with money to boy fine clothes, which in those {lays were even more coveted than at present, telling him to say his mother had sent them. After he has become a noble knight, and been her faithful adorer for many yean, she disgracefully throws him off, and becomes the paramour of a stalwart Abbot; and they both seek to turn the Sieur de Saintre* into ridicule; but he exacts such heavy revenge as makes one feel that tbe usage in those days was very rough both in peace and war. We suspect this very Chronicle was written as a further punishment to tbe lady. Jehan de Saintre" died in 1458; and the lady is supposed to have been Marie, daughter of King John (who fought the battle of Poictien), and widow of Alphonse of Arragon, Duke de Bar. If this Chronicle be a specimen of the novels of that period, we are better off in that respect, at least. The book is like reading an old illuminated MS., and has the interest of being a curiosity, but we do not find it otherwise tl entertaining. *

EDVCATION. I T/e llondee-Seek-e; cr, The History of Charles Dottylas. By M. Fiaxti Tifr.,:n. Laudun, i845. Grant and Griffith. Tnits is one of tlh %ery extknsive class of juvenile works of which Sawdford aud 3Me)r/,1 and Ereniitys at Home were the progenitors. Under the guise of a narrative, and by help of the introduction ef some half-dozen characters to excite a j)ersonal intere-t in the proceedingS, a course of lectures is conveyed. But -Tr. TYTLER has the good sense to confine himself almost entirelh to the relation of facts, which always interest, and to avoid sermonizing, which as certainly repels the youthful mind, generally a great deal less informed, but a great deal more pure and good, than that which would instruct him. Yet, neglectful of this, how often do we find the in. structors of youth substituting preaching for teaching, and cranmming with sentin-elt when they should be training to action. Mr. TYTLI.t has introduced his information in a very pleasing form, and hc has choseni the most attractive subjects, chiefly natural history; but these he has mningled with short tales, anecdotes, and some wholesome reflections ; in short, such a miscellany as a well-read man might produce in an after-dinner conversation with children from the stores of his memory. It is a volume to be heartily commended to parents and teachers.

The Linwoods, or Sixty Years since in America. By Miss SEDG- WICK. Churton, Holles Street. ALTHOUGH the authoress of " Hopeleslie," " Redwood," and " The Linwoods," does not, as a novelist, possess the untiring activity of Cooper, the broad humour of Paulding, or such sudden bursts of keen, vivacious satire, as emitted by Mrs. Trollope; yet she is held, by the transatlantic public, with great justice, in higher esteem than her American literary competitors. Her novels are imbued with an irresistible charm, the charm of truth, and, by consequence, its never-failing companion-that of sympathy. Without the superfine, metaphysical process of minutely scrutinizing and portraying the secret mechanism, the various movements and phases of the human heart, Miss Sedgwick exhibits at once, and without seeming effort, the " open secret" of our affections and impulses, in a manner so quiet-though not the less unerring-as must engage the sympathies of every reader, be they ever so homely. Moreover, her characters are evidently not the creations of imagination; but actual studies from the great "life academy" of nature. We find, in the novel before us, no exaggerations of fact, in no one instance a departure from probability, but an easy, calm, and no less interesting flow of events, presenting a more healthy, nay, greater source of excitement to the " reading public," than the sudden transitions or " remarkable events " embodied by the great "' wizard of the north" himself. The title of the book, " Sixty Years Since," immediately refers its readers to the commencement of the American struggle for independence-a retrospect peculiarly favourable to the novelist, and of which the authoress of the Linwoods has availed herself judiciously and effectively. We shall present our readers with an extract, affording a peculiarly favourable specimen of the description of talent we have given Miss Sedgwick credit for; as also one of the easy unobtrusive humour she possesses. It describes the parting of Eliot Lee from his family, his village friends, and the home of his childhood, on starting to volunteer in the cause of his country. " A fine black saddle-horse, well equipped, was at the door. Little Fanny Lee stood by him, patting him, and laying her head, with its shining flaxen locks, to his side -' Rover,' she said, with a trembling voice, 'be a good Rover-won't you ? and, when the naughty regulars come, canter off with Eliot as fast as you can.' "' Hey! that's fine ! ' retorted her brother, a year younger than herself. 'No, no, Rover, canter up to them, and over them, and never dare to canter back here if you turn tail on them, Rover.' "'Oh, Sam! how awful; would you have Eliot killed?' "'No, indeed, but I had rather he'd come deused near it than to have him a coward.' " 'Don't talk so loud, Sam-Bessie will hear you.' "But the young belligerent was not to be silenced. He threw open the 'dwelling-room' door, to appeal to Eliot himself. The half-uttered sentence died away on his lips. He entered the apartment, Fanny followed; they gently closed the door, drew their footstools to Eliot's feet, and quietly sat down there. How instinctive is the sympathy of children! how plain, and yet how delicate its manifestations! " Bessie was sitting beside her brother, her head on his shoulder, and crying as if her heart went out with every sob. The youngest boy, Hal, sat on Eliot's knee, with one arm around his neck, his cheek lying on Bessie's, dropping tear after tear, sighing, and half-wondering why it was so. " The good mother had arrived at that age when grief rather congeals the spirit than melts it. Her lips were compressed, her eyes tearless, and her movements tremulous. She was busying herself in the last offices, doing up parcels, taking last stitches, and performing those services that seem to have been assigned to women as safety-valves for their effervescing feelings. " A neat table was spread with ham, bread, sweetmeats, cakes, and every delicacy the house afforded-all were untasted. Not a word wvas heard, except such broken sentences as ' Come, Bessie, I will promise to be good if you will to be happy ! ' "'Eliot, how easy for you-how impossible for me! ' "'Dear Bessie, do be firmer, for mother's sake. For ever! oh no, my dear sister, it will not be very long before I return to you; and while I am gone, you must be every thing to mother.' " I! I never was good for any thing, Eliot-and now- ' a'Bessie, my dear child, hush-you have been-you always will be a blessing to me. Don't put any anxious thoughts into Eliot's mind-we shall do very well without him.' ' s Noble, disinterested mother! 'trembled on Eliot's lips; but he suppressed words that might imply reproach to Bessie. " The sacred scene was now broken in upon by some well-meaning but untimely visitors. Eliot's approaching departure had created a sensation in Westbrook; tle good people of that rustic place not having arrived at the refined stage in the progress of society when emotion and fellow-feeling are not expressed, or expressed only by certain conventional forms. First entered Master Hale, with Miss Sally Ryal. Master Hale ' hoped it was no intru. sion;' and Miss Sally answered, 'by no means; she had come to lend a helping hand, and not to intrude '-whereupon she bustled about, helped herself and her companion to chairs, and unsettled every body else in the room. Mrs. Lee assumed a more tranquil mien; poor Bessie suppressed her sobs, and withdrew to a window, and Eliot tried to look composed and manly. The children, like springs relieved from a pressure, reverted to their natural state, dashed off their tears, and began whispering among themselves. Miss Sally produced from her workbag a comforter for Mr. Eliot, of her own knitting, which she ' trusted would keep out the cold and rheumatism :' and she was kindly showing him how to adjust it, when she spied a chain of braided hair around his neck-' Ah, ha, Mr. Eliot, a love token!' she exclaimed.' " ' Yes, it is,' said little Fanny, who was watching her proceedings; 'Bessie and I cut locks of hair from all the children's heads and mother's, and braided it for him; and I guess it will warm his bosom more than your comforter will, Miss Sally.' " It was evident, from the look of ineffable tenderness Eliot turned or, Fanny, that he ' guessed' so too; but he nevertheless received the comforter graciously, hinting, that a lady who had been able to protect her own bosom from the most subtle enemy, must know how to defend another's from common assaults. Miss Sally hemmed, looked at Master Hale, muttered something of her not always having been invulnerable; and finally succeeded in recalling to Eliot's recollection a tradition of a love-passage between Miss Sally and the pedagogue. " A little girl now came trotting in, with ' grandmother's love, and a phial of her mixture for Mr. Eliot-good against camp-distemper and the like.' " Eliot received the mixture as if he had all grandmother's faith in it, slipped a bright shilling into the child's hand for a keepsake, kissed her rosy cheek, and set her down with the children. " Visitors now began to throng. One man in a green old age, who had lost a leg at Bunker's Hill, came hobbling in, and clapping Eliot on the shoulder, said, ' This is you, my boy! This is what I wanted to see your father's son a-doing: I'd go too, if the rascals had left me both my legs. Cheer up, widow, and thank the Lord you've got such a son to offer up to your country-the richer the gift, the better the giver, you know; but I don't wonder you feel kind o' qualmish at the thoughts of losing the lad. Come, Master Hale, can't you say something? A little bit of Greek, or Latin, or 'most any thing, to keep up their perits at the last gasp, as it were.' " I was just going to observe, Major Avery, to Mrs. Lee, respecting our esteemed young friend, Mr. Eliot, that 1, who have known him from the beginning, as it were, having taught him his alphabet, which may be said to be the first round of the ladder of learning (which he has mounted by my help), or rather (if you will allow me, ma'am, to mend my figure) the poles that support all the rounds; having had, as I observed, a primordial acquaintance with him, I can testify that he is worthy every honourable adjective in the language, and we have every reason to hope that his future tense will be as perfect as his past.' ",' Wheugh ! ' exclaimed the major, ' a pretty long march you have had through that speech! ' " The good schoolmaster, quite unruffled, proceeded to offer Eliot a timeworn Virgil; and finished by expressing his hopes that ' he would imitate Caesar in maintaining his studies in the camp, and keep the scholar evenhanded with the soldier.' " Eliot charmed the old pedagogue, by assuring him that he should be more apt at imitating Caesar's studies than his soldiership, and himself bestowed Virgil in his portmanteau. of A good lady now stepped forth, and seeming somewhat scandalised that, as she said, ' no serious truth had been spoken at this peculiar season,' she concluded a technical exhortation by giving Eliot a pair of stockings, into which she had wrought St. Paul's description of the Gospel armour. 'The Scripture,' she feared, did not often find its way to the camp; and she thought a passage might be blessed, as a single kernel of wheat, even sowed among tares, sometimes produced its like.' '" Eliot thanked her, and said, ' it was impossible to have too much of the best thing in the world; but he hoped she would have less solicitude about him, when he assured her that his mother had found place for a pocket Bible in his portmanteau.' " A meek-looking creature now stole up to Mrs. Lee, and, putting a roll of closely-compressed lint into her hand, said, ' tuck it in with his things, Miss Lee. Don't let it scare you-I trust he will dress other people's wounds, not his own, with it.-My! that will come natural to him. It's made from the shirt Mr. Eliot stripped from himself, and tore into bandages for my poor Sam, that time he was scalt. Mr. Eliot was a boy then, but he has the same heart now.' " Mrs. Lee dropped a tear on the lint, as she stowed it away in the closelypacked portmanteau." We cannot resist quoting an anecdote of the hero of the above cleverly depicted scene, related of him during his introductory visit to General WashIDgton. It is amusing and characteristic. ",' Ah, my boy! ' said the colonel, determined to tell his tale out, ' you may say that-there's no courage like that that comes by natur, gin'ral ;--he stood within two feet of me, as straight as a tomb-stone, when, a spent ball bounding near him, he caught it in his hands, just as if he'd been playing wicket, and said, ' you may throw down your bat, my boys; I've caught you out!' Was not that metal"' We cannot close these volumes without especially commending the great propriety of diction they display; we never read a work of this class exhibiting so much care and aptitude in the style: hence each sentiment is conveyed with a degree of force and elegance rarely equalled. May we attribute this high qualification to Miss Sedgwick's evident penchant for Shakspeare ? Her quotations are frequent, and seem, in some instances, quite involuntary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE STRANGE ADVENTURES OF ROGER WILKINS. and other Stories. By R. A. Andom. Illustrated. (Tylton and Edwards.) The effort after facetiousness spoils most of these stories but they have high spirits and ingenuity to set off against some vulgarity and over-strain of humour. The title-story reads like a poor imitation of Mr. Anstey; most of the others are more genuinely amusing. The scheme of the desperate journalist to fleece the prosperous relatives of his friend, the poet Crane, in " Industry and Sloth,' is ingeniously funny, and " Myrtle Farm " may amuse a reader in a mood for farce. But Mr. Andom's fun is apt to seem rather professional.

RUDOLPH AND AMINA, Or the Black Crook. By Christopher Florley. ts. (i'aber & ?aber.) 'The Black Crook" was the title of a ' Grand Magical Spectacular Drama" by Charles M. Barras which was produced in New York in i866, when it met with tremendous success, and was praised by Dickens. Air. Christopher Morley hlas recently revived it in his theatre at Hofboken. He has now taken the plot of this old fairy tale, and retells it in an allusive mischievous manner, elaborating it, to borrow his own words, bv " the uses of anachronism and insinuation." He has succeeded in making an amusing trifle of the kind that will appeal to a sophisticated minority who always prefer listening to a storyteller when he has his tongue in his cheek, but even so it fall, far short of the publishers' encomium with it, flattering reference to Max.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE WOMAN WHO HAD IMAGINATION. By H. E. Bates. 7s. 6d. (Jonathan Cape.) Among modern English men of letters there are sometwo of whom are Mr. A. E. Coppard and Mr. Rhys Davies -who have made the short story their own. By this I mean that, in whatever other fields of literature they have distinguished themselves, they made their arrival and maintain their position by means of the short story. If not the most distinguished of this group, Mr. Bates is the most universal-owing little to Chekhov and Maupassant, and adapting almost all varieties of existence to his original pen. Here he is as versatile as ever, as independent and as human; and his genius for the indirect narrative, begun in " The Two Sisters," is brought to a fine technique. Moreover the author gives us glimpses of a new Batesone who, by means of striking comparisons in characterisation and the dexterous use of background, throws up into the daylight points in the story which a less skilful writer would have allowed to become merged in the general background of shadow. Hitherto, as in " The Day's End " and " The Fallow Land " (both in some ways superior to this work) we have only had hints of this remarkable technique; but here it comes forth in a full and conscious embodiment. " The Water Fall," " The Brothers," " The Lily" and " The Woman Who Had Imagination " itself are all fair examples of this particular type of portraiture. There is however less fire in this volume than in Mr. Bates's earlier work, and I missed the unconscious beauty, the passionate inevitability and economical austerity of " The Day's End." Possibly too his refusal to be governed by any one school has resulted in the domination of too many minor influences in a small space. There are tastes here of Boccaccio, Henry James, Flaubert, Pushkin, Lawrence and David Garnett-all those who, while possessing few conscious disciples, have made the short story in Europe what it is. Nevertheless these are but tastes: and when such pieces have been digested, we are left with a arger taste in our minds-the technique of an author whose inspiration is original. Ashley Sownm

T'hcAe llayor of rinoly-ap and ('arassing. By the O'Hlara Family. 3 vols. 12mo. London, Ifl,35. Sauniders and Otley. Ti i.; O'HIara Family have not presumed upon thieir fairly-earned popularity to assail the pub. lie witit a crowd of books. On the contrary, they (for we speak of themii as they do of themselves)-thiey have heezi too abstinent; and .ionie ten years have rolled awav since we had thle pleastre od communing with them npon matters of fiction in general, and the state of societv in Ireland in particular. Yet so fa. vouIrable as well as lasting has heeni the im. pressionk left on our minds, that we were heartily glad to meet theni again, and recreate ; fezv hours W ith the productions of their talent. TMae .llayor *f Il ind-gap is a tale of national manners, aud, froui the nature of its plot, of considerable interest. The locatc of Vinid.gap, with its curiously-elected mayor, supplies the material for the former; wvhile the latter is maintained by the criminal coniduct and des. perate lortimes of the higher personages in the drama. Itilividnal characters are cleverly drawin ; and Monirteei 31alier, the mayor him. self, is .a whole-length portrait, which stands out well front the canvku.s. We have, ever anud anon, in our notice ot novels, to say, that thley puzzle nis niore than any other class ot' pulbllication, how to commlit.nicate their lineaments tt our readers without ellcroaclkilig upon the mysteries wherein sto SInich of the gratification of their future pe. rusal must rest.

The Bookman 3 : 13 29 - 29
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE SAGHALIEN CONVICT. Pseudonym Library. (T. Fisher Unwin.) But another little volume, also of the Pseudonym Library, comes to take away some of the reproach ' The General's Daughter' casts on Russian fiction-' The Saghalien Convict, and other Stories.' The three first tales at least have one strong distinctive flavour, an atmosphere which enwraps them and divides them from the region of the commonplace. They are pictures of Russian and Siberian life, melancholy enough, the first telling of the adventures of convicts escaped from Saghalien; the second, ' Easter Eve '-an artistic gem -the attempted escape of a convict tramp; and the third, ' Va Victis,' the tale of an insolent attack on a village colony of Dissenters in the forest. But their chief interest is not the convicts or the sentries that watch them, not the invaders or the invaded in ' Vae Victis.' It lies in the spirit which hovers over them all, the spirit of the taiga, the great unbroken forest, the "enchantress " that charms the vagabond in man, that defies civilisation, and shelters outcasts. In these two or three little pictures a strange contrast, though never aggressively asserted, is yet ever present, between the restraint of crime and of power and of the law, and the inextinguishable craving for freedom " blowing iD the breath of the fresh wind of the taiga."

Nelly Carew. By Marguerite A. Power. 2 vols. (Saunders & Otley.)?There is a good deal of interest in the first part of this story, which leads the reader on to hope for a good ending; but in that the author disappoints us, for the story goes off into vapid common-place iu the last volume. We hoped better things from Nelly; she ought by all the laws which govern prophecy, to have turned out a charming heroine. There are graphic* touches of description in the book, and traits of Irish life and character, which show that Miss Power can write pleasantly and observe keenly. Mdlle. Renouard, the French governess, is extremely well described in the beginning, though she afterwards degenerates into a character of the Porte St.-Martin melodrame. 'Nelly Carew' would have been better for being condensed into half its present space.

You Never Know Your Luck : being the Story of a Matrimonial Deserter. By Uilbert Parker. (Hodder & Stoughton, 6s.) As the work of an unknown writer, we should have considered this a pleasant if improbable story ; but it is unworthy of the author of ' The Weavers ' and ' The Right of Way.' The plot turns upon an unopened letter, and the scene is laid in Canada, but in the Western prairie lands instead of the St. Lawrence basin. We do not find the change an improvement. The subtleties of the Indian half-breed and the habitant of French Canada lend themselves much better to Sir Gilbert's style than the blunt, rough-living pioneers of the West. Incidentally, the line which he draws between permissible and forbidden slang for women is interesting; but we must protest against the implication that the practice of opening other people's letters?if the motive is good?is admissible for women, but impossible for men. Apart from this failing, the heroine proves herself an honourable and plucky girl.

LITERATURE. Marty Lamb. By Mrs. Gilchrist. (W. H. I TAN story of Mary Lamb's life is not to any very large extent a history of literary efforts and successes. With the exception of stray verses, and such few articles as she is believed to have contributed to periodicals-like the essay on Needlework which Mrs. Gilchrist has discovered and reprinted-her period of literary activity extended over only three of the eighty-three years of her life. From 1806 to 1809 were produced the Tales from Shakespeare, the JAra. Leiceater's School, and the Poetry for Children, in all of which the pen of her brother played an important part; and they were written under considerable pressure, and with some sense of effort, greatly to help the resources of the modest household, for, as Mary confides to a correspondent at the time when the " Tales " were begun, " it is not well to be very poor, which we certainly are at present." When this external stimulus was removed, her days of authorship practically ended; and, " without this spur, she would never, we may be sure, have dug and planted her little plot in the field of literature, and made it a sweet and pleasant place for the young, where they may play and be nourished, regardless of time and change." Her writings were sufficiently popular with the little people for whom they were prepared, as is testified by the numerous editions of the " Tales" which still continue to be issued, and by the fact that the " Poetry " was not republished in its entirety for many years because it had been simply read out of existence, and no copy could be found for the printer to work from. They possess a gentleness and purity, " a tenderness of feeling and delicacy of taste," which enable us to understand the praise bestowed upon them by Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Landor; but they can hardly be regarded as works of sufficient genius to entitle their author to any very lofty literary pedestal4 The real and surpassing interest of Mary Lamb's life Is a more purely human one. It is her personality and her personal associations that fascinate one-the sweetness and the sadness of her existence. Her history is " mainly the story of a brother and sister's love, of bow it sustained them under the shock of a terrible calamity, and made beautiful and even happy a life which must else have sunk into desolation and despair." To her task of recording this life Mrs. Gilchrist has evidently brought wide reading and accurate knowledge, basing her study chiefly upon the letters of the brother and I sister, and upon the many more or less strictly autobiographic passages which occur in Charles Lamb's Essays. The friends, toogreat many of them, individual all of themwho were so important to the Lambs, that pair who had renounced " the feverish romantic tie of love " for the mere " charities of home," are excellently touched in beside the main figures of the biography, and have assigned to them much the degree of relative prominence which they occupied in the life. Born at Crown Office Row, Inner Temple, in 1764, the year of Hogarth's death, Mary Lamb seems to have passed a somewhat cheerless and unfriended childhood. Shy, nervous, and sensitive, with the seeds in her of the terrible malady which afterwards so often shook her life, her parents never understood her thoroughly, nor bestowed on her the care and tenderness which her delicacy required. Her quiet London life was varied sometimes by a visit to her great-aunt in Hertfordshire, or to her grandmother, who was housekeeper to the Plumers in their mansion of Blakesware; and here, and in the library of Mr. Salt, her father's employer, she made her first acquaintance with the " substantial world of books," harrowing her young fancy with the tales of witchcraft and martyrdoms which the old folios contained. When she was about ten years of age her brother Charles was born, and now her existence had a fresh stimulus, a new and wholesome interest. She was old enough to nurse the infant, and expended upon him an affection which was maternal rather than sisterly in its intensity, and which Charles repaid in after-years with unvarying and self-sacrificing tenderness. It was in 1795 that the great tragedy of Mary Lamb's life was enacted. Worn out by nursing her sick parent and an elder brother, who had been suffering from the results of an accident, and by the unceasing labour of needlework by which she strove to increase the slender resources of the family, her mind gave way, and in a sudden fit of frenzy she stabbed her mother to the heart. In this terrible crisis the whole care of the household fell upon Charles, and he nobly fulfilled the trust. When Mary was able to be removed from the asylum in which she had been placed, he provided lodgings for her, entering into a solemn engagement to take her under his care for lite, and spending with her all his free time on Sundays and holidays. Mrs. Gilchrist proves by a reference to the register of St. Andrew's, Holborn, that the father died in 1799, and not a few months after his wife, as the biographers of the Lambs, from Talfourd to Ainger, have stated. When this event occurred, Mary was received under her brother's own roof, and that life of " double singleness " began which continued for thirtyive years, broken only by the recurrences of mental aberration which required that the sister should be placed in confinement-absences which, as Charles writes so pathetic. ally, " cut sad slices out of the time, the little time we shall have to live together." Of their life Mrs. Gilchrist gives us a pleasant and realisable narrative. It is touching to see the efforts of the pair to glean happiness out of the scanty materials which lay to their hand; how they prized their books and prints, their evenings at the play, the intercourse with their friends, the little Wednesday suppers with the whist and cribbage, "determined," as Charles puts it, "to take what snatches of pleasure we can between the acts of our distressful drama, like those, as it has been finely said, who, ' having just escaped earthquake or shipwrek, find a thing for grateful tears in the mere sitti quiet at home, under the wall, till the end of days.'" Perhaps the clearest picture of Mary Lamb's character and personality that we can have is given in the long series of letters to Miss Stoddart, afterwards Mrs. Hazlitt. Here we see, in quite a singular way, her sweetness and gentlen as of nature, her rare prudence and tact-h.> ve all, her wide and genial tolerance. FYw norrespondents and advisers can write in a trbin like this:Ad I know I have a knack of looking into people's real character, and never expecting them to act out of it, never expecting another to do as I would in the same case. . . . All this gives me no offence, because it is your nature and your temper, and I do not expect or want you to be otherwise than you are. I love you for the good that is in you, and look for no change." So the life of brother and sister passed on, broken, yearly or oftener, by Marys terrible illnesses, which seem to have followed like a Nemesis on any country holiday or change or unusual excitement and gaiety, the brother watching over his companion with a solicitude which was all the tenderer and more unwearied because he himself had suffered in early life from a similar seizure, and knew the bitterness and desolation that it brought, the two growing wonderfully like each other as the years went over them, so that in time the sister came to be a kind of softer and sweeter reflex and echo of her brother's thoughts and voice. '< When they were in company together, her eyes followed him everywhere; and even when he was talking at the other end of the room, she would supply some word he wanted." She had " a way of repeating his words assentingly when he spoke to her. He once said, with his abrupt, peculiar mode of tenderness beneath blunt, abrupt speech, 'You must die first, Mary.' She nodd with her little quiet nod and sweet smile, 'Yes, I must die first, Charles.'" But the fates had ordered it otherwise; the brother died in 1834, and then followed the long, recordless years-not eleven, as Talfourd says, but nearly thirteenwhich elapsed before she was laid by his side in the grave at Edmonton. Mrs. Gilchrist is to be congratulated on the clearness and interest of her narrative, on the success with which she has placed before us one of the gentlest and most pathetic figures of English literature. l J. M. GRAY.

THE LITERARY EXAMINER. Strife and Peace: or Scenes in K Frederik a. Bremer. Ai.tkn.*^- _* ?**"lf. Bt rreoenka Bremer, Authoress of the^V .*?* hours," fcc. TranslatedfromtheSweSuk vVThe H-Family. By Frederik fire^ Splated from the Swedish. Smith. 'Thl1*Miss Bremers genius is beconiiii*: a lu**perty among us. There are fewwho hTpl0' made friends and favourites of rjs^tacula*ii? ** ters in her books. It is Ma CheireSp C^(s some ; large-nosed Petrea with others ? with *** it is the good President, and daughters K$? and Ldia; with none, we suspect, the lEr* Hagars, or Saras, with all, we tope, thVexSlH)i, Governess, the good Judge and his Wife, and!?1 pre-eminently delightful Bear and Bearest A ? ters fame and genius are established beyond ferr?' ? question who can give this solid existence to Z - creatures of her laney?-who, for herself and al I list of visiting acquaintance too, finds fireside m0>% at the small home circle : as well in her own kn? as wherever her works extend. ' Very recently we spoke of the qualities of Mi*, Brcmer's genius which have secured this \aT success. In the stories before us, and especially that of Strife and Peace, they are delightfully exhibited. With the quaint and novel seat o exquisite local painting?always attractive in such primitive scenes as tbe Norwegian and Swede--! they have that marvellous truth to nature which embraces all manners, all sympathies, and all countries aud conditions. The inexplicable defect of her former stories is abtent from Strife and Peace : we have no monstrosity like the Brunos the Saras, or the Hagars, which in the rest of her w ritiiigs offer so strange a contrast to the fidelity a:)d courage, to the unflinching reality, of her general portraiture of life. The story also, though slight, is, unlike the writer's ordinary manner simply and plainly constructed; and in other point* inferior to none of its fellows. It paints the natural characteristics of Norway with splendid success ? and it points the invaluable moral which gives added beauty to all Miss Bremer'3 works?the Christian lesson of duty and of love, and the truth so important to the welfare of us all, that it is by good, and not by evil, the evil ofthe world it to be overcome. In this agreeable tale, there is only one truly sorrowful, moody, suffering person; and at ita close, in this language which she uses, we read itt tendency and purpose. 44 4 Oh, that I could speak to all bowed down, despairing souls, I would cry to them,?Lift up your heads, believe still in the future, and think still, ti ts wot too late. See! I too was bowed down with sorrow; old age had overtaken me, and I thought my strength was gone?that my life, my sufferings had been in vain. And behold! my head is lifted up, my heart is whole, my soul strong, and now, in my fiftieth year, I enter upon a new future, surrounded by all that life has most beautiful and lovely. 44 4 The change in my soul has taught me to understand life and sufferings better; and I know now that there ia no fruitless suffering?that no virtuous endurance is vain. Providence has lifted the veil from my eyes while I am yet upon the earth; for many, it will be raised only when the eyes close upon the earthly day. All will then see and know what I now with joy and gratitude acknowledge. 44' Clear and bright hes now my way before me. Assisted by my beloved children, by the friend and teacher of my youth, who will, I hope, pass under my roof tne evening of his days, will I convert this region into a valley of peace. And when I shall leave it, and my loved ones, may my memory be pleasant to them! And, now, thou advancin*rage, whose cool breath I already feel upon my brow, thoa wintertwilight of life, whose shades are already gathering about me, come and be welcome! I fear you no longer?44 4 And in bodily weakness and suffering, too, I will still acknowledge the worth of life, and with a heart open to sB that is beautiful and good upon earth, I will say to my beloved ones,? f ? 44 4 The peace of heaven dwells within my heart. The real heroine, who has also her discontent*, though not of the moody kind; and whose ?W0?B" tents, and contentments too, go to make un the temporary Strife which her courage, gcodaNtt* and self sacrifice turn to lasting Peace; * *> higher or better in station than a Swedish ****** in the household of a noble lady of Norway. ?*? loves with her frank and cordial nature; a*1 with something that the world and its wayii?? dashed her nature with, supposes herself tbs eojea of indifference to those she loves.

Before her waddled a troop of geese, gabbling SKlv: all white but one?a gray one. The gray goose fci with a timid, hesitating air, a little behind the rit^compelled to retain this position by a tyrant in the i^llock, who drove him back with outstretched neck !wS load cry. whenever he attempted to approach the rest. Xi noor gray alwayt retreated before his white oppressor, k t bare spots upon his head and neck proved that he had !!!uAllen mto this abject condition before he had convinced J?m*elf hythe severest proofs, of the inefficacy of all re^Jrfrance. None of the other geese concerned themselves "hout their ill-used brother, on which account Susanna took Jim troder her especial protection, and endeavoured, by Uamtv morsels and kind words, to console him for the injustice of his kind. After the geese came the demure but lumsy ducks, the petulant turkey-cock, with his awkward JLoes?one black and one white?last, came the turbulent rtceof chickens, with their stately, pugnacious cocks. The Prettiest of all the party were a flock of pigeons, who timidly, yet confidenHy at the same time, now alighted on Susanna's shoulder and outstretched hand, now rose in the air tad flew in shining circles round her head; then dropDing to the earth, tripped on their little fringed feet, to drink at the spring; while the geese, with loud noise, plunged splashing into the river, and threw the water over the grass in a pearly shower. Here, too, to Susanna's treat vexation, was the gray goose compelled to bathe at a distance from the others." The poor gray goose ! He has our sympathies, and seems to deserve them, till one luckless day, a few months later, when we find ourselves again in the farm-yard; and observing that the white tyrant, by an accident, has lost his power and consequence, we discover that the gray, instead of show- j'' m<r a generous spirit, retaliates in full whatever his enemy had inflicted. The upshot is, that white goose and gray, before the spirit of peace which presides over Susanna's wedding, lay down their contentious lives ; and are united in a magnificent e* Ai daube served up and consumed on that great day. fn? h- Family wants the clear, simple, definitive purpose of Strife and Peace; and it is disfigured by a personage of the Hagar school more detestable than the worst of her class ; but it has a number of charming natural pictures which at once reach the heart; its domestic lessons are valuable; it enforces wise views of the just duties and proper enjoyments of existence; and in short, with many defects, thoroughly vindicates the genius and womanly truth of Miss Bremer. Before we touch upon any main features of the story, we must mention two sketches in the writer's very best manner. Tbe scene opens on a cold night of snow and sleet at the Stockholm barrier, where a custom-house officer with a red nose presents himself, drily refuses a piece of gold which the traveller would have slipped into his hand to secure herself an undisturbed ride, and proceeds mo3t civilly to perform his duty. The talkative driver has meanwhile elicited some circumstances of his humble history: he is very poor, and says with a deep sigh that he has four children. " After the inspector had convinced himself that a goodly variety of cheeses, loaves of bread, and ginger-cakes, made up the principal part of the lading of the sleigh, he replaced everything in the neatest order, gave me his hand to assist me into it, and carefully tucked the furs about me. My ill-humour had vanished long ago. Is it, thought I, the fault ofthe poor inspector, that he is the plague and torment of travellers ? This one, certainly, has performed his duty ia the most civil manner. And while he went on to restore everything to its place, carefully and conscientiously, restore everything to its place, carefully and conscientiously, various considerations arose in my mind, which disposed me to still more kindness. The red, frozen nose, the depressed expression of countenance, the stiff fingers, the poor children, the snow-storm, the dark, dismal evening, all these passed before me like the shadows in a camera ob seora, and my heart was quite softened by them. I felt again after the piece of money. I thought of some gingerbread and a cheese for the four children's supper; but while I was feeling, and while I was thinking, the man opened the bar, took off his hat politely, and I quickly passed through the gateway. I would have cried out * Halt!' but I did not With an oppressed heart and uncomfortable feelings, as if I had lott something valuable on the way, I proceeded through the city, and saw in the white snowflakes before me, as in a transparency, the frozen red nose tad sad face, on which I might so easily, at least for a mosient, have called up a cheerful look. H How many occasions of doing good, in grater or less measure, are passed by from irresoTution! While we are ?tying to ourselves, ' Shall I, or shall I not V the moment flies away, and the blossom of joy which we might have given to it is withered, and often cannot be revived by any tetra of repentance." So* when the traveller reaches home, and finds totelf at the cheerful tea-table of the well-bghted, well-warmed room, the frosen nose she has left at *? g*te places itself in the midst of her pleasure, " on the very edge of her tea-cup." The picture is troth itself. Wehave all had our red-nosed officer. l*t ua all endeavour to be careful, for the future, to delay no good thing till to-morrow which may ?* dene Co-day. Oar second picture is from the dote of the story, w this we can only refer to. Mies Charlotte *?***, who wee timveliinf to the H-Family **? the last incident eetwafi^ifonhef wmytoe *" home, with Waiker Bohine Belt, when a ?^?tatnjUi and gaetiissss in the good Mtv *?* *????:sse I***** Um Cihn Min U ssi li aWtt Hiss ?^-wasrwaT. aMteawt?Vn?<tw?c*K(rl the school of Miss Ronnquist; and the two, with J j the help of dear Bearcss in the Neighbours, will assist the biographer of Miss Bremer we suspect, when (be the day distant!) her biography ia to be written. Sensible, affectionate, clear-headed, finehcarted womcu?full of sympathy, forbearance, kindness, and courage?to* whom" no service is mean, and no condition humble, which implies the preservation of self-respect, and tbe sense of duty discharged. The letter which has called the good Beata to her | friends, the ll-Family, is written by the giddy young Julia; it summons her to sister Emily's wedding, and gives significant intelligence of what is shortly to befal herself. " At first, my father was opposed to my marriage, and had many objections, so that it was nearly given up. But I threw myself upon my knees and wept, and Arwid's father (a friend of my father's youth) talked so eloquently, and Arwid himself seemed so cast down, that my father at last was moved, and said, 4 Well, they may have one another !' and Arwid and I rejoiced like two young larks. You will come to see him ; he has a dark heard and moustaches, great blue eyes, the most beautiful?hut you will see him?you will see him. He has the most beautiful son de voix in the world; and Emily may say what she pleases, it sounds delightfully, really charmingly, when he says, 4 The thousand take nie !' it sounds strangely, you may think ; but you will see, you will hear!" To which, in one of several postscripts, it is added : 44 P.S. Do you know who is to marry Emily .' Professor j L-, who is so horribly serious, has a twisted foot, a red j eye, and two warts on his nose. He entered the ministry a short time since. My father esteems and loves him much. It seems to me I should not like to be married by a crosseyed minister. But I shall he married in a couple of years, or perhaps in the autumn; it is not worth while to think of this yet." Here we have an Adonis in moustaches, and a horribly serious Professor with a great many pcrj sonal disadvantages. It seems a settled thing: Adonis at the winning-post, and the Professor nowhere. But alas ! in Sweden as in other lands, the way of a Julia's will is hard to find, and harder to hit. Adonis misses after all, and before the tale is done, changes place with the Professor. For the young lady has learnt in the course of the tale that you may look through * great blue eyes ' into a very senseless unmeaning person; and that along with *a twisted foot, a red eye, and two warts on the nose,' you may discover so much truth of heart, so much wealth of mind and solid worth of character, so much of all that can accommodate the inequalities of life and fortune, that, in comparison with them, blue eyes and fine noses and straight feet are but crab-apples in a paradise of fools. And when Julia, ascertaining this or something like it, leaves Arwid and his splendid equipage, for the humble home ofthe poor Professor?tbe reader himself has come to be in love with her, with all his heart. We cannot speak of any other part of the substance of this tale, or mention half the natural incidents and touches it contains. We have on this account the less scruple in passing its defects without particular remark ; such as the causeless fears of Emily about her marriage, the foreign family from which the Cornet steals his wife, and the connexion of Colonel H-and Elizabeth. Most beautiful is the character of Helen, whose plainness and personal defects only dispose her to more active duties of kindness and sympathy with others. The tutor of the little Thickeys (so called from their size?being: the least and broadest of the from their size?being tbe least ana oroaaest 01 me H? family) is amusing, though a faded copy of dear Dominie Sampson; and a doubt which falls over one of the solemn and earnest schemes of these adventurous yet cautious youngsters, is delicious. The scheme is to dig through the earth, and so prepare a little surprise for the family; and tbe doubt which stops them, is not that they might fail, but that possibly, having succeeded, they might themselves fall through at the same moment: " and where should they stop ?" There is one favourite piece of truth, which Miss Bremer often introduces. Wewmean that which courageously mingles the demisras of such a common thing as appetite with the demands of a thing so lofty as romantic passion, which bringa together parlour and kitchen, and presents the * web of life * as it really and sincerely is. Madame H-has had a sudden accession of grief: " After a moment I followed Madame H-to the bedroom, but she was no longer there; her prayer-book lay open upon the sofa; the leaves bore the traces of tears. At last I found her, after I bad passed through all the rooms to the kitchen, where she wat reproving the cook for forgetting to cut off the cutlets from the breast of lamb that wat crackling over the fire." So the Cornet, driven in despair and suffering to take refuge in a store-room, cannot resist, tbe claims of hunger. Bat we must stop here; with a word of thanks to the publisher of these stories for the cheap price at which they are published. They are translations done iii Anserine; and excellent To Mrs Howitt beJotie* the well, deserved praise of having mtroduced mai fkumm to America as well as to EqrJ^iid, ajasong other ber otra, It.*e*di*? elMttker. ^

Passages in the Life of a Lady
Aide, Hamilton
-------------------------------------------------------------
Passages in the Life of a Lady. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. By Hamilton Aide. 3 vols. (Hurst & Blackett.) Mr. Aide's new novel shows an accomplished and agreeable writer at his best. He has not chosen a large canvas to work upon, but what this picture of society in the years 1814-16 thereby loses in breadth it gains in finish. The characters in this " small drama," as he modestly terms it, are not numerous, but the individuality of each is sustained throughout both in speech and action. Mr. Aide has before given evidence of the possession of a keen perception of the workings of the feminine mind in its apparent inconsistencies and abrupt transitions, but he has never produced a more elaborate or successful picture than that of Lady Craven, the mother of the heroine and the unconscious cause of nearly all the troubles which befall the latter. Her artistic, impulsive nature?a bundle of anomalies?is cleverly described. The gradual alteration of her feelings towards her son-in-law, passing from infatuation to dissatisfaction, and thence to active dislike of the man whom she had plotted with all the strength of her indomitable will to secure for her daughter, is naturally indicated. All is coherent and circumstantial. There is nothing in the whole course of the story to impose a serious tax upon the reader's powers of belief. Mr. Aide never rises beyond the level of genteel tragedy, but he is always refined, and, if he fails to stir the depths of his reader's soul, carries him pleasantly along in the flow of his narrative. The minor characters afford an effective contrast and relief to the main plot. The Hon. Dugald Macpherson is an excellent portrait in miniature of the quatorzieme of the period; in Lady Stylton we have the incarnation of that frank vulgarity occasionally encountered in persons of high degree ; Mrs. Priam is an agreeable type of honest rusticity; while John Darville represents disinterested virtue not unrewarded in the long run. Local and contemporary colouring is skilfully, though lightly laid on. We encounter historic personages, but Mr. Aide has wisely refrained from introducing them into the dialogue. As becomes a musician, he has made allusion to more than one of the celebrities of that period, notably Miss Kitty Stephens and Braham. Is it likely, however, that Schubert, before he was nineteen, should have written a Lied in the album of a fine Russian lady of fashion ? In Nadine?the lady in question ?Mr. Aide has essayed the difficult task of portraying the conflicting elements which go to make up the Slav nature, and if the result is hardly comparable to the creations of Tolstoi or Tourguenief, it is, at any rate, a clever sketch. Nadine is a "splendid animal," capable at once of ungovernable fits of passion and diplomatic duplicity. One of the best scenes in the book is that in which, during the visit which Col. Bethune has induced his wife to pay Nadine, who has been his mistress, the latter uses the most refined ingenuity to make Imogen feel her inferior attractiveness at every turn. It is true that Mr. Aide is at his best amid the "buzzings of the social gnats," and yet he is not wanting in a certain vein of sedate pathos, shown, for example, in the parting scene between Imogen and her husband. Writing, as a rule, with considerable ease and finish, Mr. Aide makes occasional use of expressions to which exception can be legitimately taken. A "falchion-like glance" is not a very happy metaphor ; but this is eclipsed by two curious slips, for which the printer?responsible in all probability for the maltreatment of some foreign words, such as somovar?cannot be held to blame. The first of these is the expression "on suffrage," a delightful malaprop for " on sufferance "; the other is the strange form " elyptical " as applied to a person's mode of speech. But after making the most liberal deductions for such blemishes, ' Passages in the Life of a Lady' is a novel which ie welcome to the reviewer, and will find general acceptance with the public. '

Uncle Max
Carey, Rosa Nouchette
-------------------------------------------------------------
Uncle Max. By Rosa Nouchette Carey. 3 vols. (Bentley & Son.) Bruetonys Bayou. By John Habberton. (Chatto & Windus.) 'Uncle Max,' which is told in the first person, is a record of the troubles and fortunes of one Ursula Garston, a nice young woman with 300/. a year, who becomes so terribly weary of her life at Hyde Park Gate with a worldly aunt and cousin that she qualifies herself as a nurse, and determines to be useful to her fellow creatures. She settles down in the country parish of her Uncle Max, and there she does a great deal of nursing, in a thorough and workmanlike way. She also meets with a doctor, who is to exercise an abiding influence on her future life, and a considerable part of the story which she tells is occupied with the doctor's relations, one of whom is a black sheep, and causes not a little mischief to other people as well as to herself. The characters of this story are sufficiently lifelike. The goodness of some is, perhaps, a trifle too unctuous; but the author's style? or at any rate Miss Ursula Garston's?is, on the whole, simple and unaffected. There is plenty of conversation in the book, but not many incidents or striking reflections. The interest is sober, and for the most part domestic; and the number of novel-readers who prefer well-written narratives of this class is probably quite as large as the number of those who crave abundant sensation.

Miss Nancy Stocker
Blatherwick, Charles
-------------------------------------------------------------
Miss Nancy Stocker. By Charles Blatherwick. 2 vols. (Chapman & Hall.) Mr. Blatherwick's two thin volumes enclose the story of a couple of wills, and of the complications arising out of the fraudulent substitution of one for the other. The old lady who had drawn them up, in favour of her son and nephew respectively, kept them in terrorem under her pillow, having carefully labelled them "Harry" and "Dick." When she ordered one to be burnt, her companion, in the interests of the man who was to have been left penniless, destroyed the other?and hence arose the mischief which the rest of the story is engaged in setting right. Mr. Blatherwick aims at humour, and in his jokes he attains a certain measure of success. If the reader occasionally craves for a little more seriousness, he will hardly restrain an occasional smile at the quaintness of the author's mannerisms.

Bruetonys Bayou
Habberton, John
-------------------------------------------------------------
The place which Mr. Habberton has chosen for the title of his novelette is supposed to lie somewhere near the Mississippi, in the border lands between the Northern and Southern States. It affords a capital scene for a fresh bit of character study and for an effective contrast between New York sharpness and the open-handed, oldfashioned simplicity and dignity of the Southern planters. Stories made out of such materials are always welcome. Mr. Habberton's story is agreeably told, with much appreciation of salient characteristics, with a humour which he wisely keeps well in hand, and not without a touch of true feeling. It might be wished that he would free himself from some colloquial phrases, which do very passably in the ordinary books of American humour, but are rather out of place in a story which is, on the whole, very well written. That he is sensitive in the matter of style is shown by the shiver with which he makes his New York young man hear a Southern girl say, "I don't make out what you are driving at." But in this case he goes to an absurd extreme. English readers, too, could spare some of tho negro's conversation in his tiresome dialect.

Fiction TOMASO'S FORTUNE. By H. Seton Merriman. (Smith, Elder, 6s.) The untimely death of Mr. Seton Merriman removed a.writer of very real ability from the ranks of novelists. This volume of short stories, if not equal in interest to his novels, is well above t*jie average. Most of the stories are slight, hardly stories at ell^ mere suggestions or rough sketches. But it is, the slight incident wit Mr. Merriman handled with such peculiar skill and charm. He had the light touch, the power of suggestion which make such sketches valuable. He was never prolix, but knew exactly where to begin and where to end. Occasionally he compresses a whole story into a few pages?a very rare gift. None of the stories in the present volume are at all sensational or even exciting, but they interest and give pleasure. They are, as it were, small slices cut out of life, full of its indefinable mystery, replete with its possibilities, and showing various moods. Many of the stories are laid in picturesque Spain, the peasant life of which Mr. Merriman delineates with happy effect. The story with which the book opens, "Sister," is related by an army surgeon. It is a mere incident of war. A man desperately wounded and blinded by the explosion of a gun; a womanly, soft-fingered nurse to whom he babbles in his death agony, mistaking her for the girl who awaits his return down in Devonshire; the signing of the death certificate- -a slice off life rescued for us from oblivion.

By .-1011- WarLI lV KAVE. 2 vols. London: Itichard Bentley. (Owmtinufelfrom p. .) Wils'. 1)eog had fallen, Lord Lake marched on Ilhurtpore. Ilhurtinre was the strongest of the Iliun thrtresles, and was reputed impregnable. So at thik tiie it alipared to lx*. Four times the Eiglish troops were repulsed from its walls. Not till many years later-when, Metcalfe himself thmeni a second time Itosideit at Dlelhi, siggestvid awl co-operated in the siegL-did the Emglish ensign wave over the relics of its towers. Lake turned the siege itito a blockade; routed a formidlabl force that nmarched to its relief; and was reckoning conflideiti on taking the place, whei tie news arrivedl from Calcutta that the Iajahi had nccepted terms, and that peace was coninf led. S, lvtealfe, findiig himself no longer required to ' urse thm e lKing's offieers,' was thinking of returining to (overniment-house. Lord Wellesley w.as sailiig for Englandi and Charles longed to rvim hder generous homago and parting thanks to his lk-nefaictor. Iut a certain Colonel Malcolm (IIn' inted tle young liplounatist that, without tIvtrhmeit to his charactor for gratitude, he would do wisely to remain and tight his battle in the wide field Of civil distinction that was 11W opening in 'entral India. le yielded to this logic, and wrote a warm and earnest letter of thanks to the ''gloriout4 little man," who had, indeed, well doserved it bv educating and starting Metcalfoon his carer. Their friendship remained ever after undiminished : Und when Sir Charles Metealfe, ex-(;ovvrnor-(General of Inidis, returned to Eug. land more tham thirty years afterwards, one of the first and gruatest of the pleasures of his return came in a meeting with Lord Wellesley and his brother the great Duke, and a conversation on their Oriental recollections of these early days. The peacc was unpopular, as every peace is unpopular, in the camp. Metcalfe felt the military ardour, and wrote Indignant letters to his friends at ('alctta. The peace was "Inglorious," unstable, disgraceful. SA thought the army, and so thought Metcalfe. But Metcalfe's postscript destroyed his argument. " Send us money: we want money," was the tenor ; and the Company just tln haid no more money to send. Lord Cornwallis, the new Governor General, had boon sent out expressly to construct a Peace policy for the relief of the financial embarrassments. It was thought--most unjustly-that his predecessor Nul been too martial in his propensities. So Lord Lake's oocupation, was taken from himLord Lake, who*, like a true soldier, thought the state of nature a stateof war; and whose military code of education and conduct was contained in tl apopithegn, " D- your writing; mind your fighting." The army went into cntonments. and Charles Metcalfe started as assistant to the Resident Envoy at Delhi, or (as he always spelt it, to the admiration of his old tutor Dr. Goodall) Diblee. He was now in his twenty-second year, and a ripe diplomatist. It was time that he should be so; for his duties began to lhe of a delicate as well as an onerous nature. Delhi was the capital and palace of the Great Mogul. There, shorn of all the substance. but retaining all the lustre of empire, the last Merovingians of the East slurn. bored in their seraglios. Externally, all homage -all honour-all supremacy was his. The Com. pany held him as their vassal, but bowed down to hint as their master. 200,0001. a year, paid regularly, was the consideration-money given for the virtual sale of this gorgeous empire. But while everything was done in the name of the Rajah, all magistracy and final resort liy at the knees of the Company's representative, the Resident: and when Metealfe joined the station, the gentleman who held this office had carried to the extreme every deferential attention by which the pangs and wounded vanity of fillen royalty could be alleviated. Metcalfe, with all his itatural delicacy, thought that of the Resident excessive. and even dangerous. An alarming riot, which the new Asi sistant-lHosident was first and foreniost in quelling, demonstrated the wisdom of his fears. On this phase of Metcalfe's character there will probably he divided views. 11e never attempted to justify the systematic progress of English intervention in Indian afthirs. (n the contrary, when he had become a moember of the Supreme Council, lie expressed a strong sentiment against such a policy. But he thought, most wisely, that when intervention had begun, it was weakness and madness to stamp it with a characterof uncertainty and vacillation. He entertained also a strong opinion of the total unfitness of the Indian races for self-government. And, although his was not a casulstry to defend iniquity by expediency, none could be more alive to the diticulty of solving satisfactorily, on any but practical principles, the great providential missions and political problems of European progress and colouisation. 1le took facts as they existed, societies as they were constituted. l1u was for advancing, because he thought it the only way to avoid a retreat. 11e left his phluophiy in his closet, and devoted himself manfully to the intelligible and prac. ticable work of preservation and amelioration. When the Delhi Assistant had been two years at his post, and had earned a namne for ability and assiduity which was the talk of Governmenthouse; a third Governor-General, Lord Minto, was looking apprehensively towards the countries eyond the utlej and the Indus. There roamed the vast predatory hordes of the great Sikh nation, un lr the sovereignty of the wily Rajah Runjeet Simgh. It was thought that France, cooperating with Persia and aided by the Sikhs, night descend on the ftir provinces of British India. To avert the contemplated junction, Metcalfe was sent as special ambassador to Runjoet, and instructed to employ every weapon of diplomacy to gain his end. lie was to travel with military escort, and a full suite; but to act unhampered and unaided by counsellors. The young man had recently entered on his twentyfourth year, and might well be proud of the estimation that had placed him on such a mission. But he proved himself equal to it; and Oriental guile found its overmatch in European tact and honesty. Metcalfe had always a very peculiar, but very successful mode of dealing with insincerity and falsehood. 1le did not parry with similar wveapos ; but pressed home his own genuine views so dexterously and manfully that, even when defeated-which was not often the case-his defeat had none of the ignominy of a failure. So while Runject, fromin day to day and week to week, was spending every native and acquired art in attempts to circumvent the young envoy; the latter coolly, patiently, and with admirable temper bided his time-conciliated and threatened at the true critical moments-and flually concluded the desired treaty. His reputation was made. lie had started well. 1le had passed rapidly up the first and iimost arduous steps to fortune and distinction; and, although not yet a great man-which he had resolved to be-le was henceforward marked for certain and( progressive preferment. Lord Minto sent for him to compliment and consult him. Hie became for a short time the Governor's assistantsecretary. Then followed a mission, equally brief, to the court of his old enemy, Scinldial; and this was succeeded by his presentation to one of the most dazzling prizes in the civil service. The Residency at 1Delhi was now vacant ; andi the ex-Assistant, bearing Lord Minto's diploma, at the age of twenty-six, re-entered the Imperial City, as Resident. He was now in possession of rank, and was aspiring to wealth. Notwithstanding all the cant ,f philosophers against riches; and notwithstanding that Metcalf was, to a great extent, himself a philosopher of the old r6jime; he had an honest and a manly sense that money and independence are all but synonymous and convertible terms. He felt also that, of the imperfect criteria which life affords of worldly desert, the accumulation of a fortune is far from being the worst ; and that it symbolises better than an)ything else the results of methodical, consistent, and indefatigable industry. We do not apprehend that this subordinate ambition will lower him in I the eyes of any well-judging critic. Ie had mapped out the future of his life. lic sought to serve his country, and utilise his whole career; and to do so, he was rightly resolved to build on a secure foundation of personal independence. There was little danger of his prudence becoming parsinony. The Delhi Resideit drew a splendid salary, and determined to lay by a certain sum monthly. But when he came to strike his ordinary balances, lie found it impossible to curtail materially those large itenms that figured on his debtor-sheet as gifts to charities, Imor pensioners, and friends, whose naies his delicacy only intimated by initial letters. That large and generous heart impaired sadly the conelusions and resolutions of that provident aid capacious brain. His hospitality was princely, as became the representative of his nation. And of that position and its duties---even in externals -none had a higher or more chivalrous sense through life than Charles Metcalfe. So the reserve-fund at first was a failure ; then it was remodelled, and became a success ; and whenm, after thirty-eight years of life in India, he returned to England, lie had the satisfaction of hearing with him a noble fortune, which had been acquired without the memory of an action to excite a blush -witjouth an oission to tarnish a character for unbounded liberAlity. Yet Metcalfe, though now almost greaf. was fafrom being happy. Wealth and honours were flowing in; but still the something prompted a frequent, if not an eternal sigh. Rarely had fortune regarded an Indian a(venturer with a more consistent smile of expanding benirnity Was that early disappointment, that hovish fancy, still rankling at the core? l1e had been leven years absent from England at the time when he wrote to his aunt the letter to which we have already referred, and of which the following is an extract :Why should you make yourself and Williao mise. -able by parting never perhaps to meet again ?Why? loom him to tran'lportation from everything dear to him? What is there in India to recompeine for such -ufferings? Fortunes, as you juitly observe, are not made rapidly. Take iiy sitiation. I have been more than eleven ycars from England- and it will be certainly more ttan eleven years before I can re:urn. In these twenty-two or twenty-four year. the best part of my life will have passed away-that part in which all my feelings wil1 have been1 most alive to the difrerent sensations of happiness and misery arising out of diffrent circumstances. I left :ny father and mother just as I became acquainted with then as a man. I have not once had their cheering smile to encourage my labours in my profession. Wheu I return, should they both be alivewhich I pray to God that they nay be-I shall, in. heed, have the happiness of attending on lieir dedining years; but, alas! how much caust shall I ave to lament that I was doomed by my fate not o see them from the days of bovhood to those of heir extreme old age ? lut suppose that they bould not be alive-and when one considers that my father muist live to lie eighty to allow ine to see him again, It is enough to unake one tremble, though I still hope-suppose, I say, that the%, should not be alive, what will then be iy situation ? The thought is too horrible to dwell u on. See my sisters? I left them children. I shal find themf old womenMarried, perhaps, into families which will not care one farthing about mie, and whose habits it will not suit me to associate with. Take thme worst, and what a nmelanceholy situaltion I may be in when I eturn to En gland . Where will be may connections, my friendships, and even my acqjuaiitance ? I nsnown in society, amid even shnuned as being an Indian, I certainly will never push may way into thme society of fine lords and ladies, myho my turn up their noses and think mie highly honoured by being il their presence. Strong-minded Mrs. Metcalfe, if she saw this letter, must have canvassed the propriety of sending out Charles another box of pills ; and Charles would probably have ordered physic in his case to be thrown to the dogs. Whether the physiologist or the psychologist would have the best ot the argument, it is certain that 'harles was far from content. 1le longs for home almost as much as when Miss D- was fresh in his mind ; and we fear that at this period, the one ineffhiecable image-the one fatal remembranceno longer threw its bleak shade on either his joys or his woes. There is no allusion to her : but ile tells his aunt that he shall never marry, for Ie no longer believes in harmoniotis and kindred spirits. A kind, gossiping, confidntial, good old aunt this iust have been. 1i1, would not have dared, we will answer fr it, to talk such enitiment to Mrs. Metcalfe. le yearns to return to Elngland ; but fears, after all. that hs epitaph will be like " the geitk'ntaiN w)ho dicd of stopping one year longer :liere lies Mr. Wan lermcre, Who was to liie goine iorne nuxt year.

There is mo ither service in lhich a man dies not sce li frionds somctimes. Here it is perletual banisinunt. There was a good reason for sending sons to India w hei fortunes were male rapidly, and they returned homne. lint if a man is to slave all his life, he had better do so, in my opinion, in his own country, where lie may iijoiy the society of his friends, which I call enjoviI g life. . . . ..

All this maiay he only poor querulous human na. ture-thie grumblingof the characters in Ioracm's first satire. But we give tie-e passages iot only to serve as consolation to those whose fathers are not in a position to bring them up to be Governors-General ; but as showing the sttfr of which Metcalfe's heart was made; and how the warni tide of human fevling, and lit-rhaps of human folly, fiowel inder the indurations and external ossifications of the diplomatist's life. And it imust always be remembered, by sneerers and smilers, that. if Metealfte felt oi many points like a boy-if lie continued to love his relations and friends, as he loved them through lif, with a childlike depth and sincerity, and uaffected sitmplicity-the man, the diplomatist, tih statesman, was always ready and vigilant at his post to encounter, to grapple with, and to overcome, the most astute and cold-blowled professors of worldly chicanery. li worked out well, and exemplified well the truth of the German IWet's axiomil, that we should fi'4 as entithusiasts, and see as the worldly-wise. And men such as Metealfe have never been wanting, with power to expose and crush, and overwhelm even with merciless ridicule when necessary. those titular " men of the world" who Imistake their owi callosity for wisdom, and time sensibilities of their neighlours for weakness. We must pass rapidly over tie remaining events of Metcalfe's Indian career. When time first difficulties of a life are overcome. much of the interest iii its progress, whether in truth or fiction, ceases. Prosperity seldom prescuts many salient points for narrative. Akteadfe's great object, during his residence at Delhii, was the readjustment and settlement of the Central Indian States. The Mahrattas and Pindarrees were a constant source of apprehension. Tlhe Iajah of Bhurtpore was equally dangerous as frienid or foe. Metealfe had studiedi the question deeply; and the result was a conviction in his own minid-which lie comnmunicated in a 1most able minute to Lord Moira, the then Gover- nor-(cenral--that, in the ieventt (of in1)g11etunding circulstaiie..; the substanitive state iot' CentralI iIndia, uslieciaily the iindarrees. must w ainihi - lateil.

Colonel Malcil-n had also increased his restlessness. lr rev iin the idea of making C( ntral India a great agencv. It was thiught for a time that this wouild 1be done. and that Metcalfe would have the appointment. But the scliene was dropped: and the IHyderabad residencY because vacant. It was offered to Metcalt., who gladly resigned for it his golden servitude it Calcutta. unt, if' Delhi w.as no sinecure. Hyderalad was at labyrinth of' difficulti es. Metcalf fougit his way through them manfully and skilfully: but. without sowing wind, was destined to reji only the whirlwind. The great problem was financial. Rajah Chundoo-Lall was a stilmndiary of the Company, and exceeded his income. 'I le great house of Palner amd ,*o.. at Calcutta. had assisted him with loans at usurious interest, which had fallen into arrears-had ben capitalized-and subjected to every firm of arithmetical progressin, that the most extended principles of! simple ain,] compound interest could suggest. The Palinrs were stuprem at Calcutta. Lord Hastings hintsclf was of atlini ty t to them. Ail now aniother comtnnectiin, a Sir William Huntibold. had comue out from n gland. eager to maitke a fortune by the shortest poanible nians. New pri'cts fr pillaging the unfiirtunate lIn'jali were in hand: when 'Metealfei sternly anl steadfastly, not onl' set his face against the system, lit exposed its iniquity. and -niploy el every nians in his power to free the % ictiimi from the imeshes.

The Dowager: or, the New School for Scandal. LOXDOX, SATURDAY, SO I'EM VIM 14, 1840. REVIEWS Bv Mis. ('ore. .'J vols. Hentley. Tm: condition of a nation's literature (of that portion, more particularly, called thu Helles I.etliCe,) is of far greater import than is always perceived even by the professed critic. Far hom involving a mero matter of taste, and indicating only the intellectual grasp and refinement ofthe people, it embraces no less than the whole round of their moral existence, and throws ti ?trong light on their institution**, their habits, their present capabilities, and their future prospects. Thus, thc declining literature of the 9 i-ealled silver age of Latinity, might have been tiken as a sign of approaching disorganization, quite as trustworthy as that set forth in the pages of Tacitus. Thus, too, the French literati ie of the eighteenth century so far foreshadowed tin* coming revolution, that it has since been i'tioli-lily reckoned thc main cause of that catastrophe. The literature of the fifteenth century, we need not say, was still more intimately connected with the changes going forward in the religious and political opinions of the great Kuropean community. Everything, indeed, in connexion with literature, is signiliCiint; the style, the subjects, the pervading spirit, tlie moral consideration, and even the pecuniary value, are each the exponents of some peculiarity ia a nation's condition, exercising an influence on the destinies of the people. Hy the word morals is to be understood, in tliis instance, the whole range of habits political, social, and even material; so that in many respects, literature, to be thoroughly understood, must be studied out of itself. In this, us in iilinost all moral questions, mankind are tin('apes of their analytic habits : the intellectual man has been studied apart from the material, a code of criticism has lieen established as available in all times, aud under all circumstances, and one common Procrustean bed of t iste has been applied to the literature of all c.iiintries. It is not, however, by such a standard that the productions of a national mind cm be accurately valued. The existing state of literature, at any moment, is a fact dependant on the whole circumstances of the moment, on llie actual developeinent of the entire civilization, with all thc external agencies by which it is at once excited and modified. Considering merely tbe canons of criticism, the prevailing state of education, the current acquaintance with rhetoric, with the principles ol' the sublime and beautiful, or, in one word, with tbe si iencc and the art of composition, it would he difficult to point out any vast difference between the actual generation of English writers, and that whieh immediately preceded them ; and yet tlie differences which distinguish their respective productions are many and salient. Tlie causes of such difference must be sought beyond the ordinary range of criticism; and it will not (lo lo talk of the decline of taste, of genius Ik ing at a discount, or of a perverse tendency of writers to neglect those models and rules of art, which made the fame or fortune of their predecessors. Of the changes which have taken place, and ure still going on, in the literature of our own country,?and more especially, a-germane to the article before us, in its fictitious narrative,?the greater part, in our opinion, depends upon corresponding changes going forward in society itself, lt is with novels as with the legitimate drama; in both instances the audiences have changed; and managers and publishers, in their modern sub- stitutions, are following, rather than leading the public taste. To analyze these changes, and to enumerate all the conditions out ol' which they arise, would be impossible within the compass assignable to a single article. One of the most remarkable and pervading is the wider spread of literature, and tbe consequent demand for inferior articles. It is no longer the well-educated man of the world, tbe philosopher, or the student?the naturally refined, or the artificially polished?who creates the demand, and who consequently determines the fortunes of a new publication. The public now addressed is of lower qualifications, and the author cheerfully accommodates himself to a circumstance, which spares him an infinity of labour and thought. One immediate consequence is, that no very high order ol' mind being necessary for gauging the public intelligence, tbe publisher becomes a better judge of the wants of his customers than the author, if the author Innot himself a mere tradesman ; and it accordingly rests willi the publisher to determine the character of our literature. From the returns of bis ledger, be collects with statistical accuracy the sort of book which is wanting ; and lie dictates to the author both the direction he is to take, and the level he is to maintain. Another consequence of the new market opened to literature, is the increased rapidity of its movement. AV ith the reduction in the value of the article demanded, there co-exists an increase of effective demand. The supply of this demand, while, on the one hand, it tempts, or rather forces, the author into a diminution of labour, on the other, has begot in the purchaser a diseased passion for novelty. The latter acquires a habit of reading with rapidity, ? of reading without judgment; and whatever tempts him to pause for reflection, will throw him behindhand willi the march of publication, if it does not thwart him, by offering an insuperable obstacle to bis progress. In this state of tilings, tbe prolits of a quick return of capital acquire importance in the publisher's eye. lt is not the extent of sale, but its rapidity, that is chieily regarded; and an indifferent manuscript purchased at a low price, and driven through the inarki t at a hand-gallop, is more esteemed, than a valuable work whose purchase money is to be spread over many editions. This state of the market, combining with the increased diffusion of mechanical education, bas also opened literature to a less qualified class of' writers. Writing is a trade that requires no capital: and all the minor talents, excluded by their poverty from entering on other professions, crowd eagerly into the publishing market. Thus, in spite ol' the daily increasing demand, the market is effectually over-stocked; prices fall, and the author who writes for bread, (the great majority of those who succeed in literature, i is compelled to work with greater rapidity, and to substitute the number, for the inherent excellence of bis works. At the back of these extrin-ie influences, there exists a difference arising from a change going forward in the national manners, a sort of intellectual effeminacy, ari-ing out of a long peace and steady public prosperity. The sympathies of the masses have lost something ot their healthy activity, a cold selfishness and indifference to others have stolen over them, which lune tended powerfully to introduce two very opposite phenomena in the literature of the day. In one class of temperaments, it has engendered a dislike to strong sensations of any sort, a craving for the lightest species of amusement, and a disgust for all sorts of writing whieh makes any very powerful calls on attention by pathos, humour, or even by an ordinary earnestness of, purpose. Persons thus circumstanced, whether plunged in the merest intellectual idleness, or prt'-occupicd by commercial or by political interests, look to fictitious literature as a source only of pastime and repose ; and it may be laid down as a rule, that the greater the interests xvliich rest on the shoulders of the reader, the nion* Iliinsy and trilling are the works of his predilection. Of another class cf temperament*?, the very reverse may be predicted. In the lower classes of society, there is to be found an equal selfishness, perhaps, to that which reigns in thc higher; but it is engendered by other causes. Their selfishness and apathy are, for the most part, the results of the severity of the struggle for existence, and ofthe constant recurrence of uneasy sensations, which, while they blunt the sympathetic susceptibilities, brace, rather than overpower, the mind. With the loxver classes, the desire for strong sensations predominates; but these are not to be obtained through the ordinary channels of legitimate literature; and for such readers are produced the atrocities of the Newgate school, the adventures of buccaneers, ihe sea novels, and other tales of course and exciting adventure. Without proceeding further, at the present moment, in this analysis, enough, xve imagine, has been said to account, to a certain extent, for the phenomena xvhich mark the present era of literature, and distinguish it from that of tue last generation. The change is not wholly indifferent to criticism itself. The critic, as belonging to the public, must of necessity adopt sonic portion of its prejudices; like other more dignified persons, he must find his nature subdued to the atmosphere in xvliich he lives, Ihit were ibis otherwise, if critics and authors were not, in fact, the same individual*?, it would be unfair in the former to place themselves in the higher regions of their art. or to measure the anthills ol one generation by the standards of another: and it xvould be as uscle-sas it is cruel. I'he shrewdest critics haxe generally lived in ages of declining literature ; and they have done little towards arresting the decline, by tho severity ol'tin ir dicta: because they overlooked its causes, and applied to the iudix iuuals what belonged to events. It is by no means necessary to make a minute application ofthe foregoing remarks to the publication befc-re us, or to the author, to whom xve are indebted for it. Mrs. (Joreis too xvell known to the public, to render necessary a searching criticism into her merits or demerits. Those xvho are best acquainted xvith her xvritings, will readily acknoxvledge that she is a prominent illu?tration of some, at least, of the influences xv.iich have been enumerated. A xx oman of the world, in thc largest and best sense of the word, she not only is xvell aware of the intellectual and moral xx-,mts of the class fur xvhich she caters, but she is, by habit and position, eminently fitted i'or supplying them. She is, indeed, in the situation marked out by the motto xxhieli figures in her title page?" In iivre est line lettie adrcsscc aux Jitiiis indi,min-1, qu'on poss.'de dans le nunnie;" and her book is very strictly so addressed. In this respect her novels ditler from the ordinary run of " fashionable novels," to xxhieli in appearance they belong. It is not merely the conventional forms and conventional jargon of a particular society xvhieh t-he reproduces, but a faithful copy of its ideas and feelings. So faithful, indeed, are her copies, that it is by no means diliieult for one moving in the same circles, to detect the individuals from | win,ni particular trails are draxvn. Vet are her characters not portraits nor, what is still more ; common, caricatures of well-known personages. It would, for instance, be easy to assign to the dramatis persona' arranged round the Dowager, prototypes in the world of fashion : indeed it is scarcely possible to avoid them ; but then it is only in so far as regards the particular trait, not as respects the entire personage. In the same character, may be found peculiarities derived from distinct originals, and combined with much that is of general, rather than of individual application. The scope and character of * The Dowager' is faithfully set forth in its title. The school for I scandal is less a school of morals than of man- ! ners ; and it-* texture mu-t necessarily be of the ! lightest. There can be no doubt that its in- j iercst must turn on the consequences incidental i to the indulgence of an evil tongue on all that j come* within its influence ; and the reader may ? readily anticipate in the Dowager, a very di-agree- \ able neighbour. We doubt, however, whether, in i real life, that is to -uv, in real high life, this vice j is so efficient in its malice as Mis. (.ore has repre- t j- nu d it. Not to say that those who move in the i highe-t sphere are It-s susceptible as to ci riain ' traits of character than they ought to be, and rest ' very easily limier scandals that would be unbent*- j able in other circle-, it is cnou-ili to know that the fashionable world lives too much iii public, to bc '' nt the meres of any individual tale-bearer. lu that sphere, every one is known for what he is; and there are lew or no concealments to unravel. The true effect of scandal is accurately estimated in that part of Mrs. Core's tale which relates to the married victims of go.-.. ip. The calumny g. ts wind ?the Im-band and hi-fi iends unravel iis clue, trace it to its authors, aral very wisely trusting to general character, leave them unpunished save by contempt, and give themselves no further trouble about the matter. Hut the novel interest of the story requires that the same good souse should n.,t he brought to bear on the unmarried personages; and the consequence is an exaggeration of the mi-chief .ni dog iron, au old lady- llux ct ton; ut*. Mrs. (.ore, iis u-u.a!, dip, nd- principally i'.,r succcs-\ upon her potters of wit; and she has been successful iu their application. Her exi-tciice as an author lie* altogether in tho conventional world of a refined society in which she lites; and what -he sees vividly, -die traces willi vivacity. Her padres are a complete Rochefoucauld of'English Iii.-b life. Of tlie Dowager herself, ti:e eli racier is drawn with a vigorous pen ; and it is full of;/' inline comedy, which, if tran-ferred to the .-.tag.*, would be liio-t rlfeclive.

For the rest, a mere portraiture of fashionable manners, can lav but few claims to the higher excellencies ofthe hi?lier literature; and the haste which Mrs. Gore's extraordinary fecundity (operated upon, as it is by the stimulation of a ceaseless demand for novelties), induces a carelessness of execution and a rapidity of combination, unfavourable to the full devclopement of her powers. That she displays neither the depth of pathos, nor the vigour and variety of combination formerly thought necessary to a first class novel, is, as we have endeavoured to show, less her fault than that of her age; or at all events, the defect, if it be personal, serves only to adapt her the better to the customers she addresses. Compared with others, and with herself, she has, iu her present publication, maintained her place, and bas produced a work that, while it forms a feature in the literature ofthe year, does not derogate from the reputation acquired by her former efforts. To the general subject, we shall take an carly opportunity of recurring; the evil days ujioii which contemporary literature has fallen, will require much and frequent sifting, before tin-re will be a chance of arriving at tlie appropriate remedy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Odds and Ends. Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douelas. I This is a very well-planned little series of sixpenny pamphlets, each containing one or more independent papers on topics of interest. All the thirteen before us are by men of marked ability, and they are clever, sensible, and to the purpose. One is by Dr John Brown, the biographer of 'Rib.' Another is by Dr Playfair, ' On the Cattle Plague;' and a third, by 8. 0. O., contains some very note. worthy ' Letters on the Fducation of Young Children.' Three others, comprising seven separate chapters, are contributed by Mr D'Arcy Thompson, a scholar with a true and charming humour of his own, and one, differing somewhat from the others of the series, but not less interesting on that account, reports a lecture delivered by Mr Froude on I The Influence of the Reformation on the Scottish Character.' The rest are anonymous. From Dr Brown's 'Eaterkin,' a pleasant sketch of a joure to Leadhills, we extract thi rminscence of the old costing days in Sotland: We got upon the MUo road two or three mie above Tweedukr Kirk; and one of Au, who had not been there for tbhand.thrt doors-whenb-tVAn his time,-he walked from Edinburgh to Lkdal and ac gain-could not but be moved at the des look of that old mail road-hardly a trace of whoe ,-like the id of a tream tht has cesed to flow,-"s the sound of *voice that is st Nature winning it back to herself. Fancy the glory of coming ther upon the well appointed Royal Mail, with the music of its team, the guard on his little seat, with its black hairy skin, his horn, and his tremendou blunderbuss. What compactness I what a unity, power, and purpose about the whole organism! what stories we used to hear of what the driver could do, and what the guard bad donm How Willie Lawson snuffed a candle, and not out, with his whip at Peniouik Inn, on a " lowa " night before starting. How the guad, having in vain sounded his born at Harestanes toll, when some disorderly cowl. carts were stopping the royal way, their carters drinking, hoedless insidq-blew out the brains of the first horse, and got the gate cleared forthwith. And what a peremptory, " dread" horn it was, bringing somehow Fostabia into the schoolboy bead. One guard I remember well-M George. He had been in the army, and was a gentleman-stern and not given to speak; even with his companion the driver he would let the whole day pass in silence-a handsome, firm, keen face. I remember well, too, when I had gone day after day to meet the Mail, to be taken into Edinburgh to school after my vacation among the hills, and to my rapture the Mail was full, and we came back rejoicing at the respite. "Is she full?" asked again my grave and dear old uncle, six feet and more on his soles. " Yes," said M'George, with a gentle grin, and looking me in the face; " she's full of emptiness ! " whereupon the High School boy was bundled inside, and left to his meditations. Our guard, I must say, came and looked in upon me at each stage, comforting me greatly with some jargonelle pears, the smell and relish of which I can feel now. I fell asleep, of course, and when we stopped at the Black Bull, found myself snug in the potentate's great-coat. AU this impressed me the more, when I heard of his death many years after. It was a snow-storm-a night of wild drift-in mid-winter: nothing like it for years The Mail from Dumfries was late, and tho townspeople of Moffat had gathered at Mrs Cranstoun's inn waiting Jor it. Up it came. They crowded round M'George, entreating him not to proceed -" At Tweedshaws it'll be awful." But be put them aside. " They " (neaning the Post-Office authorities) *' blamed me once; they'll never blame me again." And, saddling the two strongest horses, he and the driver mounted and took their way into the night, stumbling dumbly up the street. The driver returned, having, at the Beef-stand, -a wild hollow in the bills-five miles out of Moffat, given it up in despair, and in time; MIGeorge plunging on, and not to be spoken to. The riderless horse came back at midnight. Next morning at day. break-the wind hushed, the whole country silent and white-a shepherd saw on the heights at Tweedshaws something bright like a flume. He made his way to it-it was the morning sun shining on the brass-plate of the post-bags, hung up on a bit of paling-we have seen the very stake-and out of the snow stretched a hand, as if pointing to the bags: M 'George dead, and as the shepherd said, "I wi' a kind o' a pleesure on his face." The chief feature in this series is its effort to break through the religious bigotry of Scotland, and promote healthy thought on all sorts of questions that have hitherto been regulated by Presbyterian ordinances instead of the rules of common sense. Sabbatarianism is attacked more than once, and liberal views regarding schools, prisons, and reformatories are boldly advocated. This is from a smart chapter of Mr D'Arcy Thompson's 'Oa 'Plagues,' the plagues being intellectual and moral: Perhaps the most serious of all dangers is to be apprehended from the mushroom growth of wishy-washy religious periodicals. The enervating, laxative, and emasculating effect ot these unwbolesome publications will lead all thoughtful minds to deplore the disastrous invention of printing. The subtle influence of their pietistic poison penetrates, quicks:Iver-like, through every vein and tissue of our social organism. It is, alas ! in our cottages and kitchens that the mischief chiefly operates. Sabbath rest and wholesome recreation are peculiarly needed by our overtasked artisans and our week-imprisoned domestics. After morning attendance on divine worship, a hardworked labourer would be consulting his own and his childreu's health by walking with them through pleasant fields, as did once upon a time a Blessed One in Galilee. An afternoon's walk would not be thrown away upon a cook or housemaid; and the walk would sarely be improved tenfold by the cheery converse of a well-dressed and respectable sweetheart. Public gardens might be wholesomely and profitably opened to all but the notoriously profligate and vicious; and the pleasant music of a good band, although it shocked the ears of smug and enlightened dullards, would improve the tastes and cheer the spirits of the industrious and toil-wearied. The evening were better spent in social relaxation over a comfortable cup of tea, in the perusal of some bracing work of secular information, and the study ot some simple, noble, but unannotated pas. sage of Holy Writ, than in inhaling for the hour together the nitrogenous fumes of a sentimental pietism.

In One Town. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. By the Author of 4 Anchor- Watch Yarns.' 2 vols. (Ward & Downey.) The Prelate. By Isaac Henderson. (Boston, U.S., Ticknor & Co.) 4 In One Town,' though a little pragmatical and matter of fact, is not uninteresting. It has no heights and depths, but confines itself entirely to the commonplace joys and mishaps of every-day men and women, including an old sea-captain, a friendly shipbroker, a sailor lad, a giddy clerk or two, a nice young woman, and so forth. The various dealings of these characters with each other are described without much spirit or excitement, and the story is eked out with some of the usual business of narrative fiction. There is the " Auld Robin Gray " business, and the stolen will business, and a shipwreck, and a few other familiar incidents ; but, all put together, the action of 4 In One Town ' does not amount to anything like a sensational romance. The author has written for quiet and mildly disposed readers, and for them he has written successfully. It is a great thing in these days to conceive and write an unobjectionable story. American novels about Rome are by no means uncommon; but' The Prelate' introduces a novelty in having an Old Catholic for hero. Except that this fact gives the author an opportunity of explaining the Old Catholic movement, as to which he seems to be well informed, it is of no great value to the book. The best character is a frivolous little lady with a sham passion for art and antiquity, and a real passion for social distinction. Exception may be taken to the title of the book, because according to English usage a prelate means a bishop, which the hero is not; but the author applies the word to Canon Liddon as well as to a Monsignor. _

CHRISTMAS BOOKS. The Gold of Fairnilee. By Andrew Lang. (Bristol, Arrowsmith.) A good fairy tale is a rare find, and we may all congratulate ourselves on the appearance of ' The Gold of Fairnilee,' a fascinating story, full of Mr. Lang's peculiar charm of thought and diction. The gold is hidden and found Between tbe Camp o' Rink And Tweed water clear. It is not fairy gold, but " just wealth o' this world that folk buried.lang syne." Many hundred years was it sought, but the glory of finding it was reserved for Randal Ker, a lad who was stolen away by the good folk so long ago as the days of Flodden fight. The dim, sad beauty of the Borderland, the eerie sights seen by little Randal, the wild raids of the marauders ?all the strange life, real and fancied, of the debatable land in that far-off time is called up before our eyes by Mr. Lang's magic mastery of words. Children's stories have their day, but we predict that' The Gold of FairnUee' will live and will long delight young and old.

John Standish; or, the Harrowing of London
Gilliat, Rev. Edward
-------------------------------------------------------------
John Standish; or, ihe Harrowing of London. By the Rev. E. Gilliat. Illustrated. (Seeley &Co.) 'John Standish'is a more than usually successful attempt at historical fiction. It deals with the rebellion of Wat Tyler, and as the author thinks it " more important to reproduce the very words and thoughts of the past than to rely for a faithful picture on inventories of clothes and furniture, he has, by copious use of the English of Chaucer, modern Scotch, and other kindred philological materials, and referring for his facts to Walsingham and Froissart, made up what seems a fairly successful illustration of the times. The notes are too numerous for adult readers, but excellent for children.

" While the chief divisions of the book are arranged in correspondence with the terms of office of our governor-generals and viceroys, the principal events are arranged in subdivisions with separate headings."

Blue Lights; or, Hot Work in the Soudan. By R. M. Ballantyne. Illustrated. (Nisbet & Co.) Mr. Ballantyne has written a soldiering story of the usual type, only differentiated by a somewhat too persistent inculcation of temperance principles. The praise of Miss Robinson's institutions at Portsmouth and elsewhere cannot be exaggerated, and it is to be wished that every one who saw the Mahdi had got off as cheaply as the heroes of the tale.?

'Tho Lion of St. Mark' is perhaps one of the most exciting of Mr. Henty** many thrilling romances. As the name would imply, the scene is laid in Venice, at the time of her hardest struggle for existence. With much that is historically true are woven skilfully the strange adventures of a gallant English boy. Mr. Henty unluckily winds up with an obvious historical error.?From the shores of the Adriatic and from a bygone age Mr. Henty whisks us back to Westminster School a generation ago, and then off to the gold-fields of California, where Capt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Individualist. NEW NOVELS. By W. H. Mallock. (Chapman & Hall.) No writer of fiction succeeds so well as Mr. Mallock in leaving a nasty taste on the palate and a nasty smell in the nose of his readers. It is not so much that he is always hovering about the purlieus of what he characteristically enough calls Lampsacus as that he seems to be afflicted with that unpleasant idiosyncrasy which causes its victims to notice particularly just those objects or details from which healthier people look away. The late Mr. Quick has a story of "an odd boy who on a journey pointed out to his aunt a number of disgusting sights. At length she said, 'Alfred, you see nothing but what is disgusting.' * O yes,' said Alfred, * I see everything, but I only point out what is disgusting.' " This youth, Mr. Quick adds, " ought to have turned out a Hogarth or a Smollett." That is possible, for "Alfred" clearly had a sense of humour; and, besides, we have his word for it that, like Hogarth, at least he saw the beautiful things. Otherwise he would probably have turned out a Mallock. The older and simpler fiction used to make its characters good or bad all through, physically, morally, and all. Thersites is ugly, wicked, and mean; Eichard III. is ugly and wicked, so is Quilp; Iago's personal appearance is not mentioned, but there is no reason to think he was beautiful. Milton set the fashion of the ange dichu; the "bold bad bart." of the London Journal is the lineal descendant of his Satan. Thackeray, as in J. J. Ridley or Major Dobbin, was one of the first to recognize that a generous soul might be housed in an unattractive frame; and it afterwards became a commonplace of fiction. But the usual method has been to touch lightly, just as refined people do in real life, on the defects, and to remove any unpleasant impression that they may have left by emphasizing the better qualities. Mr. Mallock has another system. His Mr. Bousefield is obviously avery decentfellow?hospitable, intelligent, honest; but he represents certain social developments with which Mr. Mallock does not sympathize, so we are told about the crumbs on his waistcoat, the untidiness of the washing arrangements in his house, the toothpick on his mantelpiece, and so on. Even where no animus?no animus based on opinion, at all events?can be suspected, one observes the same tendency. The barmaid of a railway refreshment-room has a "fringe, impertinent eyes, and half-washed hands?a mixture of rings and chilblains." These are things that well-bred people regret, and do not talk about, any more than they do about visits to " priestesses who live in St. John's Wood." Whether it is in pursuance of the same method that Mr. Mallock makes his Prime Minister, Lord Runcorn?a character modelled apparently on the first Lord Lytton, and represented as a highly cultivated person?grossly misquote the best known of Wordsworth's sonnets, there is no need to inquire. The general conclusion as to Mr. Mallock's view of existence (for his novels are nothing if not didactic) seems pretty clear. The human being, he would say, has the choice between being a vulgarian or a profligate, with the chance of being both. The most melancholy thing is to see how dull the author of 'The New Republic' has grown. Audacious and scurrilous that work may have been, but it was funny, and contained more than one good epigram. The nearest approach to an epigram which we have found in the present work is a remark made by a third-rate political Egeria to the hero, who is bored with public life:? "If you take a back seat in life, simply because you despise the play which you would look at if you took a front one, you will find that the heads which impede your view are a prospect compared with which the worst play is a masterpiece." There is a look of profundity about this? but is there not also a confusion between the two sides of the footlights? to say nothing of the assumption that no one can keep out of the theatre altogether.

May 17, 1851  ENGLISH LITERATURE - 19th Century|ENGLISH LITERATURE - 20th Century
The Athenaeum  : 1229 520 - 520
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Caleb Field: a Tale of the Puritans. By the Author of' Passages in the Life of Mrs. Margaret Maitland,' &c. Colburn & Co. The title of this short novel is in some degree calculated to mislead the reader. ' Caleb Field' is a tale of the Great Plague in London; showing principally how the pious and high-hearted daugnter of a preacher went about ministering to the sick,?in the progress of her ministrations finding a happiness beyond that which most Dorcases propose to themselves and obtain. That the right tone of the awful time in which the action takes place has been found by the author of * Merkland,' the following passage will sufficiently illustrate.? * They passed on. Along the street, thrusting the very few passengers on the footpath aside in his precipitous career, a man thinly clad, with horror in his pale face and wild eyes, came dashing forward. They heard his cry indistinctly before he approached. 'What is it, father, what is it?' whispered Edith, fearfully. She thought him some unhappy lunatic escaped from confinement. But the passers-by showed no signs of terror; they looked at him with compassionate eyes; they uttered ejaculations of prayer, strange to hear in that public place and time. The unhappy wanderer rushed on, uttering his sharp, monotonous cry: 'Oh! the great and terrible God;' and men looked on in solemn quietness, not marvelling. The healthful blood ran cold in the young veins of Edith Field. What cries were these for the streets of a mighty city! They proceeded on?so many deserted nouses frowning dark with their closed doors and windows upon the life around?so many signs of panic and terror, from wild apprehensions of God's wondrous vengeance, like that of the maniac who had passed them, to the helpless, tremulous anxiety of those serving maids and labouring men, who crowded about the apothecary's door?combined to throw a cold blight of despondency upon the strangers. Up in the clear sky before them, Edith's eye had been caught by the glorious golden hue of a singular cloud. The heavens were flooded with tlie light ofthe setting sun; in beautiful relief against the blue sky, the cloud turned forth its mellow roundness to the gentle summer breeze, gliding onward stately and slow, as you may see a full sail sometimes on thc verge of the far horizon, with the sunshine in its bosom. As Edith observed it, they came up to a knot of people gathered in the middle of the street. 'Lo!' exclaimed a female voice,' how he stretches forth his sword, and his eyes like fire gazing over the city, and his face terrible, and yet so fair, and his garments like a wondrous mist, with the sunshine below! Ah! Sirs, do ye not see him ? Lo! now he bends to the east and to the west, with his sword gleaming like a diamond stone, awful to see! Can ye not see him??can ye not see him? or hath his glory blinded your eyes?' She was gazing up with passionate earnestness at the cloud as it floated above. 4 Yea, yea, yonder is the flashing of his sword over St. Paul's!' cried a man beside her. ' I see him! I see him!' said another; 'what a glorious creature he is!' A thin, mild, contemplative man, on whose lip an habitual smile of gentle pensiveness seemed to hover, stood on the outskirts of the crowd, looking up with serene blue eyes towards this wondrous object in the heavens. 'Dost see him, Sir?' exclaimed the first speaker, jealous, as it seemed, of the gentle smile. 'Dost see the angel?'?'Nay, truly, good neighbour,' said the meditative man,' I see but a singular fair cloud.'?'Out, thou profane mocker!* cried another;' dost not see how the Lord sends forth his signs and wonders upon us? Woes me for us? a doomed people! Woes me! woes me!' and the speaker wrung his hands." In order to introduce the historian of the Plague, Daniel Defoe, our author indulges in an anachronism for which formal apology is made in a note. Such licences are by right prescriptive warranted to the romancer; but, after the liberty was taken, more use might have been made of the author of * Robinson Crusoe' than is here done. He speaks a few sentences,?and is little seen or heard of afterwards. On the whole, this sketch may, after its kind, be ranked with the more elaborate pictures of the Plague hung out in fiction by Horace Smith, Leigh Hunt, and Mr. Harrison Ainsworth.?The amount of physical horror inherent in the subject will always make it more or less intractable to imaginative Art.

379   9007514   Adventures of a Medical Student.
Jan 5, 1850  ENGLISH LITERATURE - 19th Century|ENGLISH LITERATURE - 20th Century
The Athenaeum  : 1158 9 - 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adventures of a Medical Student. By Robert Douglas, Surgeon, R.N.; with a Memoir of the Life of the Author. Tegg & Co. When and where these adventures were written we are not informed,?but we have the impression of having seen some of them before. Whoever shall take up the volume expecting to find the narration of a series of consecutive events, real or fictitious, will be disappointed. Its pages comprise a variety of tales written evidently at different periods in the lifetime of the author, and exhibiting very different degrees of merit. Nor is their medical character so exclusive as to give them a claim to be regarded as merely medical adventures. They are a collection of papers, the production of an author who died at the early age of twentyfour ; and though he was an assistant-surgeon in the Navy at the time of his death, the principal portion of these narrations seems to have been composed whilst he was a medical student. The fate of the author is one pregnant with interest at the present time:?for we cannot forego the impression that the cock-pit of a manof-war was of all places one of the most unfitted for the welfare of an individual with a cultivated and susceptible mind. How long the Admiralty intend to continue the injustice of sending their assistant-surgeons, who have important duties to perform and studies to pursue, into the cockpit amongst the noisy midshipmen, we know not: but sure we are that they cannot long expect to find men of intelligence and accomplishments submitting, in addition to the necessary hardships of a life at sea, to the indignities and disquiet to which they are now exposed. As artistic productions, these tales have great defects. They want taste and refinement,? but frequently exhibit force and power. The author is fond of the marvellous and terrible? and sometimes deals with his materials with novel effect. We give an extract or two: the first from a day's excursion of two medical students ? during which they meet with a ' whistling pedlar.? l ''' Hillo !' cried Bob;' where did you pick up tliat melody, may I ask? Just whistle it over again? I'd give anything to learn it.' The pedlar repeated the air till he could whistle it with con*-iderable accuracy. ' Weel,' quoth the latt-.-r, 'that's gay and gude, but I'se be bail ye"ll forget it again before you come to the cross o' Drittenbrook.'?'I'll bet you a bottle of ale I don't.'?' I'll bet you a bottle of the very best Edinburgh ale, that ye'll no stan' at the cross and whistle the same tune.'?'Dane!' cried j Bob. ? I agree wi* you there; ye're dane if you do.' j This was spoken aside by the vagabond, not so much so, however, but that I heard him, and doubted '. much and feared as I heard. * * The prime assem, Wage was at the stone cross. Here the young men were met to put the stone, pitch the bar, sling the hammer, and perform other rustic feats, whilst the big-wigs of the place stood by spectators, arguing now on points of the game, and now on points of politics ns intricate and important, a thin, wavery vapour of tobacco smoke hovering above thc groups. The public-house, too, was hard by, and from the open windows of the tap-room leant, idly lounging and occasionally putting in a word or a joke from a ! distance, several sturdy tradesmen, taking their even- I ing relaxation after their labours. All the while we had been marching along, I had heard Bob whistling away at the marvellous aria, evidently anxious to prevent its escaping his memory, and to secure tho pedlar's bottle of ale, which, from the warm and dusty travelling, was become now rather a desirable object of speculation. Hurriedly did he wend his way among the honest folk till he reached the stone cross, placing his back .against which he began to pipe his whistle, loud,c!ear,and richly toned as throstle's melody,while the upper part of his visage, with his too funfraught eyes, beaming a smile of triumph and delight?to appearance taking no thought but of the pedlar's discomfiture. But the latter had popped himself quietly into the public-house, and now from t'*e open windows stood regarding his proceedings with a gloating grin of satisfaction that was anything but to be looked for on the face of a man who saw himself ' let in' for a bottle of the best ale. Right slapdash into the tune did Bob launch, entering with his whole art into its spirit, nodding with his head to the time, and drumming with his cudgel upon the end of his box. The effect was instantaneous, and most miraculous. It acted like a talisman. The whole doings around came at once to a stop, and every eye was bent upon him with an expression of astonishment and indignation, while every ear was erected t_ at his extraordinary warbling. For half a minute d this lasted, and then the charm was broken. The Vulcan of the place, a fellow like a bronze colossus, had just h-xn in the act of slinging his ponderous sledge-hammer, when the sound arrested him. He stood motionless like the rest at first, till satisfied he heard aright. Swinging the tremendous weapon thrice round his shoulder, he hurled it, with a terrible imprecation after it, by way of leather to guide its course, right at the audacious whistler's head. The latter saw the fearful missile coming, and had but time to duck his crown when over him it flew, and, hurtling through the air. went crash like a thunderbolt through the roof of a neighbouring pigsty, the hideous screeching that immediately .-.rose from the inmate of which told that, if Bob's timely stoop had saved his bacon, it was at the expense cf other people's. Thereupon arose from everv lip loud eries of?* Down with him! * ?' Kill him!'?' .Minder him ;'?' Fell him !'?with oaths, curses, and deinmciuio'-s of divers streng'.h and quality, a'l mingled into one confused roar cf a most valour quelling description. Then I could see folks rushing from every door, eagerly inquiring the cause of the atti av, and immediately swelling the hostile multitude that w.->s a hancirg.a wrathful nnd most formidable- i.-halaiix, upon the daring but now devoted Bob." The adventurous whistler got well paid out: ?but some time after had his revenge. One of the professors, with the two medical students to assist, delivered a lecture in the village on galvanism. Thc latter two resolved to be revenged on Bob's f\ vn-.r assailant: whom they accordingly persuaded to form a circle and take a galvanic shock.? "Mr. Whyte, whe-n lie had them all nicely arranged about the inMni-iKiit, tit the handle of which I wits otficia-.ing, an.i when they had for some moments, with laces expletive of satisfaction, remarke! upon tho strange and peculiar sensation they were cx-jcric-nci-'g, cn a siuV.cn made with his off eyelid a wgnal wi.ich I was immediately on the alert to obey. At once I slipped the crooked wire into the two cups, and whirled the wheel with my whole strength and activity. Thereupon, the unfortunate victims began to cut thc most surprising and original capers, flinging their limbs out at an amazing rate, and twisting their frames about into all sorts of contortions. The group of Laocoon gives but a faint idea of their attitudes or their distress. They struggled and plunged about as if seven devils possessed them; threw out their arms and legs; puffed and panted, and made convulsive attempts to cry out for help or mercy, which came to the ear only as inarticulate gasping roars. The water gushed into their starting eyes, the sweat poured over their faces, but, with an enduring remembrance of our own bruises, I turned the crank with only increased vigour and good will. But all this time my companion was anything but idle. He got hold of a cloth, which he made dripping wet with the acid I have alluded to; then, going round behind them whilst they were unconscious of anything save the racking of their joints, thoroughly damped all their black coats with the colour changing liquid. Then, flying to me with an appearance of the utmost anxiety anel concern, he stopped my operations just as the burley grocer fainted away from exhaustion. He was profuse in his apologies for the untoward circumstance, laying the whole blame upon the little bit of wire, which he assured them had completely deranged the machine. He could not sufficiently express his regret at the accident, anel severely chide me for my carelessness, while I 6tood by with aspect contrite as became one corrected. As for the poor creatures, they dropped into the nearest seats, and began to wipe the perspiration from their faces and hands. But he, with the most attentive politeness, immediately directed them to a basin hard by, which might be supplied from a jug beside it, containing a clear liquid, quite like water. This was a strong solution of nitrate of silver (the substance which constitutes marking ink), and the result was, that four of them washed their faces, and all of them their hands in the jet producing compound. As soon as they had recovered themselves from the stunning effects of their experiment, they got up, took their hats, and, wishing us a humble ' Good Night,' went hastily away, with gait marvellously dejected, remarking that we and our machines were anything but * canny'for honest folks to have to deal witii, taking in with beedie-s ears our re- j peatedly urgi d apologies and expressions ot' regret." j Our readers will perceive that these narra- | tives are not recommended by any charm of originality or //race of style :?but the volume may add something to the fireside amusement of the coming winter evenings.

CALEB WEST: MASTER DIVER. By F. Hopkinoua Smith. 6s. (A. Conmtable sad Co.) There is a frank naturalness about this story which we have found particularly attractive. The characters are thoroughly human. They speak and act like living people, and secure the MR. F. HOPIUNSON SMITH. reader's friendship from the first. Caleb West is a strong Ad interesting character, but there is a burly-chested, big-hearted old sea-dog, known as Captain Joe, whom we prefer even to the diver. There is something invigorating and refreshing in the briny atmosphere which he brings with him everywhere. The young civil engineer, too, is an entirely satisfactory type of man, clever, sensible, and honestly human, a capital busneas man where lighthouse building is concerned, a loyal and honourable gentleman in his friendship with Mrs. Leroy. In fact, all the characters are good; the details of engineering work are interesting; the style is bzight and effective. The writer is to be congratulated on his work.

fctb, 3Sool$. Homc Sketches and Foreign Recollections. By Lady Chatterton. [ALL who have read Lady Chattcrton's charming Ranibles in the South of Ireland, will expect in the present work a rich and racy mdlange; and they will not be disap. pointed. The Sketches and Recollections is indeed the most fascinating book that we have enjoyed for many a long day: it is so full of exquisite sentiments, and amiable common sense; so picturesquely graphic; and so animated with a love of the beautiful and the pure-that we scarcely know how to convey to the reader an idea of the treasurable variety contained in these volumes Home and foreign tours, or visits to sites consecrated as the abodes of genius, or dearly associated with history-form the staple. Ireland is not forgotten, and the accomplished authoress ventures to hope, that of the manny who kindly followed her guidance in the " Green Island," a few at least will be found willing to accompany her through some of the fair scenes of her native country, and to touch once more upon Irish ground, in their flight to other lands. The work contains two or three nourcllettes; but, brief as these are, they exceed our limits, so that we must quote from the more detached portion. English and French Woncn.] A French gentleman said to-day he thought the generality of English wonmen more frivolous, more devoted to the world and dissipation, than the French. I have often heard it asserted, that the conversation of French women is more intellectual, that they are more accustomed to convene on interesting and important subjects than the English. This is very natural in a country where conversational powrers and agreeability in society are so much esteemedBut the imputation of the frivolity of English women excited to-day great indignation among the Englishmen present M1y idea is that we are more frivolous than we used to bem-iore than the last generation There is a passion for society now afloat which destroys our old genuine domestic feelings. Our homes, our country places. are deserted, and I never can forgive us for this. The Battle qf the Boyne. We drove along the banks of the Boyne, and rambled over the site of that battle which is so celebrated and important in Irish, and indeed in English history. It has been sung by the poet and the beggar in the halls of the great, and in the abodes of wretchedness. The Boyne is still a watchword of party-spirit; and I am glad to have seen the place which excites so many interesting recollections, and sketched the obelisk which has been raised to the memory of King William. The clump of trees on the opposite height is the spot from whence poor King James beheld the defeat of his army. Not far from the obelisk there is a very pretty glen, where a profusion of wild honeysuckles and roses, growing among the rocks, and perfuming the air with their sweetness, are wreathed into such a variety of fantastic forms, that they look as if twined by the graceful hands of fairies. This glen runs up from the broader valley where the battle wvas fought, and on the height to the right we were shewn the spot where King William's artillery was planted. Down this sweet and peaceful-looking glen, the roar of cannon must then have been heard; the wounded and the dying must have lain among these rocks. I hope the woodbines and rose, grew there then, and that their sweet perfume, which seems to me always to breathe hope and confidence in the goodness of God, may, even amid the tumult of battle, have soothed their sufferings, and spoken peace to them in their last hours. Rosstrevor. The scenery of Rosstrevor is celebrated, but its beauty far exceeds my expectations; and then there is no appearance of squalid misery to mar the effect, as is too frequently the case in Ireland; here the people look happy, and the cottages are comfortable, as well as pretty. The women indeed often wear no shoes or stockings; but they have such pretty feet, and the other parts of their dress look so neat and clean, the bright-coloured handkerchief is so well arranged over their shoulders, and the little plaited white caps so becoming, that one cannot help fancying the foot is left uncovered, more to shew its beauty than from poverty. Tuesday.-The weather would not allow us to ascend the highest mountain near this place, which we had intended to do to-day. So we strolled about between the showers, and passed many pleasant hours in the lovely gardens belonging to different villas, which the owners most kindly allow strangers to enjoy. Each of these abodes seems to vie with the others in loveliness; gooi taste is shewn in the architecture of the dwellings, as well as in the arrangement of the garden walks, the green-houses, and the rustic bridges which are thrown over mountain torrents. Flowers bloom in the greatest profusion. I remarked great varieties of geraniums and roses, growing apparently wild under the wide-spreading trees which separate the hay and corn fields. Everything is perfectevery inch of ground is adorned and made useful. The troughs which the cattle drink out of are carved and ornamented, as well as the gates to the fields and farm-yards. The village church and school are beautiful; then the children seem so well educatedsmiles and bows greet one on all sides, from rosy faces. The girls' hair well combed and arranged, and their dresses and white aprons scrupulously clean; and even the boys' coats, those usually most dilapidated parts of the human attire, appear well brushed and mended. I have not seen a rag, a broken window, or a miserable face in the whole place. Scenery of the Elbe. Such a day-I cannot describe it. Went to the beautiful Kuhstall, Prebicsthor, and Winterburg. The sunset, on our return by the Elbe, was more lovely than anything I ever beheld. The Lilienstein, a mass of rock which resembles a gigantic shaft and capital of an inverted Corinthian column, rising abruptly out of the high woody bank which overhangs the Elbe, formed to-night the centre of the beautiful picture. The sky, as we slowly rowed along the smooth stream, changed from the soft blue of brilliant sunshine to the fiery red of sunset; against this, the rocky banks, with their towering forests above, assumed a dark purple hue; and lower down, that blue vapory tintwhich served to bring out in strong relief the little town of Schaudau, with its high pinnacled dome, Swiss-like cottages, and crowd of masts. All these objects, even the feathery pines which stood like graceful fairies on the distant Lilienstein, were reflected on the majestic river. I tried to make a sketch of the view, which is here given. In such scenes as these no wonder that the poor Triiger should exclaim, with unostentatious, yet unshrinking devotion, when he came to the end of his labours, "L Let us be thankful to God for the safe and pleasant excursion we have had." It was a most delightful expeditiontwelve hours of perfect enjoyment!" A beautiful Girl. At the table-d'hite to-day, at Dresden, there was a beautiful girl, a good likeness of Malibran. There was an air of originality in her dress and manner, which rivetted my gaze during the whole dinner. She was at too great a distance for the sound of her voice to be heard; but there was a look of quiet intelligence in her eye, and of persuasive power in her lip, which made me feel sure that her thoughts and words did not fall short of the promise of wit which was stamped on her smooth high brow. The dark auburn air, divided into four plaits, descended low on her delicate cheeks, and then falling on her slender throat, the ends were looped behind her ear; a bow of crimson velvet was placed at the back of her head. Her dress was black; and, unlike that of the German girls, it was made low and with short sleeves; but a large transparent veil of the same sombre hue was thrown over her shoulders, the folds of which were gathered up, and rested gracefully on her round and snowy arms. No ornament of any kind interfered with the lovely simplicity of her appearance: the idea that probably I shall never see that radiant creature again makes me quite melancholy. Gernman and Italian Ausic. I traced in the wild melody a strong resemblance to the national character. Deep, full of feeling, imaginative, and intellectual; yet occasionally a shade of northern barbarism seemed to break out in the sudden startling discords. How different I thought them from the soft, voluptuous, graceful strains of a luxurious people who have attained and passed their meridian of civilization. In the music of Italy (of a country which has been) there is very little of that energy which must create a feeling of power, and inspire strength and vigour. When listening to German music, I feel capable of doing all things. When listening to Italian, alas! I can only feel regrets, enervating, useless, yet perhaps delightful regrets. It puts me in a delicious frame of mind, but incapacitates me for any vigorous employment. Jews' Street, Francfort. All, from the old woman selling apples at a common stall, to the jewelled head of a young beauty leaning out of the window above-from the man in a ragged coat, drawing a wheelbarrow, to the two usurers gravely discussing some money transaction -all seemed to belong to one family. Indeed, the members of few Christian families resemble each other so closely as the Jews do each other. The words, "Come out, and be ye separate, and marry not the daughters of the land," were plainly engraven on the countenances of all. Here, in their own home, they sought not either to disguise their names or appearances, or to imitate the habits of others. There was something tome inexpressibly awful in thus finding myself among those living witnesses of the truth of our religion, of the fulfilment of prophecy; in seeing over the door of a common eating-house, those same characters in which the commandments were inscribed, by the finger of God, on the tables of stone-in which was written the most ancient history that has been transmitted to us; in hearing from the lips of a dealer and his customer that language in which the Creator of all things, the great Jehovah, spoke to the father of his people. In this lugubrious region, where the very smell and the atmosphere seemed different from the rest of the world, old Mrs. Rothschild still lives; she is the mother of thea powerful family whose very name expresses riches - who possess places in almost all the capitals of Europe, and hold in their hands the destiny of nations. Yet this ancient dame still resides in a house undistinguished from any of its sombre and dingy companions. It is said the motive which induces her to do so is a superstitious one, in some way connected with the prosperity of her descendants. Poor woman! it seems rather hard, that when one of her sons possesses in this very town such a residence as might excite the envy of a monarch, she should be doomed, by superstition and prejudice, to this gloomy abode. It is probable, however, that the interior of the houses are better-their appearance indicates that it is still the failing or habitof that cautious people to appear wretched and mean. This part of the town is still as it existed in the fifteenth century, and is very well described in Spindler's novel of Der Jude. Tlkc Tuilleries at Paris. We took a verv beautiful walk yesterday through the Tuilleries, along the river side, and over the Pont Royale. The view from this point each way is charming; we then returned to the gardens of the Tuilleries, and watched the raising of the obelisk, from Luxor, in the Place Louis XVI. Mrs. Trollope is certainly right; the Tuilleries gardens are delightful; as a promenade it is perhaps unequalled. And then if we are fond of observing character and countenance, here is the place; if we like to see the graceful gambols of children, of tracing the artless dawning of character in their looks and gestures, here is the place; if we wish to find indications of party spirit and political rancour, or like to study the last invention of Herbault or Palmyre to adorn or torture the human form, this garden is still the place. I was much amused yesterday at the number of black-looking men sitting and standing about, reading the newspapers; their shrivelled forms resembled those of the half-dead autumnal flies which were strewed about them; but to judge by the eager avidity with which they devoured their sous-worth of politics, their minds were by no means in a harmless or quiescent state. The countenances of some looked as if they had been born and nurtured in political dissension, and their hard features seemed cast in the mould of discontent; and the expressions which at times varied their stern harshness, were not like the indications of common passion, but faint gleamy sparks of the volcano of political violence which burnt within. [The volumes are liberally illustrated with clever lithographs, from sketches by the highly-gifted authoress.]

Gloria Victis. By J. A. Mitchell. (D. Nutt.) Mr. Mitchell's story is too trivial to bear so sounding a title. But it is very readable and it amuses, and three, at least, of the characters are interesting additions to the inhabitants of the world of fiction. The story briefly shows how a boy, Steven Wadsworth, predestined to crime, overcomes his fate and substitutes for the profession of thief that of honest acrobat. But the change convinces no one, for it is described entirely from without. Psychological analysis is quite beyond Mr. Mitchell's power. Li the course of his career the boy?the son of a housebreaking father and a mother possessed of a cataclysmic temper?steals, lies, murders, and attempts murder, all without consciousness of evil. He preserves, indeed, throughout his worst deflections from morality, honest grey eyes and a clean heart. When first embarked as a highway robber he encounters Dr. Thorne, an amiable clergyman, and bids him throw up his hands. The doctor does so, but by. a strategic movement defeats his assailant. The following scene is then recorded: *" If I let you go will you promise to behave better, aud not play with loaded pistols in the future?' ' Yes, I promise.' ' You give me your word of honour ?' ? Yes, sir.' As he released his grip and took a backward step, the boy sprang toward the pistol, snatched it from the grass, cocked it, and levelled it again toward the figure before him. ' Now, who's ahead P' he exclaimed. ' This time you throw up your hands, or I'll fire it!' But the hands were not thrown up. The massive head drooped slowly forward, and two calm brown eyes rested mournfully upon the speaker. Beproachfully and without anger he looked into the triumphant face. ' So your promise goes for nothing! You should have been a sneak thief or a pickpocket; not an open robber. I have always understood that famous robbers had some self-respect, some regard for their word of honour.' Over the villain's face came a flush of colour. Shame and indignation took the place of triumph, and the eyes wavered. There was an inward struggle, as easily read by the man before him as from an open book Lowering the revolver, he turned it about, holding the muzzle toward himself, then stepped forward and presented it to his towering victor. In an uneven voice, and with a strong effort to repress the quivering of a lip, he murmured hurriedly? ' I'm not a sneak thief! Take it yourself! I don't want it!' Br. Thorne took the weapon and carefully pointed it in another direction as he lowered the trigger, then returned it to the owner, saying? 'As we both are men of honour, it doesn't matter who keeps the pistol.'" Perhaps the best manner of taking leave of the book is to say that it is too good-humoured and unpretentious for serious criticism, too unreal and superficial for much praise, and too readable for neglect. # * # # ?

SELECTED FICTION MAGNUS MERRIMAN, by Eric Link. later. Caps. 7s. 64. MR. ERIc LINKLATER, as several thousand -or it may be several hundred thousand -readers of Juan in America hoped he would do, has escaped from politics and returned to the picaresque. In a foreword to his newest novel, Magnus Merriman, he. reminds us that he is giving us neither photography nor history, but fiction. Whether this statement will satisfy those who search for autobiography in everything, I do not know, but from between the lines of Mr. Linklater's satire on the Scottish Nationalist movement there emerges a very sane summary of the political manifestation with which the author's name was not long ago associated. Those who expect in Magnus a new Juan may find themselves disappointed. Scotland conducts itself with less extravagance than the United States, and Magnus rides a quieter steed than the frolicsome palfrey whose hooves struck laughter from the American macadam. But it is still literary horseplay, and the satire does not suffer for being reined in. In Magnus Merriman, moreover, the hero is no longer a stranger spying out the laughable nakedness of a strange land, but the descendant of Orkney Vikings, a Caledonian, feckless and shiftless maybe, but capable of surrender to at least one profound emotion-the passion for the rock whence he was hewn. He is pursued, this Magnus Merriman, by a sardonic fate which reserves for him situations comic to the point of tragedy. His strenuous efforts to obtain military distinction land him in a courtmartial. In London and Edinburgh two love-affairs which appear to offer the ingredients for tolerably satisfying romance both end ridiculously. He is twice arrested for too vigorously comn bining alcoholic enjoyment with the defence of Shakespeare against the rival merits of Racine. He loses an election fight and forfeits a twice-paid deposit (the first payment having disappeared with his agent) because he loses touch with the fluctuating policy for which he is standing. Weary of politics and journalism he returns to Orkney to mak an honest woman of a fanner's daughter, is afflicted on his honeymoon with the undignified complaint of thrush, and thereafter with the unbridled temper of his wife. " I'm Troilus with a cold in his nose, not sighing but sneezing towards the Grecian tents. I'm Romeo under the wrong window, Ajax with a boil in his armpit, Priam with a hundred hair-lipped daughters, Roland with a pair of horns. But before God I'm a poet too." Thus Merriman, and to crown the irony the author mercilessly gives us samples of his hero's verse. But if Magnus claims too ambitiously the command of language, Mr. Linklater may make the claim with justice. The question, as Humpty Dumpty observed, is which is to be the master; and here is 4 master of words. FNcis WATSON.

Gentlemen: The Regiment!
Talbot, Hugh
-------------------------------------------------------------
GENTLEMEN: THE REGIMENT I by Hugh Talbot. Dent. 7s. 6d. IT was to the " wars " that Lovelace departed, bidding his Lucasta farewell. It was likewise for the " wars " that the 137th and 138th Foot, in Mr. Talbot's novel, left the market-town of Harwick to the accompaniment of manly cheers and womanly weeping. The vague plural has about it a picturesque glamour which the Crimean campaign, heralding the era when War is War, almost succeeded in dispelling. Mr. Talbot handles with great skill this theme of the military population of a military little town exchanging the parade-ground of a forty-years' peace for the horrors of the Scutari hospital. Nor does he let the obvious tempt him, for all that we hear of the noble six hundred is that " the Light Cavalry had been cut to pieces the other day by some damn-fool muddle, though the Heavies had done well ". Worship of Regiment, Family and God (in that order) is the emotion which sustains most of Mr. Talbot's unintrospective Victorian characters. The exception is his hero, Alastair Chappell, whom we see growing up in an atmosphere against which he rebels, though for the most part unconsciously, at every step. Yet, finally, it is these uncompromising traditions which save him from the frustration to which, the last of a decaying family, he seemed inevitably committed; for Mr. Talbot, subtle satirist though he shows himself at times, does not subscribe to the fashion for iconoclasm, and leaves us with the welcome impression that the Victorians, after all, were neither subhuman nor superhuman. He appears to find some difficulty with his heroine, Katherine St. Quentin, whom he strives to free from a " period" artificiality by making her " fey " and unsympathetic to her environment. A fine piece of sensitive writing almost disarms criticism of the condescending " sacrifice " of Katherine's virtue to the man who loves her, but " good-night, dear book ", in her journal is a hard nut to crack. Mr. Talbot's book is stuffed with excellent scenes and occasions-a review, an ice-carnival, a hunt, a schoolboy poaching foray, a garden-party, fighting in the Crimea-all well contrived and none over-described. It is indeed a first novel remarkably rich both in achievement and in promise.

Longford, Christine
-------------------------------------------------------------
MR. JIGGINS OF JIGGINSTOWN, by Christine Longford. GoUascz. 7s. 6d.  It is my own fault that Mr. Jiggins of Jigginstown is the first book by Lady Longford that I have read, and the position shall be rectified. She has the most exquisite wit, a wit which is the product of intelligence and not its substitute; a wit which can dispense with polysyllables (and that is a rare wit these days). Her scene is Jigginstown, the country mansion of Mr. Jiggins in the Irish Midlands. Mr. Jiggins has not long to live, a fact which is obvious not only to his philosophic self, but also to a number of more materially-minded connections who fancy they have moral claims on his estate. The reader awaits the death of Mr. Jiggins with a growing apprehension of real loss, and the opening of his will with a happy conviction that grasping hypocrisy will be well served. But the grasping hypocrites, a well-assorted bunch, are much too delightfully described to rouse resentment. Mrs. Georgina Jiggins is a lovely creation. "

Saint on Holiday
Dearmer, Geoffrey
-------------------------------------------------------------
SAINT ON HOLIDAY, by Geoffrey. Dearmer. Haimmann. 7s. 6d. If you like Mr. Dearmer's style ", say the publishers of Saint on Holiday, " you will like his story ". Of his style the following sentence is not an extreme example: " The alibi was certainly established if the photograph of the sleeping Santa was genuine, as there could be no reason to doubt, so excellent was it ". I ought further to warn in- tending readers that Mr. Dearmer has an unaccountable habit of lapsing from slipshod prose into doggerel verse. As for the story, it concerns a latterday saint placed by remarkable circumstances in an awkward position, and forced to hide first from public spleen and subsequently from public adulation. There is originality in the idea, and in the selection of the Zoo as a place of refuge, and the theme deserves better treatment than Mr. Dearmer has given it. On occasions he succeeds in being diverting, but he has so many abysmally poor jokes to each good one that to finish the book requires iron determination. However, I believe there is a public for everything, and no doubt Mr. Dearmer will reach and please one. FRANcIs WATSON.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PETRUCHIO. By G. B. STERN. Chapman and Hall. 7s. 6d. THE author has produced an admirable light entertainment. The end of it does not seem very likely, but that does not matter, She suggests with a minimum of the Italian language the charming scene in which the modem Petruchio finds his bride. Modesta is a little Ligurian peasant, one of three servant girls at a villa, prettier and lazier than her sisters-a humbugging monkey. The young Englishman on a visit there must needs take her for his wife, and finds her impossibly selfish and pleasure-loving, much fonder of clothes than of her husband. So he decides to take her out of the luxurious life and make her work with him on an Italian farm. She is beautifully tamed, but how can a young, sport-loving English dilettante fit into a working atmosphere of gourds and goats and grapes after a London flat ? That is a secret revealed by the rest of the plot. The gulf between the English and Italian temperaments is indicated with abundant humour.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
LITERATUBE. THE CITY OF SUNSHINE. The Citij of Sunshine. By Alexander Allardyce. W. Blackwood and Sons. As a rule, there is no more unromantic mortal living than the Anglo-Indian. The " Griffin " and enthusiastic specials who skim the surface of the land in a cool season, are indeed prone to break into glowing periods concerning the ''gorgeous East." But the effect produced upon the European character by any prolonged residence in the most picturesque, and at the same time the most humourous, country in the world, would appear to be almost invariably' commonplaceness and unalterable gravity. The reason is not, of course, difficult to discover. There are awkward practical qualities underlying Indian picturesqueness and Indian absurdity which tend to detract from their charm. With tho national prepossession in favour of the more solid virtues, it is difficult for the average Englishman to retain any delight in the flowery jungle, or the fairy.like grotesqueness of tho native bazaar, when he has learned that the one means lurking snakes and poisonous miasmas, and the other any number of grave offences against salubrity. In the same way he ceases to be attracted by patriarchal habits, and romantic beliefs, when he finds that these by no means indicate the manly qualities of energy and uprightness. But after all it is a part of the Englishman's Philistinism (his meiitorious Philistinism no doubt, but Philistinism notwithstanding) to dislike or despise the Romance of India because of her deficient Respectability. This deficiency is not to be denied ; as far as thc respectable virtues go, India has some cause to feel ashamed. But her shortcomings herc are, after all, but negatiA'e qualities, thc result of applying to her a foreign standard. The positive quality, the distinguishing fact about herself and her people, is not Respectability nor the lack of Respectability, but Romance. She is only to be seen truthfully, and interpreted justly, when looked at from the romantic view-point, so that it is really to le regretted that just those people who know most about ber refuse either to see or to paint her for us under this her most lovable and vital aspect. Mr. Allardyce, Ave hasten to say, forms a brilliant exception to tho rule; evidently he is under no illusions himself as to the character of the mild Hindoo; ho does not attempt to attribute to him any of the heroic virtues, nor does he represent India, after tho manner of the gushing special, as a Paradise of luxuriant splendour; he is content to paint her as he finds her, as imagination and experience have shoAvn her to him?with all her faults and Aveakness, her unreliability, caprices, and deceits, but at the same time Avith all her dreamy fascination ; her grace, her pathetic tenderness, above all her poetry, Avhich hides a multitude of sins. The * City of Sunshine,' as its description stands in our novel, Avill do for the picture of almost any Bengal village of tolerable size. There is the picturesque little temple under tbe fluttering peepnl-tree, tho dilapidated but imposing-looking mansion of the poor native nobleman of the place ; the tawdry stucco dwelling of the rich Mabajan, or money-lender ; and then the street of quaint little open shops, either linc broken here and there by high brick Avails, OA'ershadowed by large-leaved plantains. Mr. Allardyce is sufficient artist to people his little world with none save living and typical men and av omen; Ave have no lay-figures, no ghosts, to fill up empty niches and corners; all bis characters, from Ram La ll, the greedy oilman, to Gangooly, the simple garrulous headman of thc village ; from Kristo Lahory, the proud and poor Brabmau, to Three Shells, tbe moneylender and Arillain of the story, are true, not only to life, bnt to natiATe life. The reader may learn as much from studying even this little side group of secondary personages as from spending many hours in the actual dust and heat and bustle of an Indian bazaar. But there are two studies of a much higher dramatic order, testifying not only to the author's exceptional grasp of the shades and colour of character, but also of his clear sense of the very questionable improvement for moral worth or personal happiness to bo effected by encouraging Young India to make one mouthful of all European intellectualism, much after the manner that the ancestral sage Vasistha swalloAAed the thunderbolt of Brahma ; Avith much the samo results, also?of sore inward burnings, and outward vomitings of smoke. Inasmuch as the noble human spirit, or thc spirit Avhich just falls short of being noble, is always a higher matter of study than the oddities and drolleries of vulgar natures, Krishna Gossain, the faithless apostle of the Brahma Somaj, is a more interesting creation than Romesh Chunder Roy, otherwise Mr. R. C. Roy, of the Calcutta bar, the Anglicised Baboo who has tasted the delights of one year's spoiling and petting in London. But Mr. R. C. Roy is deliciously life-like, Avith his " enlightenment," his quotations from Shakespeare, his poems, patent leather boots, contempt for his countrymen's prejudices, and withal his imperturbable good-humour. Krishna is, as Ave have said, of a noble type ; he is the son ofthe kindly and cultured old priest of Dhupnagar, and has been sent by his father to Calcutta to learn, not tho heresies but the wisdom of thc sahibs. Here he associates himself Avith the neAV sect of thc Brahma Somaj, and avc have him, in the first scene, tearing off and discarding his Brahminical cord as a solemn preparation for the life of persecution and hardship he is eager to court as a national reformer. In truth, his zeal is real and earnest; he is quite ready to meet martyrdom in attempting to reclaim bis countrymen from tbeir idolatrous superstitions. But Avorse dangers than persecution beset bis faith; instead of disinheriting or heaping reproaches on his son, the kindly old priest receives him with tender pity, and sets about contriving a marriage for him with a Hindoo girl for Avhom he has conceived a pas- sion. Little by little Krishna's new religious fervour melts away nnder the influence of his love and his father's generous kindness. Tho romantic attractions of the old religion begin to exercise a dreamy charm over him ; and in the very midst of all these influences the Calcutta Theistical Society commit tho error of sending down to Dhupnagar Mr. lt. C. Roy, so as to confirm and strengthen his flickering faith. Krishna has all tho poetic sensitiA-eness and refinement of the higb-casto oriental, and the shallow vulgarity and hybrid Anglicism of his lowborn countryman finish the work of bia demoralisation, and the smoking flax is quenched. Tho scene in Avhich Mr. R. C. Roy arrives at Dhupnagar is so humourous that wo cannot forbear from quoting it:? Forth from the palanquin crawled a man of middle stature, with skin Mackel* than the blackest native of Dhupnagar, but dressed foppishly after tho manner ofthe Anglo-Indian dandies of Calcutta. An enormous sola, or pith-hat, covered with yellow silk, and resembling in shape a huge overgrown toadstool, was perched jauntily upon his crisp locks ; his dress was a loose jacket of black paramatta, with a vest of tho same material sufficiently low in tho breast to show a dirty shirt-front garnished with gold studs, and a pair of stiffly-starched white trousers, which had apparently been just put on to enhance the solemnity of the wearer's entrance into Dhupnagar. His feet wero encased in natty little boots of shining patent leather, and he wore a necktie of tho most gorgeous colours. Kings, pins, watch-chains, and charms, with precious stones dug from tho mines of Bristol, that Golconda of the West, adorned his elegant person in great profusion. In one hand he poised a gold-headed cane, while in tho other he flourished a scented handkerchief of less than doubtful whiteness. " ? Thus far into tho bowels of the land,' as the divine Shakespeare saith," soliloquised the stranger, addressing himself in the English tongue, as ho stood up and looked about him ; "but littlo bowels I shall find here, I warrant me: O dura ilia, thc restraints that caste and superstition havo cast upon a naturally hospitablo race! That's two puns, but it is too dark to take thom down, Peace bo with yo, friends," added ho, in Bengalee, turning towards the crowd of villagers. ??Upon you be peace," replied Gangooly, coming forward and salaaming, but sorely puzzled in his own mind as to what hybrid phenomenon this might bc, wearing the dress of a foreigner, yet having the features and tongue of the Bengalee. "Are you tho headman of this village?" demanded the hybrid, shaking out the perfume from his pocket-handkerchief as Gangooly thoughtlessly approached too closely to his delicate nostrils. Tho headman again salaamed and answered in the affirmative, adding, moreover, tho information that his fathers had been headmen of Dhupnagar since tho British had obtained the stewardship of Bengal, Behar, and Orissa. "And have you no hotels in this benighted and heaven-forsaken hamlet, my good friend?" said the stranger, whom we may without further reserve introduco to tho roader as Mr. It. C. Roy. " Is there any decent place where a gentleman can get a night's lodging? " " I don't know, Baboo?that is, Sahib, I mean," said Gangooly, scratching his head. ?* Your honour sees that when respectable Hindoos come to Dhupnagar we are like to fight among ourselves for the pleasure of entertaining them; for verily, as holy writ sayeth, ? That man is truly excellent who offers to a guest a soft seat, clean water, and sweet words:' and when a poor man comes among us we all giA-o him something to make up a meal, and quarter him with some one of his own condition ; for, as the Scriptures again say, ? Benevolence towards all living creatures?this is religion.' But in the case of?that is to say?in fact, your honour," stammered the headman, twirling his ckaddar in perplexity, "strangers never do como here, and so wo don't very well know Avhat we would do with them. And is your honour a Hindoo?" demanded Gangooly, dubiously, as ho eyed tho pantaloons and Bristol jewellery. " You will excuso our asking this, for we aro simple people, and seldom see anyone except our own folks." ?? A Hindoo! of course I am a Hindoo. Give mc a light, some of ye," said Mr. Roy, taking out his cigar-case; but, polite as Bengalees in general aro, not a soul stirred to do the bidding of this man of doubtful caste. "There is not a better-born man in all your valley than I am," he continued, striking a light for himself on the sido of a fusee-box. " But aro you a man of caste, Sahib ? " asked Gangooly, fidgeting about uneasily at tho idea of being impertinent to ono who might bc a Rajah, or a Deputy-magistrate, or somo other great official of Government, but at the same time fearing lest he should compromise the caste of himself or his neighbours by giving hospitality to a pariah. " Caste, indeed! do I look liko a man of caste ? " cried Mr. Roy, indignantly. " Why, man, I was six years in England, and have eaten more beef in my time than all the cows of Dhupnagar would make, if they were killed and hung up hy the hind legs tomorrow." Shama Churn, thc grain dealer, observed that it was getting late, and, as ho must bo stirring betimes in the morning, he would ?o homo to his bcd. "And I will go with you, neighbour," said Be joy, tho fjhatak, shrugging his shoulders, as ho took a pArtjpg glance at their perverted countryman. ?* Come home to bed, Bnjo, child/' cried Dwarkanath, the school master, catching hold of bli son's arm, as that reckless young man was pressing forward to address the stranger ; **good never comes of tho**e wlio wander under th** cover of night." "Sri Krishnaji.''* erie I Niry\ the quack d<*ctor; "and ol I Biprol.iss, the money-changer, wantinr his potion all this time! I am too long hore ; " and off ha hurried as fa*t as his legs could carry him. And in tho course of a few minutes thc villagers had all dispersod, with tha exception of Gangooly, the headman, who still stood uneasily before the stranger, scratching his liKid, and twisting tho corner of his upper garment in mute per* p'exify as to what he should do with this awkward arrival. We must of course let Mr. Allardyce himself unfold the intricacy and detail of Krishna's descent from the high moral position of a national reformer to the easy tolerance of a cultured Hindoo, whoso favourite maxim is that " There is no creed so bad but it may serve to comfort some poor soul." But tbe reader may take our word for it, tbat though Krishna's course may be considered by some a doAvnward one, he never fails to carry Avith him our sympathy and interest. Another excellent life-picture is Mr. Eversley, the collector, an AngloIndian of the old-fashioned type, Avho gets lectured by the enlightened modern newspapers for his rough-andready manner of deciding cases; and his inferiority to a model young civilian, Muffington Prig, AAdiose reports are always drawn up with faultless regularity, and who could never fail to answer positively thc inquiry of tbe Government how many punkah-wallahs had been vaccinated in his district during the last twenty years! Rut CArcry page of Mr. Allardyce's charming novel contains some happy idea or description worlhy of perusal. Amongst the many sweeping charges made against that well-abused entity, tho British publio, a very common one is that it refuses to take a lively interest in India. But this accusation is no longer well founded ; there is a growing desire to know and understand India better, and a few more such romances as 'The City of Sunshine' Avould do more both to sustain and satisfy the increasing interest felt by :;ll cultured Englishmen in the far Asiatic homo of so many of their countrymen than a Avhole library of reports and elaborate descriptions of viceregal durbars nod political skirmishes from the pen of Mullington i'rig, whether official or otherwise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE CONQUEST OF PLASSANS.* Messrs. Vizetelly seem to have done their best to make Zola popular in this country, having published up to now unabridged translations of fourteen of his realistic novels. Whether his works ought to be expurgated or not before being placed before the public is a moot point; but Messrs. Vizetelly can at least claim that their translations in general are excellent, and that the characteristics of Zola are so well known that few persons, even his admirers, * "The Conquest of Plassans." By Emile Zola. London : Messrs. Vizetelly. 1887. would choose his works, even with the gorgeous and striking covers in which they are issued, for free use and public display in the family library. Some of his novels are wonderfully dramatic, and, with all their faults, can be read over and over again. u Germinal/' the " Assommoir," and " Nana'' are instances in point. Others, such as 44 His Masterpiece " and " Therese Raquin," are dreary reading, notwithstanding their piquant parts and their tragedies. The one before us now ranges between the two; inclining, if anything, towards the former. It is intended to describe French clerical life under the Second Empire, and deals more with the intrigue of the priest in the house than faithlessness towards his vow of perpetual chastity?a subject, by the way, dealt with in another work, " The Abbe' Mouret's Transgression.'' The hero of " The Con- quest of Plassans'' is a needy and ambitious priest, the Abbe' Faujas, who is dispatched to that provincial centre to supplant the feeling in favour of the Count de Chambord by enthusiasm for Napoleon III. How, installed as a poor lodger in a well-to-do tradesman's house, he manages to place the family under his control, then the local schemers, and finally the personages of the place, is related in the most interesting manner. Unluckily for himself, instead of confining himself to his mission, he embarks on a dangerous course in regard to a particular family of the town, and the man he has wronged wreaks terrible punishment upon him. A few errors are to be found here and there in the book, but on the whole the translation is well done, and maintains the character of Messrs. Vizetelly's renderings from foreign popular literature.

THE GENTLE ART OF CYCLING. By AN AMBLER. IL" WVE were sitting in a little r0oom at the back of the village inn, the Schoolmnaster and 1. He (lid] not tell me that lhe was a schoolmaster; but the expression of habitual worry on his face, the constant ten(l of the conversation towards the vagaries of the Education Department, grotesque examination-papers, the characteristics of the genus boy, and many other similar touches, convince(l me that lhe wvas a pedagogue. Then, again, for four mortal weeks lhe had been sitting on the banks of the stream that flowed beneath the windowv, trying to hook innocent little fishes that ha(1 never ilone him any harin. This was just the sort of pastime that a man, whose soul had been eml)ittere(l by tle brutal stupidity and Satanic impishiiess of a hundred boys, would fly to. lie was manufacturing a mysterious paste of a variety of messy farinaceous substances, in whichl he now and then dropped a few drops of giln, much to the (lis,,ust of the natives who peepe(l in at us through tile barwvindow. With this toothsome mnixture lhe expected to commit much slaughter on the followiii, m(ining,. It waas most annoying ; the rain was pouring (lownr steadily, to the Schoolmaster's great satisfaction, andl lie would persist in talking fish. I knew that nothing but some educational subject would lead him away from his awful hobby, so, in sheer (lesperation, I tackled him on tile teaching of foreign languages. He took the bait and we were soon at it, to use the words of Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim, " Ding-dong, horse and foot, helter-skelter, right and left." " Oh, yes," said he testily, " there's to be no application now; everything's to l)e made easy, and boys and girls are to be taught French without their knowing it. They're to pick it up, as children pick up their mothertongue ! Why, sir, they'd be seventy years of age before they could read half-a-dozen pages on such a -system. When I was a boy I had to work hard to acquire knowledge. My first French book was William Cobbett's French Grammar-do you know it? " " Know it ' I should think I did," I replied. "Shall I ever forget the villain's instructions for learning the genders? You were to rule sheets of paper down the centre and then go through the dictionary, copying out the feminiines on one side of your line an(d the masculines on the other, and committing them to memory a page. at a time. Do you know anything more likely to prevent a boy learning French ? The Schoolmaster's worn face re]axed in a smile, but we soon both agreed that Cobbett was a fine old fellow, a-nd had done much to set people thinking. It was this conversation that made me determine to ride over to Farnhain the next day, if the weather would but change. What better excuse could one find for a ride along the Hog's Back than an interview with the ghost of old Cobbett? And beyond Farnham there was Moor Park, with recollections of Dean Swift and Stella. The Schoolmaster ap- prove(l my plans, and(, rather slheepishl, beggedl Ine to b)l'ill r in inl it splra)y flront1 Col)l)ett's Yra ou. You sec., ill spite of yearls of suffilerili fronm the brutality of boxs, thie ol( fellow had still a s-oft place left in his heart. T1e morning looked doubtful, to say the least of it ; theI London piaper prophlesied thItUfl(Ier-shlowvers wvith brigiht intervals. I r-esolved to take mn hance of having a fail share of the latter. When I once asked an old iikipper' how heJ liket Isea-faring, lhe gave Ine this answer If evel uC'1 Coin e acloss a mllanl Who has heeten on t he seas for thle-e vears, and - sasS ies likes it, Vyou maY put hini dlown itas at liar.'' .Just so, if ever vOu Colite across at cyclist who says that lie rieleS ill all weathers andI elljtys it, dlon't you believe him.

Thle, ci).t of keeping Up such an ilit-ituitioln ImuLs-t b)e Vciv sittall, but it is a civilisin, and relitiuiig intluence that should bear excellent fruit. I admire quiet, unostentatious wvork of this kind. Your great man gives at large sum of money to build a b)ig institution, which is opened withI a loud ftourish of trumpets, allnd illmllmdiate vIol'% is showered up)Oll the gracious founder, everyone taking it for granted that the institution is going to accomplish great things b)eCatuse it cost at pile of mnoney. The founders of these simple libraries received no glory and expected none; they have been content to try what Can be (lone to raise the tone of thl -illnae labourer and mechanic. Sucl places form a quiet haven for a man whleon lhe has lhalf-an-hour to spare, and( they often ,ive shelter and amusement to the belated cyclist, who, if he be a true follower of the O-entle Art, slips a coin illtO the contribution-box, and l)e1liaps, whien lhe returns home, sends (down a few books to add to then shelves. My nearest Nvay to Farnhaum wvould have been through the scattered haiIIlet of Send(, on to the famous Ripley road, but as that would have meant about five miles of rather rough riding, I decided to tack in the direction of New Woking, and get on to a road leadin, through shady lanes and across comnitons into Guildford froi the Stoke side. As I got into the saddle I caughit sigaht of the Schoolmaster sitting in his melancholy punt, where lie had Ibeeni eastin, his line on the waters since six o'clock that morninii. He waved his hat in farewell, a most unusual (lisplay of high spirits in so undiedionstrative a character. I conlcluded thlat his three hours' exertions must have resulted in a bite. I'lie roads were none the worse for veste rdav 's rain, and there was the advantage of hav-in,, no dust to contend vith. Betweell Woking and Guildford there are no hills worthy the namle, only a series of gentle inclines that evi elderly ainblers can get ov'er with ease. There is one nice little slope, running dowvn into the road theat leads to Mayford, where the trees meet overhead like the arched roof of a cathedral aisle. I should not like my enemy, the Scorcher, to know it, but I have been guilty of coastinq down this incline. In justice to Imy'Self, however,, I wish to stato that I have never been guilty of such an act when any man, woman, or other animal has been in sighlt. On the ethics of coasting disputations might lbe carried on for years b! discourses, letters, and pamphlets, just as St. Augustin and the earlv Fathers discussed Pelagianismn an(d Arianism. 'I'lie sensation is delightful, and it is a tempting form of rest for weary legs; but it is decidedly dangerous both for tlme rider and the pedestrians who may happen to get in his w.ay. The cockneY Hlarrys and country yokels who go in for coasting without a break to their machines deserve all they get at the hands of the magistrates, and a gieat deal more. No one but a stupid brute would think that all the men, women, and children in a district ought to leave the road clear in orlder that lhe may indulge in a selfish form of amusement. The cyclist, who is also a gentleman, realises that the high road is for others as well as for himself. On this particular ride, wvhen I turned the corner of the road vhere thle incline commences, I was suddenly confronted with a blrewer's driay, a drove of bullocks, and a female cyclist, all going, (lowwards. Alam'selle, evidlently frightened half out of her life at the cattle, was tacking from one side of the road to the other in a dangerous fashion. !,he had evidently turned the corner at full speed, instead of sloNving up, and had suddenly found lelself on an incline within a few yards of the drove of bullocks and the drav, both of which were of course travelling at a slowv pace. She was too nervous to dismount on the hill, aIIld, like 0mw half crazy, was steeriing the machine from side to side of the road, to prevent herself being precipitated among the bullocks. The inevitable end came in less than two minutes; the front wheel went into the bank, and over went the young lady. She ha(l escaped the dray and the drove, but she had smashed her pretty aluminium lamp, bent a crank, and given herself an unpleasant shaking. Bicycling too dangerous for ladies ? Not al bit of it ! He would be a 1)old man w-ho should suggest. that horse-riding is too dangerous for ladies, yet if a horse is not treated with discretion he brings the rider to grief. A bicycle is quieter than the quietest horse, and, if used with care, will harm no one who mounts its saddle. Unfortunately many ladies when they ride a bicycle (and, one may add, a horse too,) seem to lose all that part of valour which is called discretion. Theye do not seem to realise any possibility of danger, and they go gaily down hills where the strongest man would not be ashamed to dismount. We amblers see them and shudder. What wonder that the newspapers teem with accidents to our petticoatedl cyclists ? The wonder is that they are not much more frequent. Having assisted the young lady as much as was possible, I continued my way while she pushed her machine homewards, a sadder if not a wiser woman. I like this road to Guildford, because the lanes are so pretty, at times reminding one of Devonshire; there is none of the monotony of the high road,-not that I would imply that the high road to Guildford is monotonous, far from it-but I am thinking, of main roads in general. From these particular lanes you get delightful peeps at fine old mansions of timemellowed brick, half covered with ivy and nestling among huge trees. We Englishmen are so accustomed to the sighIit of these sylvan giants that w c scarcely appreciate their beauty, and seldom realise what the growvth of a great tree really means. D)id you ever, to amuse your children, plant an acorn in your garden and w'atch its yearly growth ? How slowly, how painfully slowly, Nature seems to Work. You cannot pereeive that the tiny stem is any thic lker (w higher this year thI an it waas last. L.om)k upon these 1(1 odgiant, and try to realise what the growth of t heir scaly trunks really means, how many generations of mlen have their green Jouglls WIaI e(.l over. To Ilnte, there is a soleninity, ats well as beauty, al)out a g'reat tree. It iiakes me feel how frail a thing, is uiman, what a small itemll lie is ill the eclnoniv of Nature. .Ireater I lil(ls re(jLlire all Alpine range to brillg this hJomiet to them; Ill a old oakl-tree ill a Surrey lane is ellnough for mil. What was once the village of Stoke is now a suburb of the town of (Guildford, and an Ugly one, of Course, as most suburbs are. You ride pll a, ,,emtle miacadamnised ascent until vou reach what is Called Chertsev Street, where the gradliemlt is much steeper adl(l you aie in a legion of rough ('rallite setts lea(ling into the High Street. S'omle People ride up) Chertsey Street and (l owu the High Street. WN hy, it is (ditfeult to tell, for it is an unmcolfortable jolt at the best, ald the tratfic is *,ften thick and alwav's erratic. I invarial)lv walk (lowu tilte High Street, because 1 cannot pass the sec( ond-lhamirl book shi)p witlout ovemhauling the stock. Have \ou ever experienced that indescribable thrill of deliglit at findin, at second-hand bookseller iii somuip remote conitry town, in which you had lt nt (dreamledl of being eonflrollted with such a joy 7 If not, then you have lost at' least one of the pleasures of life. The worst of b)uyinig books is, that sonie lay you may come across a copy at a, lower price than you have given for yours. Tlhis was my unfortunate experience on this particular (lay. There stood I, face to face with two ieal l)argains, which I could not take advantagre of because they were already onl my shelves, having lbeen purchasedl at a much higher price. Unable to )ear the sight, T savagely puslhed the maclime downi the hill and over the canial bridge ; and then moun1lting, nlee more, turned up the narrow road on the right, called tme Farnham Road. But it is impossible for any middleaedl aml)ler to go very far along this road without dismounting, for it ascends at a rather acute angle to the level of the famous Hog's Back. After nmany miles of narrow winding lane s, the billowy hills, thmat are somewhat su(ldenly revealed as one clilmbhs outi of (Guildford, appear like mountain rangies; Nature seems at a bound to have chalngedl her moo-I and taken up' her w% -ork on; a gfrand -scale. 1y travelled friends, I pray you not to s;mile at a simiple-minded Englislman speakin, of granderll ill connlectioll with a Surrey landscape. Before you have finished the first mile you are ready to admit the legitimacy of tile title Hog's Back, for /Ioya, a hill, it certainly is. When the summit is reached, however, you are fully rewar(led for your exertions. You are 011 all excellent ridiling,-road, which runIs for al)out six miles aloang, thle narrow hill-top on either side of which are superb views of typical South of England seenery. Surely there is no cyele ri(le to surpass this I)irectlv l)e-lan to face the exhlilaratiimg hill-top l)reeze, 1 con-rat tlated 1mnvself onl mlly grood fortulle. hitrighit ilntervals,' tile meteorological officials had announced; I had capture(l one of them, at all events. Thme black clouds, that had followed threat- eninglly in my wake all the morning, liad now passed away, and, riding along inl a perfect blaze of August sunshine, I had the privilege of seeing the rain, on the other side of the valley, pouring out of ragged-edged clouds upon Hind-head. Never have I had so glorious a run. Down in the plain on the north side, as far as eye could see, was a beautiful lanld of green field1s and yellow corn, interspersed vith patches of woodland in tfleir richest summer gaYrb; on the south vwas a lovely valley, thickly clothed 'with foliage of every possible tint of green. I must needs dismount and lest me on ?t gate to enjo this superb scene. Such, I thought, must have appeared the promised land to 'Moses, when he stood on Pisgah. And then my fancy turlied to young" Fitz-Eustacc anid his gallant cry,Where's the coward that would not dare To fight for such a land!when, with a rush and a w hirl like a steanm-engine, there shot by me a youth o(n a bicycle. His back described the once familiar Scorcher's curve: his inose almost touched the handle-bar of his machine ; and lhe seemed to be taking all available means of shuttin, out the lovely landscape through wVlich lie was p)assillg. 1Hadrl an aveng'ing allnel, or devil, been pursuing, hi lie could not have pe(lalled 'vith mlor e pathetic fierceness. It W's at soIrry sight indeed for a gentle ambler, and it would have ma(de me unhappy for some time, but, as I got into the sa(l(lle again, the breeze increase(l to sometltiilm like a glale, and miyv atten tioll Aas ttirne( to the task of ke epilng the niachine upright. rhle Nvinid sang wild songs iii the spokes of my wheels as I came in sight of larllhamn an(l its hop-garldens, and it N;as a relief to amble alon, in the sheltered roa(ls on the lower ground. Once in the lower road it was easy to see that one was in a land of hops, and that picking-time was near. Shabby individuals, chins unshaven and hair unkempt, trudged along, each with a mysterious nobblylooking sack slung over his -shoulder. Whatever else the sack contains, you may rest assuied that it holds a kettle or a saucepan, or a publican's tin can, for boiling water at the roadside. These tramps, howeveer fond they may be of beer, dearly love a cup of tea, or they would not carry the means of making it for the number of miles that they do. I have often been astonished at their deftness in prepaling afternoon tea, which they seem to take at all hours of the day. Any one of them, duly washed and combed, would be a great acquisition at a picnic. If you have eveer tried to prepare and light a fire on such an occasion you will readily appreciate the skill of these gentlemen of the road, who get a bundle of twigs blazing in the proverbial no time. The tea and the sugar are kept, each in its separate screwv of paper, in the trousers' pocket. Milk is dispensed vith as a rule, but I have occasionally seen theem scraping out a tin of condensed milk. These mien alvays seem to be in a state of anxiety about the time of day; if they condescend to speak to the traveller, they always want to know the time,-they also want another penny to add to the tbreepence they have in order to olbtain a niight's lodging. You may, however-, relieve yourself from any anxiety on this point, their knowledge of dry barns, out-houses, and casual \ ards being of a most extensive and peculiar character. We should probably be greatly astonished if we knew the number of people who live on the road during the summer months. On a certain little peninsula formed by the wvinding of the river Wey, three of these gentlemen met every evening at about six o'clock luring last summer, two middle-aged men and one old man with white hair. I had frequent opportunities for watching the spot, and regularly, within five minutes of each other, they would make their appearance shortly after the church clock in the distant village struck six. Sturdy and strong, they looked, andl the old man vas decidedly fat; they were always in excellent spirits, andl cracked jokes together while the saucepan was boiling for their tea. One of theem always .sang the saino song, wvlile hie examined the contents of his bag:I)earest Mabel, now I'm able To buy you a happy howie, Since they've raised my screw, love, I've enough for two, love. \Will you marry ? Do not tarryHe never went beyond this point in the song; l)ut whethler it was because he remnellmbered no More, or because the arrangements for the meal distracted his attention, I could not succeed in finding out. A notable thing about the party- was ti at they always had a newspaper, which one of them, .seated comfortably among the ferns, his back supported against the trunk of a fir tree, read aloud to the others as they sipped their tea from tin cans. And w hat (1o you think vas the first item of news the reader always started wvith ? It was invariably the cricket intelligence. To witness their excitement over the latest Scores froml Lord's or the Oval w as an experiemmce not easily forgottenl. How these men picked up a living I could never discover; h)ut they were obviously (quite happy amid well fed, notwithstanding their rags, alnd they never seemed to be short of tobacco. Past the famous hop-gardeils into tihe vilil, ,u lk)m' Frii'ia I trundled, and turning up a side road to the left, paid my respects to the inn where William Cobbett was born,the Jolly Farmer. It is a commonplace public-house, and nothing more. What a pity it is that babies who are to become famous should not always be born in picturesque surroundings No one could wax enthusiastic over the Jolly Farmer. By the by, how few famous men ha.ts the licensed vietualling interest produced ; or is it that the sons of publicans, when they achieve greatness, take pains to conceal the occupation of their sires But the publicaus earn really only claim half of Cobbett, for his father was a farmer as well as an innkeeper. While I was riding, alon the rough eentral street of Farnhamn, my mind filled with thoughts of pugnacious Cobbett, a strange thing happerned, as the novelist would say. A very unclean Italian, once an innocent peasant, nowv one of the horrors of civilisation, was ferociously grinding out one of Moody and Sankey's hymns. I had never, until that moment, heard any saCrecl song played on a street-organ. 'I'he strange thing that happened was this,-the hymin-tune set up a train of thought wvhich eventually lecl to a name that I had not read of, nor heard spoken, for more years than I care to reckon.

Of all the babies that have ever been borin in Fl'arnlhamn, baby Cohbett and lbal)y Toplady ale the only two who lived to miake any stir in the world. Yes, Toplady not only wrote sweet an(l gentle hynmis, but hle wielded a doughty metaphysical sword agatinst nIo less a giant than John Wesley anl(l when theologians (lisagree, it is a decide(ld stir that they niiake. As to Cohbett, his life was a continual stirriw, up of things in gener'al. Did he not write under the niiane of Peter Porcupine ? W\as li}e not accused of raising dliscontent in the miiind of the agricultural labourer, and inciting himn to aets of violence, and to the (lestruc.tion of corn, stacks, mnachinery and othier property ? Cobbett had his fauilts, and serious faults they were, but, as the hig-h-priest of indusitry and (loe(l perse\erance, lhe (did much to give backbone to the outing mnen of iis daly. Ile was the great a(lvocate of the gospel of self-heelp, thle great pihysicianl who recommended Ihard worIlk for every physical, mental, and Social disease. His AIvicE ro YouvMEN was at one time in the pocket of every thoughtful young workiman dlnd the Nvorkimnen of to-day have lost muinch by turning their backs upon Sucl an excellent chIaracter-foimning lbook.

Cobbett's RuRAL RIIDES, should be in every cyclist's library. 'The book will suggest many excursion-s, an(d it gives a remarkalble insight inlto the conditions of rural life at the beginning of the century. In it are described, with an always vigorous and sometimies picturesque pen), many places that are familiar to the wvheelhan wvlo has travelled the Sussex and Hampshire roads. Cobbett's extraordinary knack of letting off his political steam at all sorts of ockl times and places, is showvn at its best in sone of his descriptions of scenery, as in the following characteristie example This pretty valley of Chilworth has a ruil of vater, which comes out of the high hills, and wvhlich occasionally spreads into a pond ; so that there is in fact a series of ponds connected by this rwi of wvater. This valley whcllh seemis to have been created bv at bountiful Providence ats one of the chIoicest retreats of nian, which s'e'mlls formlied for at senCIe of inlno cence and happiness, has beei 1) yv ungrattefull man so perverted as to iinake it inStruimllental ill elfcctillmg Lvo of the Illost damiiLblc of purp)oses ; in carrying into execution two of tile most lallnnable invelltiolls that ever sptrangt from thle nmin(d of man, under the influence of time devil ! nallnely, the mnalihng of gunpowder aindl of bank-notes! Here, in this tranquil spot, wvhere the nighlitingales are to be lhcard earlier and later in thme Year thanr in any,. other part of England, where the first bursting of time buds is seen in Spring; whlere no rigour of seasons eami ever be felt; where everythin, seenis formied for precluding thae thre thoughlt of wvickedncss ; here hz.s tlc devil fixed on as one of the seats of his gnraud manufactory ; and perverse anld uinglratefull man not onlv lends him his aid, but lends it cheerfullY.

The alders and the villowvs, therefore, one can see, without so much regret, turned into powder by the wvaters of this valley; but the bank. notes! To think that the springs, which God htas commanded to flow from the sides of these happy hills, for the comfort and the delight of man-to think that these springs should be l)erverted into means of spreading muisery over a whole nation 1 jolted along the uneven road to the hostelry where, from experience, I knew I should he well treated. Be it known to all good cyclists that there is in the village of Farnhami a neeat and clean inn where an excellent bed and breakfast can be obtained for three shillings. If tllis mine ho}st can thrive, onl such it ta iff, why not all? Putting up iny machine in the dry coach-house, I partook of a scanty lunch, onl principle, and afterrd s proceeded to find Cobbett's grave. There is no more pleasant village in England for an afternoon stroll in the l)lazing sunshine. Not even a Scotcllmzan couldi find fault with the cake-shops, and there is always at plentiful supply of fruit on hand. You stan(l in the market-place and look up the picturesque hill at the old castle above the cedars, and think what a happy man time Bishop of 'Winchester niust be to have such lodgnment. On this particular August afternoon a fine and inspiriting touch was given to the scene by a regilent, of Lancers riding up the hill. Far-nham has an unmistakable spice of Alder-shot about it ; the wvell-dressed, smart-lookin- men. with bronzed faces awl fierce moustachios w1ho gaze at you sternly, almost witheringly, until you feel quite ashamed of your untidy, du-,tv cycling costume, are officers of Quten Victoria. But you take hea-t of grace when you remember that the bicycle has now become a part of the equipment (in peace-time at any iate) of the I ritish Army. Cobbett's grave is easy to find. It is covered with a rectangular monument enclosed in ugly iron palings; on either side of the inscription is a conventional inverted torch, the only attempt at ornament. As the inscription is fast disappearing I thought it would be w ell to write it dow-n, anld, as the children in the school-house were singing a merry chorus in their shrill treble voices, I copied the wor(ls: Bleneath this stone lie the remains of WILLIAMI COBBETT, son of Georgec alnd Ann Cobbett.

In 1794 he became a political writer, in 1832 wans returned to parliament for the borough of Oldham and represented it till his death, which took place at Normn-andy Farm in the adjoining parish of Ash on theThe date cannot be deciphered, but Cobbett died on June 17th, 1835. On a wtall inside the church there is a marble tablet erected to his memory by his colleague in Parliament, one John Fielden. The tablet is worth seeing because it contains what surely must be an admirable likeness, carved in relief; it exact]y coiresponds to one's preconceived notions as to the app)ealance of the sturdy old Radical. There was not even a wild flower by the grave, so I could only gather a few blades of grass for the Schoolmaster, who, on my return at eventide, seized themn reverently and said, with a tender-ness that I had not ,given him credit for, that lhe would preserve them between the leaves of his copy of time ADVICE TrO YOUNG 3IEN.

-------------------------------------------------------------
The Mystery of Jlr. Bernard Broun. By E. Phillips Oppenheim. (Bentley & Son.) Melodrama, not of the highest kind, plays a large part in 'The Mystery of Mr. Bernard Brown.' One may enjoy the oldfashioned novel of a certain type more than the novel "replete with every modern convenience." But this one is not charming, though it is out of date. It has the worn-out, ramshackle machinery of the worst kind of sensational novel, and all the ineffectual tricks of the trade. Besides, there is not a mystery, or none to speak of. The writing is vulgar and weak, the characters and general handling inept.

The Modem Prometheus. Samo author. (Fisher Unwin.) Little to say?and that little not praise? about measures our impression of ' The Modern Prometheus.' Of style it has none, or the worst possible, and the matter, though it smacks of "upholstery," opulence of detail, and ambitious intention, is poor in the extreme. People are " distinguished," "elegant"; they have "alabaster shoulders," the "carriage of a queen," "superb toilettes," "voluptuous lines." Nobody begins, but everybody "commences" to do things. Frock coats are "faultless." All this might mar even good material; it damns what is already bad.

History of the United States, from the Discovery of the American Continent. LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 1868. i ?-{ ItlTBBATURB ( By George Ban- 11 croft. Vol. IX., 1776 to 1778. (Boston, US., Little, Brown & Co.; London, Low &Co.) Covering the interval between the summer of 1776 and the spring of 1778, the Declaration of Independence, and the publication of the American-French treaty, this ninth volume of Mr. Bancroft's great work recounts the trials of George Washington during the gloomiest period of the struggle that resulted in welldeserved victory to the young republic; and with a full sense of the responsibilities of an historian venturing to deal with a subject of such grandeur and importance, the writer has done his utmost to prove himself worthy of his theme. From the date of Lord Howe's arrival at Staten Island on July 12, 1776, till the Christmas Day of that year, the commanderin-chief of the revolutionary force, had few grounds for hope, apart from confidence in thegoodness of his cause, and a religious assurance that the God of Battles would not eventually permit the unjust to triumph; and whilst the leader strove to conceal his reasonable depression and fears, not a few of his less resolute and less patriotic followers surrendered themselves to despair. On both sides of the Atlantic clouds were rapidly gathering over the fortunes of the insurgents. In Europe the first announcement of the Declaration of Independence had caused impressions unfavourable to their purpose. In England the immediate effect of that bold renunciation of the mother-country was most disheartening to the small band of statesmen and politicians who had denounced the ministerial policy and demanded justice for the colonies. Englishmen, who were fully satis- I fied that the British Parliament had no right to impose taxes on the settlers of New England, could not see that the colonists were justified in revolution as well as resistance. To such men, scarcely less than to the most violent defenders of George the Third's ministers, it i seemed that the dignity and authority of the j Crown were to be maintained at any cost, and j that the submission of the insurgent states must precede the enactment of measures for i the relief of their grievances. Nor was this feeling confined to the mother-country. Though the French King desired nothing more than that Great Britain should be embarrassed by the discontents and commotions of her Transatlantic States, he was not prepared to sanction revolution, and give his support to principles which even his dull vision could see were fraught with menace and peril to monarchical interests. There were also other reasons which made the young Louis reluctant to take a step which would be necessarily followed by war with the first naval power in the world; and though he could not quench the generous enthusiasm of the youthful Marquis de Lafayette, ?to whose chivalric mind the glory of fighting for liberty was far preferable to all the delights which princely wealth placed ^within his reach, ?he turned from the solicitations of Vergeunes with a prudent resolve to wait awhile Defore he committed himself to all that would inevitably follow his recognition of the new nation. Similar considerations influenced Spain. Thus tho European agents of the American States endured the mortification of seeing their influence wane on the Continent, just at the time when England was making it clear to her conscience it was the duty of her king to punish disaffection and subjugate rebels. " The new attitude of the United States," says Mr. Bancroft, " changed the relation of parties in England. The former friends to the rights of Americans as fellow-subjects were not friends to their separate existence; and all parties were summoned, as Englishmen, to unanimity. The virtue of patriotism is more attractive than that of justice; and the minority opposed to the Govern- ( ment, dwindling almost to nothing, was now to have against them king, lords and commons, nearly the whole body of the law, the more considerable part of the landed and mercantile interests, and the political weight of the Church." Whilst this was the state of things in Europe, the affairs of the revolutionists were not more hopeful on the actual ground of struggle. With the exception of a small number of brave leaders, distrust and despondency prevailed throughout the ranks of the colonial malecontents. Jealousy of supreme power was the chief cause of their weakness. Having just broken from their connexion with a tyrant in Europe, they were resolved not to create for themselves a new tyrant nearer to their doors. To such a degree were the United States suspicious of each other that, after taking ample precautions to preserve their individual sovereignty nnd mutual independence, they could not, for their common security and the triumph of their common cause, bring themselves to invest their commander-in-chief with requisite powers or to furnish him with adequate supplies of men and arms. A similar distrust prevailed in all classes. The sentiment which Cobden happily designated " fireside jealousy" produced its natural fruit in dissensions and petty rivalries. Inferior captains of the army despised their commander; private soldiers had no faith in the ability or patriotism of their regimental officers; a considerable proportion of the nonj belligerents had so little respect for an army ! of militiamen, drawn from just such people as j themselves, that they could not believe in their j ability to win a grand battle over regular troops. As might be expected, this faithlessness ! in and despair for the rebellion were less general J amongst the rural populations than in the j towns, where the official supporters of King j George's Government were concentrated, where j men had been trained in habits of respect for long-established authority, and where the consequences of war upon commerce and trade were most sharply and immediately felt. Amongst the superior classes of the colonists there was | a general feeling that the rebellion would be speedily crushed by the King's troops; and consequently, many men who wished success | to Washington's operations deemed it prudent to hold aloof from his army. "In New York," says Mr. Bancroft, " where two-thirds of the men of wealth kept aloof from the struggle, or sided with the enemy, the country people turned out of their harvest^fields with surprising alacrity, leaving their grain to perish for want of the sickle/' Whilst the timidity and jealousies of the colonists left George Washington to maintain the struggle with a handful of raw troops, the British Government poured mercenaries and munitions upon the scene of contest; and for a time their energy was rewarded with a series of successes. The battle of Long Island may not have heightened the lustre of British arms, but it was a grievous blow to the States, increasing the despondency of the people, whilst it compeSed their commander-in-chief to withdraw his men from Long Island. Sixteen days later tho King's army took possession of New York, in which city a conflagration, that broke out just five days after the entry of the Hessians, consumed one out of every ten houses, and roused the victorious soldiery to wild and savage fury against the inoffensive populace. "The British troops," says the historian, "angry at the destruction of houses which they had looked upon as their shelter for the coming winter, haunted with the thought of incendiaries, and unwilling to own the consequences of their own careless carousals, seized persons who had come out to save property from destruction, and, without trial or inquiry, killed some with the bayonet, tossed others into the flames, and one, who happened to be a royalist, they hanged by the | heels till he died." the affair of White Plains, a comparatively trivial reverse for the Anieri| cans, was followed by the disaster at Fort Washi ington ; and during the dark days of his famous I " retreat through the Jerseys" Washington ' saw from their conduct that the inhabitants ! looked upon his ruin as inevitable. " The men J of New Jersey, instead of turning out to defend j their country, made their submissions as fast ! as they could, moved by the wavering of their ?Chief Justice and the example of Samuel j Tucker, who, though he had been president | of the convention which formed the constitution I of the state, chairman of the committee of ! safety, treasurer and judge of the supreme court, yet signed the pledge of fidelity to the j British." It seemed that the Howes and the | Hessians, aided by Indian mercenaries, were j destined to carry all before them. j In Europe these successes, which to men of I ordinary vision appeared the beginning of the end of the rebellion, lost none of their importance. .They inflated with insolence the English {ministers and their supporters, who by this ; time numbered ninety and nine out of every I hundred persons in the entire population. ! Howe was extolled as the greatest general of modern times; and the King's firmness in declining to retire before his contumacious subjects was the theme of admiration throughout the country. Corresponding depression existed amongst the few Englishmen who still remained true to the colonies. "Franklin's troops," wrote Voltaire, giving utterance to gloom which possessed the hearts of those Frenchmen who wished success to America, "have been beaten by those of the King of England: alas! reason and liberty are ill received in this world." But whilst English ministers were congratulating themselves on their victory, and chuckling over the discomfiture of the rebels, intelligence was crossing the Atlantic of events that had altogether changed the aspect of affairs. Even in his retreat | before an overwhelming force the American commander had snatched successive victories from his enemy. The brilliant surprise of Trenton?concerning which Lord George Germain exclaimed, "All our hopes were blasted by the unhappy affair of Trenton"?was followed by the battle of Princeton; and before the first month of 1777 had closed, Washington was in a position to order all the Jerseymen who had sworn allegiance to Britain to " withdraw within the enemy's lines, or take the oath of allegiance to the United States of America." It would have been well for British fame if our statesmen had seen the lesson of this change in the tide of war; but instead of yielding or making any overtures for a just settlement of the dispute, they continued the war with a brutal ferocity for which Burgoyne's capitulation and Cornwallis's surrender were insufficient punishments. Englishmen of the j present day blush for the shame of their land when they read the story which sets forth the dealings of our ancestors with the red men who were hired by English ministers to plunder and : burn the homesteads of defenceless backwoodsmen, and slay their inoffensive wives and children. " Il faut," said Le Come Saint-Luc, the ruthless partisan, "lacher les sauvages sur les frontieres de ces Canals, pour imposer des terreurs, et pour les faire soumettre au pied de la Trone de sa Majeste Britannic.'' In accordance with this counsel, the savages were let loose upon the settlers, their women and their babes, to inspire terror and make them submit. It is enough to hint at atrocities the details of which shock humanity; and yet when Edmund Burke ventured to denounce the employment of such means of warfare, and to declare that red men armed with tomahawks were no fit allies for the King of England, no fit companions for British soldiers, or even for Hessian mercenaries, he was upbraided for his lack of patriotism, and sneered at in good society for his sentimental softness. Englishmen reverend by years and profession were heard to argue that, for the subjugation of rebels, ministers were bound to employ "every means that Providence had put into His Majesty's hands"; and amongst prosperous people at London dinner-parties it was an affair of" good breeding to say that critics sitting in their armchairs in England had no business to condemn measures* which received the approval of officers in America, who knew from personal experience the exigencies of the war, and were employed to bring it to an honourable conclusion. So his Britannic Majesty fought on with his Hessians and his red men, with results that justified Chatham's words, " My lords, you cannot conquer America." Mr. Bancroft's ninth volume, however, stops short of the date which witnessed the final justification of the elder Pitt's prediction, and closes with the reception of the American Commissioners by Louis the Sixteenth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
x - ;is Prom and Ver. By C. Bond. Edin. I burgh: Blackwood & Sons. Thee Miscellanies consist of reminiscences of Invernew, alias, aa1aeudis, taken down by the Editor of the Inerea Herald from the conversation of a man of ninety years of age, a venerable relic of the put,-whose faculties ae still entire, and whom mind is as vivacious as it may have been shortly after the Battle of Culloden. This patriarch lost his parents in his infancy, and was brought up by a grandfather, who lived to the great age of ninety-seven. The memories of the Highlands, transmitted from the grandfather to the grandson, thus stretch * back for above 150 years, to a period, " when," as we can well believe, " the Highlands were in a very different state from what they are now." The reminiscences of the Nonagenarian must possess great local interest; and though Captain Burt's Letters have forestalled some of his information, he has related many curious incidents, particularly those which occurred about the time of the Rebellion, which was long subsequent to Burt's residence in Inverness. We select the following traits of manners, now a century old, as specimens of this amusing little book: KIRK DISCIPLINE. The Rev. Peter Nicholson of Kiltarlity so far carried out the discipline of the Kirk, as to order, of course not for good conduct, LORD LOVAT ON THE CLTTY STOOL. This order sadly militated against the pride and wishes of his Lordship. Being, however, assured by Clerk Fraser that the law of the Kirk was imperative, and that nothing but compliance would save him from elcommullication, he consented to the punishment, upon a promise from the Clerk that he would stand by him for three Sundays in the Church of Kiltarlity. Mr. Nicholson, who was then the John Knox of the Highlands, being about to address the lordly occupant of the Cutty Stool, Lovat exclaimed, " Ah, Nicholson, you ungrateful man! was it not I that placed you there !" (having presented him to the living); whereupon Mr. N. answered, " True, my lord, you have placed me here; and I have placed you there to-day, to be publicly rebuked for your sins." Lord Lovat, however, thereafter forsook the Church of Kiltarlity, and became a hearer of that eminent divine, SMr. Chisholm of Kilmorack. Nonagenarian remembers seeing, in addition to the cutty stool, the iraequs, or iron collar, affixed near the entrance; and the last person said to have been exhibited as an example to offenders, was a military officer, at the instance of the Rev. Mr. M5acbean. INTRUSION OF MINISTERS. In 1744,however, Lord Simon Lovat presented the Rev. Mr. Thompsou, at that time chaplain in the Castle of I nverne, Xtothe parish [Kirkhill ]. The anticipated difflculty of reconciling the people to such an appointment was immediately realized. Forgetful, it would seem, of the peaceable doctrines inculcated by the departed minister, the parishioners proceeded violently to oppose the settlement. The population turned out en mans; the women, under the leadership of Muckle Kate MPhail, a person of masculine stature, being particularly active. Having filled the creels they carried on their backs with stones, they commenced such an attack upon Mr. Thompson, that he precipitately retreated to Inverness, closely followed by his persecutors, who kept up a brisk running fire at him with stones from the church till he reached King Street, near the Central School, a distance of about eight miles. His appearance, on passing the Green of Muirtown, was painfully ludicrous in the extreme. Mr Thompson was a remarkably little vma; under his arm he carried whit wais then termed a brown ,a.. r', or great coat, a huge wig reached halt down his back, while his brod-skirted and long-flapped coat sorely oppressed and encumbered him, as, with his cocked hat in one hand, and perspiring at every pore, he trotted on ; a stone or two from his enraged pursuers, under their generalissimo, Muckle Kate, ever and anon couellig him to quicken his pace. The very children accompanied their mothers and supplied ammunition for their creels, by picking up stones and putting them into them. Such an exhibition attracted numerous females to the doors of their cottages at the Green of Muirtown, to whom he said, as he ran by, " Oh, women, is not this hard !" Hi.s brother, being master-gunner at the Castle, and expecting the reverend gentleman would have to make a quick retreat from Kirkhill, was looking from the Castle-hill in that direction ; and seeing his brother hard pressed by the foe, he sent a few soldiers out to cover and make good his retreat; and at sight of t-arm deary, or the "red-sodgers," Muckle Kate and her " irregulars" in turn " faced about" in double-quick time. A whole year elapsed, before Sir Thompson attempted again to appear at the church of Kirkhill. In the meantime, the feelings of the parishioners were softened down; and being an excellent man, and as " a continual dropping wears the rock," so in process of time the parishioners of Kirkhill became quite reconciled to his ministrations,-Muckle Kate, among other of her allies, being indebted in afterlife to him for assistance. At the era of 1745-6, Mir Thompson was conspicuous for his loyalty to the house of Brunswick. THlE PRICES OF PROVISIONS NINE'TY YEARS AGO. Nonagenarian remembers the best butter being sold at I Os. the stone, Dutch weight ; cheese at 3s. per stone do. A good leg of mutton might be obtained for Is. 3d., the fieshers never thought of weighing legs of mutton but merely named a price from Is. to is. 3d. according to the apparent size. Good beef was sold at ld. and IId. per lb. Oatmeal at Gd. per peck. Hollands, ld. per gill; strong beer, 3d. per Scotch pint. A fat hen was sold at from 3Id. to 4d., chickens 2d. per pair; eggs were generally sold at about Id. per dozen. Shoes, (Brocan Sasanach,) from 2s. Gd. to 2s. 9d. per pair; brogues, (Brocan Dubh,) from HI d. to Is. per do. The best green tea was frequently bought at Is. Gd. the pound ; it is probable, however, that it was smuggled. In those days the Excise officers in the town, consisted of honest Mr. Collie and his son; and when the Inverness dealers expected a smuggling vessel in the Firth, they were accustomed to get the father and son into their houses and treat them with such hospitality, that they would neither be fit to distinguish a free trader from another vessel, nor have an. opportunity of leaving the houses of their kind entertainers before a late hour on the following day. Although the prices enumerated appear very low, yet they were great compared with previous years. Nonagenarian well remembers Donald Cameron, a neighbour, mentioning that he and his wife had been on a Friday morning to the market, and purchased a leg of mutton, a peck of meal, and cart of peats, all for I Id., and procured a gill of Hollands for himself and guidwife with the other penny composing the shilling. -Wages were low, the difference, however, that existed, was considerably in favour of the poor. So far as the reminiscences of the Nonagerian go, the book is really amusing. It also contains some copies of verses; and a semi-political Essay.

Not to interfere with. the circumstances of this tale, which shloiild IIe left as a thread through tIhe lahbvriitlit oif incidenrts to interest oiur fair friends Irjoin first to last, we shall orly select a few examples irorn tile volume, which. may ind(lieate its niature withouit exposing its secrets. The opening isl reflective and touch. iug: - " It is diflhenit to discover wvrat are the exact sources from wviichr spring the thrilling feelirsga of joy and satisfaction wvith which we look aick to thle days of our early yoruth anm to the scenes in which our intrincv was passed.

I love to dwell upon sich memories, and to find likenesses for them in the course, the aspect, and the productions of the earth itself. I see the same sweetness and the same simplic itv per. vading the youth of all nature, and find in the dim violet, the youngest child of Spring, an image of those early jovs-pure, soft, anid calm, and full of nn odour thit acts uponi the sense more than that of any other flower. Thus it is, I suppose, and for these causes, that in looking hack upon the days of mv youth -though those days were not as hliakpp and as bright as they are to many people I feel a secret satisfaction, which I knewv mnt at the time. Yet those hours indeed, as one wholii gives a diamond to a child, bestowved upon me a gift the value of WhiChl I knew not till manya a year had passed away." j Here are also some finely simple reflections from the many sccattered over tiese pages:_ "' I have sifice learned to know,that in the lii. man heart there is often a great difference be. tween remorse and repentance; and that whent wve have done a fellow.creatuire wlrong, when! we have pained, injured, aggrieved-ay, even vhien we only entertain the purpose of doing so -we hate that being on account of the very acts for wvhich we sshould hate ourselves. * '; At this point may lhe said to end tile period otf my early life, wlirchlike tin ol( picture paintedl at first iii vivid colours soon loses the bright- ! ness of its hlies, becomes mellower but less dis,tiuct to the eye, thien grows grey and dini, anidi then is almost obsctired altogether hias now' greatly failed away tronm mhemory, tlonigh the impressions wvere then ns bright and vivid as perhaps, any that [ have received since. 0 * el I How far is it to that town d' demanded Louise, after gazi ng for some time. ' Nearly five miles, dear ome,' I replied. ' How near it looks ! ' she said: ' I shiuldn't liave thought that it were two.' I It looks so, dear Louise,' I replied, 'fromi the clearness of tie wintry air; and so it is, ILouise' I said, ' wit,, future, as witho distant things. To tie calm, cold, icy eye of experience and reason, the remote and distauit times, the five or six years hence, look as near as if we could touch them; the space between dwindles down to nothiuig, anid the rest of life steets but as a moment: while, in the warm and sunny days of youth, tie airy mist of passion, of fancy, aiid of expectatioin, throws every future thing far, far away, and the five or six years that way lie between us and happiness seem a long age of wvearisome expeetation.' She looked up in my face and smailed, saving, ' I suippose it is so, Ilenri. "' Rolbert Stuart, a Scottish soldier of fortune, is a capital portrait aini so is Moric Endeni, a folloower o I)e ('erotis. T'i'he former, in, eti-. ping Ileiiri at Bordeaux, previous to his join. ing the armiv, gives rise to the fooowinmg :_ " I Two horses may lie hiad for you cheap enough, if you can ride well; for there is it Mlaquginon, called Pierrot, has got a troop of vild devils from tie Limousin, for which lie can find no sale here amosngst the merchants. and citizens, and soft-honed gentry of Bordeaux.' I smiled, replying, ' We will rhle them, if they Can1 be ridlden. ' I adsise you.' he con1tinull"J, to to tJhis rather thlaui to firm nish yourself at the army ; both because you will find it cheaper, and because it alvayslooks better, and gives a higher opinion of a man when lie joins his leader fully prepared. Besides, you have a chance of some little adventure on the road, which may take off the freshness of your arms, and give you some little reputation. Suchi things are its common in these days as they were in the times of the knights-erraut. Now, !i'hat I propose for you to do, when you have joined the army, is, not for vou to put yourself in this troop or that, as a sim'ple man-at-arms - for that is the way to get yourself killed speed. ily, without alny body hearing any thing of youa hut to look about the camp for ainy stray vaga. bonds that may be abotuit-I m;ean of those whose whole orutulle consists ill at steel cal, a blreastlplate, and a horse; and the whole sum of whiose virtues lies in courage. You, will tind two or three voting fellows, too, at every cor. tier, who, like yourself, are seekiiig service, fresh in arnis and willing to stick to aziy leader wvho will bust gallop tiemn into) the cannon's mouth. They are generally younger than you are, for von have hteen somewhat late in taking to the trade. That, however, will onlv make it the mone likely they should followv you; wvhicli is tie great thing; fo;r to ibe the leader of one 'otiese lbands is thle sure means of getting on, wlhereas to be a follower in one of them is the readiest way of getting hanged. You have then nothing to do, you know, but to take tip ahisolutely t'he trade of adventurer, attack the enemy every where, harass him on every occasion, cut oft his parties, attack every cbhuteatn where you think there is a soldier,-in short, run your head against every stone wall that you meet with. Yon may chatice to knock some of them dlown ; and it' voL do, yout will gaimi a reputation wihich will soonl put you at the head oif a lbetter band than that withl wvhich i you, set ouit. Good old soldiers will lie glnd to conie to yotil then, aid you may work yourself up to be at general by steadiness atid perseverl. alice.' I' Tiere are two thlings, however,' I said, I whiclh you have forgotten to mention first, where anm I to get the money to pay these recruits ? fbr after I have bought horses atid armas for mvself and Andriot, there will miot be mich left 6 pay any one.' Ohi, they will pay themselves-thiey will pay themselves,' lie said. Vo' n may liave, indeed, in the first instance, to give tne or two of these vagabonds, who have seeti service, a crown a-week, just to make the bueginnintg of a band; all the others you will take merely tipon trial; and, of course, you must ptut the Catholics undercontribhttious. If they will have wvar, let them have war, and pay for it. It is an undoubted fact that, since thie last pteace, they have put to death, in one town or another, full ten thousauid Protestants - and therefore we have a right to make them pay for such sorts of amusement. Then you will put the lprisoners to ratisonm, von know and ever y otle that is taken bv 1your men pays VOII a share too. Yon will, therefore, have plenty to keel the hand iup as soon as it is hunitled.' " A scene after a skirmish, in wbiich our hero had reseined saute nuerchatits from the Catholics, will supply its with attother characteristic extract :_ " In the meatihile, Andriot and 15Moric Etidem iwere aiding the merchant's wife and the vomen servants to lay out the provisions upon the hianks of the stream; and wvith all the facility of all old soldier, Moric had cast downv his steel Cap, and was lousily arranging the whole, with niauty a dry jest, and merry hook, amd carelss lavtghter, wJhiue nhaul tle I I i I i women and the children soon forget the terror that had seized them, and prevented them even from perceiving the extraordinary ugliness of their gallant defender. A huge cold capon, which he instantly christened ' Moonseigneur,' was placed in the midst of the little cirele; manifold eggs were arranged neatly around; various stores of salted provisions, t(nguies lard, and sausages, were spread out by his handls with more taste than one might have expectedl and at length came two huge bottles of wini', wihich. lie called the king and. queen, with various other things, for each of whlichli )r bsd a name. As we all took our plaCes arouin, howevex, it was discovered suddenly thlat ti, eggs, which were to form no inconsideridike part of the meal, 1had not been cooked. ' We could soon cook them,' cried Andriot, ' fIr there's wvood enough in the neiglhbourhood ; but vwhere are we to find wherewithal to ciok them ill in ' I You get the wood-ou'OL glet the wood, 'scapegrace,' cried Iloric, ' iu up the hill, and get the wood. You shew how long you have beeni a soldier. l)on't you know that every man.at.nrams carries a kettle onl bliN head and a fryingpan on his stomach ? Get ve gone, and come back speedily, .nd leave tile cooking to me. Nowy we wvill put hiim in a fright for his polished morion,' continued Mlloric, after the youth wvas gone, at tie same time collecting some dry stricks an(l grass that lay about, an(d striking a light. I Susanne. ns pretty one,' lie continue(d, to one of the little girls, ' I see some bruanches lying there; go and fetch themn, while I hlowv the lire lip.' Andt, using his mouth for a pair of bellows, lie had contrired to kindle a strong flaine by the time that Andriot and the girl had retuined. ' Now, Andriot,' lie went ol, ' take otf yowr morion, there's a good v'utih fill it with vater out of the stream, antd you shall see that we svill boil tile eggs in a minute.' ' Had I not better take yours, Master Moric sail the young man, looking somewhat rietiflly at him. Moric burst into a shout of laughter, iii which all the rest of the party joined. ' Cole. come,' cried M1oric, ' since thou art stingy9 (i thy morion, Andriot, we will roast the eggs, though it is a difficlilt task, and not to 1undertaken by any bitt all old woman or ,ni old soldier. There's aln art ill roaiting of eggsthere's aii art roaTisllg of egg&; And lie WhIo ieoult rlu before lie can1 walli, m""'t lirt learn to Uase his legs.' Thus sung Aloric Endem in a tolerably) good voice, as lie laid the eggs in order amongst tile hot wood.ashes; and there was somethiin, so contagious in the gay, careless merriment whlict my new follower displayed, that I never lielhell a meal pass more cheerfully than did olurs oS that day by the banks of the little streaml. Moric's eggs proved to be excellent, aud of the wine, which was excellent also, he was Permnttedl, in recomnlelise, to hlave his full silre. It ]lad lno perceptibile effect upon hill, llov. ever; more cheerful it could niot nmake dim. and his head was a great deal too well seassined to the juice of the grape for his faculties to lie disturbed by it. Before we rose to go oil inlu way I produced tile purse which I had receivod from the merchant, and bestowed ten Cloa'll from it upon the old soldier, vithi tile likle sumn up1on Andriot. 'lhe eves of luotil gliste()l not a little at the treasure they had so rapiidl acquired, and 11lorin, starling uip, drewv nme ii on one side, saving, ' That puts nie in mid I something.

Wi, 1, s.tid noting yet aabout the way we intend to dlivile it ; but I tell you what I saw tried in tile last wvar, and wvhiich is the best plan; nimelv, this, that every thing which is brought' ill is given llp to the captain. Every week it is dlivided amongst the whole band, the number of Iits being just one more than the hand, including tie Calptain. lHe has twio lots, and every other maln one. That makes each man do his best I;Or the whole, and see that others do the hest tii; anid the captain, who has a great maiv tiliiigs ti I)aV, and to do for Ius all, has some. thing t(l do it with, and a, little more. Rans.ums, howvever, and compositions, and such I tliinigs, are, of coijise, regulated differently, according to the laws of arms, and each manl keeps his own. Also, of any plunder taken in a general baittle, you knov, a part goes to tihe leader whose cornet we tighlt tinder; but only le Sine in making terms with the general, that OILu get his aauthority for dealing with your iIn men according to your obwfl way, and bind voillrself as little as vStlt caln to thle laws and regulations of other leop)le.' I omewvhiat free. looting advice, Master Miforic,' I repliedl; I thoagh not had in rome respects. Buit, nevertheless, you must rememher that I have honiur and glory to gain, and to make a. name lir mv bland too, as vell as to acqiuire money adl lili(ler.' I The one 's the way to do the oilier,' replied I1foric. ' Your way to get ]lo. riour and renown for yomirself ani( yonr b* hand is to fight like a lion and make your men i]lht; and depend upon it, every olle lights tell times ts vell when lie thiinks lie is to get s metltiiig for it, as wvhen lie thinks that every tihing lie takes is to ble shared vith. the sviole tiniiv. There svas some reason in wvliat the miaft said, and I then proceetded to consillt liin iii redard to obtaining so51e new recruits as 'Iliedlily as piossilie." With llenri's lirst military trial uniler the eyes (f the great Protestant chief we shall now wI as ;awake by daylight on the following mornillg, and svits pl), and had made a soldier 's llief tWilet, as well as armed myself completely, lel'Ore live o'clock. Luckily it happened that I was so, for in a few minutes afterwards I was visited by a gay.looking youth, who introdiicei biinlselfas5 the Captain (Geniistc, and who told me that in mal lhour we were to mouint the breach together. Ile looked at me somewhat silierciliotisly from ]lead to foot; and, though, I ' it that i could have broken him throuigh tIle middlle over my knee, as a boy breaks a ,tick, his cool scru'tinv annoyed aiid discom. Iosed me. We talked over what was to he donje for some time; aitd, urging me to hasten MY movements, he went to take his station at the head of the storming party. I lhtirried aiter at all speed, followed by my little hand arid, ,gCttiig olut of the hamlet, and passing thrloughi the middle of tile tents toward the lattery hlich had effected tIme breach, a line, a gay, aiid all interesting sight was presented, vwhich remains fixed upon my memory, as miuch fro)m the heatity of tile scene as from being the first military etfort of any consequence in which I took a part. The whole army was drawn 'it in the open space between tile camp and tlhe city; and about five or six hundred vards ill advaiice of the line was the small battery, selichi had effected a very insufficient breach in the wall. It was still firing, as it had been Since tbe break of day; and a light wind blew the wreaths of smoke down into the hollow Which ran towards the Charente, enveloping the base of the hill on 'which Augouilame stands; while out of the white, uncertain mist thus created started forth clear the towvn, with all its manifold towvers and spires. 'T'he StIrl was shining brightly as he rose upon. the glittering line of our cavalry and inf'antrv, variously armed, and vith many a cornet and a pennon amongst them ; while the rich and peaceful. looking slopes and rises-the clear blde sky_ the bright sunshine-and the soft murmuir of the 'tutunin'al air, contrasted strallnely andl strikingly with the camp behind us,- tle long line of iron-clad soldiery in the front, the occa. sional thunder of our own artillery, and the flashes that burst from time to time from the I walls of Angoul'me. Stome way in advance of the general line appeared a sniall bodv of in. hntry, vwith (Genissac at their head and be hiind him, a little before the other forces, an entire infantry regiment, supported by a strong lorce of' cavalry. Between that body and the little lpcdot of Crenissac were a group of oticers and gentlemen, withi one or two led horses, apparently waiting, for their riders. As I tassetd by, my eve rested for a moment iipons the wellknownI l)'Andelot ; while another officer, COnbiderably older in appearanmce, but with a fine opell countenance, whrons I took to be tile ftar. famed Admiral de Colignv, sat beside him, oll a strong horse, receiving from timne to time communications from different persons who rode up. D'Andelot's visor was up, and, as I passed, he noticed ine with an inclination. of the headt, and then, turning to tine admiral, pointed me out to him. (>oligjny immediately beckoned me towvards him ; anid, ordering my men, to march onl and take the order from Monsieur de Genissac, I advanced to the side of' the admiral's horse. ' I knew your father veil, lonnsieur de Cerons,' said Colignv, ' and my belholding his son here this day gives me the pleasant expectation of' soon seeing him belhave as his fiather would have done onl a similar occasion. I grieve that we have not the pre. sence of your cousin, Monsieur de Blancfor:ld hut his faiths has been supposed to be waveri for some time. I must not detains you, howyever, for here comes the prince, and the word will be given in a moment.' I bowed, and then advanced immediately to the side of Genissac, who, I kound, had drawn tip my men with his owvns very fairly and very skilfully. In order to take advantage of some liollowvs in the ground, we were to advance six abreast, three of my men and three otf his, with the twvo leaders at the head. As the whole of the party were composed of albont a hundred men, he lhad filled tip the space behind, where my cantv baand ended, by hsis oWIn troops; and, placihg himself close to me, lhe said, Now, Monisieur de Cerons, you and I will keep near together, as I may hiave something to say to you when we are near the breach. I wish they would send tis the word to advance, for this long expectation dulls the men's spirits.' At thwat moment, however, an officer gave the Word to march, while the battery opened a sharp tire upon the bnreachn. In the first instance we had to descend some way, which we (lid with consideralde rapidity, but not so fast as far to outstrip the regiment behind, wvho, as soon as they were withiin shot, opened a sinart fire of small arms against the enemy. I'rom tile bottom of the valley we had nowv, however, to ascend to the park; and the moment we began to (lo so, one of the hottest fires of' musketrv I ever saw was poured upon us from the breach and the neighbouring walls. One of Genissac's men went down; and one of mine staggered from a slight wound in the shoulder, but regained his footing and kept on with the rest. I was somewhat surprised that we did not advance - more rapidly, and said to my companion, ' Let us hasten forwvard ! -let us hasten forward! Tle men ivill soon be out of the iire.' (enissac gave no order, and at tile same time a shot, passing, between, him and me, carried away a part of mv casque, and went through the head of one of tihe men behind. ' Don't be too hot, -don't he too hot !' lie said the minute after, when we had got so near that I could see the features of the men in tile breach. ' I am only ordered to make a reconnoissance; Int to retreat immediately, if tile breach is not prac. ticaiule.' ' But I was ordered to storm,' I re. plied; 'and tile breach, tiloulgh small, is deep, and seems to me (quite practicable.' IHave with yoti,_hlive with VOill thien !' lie said, ' if you are so eager.' But the words we had tittered had been heard by those behind ns; andl, tilough we lhad been, still advalncing, the men began to waver. It was a critical moment; anld, waving iny sword over my head, I cried alotnd, T To the breach ! -to tile breach !' Mly own men took it np, shouting, I To the breach ! -to the breach !' His people fallowed; and, ruishinig forward with iealous rivalry of each otiler, tilough, as we came nearer, the sIhots of the enemfy told terribly amongst ts, %ve clillned the height, and rushed tuip furiously to tile loot of the wall. There was an immense deal of broken rubl)bish, earthl, and stones to be passed, wilich hlad been cast dowin by the fire of our battery, an(l a tremendouis discharge of musketry welcomed us at the top ; but still we rushleldi on, while tile regiment, which had advanced to support ns, now caught the spirit ot the assault, and doubling its pace, crossed the valley and charged tip tile hill. Oln we pressed, as blard as we could go, with the stones and earth slipping away and rolling unider our feet; all staggering, some falling, and only thankfiu thlat tlCe dense smoke of tile eneny's fire rolled into the breachl, and prevented them from takilIg any very certain aim. When first we arrived at tile foot of the wall, the breach was crowded by arquebusiers; liut they began to fall back as we climbed over tile piles of rub. bisli ; and, wIleln 've vere near the top, only five or six men remained. of whom one rushed down, several steps to meet me, aiming a pistol at me as he came, and firing within three paces. Striking my cuirass oil the left side obliquely, tile ishot glanced off, alnd entered my arm a little above the elbow; but it was a mere flesh. woulile, and only incolnvenient. A blow of my heavy horse-sword, however, dashed my adversary's casque down, upon. his head, broke the fasteings, and broighlt Ilim on his knee; anotiler blow, before lie could ward it off, struck the belinet from his head, and at tile same time inflicted a deep wvound upon his forehea~d; and, as lie called out that le wvould surrenlder, -indleed, lie had no choice,_I passed him back to tIle ilands of IMloric Elndem, who followed me close, without seeing any thing further tilan that lie was a young manl of good mien. Genissac was 21oW a step or two before me; ltnt, rushlingt up, I was by his side in a momneit, and in another instant we stood together at the top of the hill. 1iie interior of what 'vas called tile park,_a large open space, formnlg a sort of Place d'Armes,_vas now opeit betore us; and, to my surprise, I eheleld, drawn tip (in either side, and ready to charge Is the moment we descended, a large body of men.at-arms, with their lances levelled, aind supported by a considerable force of pikemeni and arquebusiers oii foot. Our men were rushing up, however, one by one, as fast as they could climb, to our support; ,Aoric Eudem, having pased on his prisoner, I I I I I I I was clse behind uts; a sliglht.looking youth, armed only with, a close-covering casqile hnd Cu'irams, wva upoui my right, struiggling tip with difficulty over a steep part of the riniii atid giving him my haind, unfortinately for himself, I drew him up in n momentt: (eninsac wam a little farther olf on the satlae side, with four or five of his ftllowers; stnd, seeing the infantry regiment coming ulp, I thought it Itot at Nll improbable that we might he able to foree an entrance, notwithstanding the strength of' the enemy in the park. All this was soomi thought, and done in a moment ; but at the very same instailt the reginient helhind hluted, a aniall party of horsemien galloped up towards Ius from our ovn rtimy at full speed, and the arquehuesiers frnm the park opeened a sudden and trememtolos lirei upon the breach. Three men armongst nis were brought dowit at ouice; Geni.sae', stanidinig iupon a hiighl pd cit of the' broken vall, received a sho11(t ill hiS lletdi nmul fell laock, rolling over and over down the heap, of retbbisih, writhiing in the agonlies 4f denth ; one of his men fell ifuorward severely wimulded, and a sthot took tlme psior youth I had juist helped lip, amid, entering his right side, laid him prostrate atrosts 40e of my feet. Still my own followers were coming rapidly up several ol Gentissac's people were making their way towvards the top anid though it was impossille to face the force in% the park, niow that the other regiment ha1d lalted, it was quite possihle to effect a lodgment on the breach. Turning, therefore, to thlnse wvhlo were following, alnd to the grouip of officer-s who had now advanced nearly to the fo)ot of the wall, anid were shouting up loudly to me, thomgh I could not hear a word they said, froin the noise of the smadl arms, I called to them to roll me up galbions and harrels, for that we could certainly effect a lodgment. M1y vords were passed down by those who were filloiuving; but 1)','ndelot, whom I now saw at the head of the officers, shook his clenched list at me, and shouted to me, as I found, t. come *lown and retreat. The words were passed np to me, and with muchi regret, I owwn, I prepared to obey. ' We must retreat,' I said, ' M1oric. We are conimanded to retreat !' But at that moment I heard a voice which I thought I had heard somewhere before, proceeding from the casmtiue of the young man who had fallen beside mee, and who exclaimed, 'Oht, do not leave me here !' It would have heen cruel to do so, even had it leeu more difficult and dangerous to rescue him than it was ; and, therefore, taking him up in my arms, I curried hiin down to the 'pot where D'Andelot stood, and to vhicl several horses liad lheou brought, lby this tile, lor the purpose of removing the wounded. * You tteeni determined to) get yourself killed, .11onsieur de Cerons,' said l)'Andelot. ' We only intended a reconnaissance, and poor (e. nissac has suffered for his folly in chalginlg it into an assatilt.' ' Mly orders vere to storm. Sir,' I said; 'and I have done no more thilo I was directed to do.' ' 'We were wvrolng ! We were wronig, Monsieur de Cerons !' saidl that great commander. ' We wvalteo. to try yVoul: but Genissac had ftill orders how to act, and lie should have oleyed them. Now take a house, put yourself at the head ot his men as wvell as your own, get thent int') order, and malke thle best of your retreat. 'gun are 'cry vell bhel. tered here, hut y .ou will tind the 'tire some. watht hot in the valley. D}on't iintl timing yotir legs there, for you have shewn sufficieuutlv that it is not bullets you are afraid ol;' I onlyI paused to teol Mloric to place the lad I woI tarrying on a horse, and take him carefully to the camp ; andl then obeved the orders of D'Andelot. T'le matter %vas a mere affdir of discipline; the men followed my commands with nlaeritv; and choosing thedirection which -teemedl 11o0t sileltered frtum tile fire ot' tile irarrison, I led them on without loss, and with but little haste and confusion, till, passing the battery which had effected the breach, I took Up the same position with them which we had occupied in the morning before the assault began. I acted altogether as I had learned from the memtirirs of varioits distinguiishied knights andl otficers that it was right and proper to do o<n such occasions ; and the moment I had reached the same spot from which we hall started, I made the men wheel round again, and face the city, as if for a inen, assault. They were all picked soldiers, anld they performed the manruuvre witlh promptitude and precision hut. in the troubled state into which the whole .rt of warfare lhad fallen in that day, this little evolution, which never would have beeto neglected in former times, except in case of a coin. plete defeat, excited the surprise ot every body ,sit loud sihout of applause burst from the! regiments around." These quotations will speak more forcibly for Henri (le 'crons than any more praise of ours and we leave them, without comment, to the taste of our readers. !~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--

??? th Life and Labours of Mr. Brassey, 1805?1870. _i ?_ ? - - t-? 1 /Tl ll P ?. 1 1 V .1 SATURDAY, AUGUST 3, 18J2. of ap LITERATURE ^ By Arthur Helps. (Bell & Daldy.) When, in October, 1829, the newly-designed locomotive-engine of Messrs. Brathwaite and Ericsson, the " Novelty," shot over the level mile and a half of newly-laid iron-way at Rainhill, near Liverpool, at the unprecedented speed of more than twenty miles an hour, wise men foresaw the coming of a mighty change in the internal communications of the country. No one regarded the triumph of the Swedish engineer with more surprise than did his competitor, Robert Stephenson; whose "Rocket" obtained the prize at that memorable competition, from what racing-men would term its staying qualities. The " Rocket" was the only engine that accomplished the stipulated 500 miles; its average speed on the first day of trial being thirteen and a half miles an hour; while the machinery of the " Novelty " broke down after the second run. The shrewd foresight of the Lancashire manufacturers soon led to the commencement of that web of iron roads in which the country has since invested a capital amounting to more than five-eighths of the national debt. To accomplish this great task a new class of men sprang into existence. Robert Stephenson, practically trained from childhood as a miner and a mechanic, came naturally to the front. His father's position as one of the practical originators of the locomotive, his own special acquaintance with the subject, his admirable business qualities, and, we may add, his handsome face and noble bearing, assured him an eminence which was only rivalled by that of the highly cultured Brunel, who was, in the truest sense of the word, an engineer born and bred. To these, as work accumulated, were added men of the old school of road and canal engineers, such as Rastrick; men whose science played a less prominent part in their success than did their business capacity, such as Locke; and finally, in years of parliamentary madness, almost every one who could use a level or construct a plan. With these men,?the brain which was to direct the new description of public works,? were associated others, who supplied the brawny and nervous arms. It became evident, on the first serious inquiry, that the only mode of executing works of magnitude unprecedented in the country, with any regard either to despatch or to economy, was the contract system. The only efficient counterpoise to human idleness was to be found in human cupidity. This may be a somewhat cynical phrase; but it goes to the root of the real question. The advantageous employment of thousands of men is only to be secured by perfect organization of detail, and by such a careful and constant inspection of every part of that organization as shall secure its perfect and unchecked working. This, in a country where the whip is not applied to the labourer, can only be ensured by giving the executor of works- a pecuniary interest both in their cost and in their stability. The great principle of co-operation, the hope and promise of the productive power of the future, was brought isito play, although but rudely, by the system of letting contracts in the lump. It was applied, in a second stage, by the great contractors, in endless modifications of sub-contracts and of piece-work. And thus, while the country became furrowed with great trunk lines of railway, large fortunes were made by the men without whose intervention the cost to the proprietors would have been trebled, and railway work would ultimately have become a mere organization of costly idleness. Hard-handed and hard-headed men for the most part, these contractors came from the quarry, the bench, the forge, or the very ranks of manual toil. Certain intellectual characteristics were necessary to success, and usually attained it (when men were wanted), to the utter confusion of the moral order. A knowledge of work, it became evident, was a natural gift, in some men amounting to instinct, which enabled them wisely to utilize the labours of others, often including men of a far higher education and general ability than themselves. The way in which a man who could barely read, and could only scrawl the letters "acep" on a bit of stamped paper, which, however, his banker would discount, could tell, after merely walking over the ground, for how much money he would remove a hill, or bridge a valley, would be incredible to those who were not personally acquainted with the fact. Keen watchfulness, shrewd adaptation of means to ends, profound insight into character (as far as the few requisites for an efficient foreman or ganger were concerned), ready wrath, ready expedients, promptitude to take instant advantage of the engineer turning his back, power to screiv in both directions,? the utmost labour out of the brawny " navvy," the utmost pound out of the anxious engineer, ?these formed the main characteristics of the successful contractor. Drinking, it might be said, never stopped him; but, indeed, sometimes it did, and one, whose name is only second to that which we are about to mention, fell a victim to delirium tremens. "How much would you take," said an indignant engineer to one of these busy harpies one day, "if I were to give you my cheque-book?"? " All you have," was the cynically honest reply. Among these men,?the rapidly accumulated gains of most of whom vanished like fairy gold,?was one who became known and noted by his adherence to a line of conduct that was special, or nearly so, to himself. Where the typical contractor was rough and overbearing, he was gentle and courteous. Where others drove, he led. Where others carried on a constant war of detail with the engineer, this man was more faithful to that officer than were his own paid inspectors. When a large viaduct, which had cost some 50,000/., fell down like a house of cards, instead of attempting to throw the blame on the engineer, and thus the cost on the company, this contractor quietly and rapidly rebuilt it at his own cost. So rare a fellow-workman soon became eagerly sought for by many of those who found great difficulties oppose the execution of works under their control. Engineers offered him contracts, foreign governments offered him concessions, capitalists sought his support. So throve and prospered his affairs that a retrospect of his operations showed that, either alone or in conjunction with twenty-six different partners, and with agents and sub-contractors too numerous to reckon, he had constructed 6,COO miles of railway, at a cost of 78,000,000/. of money. The life of this man was a noble life, and might form the theme of a noble book. The history of his works, if written with that masterly generalization which springs from an adequate knowledge of detail, would be a contribution of unusual value to the industrial history of mankind. His negotiations with foreign governments, and his experience of wholesale attempts at robbery which, unfortunately, are not exclusively foreign, would furnish the satirist with new examples of human baseness. The mode in which he tempered the spirit of commercial sagacity, and the keenness of industrial activity by unaffected human kindness, and in which, over all his numerous engagements, there was shed one bright halo of incorruptible integrity, would be a subject for the pen of a Pliny to illustrate, in a few nervous, immortal words. We cannot compliment Sir A. Helps on his discharge of a task which demanded, for its fit accomplishment, knowledge of the subject, of which he gives no trace, and labour, of which he gives no evidence. We cannot say that we are told as much about the author as about the subject of the volume; but a very unnecessary sense of personality pervades it throughout. Worse than that, we lay down the book with an uncomfortable sense that Sir A. Helps's Brassey is but a feeble shadow of the real Brassey. There is no clear conception of the character of the man. There is not even an attempt at an account of his works. There is a great deal of that sort of personal gossip with the reader about the writer's thoughts and views, which may be very charming in the right place, but which is thoroughly out of place in the 340 pages which profess to describe the life and labours of Mr. Brassey. There is a feebleness in some of the original remarks which is marvellous. Thus we are told, "the system of contracting for great works necessitates much forethought before commencing them, and, for the most part, a rigid adherence to the plans originally laid down." " It is pleasing to find that, after all, we have some power in the acquisition of languages, for several of these navvies did eventually acquire a considerable knowledge of French." " The want of good government has been the bane of many portions of a region of the world." In fact, the author has so fully justified his candid remark, that "in writing the life of Mr. Brassey I have undertaken a task for which I have no special qualification," that we think he must share our regret that he did undertake it. He has given us a chatty and agreeable scrap-book, but something of a very different order from the work promised by the title-page, and demanded by the subject.

Camiola: A Girl with a Fortune
McCarthy, Justin
-------------------------------------------------------------
Camiola .* ? Girl with a Fortune. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. By Justin McCarthy, M.P. 3 vols. (Chatto & Windus.)Mr. Justin McCarthy pursues in ' Camiola' the fortunes of an old friend, whose acquaintance we made in one of his previous stories, and who figures throughout this new book as Mrs. Pollen, the Lady Bountiful of Fitzurseham, a faded London suburb. In Mr. McCarthy's romance there is not much of a plot; the author works on his old lines, drawing eccentric and epigrammatic men, subtle and epigrammatic women, and here and there adding a touch of dramatic vigour to keep the action from dragging. Mrs. Pollen is quite in his chosen style?acute, cynical, "not a bad sort of woman" according to her own admission, with a trick of telling every one what he or she happens to be thinking of, and then explaining how the trick is done. Camiola is an American heiress, somewhat of the same stamp; and in addition to them there are one or two girls of the author's second type of womanhood, simple, and silly, and made to be victimized. One elopes, another attempts suicide; a male character actually commits suicide. Life is held cheaply in Mr. McCarthy's novels, though he is too good an artist to allow much killing to be done on the stage. ' Camiola' is not so good a story as ' Dear Lady Disdain,' or even as ' Maid of Athens,' to which it is in part a sequel. But it is pleasing, nevertheless, and the reader will like it.

Babylon
Allen, Grant
-------------------------------------------------------------
Babylon. By Grant Allen. 3 vols. (Same publishers.) Mr. Grant Allen is incapable of writing a dull novel, but he has not yet shown that he possesses the peculiar gift of the novelist. In reading ' Babylon' one cannot help observing that the characters are typical rather than individual. The story is pleasing and even utopian, but it is never exciting. The most interesting parts of the book are those in which the author talks round his subject and draws upon his experience and his varied knowledge. ' Babylon,' in fact, has a very unusual quality: the padding u the best part of it. It is very common to find novels made the vehicle for all sorts of stray information, but it is very uncommon to find oneself in the company of a writer who can tell one so much without ever being tedious. ' Babylon' is bright and sparkling all through, but still it misses the essential point of a novel. Mr. Grant Allen does much better with short stories.

Arnold Robur
Combe, Martin, and Duncan Lisle
-------------------------------------------------------------
Arnold Robur. By Martin Combe and Duncan Lisle. 3 vols. (Chapman & Hall.) The hero of ' Arnold Robur' is the young heir to a comfortable patrimony, a fairly steady and accomplished man, combining a philosophical disposition with a somewhat keen appetite for the good things of the world. His lot is cast amongst many villains and many philosophers. The types of either class are distinctly out of the common run of humanity, and, indeed, humanity would have a poor time of it if all our villains were so intense and all our philosophers so shrewd as those drawn by Martin Combe and Duncan Lisle. Their story is manifestly a duplex creation, and if it were not for certain particoloured characters, tinged by philosophy and villainy both in one, it would seem very plausible to suppose that the authors had turned each other on alternately to supply the philosophy and the villainy, the lofty and the intense. However this may be, and although the pulling of the strings is too conspicuous throughout, ' Arnold Robur' is a good story, told by men who can write well, and who have aptitude for, if not experience in, the weaving of romance. The style is laboured in parts and the humour somewhat forced; but, on the other hand, there is some very bright humour and a good deal of excellent writing. It is unfortunate that the personages on which Martin Combe and Duncan Lisle appear to have lavished the most care, and which they evidently think their best, do not strike the reader as being most true to life. It is so, at any rate, with the men ; but Paston and in less degree Robur himself are successful sketches of character. So also are many of the womenfolk.

The Beauty of the World
Duffield, A.J.
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Beauty of the World. By A. J. Duffield. 3 vols. (Hurst & Blackett.) Mr. Duffield, though the translator of ' Don Quixote,' seems hardly to have grasped the rudimentary principles which ought to govern all novels. He lets us know his views on religion, philanthropy, Shakspeare (with extracts pages long from the works of that author), and the Bible; he expresses his opinion of bishops; he gives descriptions, not wanting in vigour, of life among the artisans of the Black Country; but therewith no plot, no character, no construction. There is no apparent reason why the story should begin or end where it does, nor why half the personages should be introduced. The style, in the earlier chapters at all events, seems to be modelled upon that of Charles Reade, exemplar vitiis imitabile. The only clear idea which the reader carries away from the book is that Mr. Duffield has in certain parts of it chosen a most grotesque method of gratifying a literary grudge ; and many readers will not even detect this, and so will carry nothing away.

Chareombe Wells: a Tale of Country Life
Werry, Eliza F.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Chareombe Wells: a Tale of Country Life. By Eliza F. Werry. 2 vols. (Stock.) ' Charcombe Wells' is a posthumous story by a lady who did not live to see it published ; and, though this task has been performed "by a near relative out of affectionate regard for the authoress," it is only fair to say that the relative had better justification for giving it to the public than many authors who publish their own first attempts. There is not much originality in such incidents as the disappearance of a baronet for several years on his own estate, the self-banishment of an heir whose legitimacy is in doubt, the captivation of a betrothed young man by an artful young widow, and the consolation of the deserted lady by a more eligible suitor; but the tale is told sensibly, soberly, and without the claptrap usually indulged in by mysterymongers. The rustic setting of the plot is really well done, by a ready hand in obedience to an observant eye and a reflective mind. The writer must have studied her rural characters from the life, and their portraits are faithfully and vigorously drawn. There is, at any rate, nothing to blush for in ' Charcombe Wells,' which will give pleasure to many.

Rhoda
Maitland, Agnes C.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Rhoda. By Agnes C. Maitland. 2 vols. (Remington & Co.) The prologue to 'Rhoda,' well written and necessary for the mechanism of the plot, and the somewhat conventional opening chapters afford no intimation to the reader of the interest and charm of the subsequent portion of the story. As the scene shifts from Norfolk to Devonshire, we find ourselves in the midst of a set of very real personages, drawn with a light but sympathetic touch. It is a noticeable and agreeable feature of the book that Miss Maitland is singularly loyal to her own sex. " Find out," as she puts it, "at what house .... accidental meetings most often take place, and you will know infallibly which is the pleasantest house in the neighbourhood; and that means simply where the most womanly woman is to be found." By far the most finished study is that of the old Scotchman Adam Gair, whose racy talk has no suggestion of artificiality. In describing his long quest of a missing grandchild and the circumstances of their ultimate meeting the writer has reached a high level of unstudied pathos.On the other hand, there is no deficiency of humour in * Rhoda,' while in point of style the author is far in advance of the rambling method so frequent amongst female writers. ?

Love, Too, is Vanity
Brewer, Emma
-------------------------------------------------------------
Love, too, is Vanity. By Emma Brewer. (Bell & Sons.)  Mrs. Brewer's story is old-fashioned, and there must be many readers in these days who will welcome it as a decided relief from newer and more conventional models. It is, in fact, a spirited novel of the sort that our grandfathers delighted in, rapid in movement, with incidents on every page, full of perils and adventures, with plenty of distressed damsels and desperate villains, with pirates and gipsies ana outlaws, and with enough of kindly human nature to qualify its strong melodramatic flavour. The author has framed her style on that of the romancers of half a century ago, and she has done well to cling to her early teachers rather than adopt the newer fashions of a younger generation. She would have produced far less satisfactory work by aping writers whom she does not admire.

The Life of a Prig
One [Longueville, Thomas]
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Life of a Prig. By One. (Kegan Paul, Trench & Co.) 

' The Life of a Prig' is better printed and "got up" than it deserves. The author has not much to say, and on common paper and in a common form of presentation his remarks would fail of any sort of effect. But his pages are so comely, his margins so broad, and his text is so narrow, that his matter seems almost interesting, and the essential futility of his satire (for satirist he would be) is, for the time being, only half perceived. The prig of his vision is not an artist in appropriation. He is only an Oxford man who has taken honours and enjoys a vast inheritance of spiritual conceit, and the story of his life is no more than a rather aimless account of his several essays in religion. His experiences are smartly , i imagined and smartly written, and one or ' two of the characters?as, for instance, the hideous young aristocrat who is divided between the doctrines of the 'Imitation' i and the teaching of the best agnostics?are ; amusing in their way. But the book is a ! failure. The satire lacks point and edge, : and the general impression is one of mingled ; flippancy and feebleness.

Criss-Cross. By Grace Denio Litchfield. (Putnam's Sons.) j ' Criss-Cross' tells in a series of letters the terrible success of a completely accom- j plished American flirt. The earlier part, j which gives the flirtation pure and simple, is full of fun ; but as the story grows more serious it loses its interest, and the end ! almost countervails the merit of the beginning, for it is as overstrained in probability , as it is defective in art.
