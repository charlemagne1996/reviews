John Holdsworth, Chief Mate
Russell, William Clark
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of the harrowing story of 'John Holdsworth' it is almost enough to say that it is a prose version of 'Enoch Arden' complicated by the circumstance that the shipwrecked mariner in the present case loses not himself but his memory as the result of ten days' exposure in an open boat on the Atlantic. The author shows no lack of descriptive power; and, though there is nothing very original in the tale, sufficient knowledge of nautical matters and of the horrible narratives of calamities like the one imagined is displayed to make the story fascinating, if rather ghastly, reading. The account given of the parting between Holdsworth and his young wife in the first volume is rather lifelike and pathetic, and that of the voyage dramatic, and, to a landsman's ear, genuine and intelligent. Holdsworth is happier than Enoch, in that poor Dolly's second husband, a most hopeless bargain, is opportunely drowned shortly after the return of her first lover. The part played by the child in drawing these hapless souls together again is well imagined ; and, although a trifle too melancholy for most tastes, the novel is no commonplace product of the silly season.

In Bonds, but Fetterless
Cunninghame, Richard
-------------------------------------------------------------
It is Mr. Cuninghame's laudable object to plead before the reading public the claims of an historic party which of late has been unpopular among the writers of fiction. There is considerable eloquence in the introductory remarks, in which our author urges the merits, in a picturesque and imaginative point of view, of the Puritan party during the troubles of the seventeenth century. Austere he allows they were, and precise in using the language of their sect, but one of these traits was the result of a life of conflict, the other of mental separation from their kind. And he thinks them at least as ideally respectable, at least as noble objects of poetic treatment, as the gallants who were not animated by views of life so earnest or obtrusive. Whether he has altogether succeeded in paying the Ulster worthies the tribute he desires for them is another question. The period he takes, that of Blood and Leckie's plot in 1663, is well selected, and the northern gentry and yeomen, with their Scotch accent and true blue Presbyterianism, probably life-like enough; but we miss any spark of literary skill in the handling of this promising material. The plot is thin, and the only part of it outside the scope of mere historic narrative, viz., the resuscitation of Lucy Afton's first husband just as she is about to be married to a second lover, is a needless piece of cruelty. We wish we could gay more in favour of the execution of a good idea.

For the Term of his Natural Life
Clarke, Marcus Andrew Hislop
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The moral of the ghastly account of convict discipline published by Messrs. Bentley is a little out of date. Perhaps as a reaction from the horrors which, undoubtedly, at one time prevailed in our penal settlements, the tendency of late years has been, some people think, towards the extreme of unwise indulgence to habitual criminals. But those who have an antiquarian bias in favour of the terrible, may feed full on hideous anecdotes of torture, murder, and cannibalism. Such readers as are not at once deterred by the nature of the subject will find considerable descriptive power displayed, a complicated plot, and certainly no lack of incident. The characters, of course, are for the most part horribly depraved, as befits the atmosphere of Norfolk Island and Macquarie Harbour ; but even among such a godless crew there are degrees and varieties of idiosyncrasy, and the author might have dealt more effectively with finer materials. But thc interest of the tale is concentrated in the hopeless tragedy of the miserable Rufus Dawes, who, from his unjust conviction to his violent death, is the victim of an appalling series of hostile circumstances. His first misfortune is his shameful birth. When j nat of r.ge he is connected by untoward chance with the murder of his father, though how the prosecuting counsel got over the fact that the property of which the murdered man was robbed was never traced to the prisoner's possession our author does not explain. On his outward voyage in the convict ship he discovers a projected mutiny, and on the testimony of the guilty parties is condemned as the original author of their plot. He escapes from confinement at Macquarie, or rather is left behind when the settlement is abandoned. This freak of fortune also turns to his discredit. When reduced to the verge of famine, he falls in with a small party in nearly as wretched a position. The commandant's wife and daughter, with an officer named Frere, already an old hand at tyranny undtr the guise of discipline, have been marooned on the desolate coast by convict mutineers. Dawes joins them, saves them by his skill and resource from famine, and finally enables them to escape. He is rewarded by Frere, who takes the credit of the transaction, with further condemnation, as an absconder, to perpetual slavery at Port Arthur. The death of Mrs. Vickers from the hardships she has endured, and the brain fever of the child, who might have testified in his favour, prevent poor Dawes from any possibility of disproving the assertions of his enemy. Finally, he has the exquisite pain of seeing the child he learned to love, with the concentration of a heart closed to all other objects, married to the villain who has been the bane of his whole life. How out of this wretchedness one glimpse of happiness survives, and at the very last moment lights his dark passage to restful death, is told with skill and pathos. We shall not attempt to explain the process by which the real heroism of this poor mangled felon is brought into relief at the climax of his history, nor to enter into detail as to the fortunes of minor characters on a very crowded stage, and will conclude by saying that though we would never willingly read the book again, we recognize some tragic force in the method ' of its writing.

Novel review 1 : 6 522 - 524
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soet echis Lit1ljr ,iees. By Maximie du Camp. (Hachette and Cie., Paris).-The hero of this book is Gustave FlaubJert, the author of "Madame Bovary," who gave French novelists an example of style and structure that they have carefully imitated. The French novel is as much ahead of the English novel as the divine Sara is ahead of the English actress. Those who have seen la Sara find our actresses all arms and legs, and those who have read French novels cannot hide their contempt for the badly constructed works of English novelists. Gustave Flaubert was born in Rouen in 1821. As a Young man he was exceedingly handsome. He had a clear complexion, a golden beard, fine fair hair, and large expressive eves under black eyebrows. His eyes were of the sea-green colour that varies with the light upon them, and his voice was ringing and melodious. While still young he was smitten with epilepsy. His father, a doctor, bled him to excess, allowed him no wine, tobacco, or succulent meats, and overdosed him with valerian and ( .storeum. A heavy sleep and a lumbago generally followed a paroxysm"my nervous attacks," he called them; and they sometimes ended in fits of misanthropy. He devoted himself entirely to literature, but for some time. achieved nothing beyond fine sentences. His friends were afraid to tell him the truth about his work; but at last one of them advised him to burn it. All night the friends sat up discussing the future of his efforts; and at eight o'clock they tfund Madtme Flaubert listening, at the door. She thought that they were jealotis of her son, and did not hesitate to tell them so. The following day one of his friends said to himi: " Wh not write the storv of Delaunay ? Delaittnav was a poor devil of an officer of health, who had leen a pupil of the elder Flaulbert. He had started practice as at doctor in Bont Secours, near Rtouen. He was first muarried to .I wVman older than himself, whom he had thought rich ; when be became a widower he mQarried a vountg girl without fortune, whose hair, of at dull yellow, framned at face covered vith freckles. Preteut us, contemptuous of her husband-whom she considered ai fool-round and white, with sinall bones that were well covered, she had in her gait-in the general carriage of her bo,,d%--the flexililities and the undulations of a serpent ; her voice, vulgarised by her common Norman accent, was extremely caressing; and in her eves-of an undecided colour, green, grey, or blue, actordinog to the angPle of light-there was a k;ind'l of perietual su pplication. Delau nay adored his wife, who did not ,:are for himl, who hunted for all kinds of love adventures, alnd wats insatiable. SLe wvas the victim of one of those nervous disorders which attack antemic women. Growing worse and worse, and insanely extravagant, she became scarcely responsible for her acts, and as the only re muedy applied to her was kind words and advice, she did not get any better. Overwhelmed with debts, hunted by fierce creditors, beaten by her lovers, for whom she robbed her husband, she was seized by a fit of despair amid poisoned herself. She left behind her a little girl whom Delaunay resolved to bring up as well as he could ; but the lpoor mlan-ruined, exhausted in all his resources, and, nevertheless, unable to pay all the debts of his wife, pointed at with scorn-becamie, in his turn, also disgusted with life, coimpounded with his own hand some cyanide of potassium, and went to join her whose loss had left him uuconsolable. It was this private drama, played by four or five persons in anl obscure village, which became in time ' Madame Bovary.' Flaubert fell in love when he was about eighteen. He met at Trouville a lady ten years older than himself, the wife of a brewer, who was pretty and peculiar. She had bluish-black hair, a pale amber skin, dazzling white teeth, and large dark eves. Flaubert looked and loved, but remained silent. That was in 1838. In 1881 he saw the lady again. He tells the story himself in his Ejthcativi Sentimertiale:_ "I was out hunting by myself. . . . I sat down in the shade, my dog lav down beside me, and I breathed the fresh air that passed through the trees. The door of the lunatic asyluin. close by was open, and I saw coming to the wood, where I was resting, a crowd of women walking in two rows. It was a body of lunatics, who wvere taking their daily walk under the inspection of nurses. The unhappy one who imarched at their head attracted my attention. Very old, sombre, self-absorbed, her eyes fixed on the ground, her arms hanging inert by her body, she seemed to glide by an internal movement that pushed her forward without moving her bodv. Her hair, white and in disorder, escaped from an old crooked straw hat, from which there hung a crushed flower. Her skin was brown, with livid colour under her eyelids. Her lips were flattened, her sunk jaws showed that her teeth were gone. Near her lips a little shadow of hair had no doubt been a beauty spot in the days of her vouth. Her hands. with bitten nails, were covered with lace mittens, tied with ribbon. A gold watch bobbed up and down at her girdle, and she had oln slippers, worn and old. Her whole being was impregnated with despair. The sighs which heaved unCer her bosom were deeper than those of Lady Macbeth. She was suffering from melancholy hysteria-from a longing for death-from the most terrible of all diseases. Passing near me, she bowed to me. Our eves met. It was the apparition of Trouville-it was Madame Arnoux, she whom nim poor Flaubert had loved." Flauliert was left comparatively well off by his family, but squandered his money on false friends, and was only saved from actual want by M. Jules Ferry, who gave him enough to live on. He died May 8, 1880, in a fit, calling for his doctor and friend, M. Hallot. The Franco-Prussian war had a' great effect upon him, and he never recovered having Prussian soldiers quartered in his homne. Flaubert's correspondence is one of the most interesting books ever published, and we hope that 31. du Camp's recollections of him will remind readers of those wonderful letters in which he speaks of himself and his work, and tells his own story as no one else can possibly tell it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOVEL NOTES. THE OPTIMIST. By Herbert Morrah. 6s. (Pearson.) The writer's purpose in this book has surely changed more than once. There is excellent material in it, but it is wielded with a shaky hand. The story of the girl who keeps her engagement to a man condemned for forgery to penal servitude, and who, during his imprisonment, goes out into the world, so that she may be a bright wife in the future to the man who has suffered so much, is of strong human interest. There was no need for anything more. Even with only that the title might have been retained, for surely the girl was optimistic enough. But there is a shadowy figure to whom this title is attached, who takes up whole chapters and never wins a moment's interest. There is much talk of election contests which seem to hang useless in the story. And the author has not left himself room to deal with the real and very controversial there, which is, Would the nature and character of a man, who has committed fraud and forgery to serve his own perfectly selfish ends, be likely to prove satisfactory after he has undergone due punishment for it? Probably the best of us would admit the possibility of the optimists point of view. But Mr. Morrah deals with the matter much too lightly. We are the more disappointed with this story, as we call to mind the same writer's attractive and most unconventional book, "1 The Faithful City."

Our Nome by the Adriatic. By the Hon. Margaret Collier (Mdme. Galletti de Cadilhac). (Bentley.) " CoELUM now ahimum "?the old dictum is peculiarly true of the English race; and, though this rigidity brings its advantages, it makes it often hard for English people to acclimatise themselves to strange surroundings. Mdme. Galletti's book is a proof of this. But is it worth while to record a personal dislike of a place and a people; to chronicle the small inconveniences of life, small in themselves, but large when placed under the microscope of discontent? Yet this is what Mdme. Galletti has done. Only here and there do we find a thin disguise of appreciation ; the dislike, the want of sympathy run all through the book. The very table of contents proclaims how miserable is the author in her home by the Adriatic. The first three chapters bear the painful headings of " Installation in my New Home," " More Trials," " Alleviations of my Lot." Thorough hatred of a people, combined with the power to satirise them, is good material for a book. But Mdme. Galletti possesses neither the indignation nor the scorn nor the humour which are required in a satirist. If you do not satirise you must reach your audience through a strong sympathy with your subject, and the knowledge that sympathy will bring. But Mdme. Galletti does not sympathise. She is merely uncomfortable. The home which Mdme. Galletti describes is in one of the most beautiful parts of Italy? the Marches of Ancona, that lie between the Adriatic and the highest points of the Apennines. The country is full of little villages, perched each one high upon its own hill-top. From the walls the view is splendid?on one side the Adriatic and the distant outline of the Dalmatian coast, on the other the snowy ridges of the Gran Sasso d'ltalia, at one's feet vine-clad valleys and olive groves; a country beautiful in itself, with a vast horizon and variety of detail. Yet it was a veritable misfortune which compelled ^Mdme. Galletti to settle there. In talking of Italy one must carefully distinguish which part of Italy one means. The Italians of one district are so different in character from the Italians of another?the Piedmontese from the Romagnoli, the Venetians from the Neapolitans? that knowledge of the one is no guarantee of ability to understand the other. We admit that we have no intimate acquaintance with the peasantry of the Marches ; and they may be as unpleasant a sort of people as Mdme. Galletti makes out. But it is certain that, if the people of the Marches are naturally difficult to deal with, the task is rendered ten times more difficult for one who comes among them imbued with English ideas, convinced that English ways alone are good, and burning with a desire to convert or compel one's dependents to these methods. Mdme. Galletti devotes several pages of her book to an attack on the "fascia"?the swaddling bands in which Italian babies are wrapped. Free limbs may be all very well for babies who can afford a nurse to carry them; but babies whose mothers have to work all day long are surely better off inside their shell of stiff cotton swathes. They can be laid on the ground or hung up on the wall without danger to their limbs. Again, Mdme. Galletti was very indignant at a poor man who had lately lost a child. She found him crying, and offered some words of consolation. " What child ? " said the man. " Its the cow that's dead." The remark, no doubt, seems heartless to people who have many cows, and money to buy others if these die. But to the peasant the case looked, and was, very different. He probably had many children; at any rate he had the prospect of more than he wau ted. The loss of the cow would cripple the family for a year or more, meaning less polenta and less fire. It was for the living that he cried, not for the dead. His attit> ide may not have been highly moral or humane; but one is bound to understand customs, religions, anti peoples before attempting to reform them It is hardly surprising that at first Mdme. Galletti'8 servants resented the imposition of strange ways and hostile criticism, took sudden " capricorns," and disappeared in the night. One must remember, however, that this inflexible determination to be English always and everywhere, to see all things from an English point of view, is just the quality which has made England mistress of so large a portion of the world. It is a quality which wins in the long run; and we suspect that by this time Mdme. Galletti's home by the Adriatic is thoroughly Anglicised, and we trust that she is happier. The description of upper-class life in these hill cities is amusing and instructive. The book is here at its best; not that the cittadini fare any better at Mdme. Galletti's hands than the contadini, but if they get no more sympathy they require less than their poorer neighbours. There is one very beautiful and touching story ; the story of the faithful halfwitted contadino servant Vallucci, devoted to his master, following him like a dog, guarding his interests. It is a tale out of which Tourgenieff would have made one of his immortal sketches from the life. The book is worth reading for this story alone. But Mdme. Galletti always writes well. Her English is singularly pure, flexible, and simple; an admirable style, free from the colloquialisms which almost unconsciously creep into the composition of those who habitually speak the language which they write. The author gives us an unfavourable view of her surroundings. She did not like them. But there is no doubt much truth in her picture. Her book may well be read as a counter irritant to the many exaggerated and heightened descriptions of Italian life. H. F. Brown.

5   8569120   PEEPS AT THE FAR EAST.

Examiner  : 3301 469 - 470
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PEEPS AT THE FAR EAST. Peeps at the Far East. By Norman Macleod, D.D. Strahau and Co. The get-up of this handsome volume leaves no manner of doubt that the author is a popular man. The " beautiful book " is expected to grace many a drawingroom table, and will, doubtless, be lovingly opened by hundreds of delicate fingers. Nor will purchasers be disappointed with its contents; they will find its easy, familiar discourse about the customs, morals, and religioDs of the Indian people, as they appeared to the eyes of a Liberal Scotch clergyman, largely interspersed with amusing incidents of travel, agreeable, interesting and instructive reading. We can also believe that, to some extent, the hope of the author will be realised, and that ' Peeps at the Far East' will tend to advance, " by intelligent sympathy, the true civilisation of two hundred millions of the human race." Not only is the average Britisher densely ignorant of Indian character and ability,-he is the victim of libellous prejudices against the Hindoo, whom he stupidly classes with the negro, and towards whom he too often carries himself with a coarse, proud bearing, such as the savage bull might wear towards the graceful hound. The reverend doctor is a distinguished light in the Scotch Church, and a widely.rcspected man; thousands will read his book, and be impressed by it, because it is his; and we rejoice to be able to say that his influence will be on the side of sympathy and a better under. standing. The passage for whicb, in the interest both of this country and of India, we most heartily thank Dr Macleod, is the following: I can hardly explain whj I felt as if coming into contact witli something very strange and unexpected when I first wnet in society educated Hindoo gentlemen with their caste marks on their brow, and heard them speak my own language with a purity of diction and a correctness of accent which, as a Scotchman, I could not emulate. And these feelings were only increased when, durinig conversation on vurious topics-literature, philosophy, or politics -there was evinced a minute knowledge seldom found among ourselves except in very well-informed circleF. I confess my first feeling was one which I had never hitherto experienced, and w88 somewhat allied to shamne. Something of what the reverend gentleman felt is experienced by every honest, sensible Englisliman, not drunk with national egotism, when first introduced to Ilindoo society. The few, the wealthy, the educated, these can compare lionourably with the same class in this country. But what of the poor ? In these days when the eyes of philanthropy reach the ends of the earth, and the tidings, of sorrow thrill the sensitive breast with the woes of every nation, we hope sonmc may be able to find comfort in the assurance that, " in comparison with the lot of those who suffer from cold amid the mist and rain, the smoke and mud, which combine to make the homens of our poor so wretched," there is little " in the outward condition of these Indian natives to call forth much sympathy; " in a word, " the ' Saut-Mlarket ' of Glasgow must yield, if not the palm, at least to the palm." Of course there is a great deal of religion in the book. Christianity is the standard by which Mr Macleod honestly attempts to estimate the religions and morals of India; and the civilisation of our Eastern Empire means with him its Christianisation. But this, while it takes from the little speculation in which he indulges the universality of interest it might otherwise possess, w.vill only the more recommend ' Peeps at the rar East' to the circle of readers for whom it is designed. It is instructive to observe bow the free play of the intellect of even this able and liberal divine is affected by opinions that appear to have become to him almost necessary trutlhs. To take a small point: Ts there not a simplicity in recording that " investigations as to the alleged facts of historical Christianity do not interest a Iengalee, if, indeed, he is capable of making them." How many in this country have troubled themselves about the historical evidences of Asiatic religions, or even of Christianity ? What interest, may we venture to ask, has even the autlhor himself in " the alleged facts " of bistorical B3raliminism or Mhi3onietanism ? There is, however, an element of truth in the over-stateinent thwat iii tlie " Ilindoo mind the historical faculty seemns paralysed." Thesc remarks occur wlen speaking of "t the iiew school of religious thought called the Brahimo Sonmnj," best known in this country through its representat1ive, Mr Kesliub Chunder Sen. Now the fact is this: the educated Ifiridoo, subtle and philosophical, will seldom enter on historical discussion he prefers to cut the ma-tter shiort by questioning- the antecedent po)ssibility of the "a .lleged facts." There remains but to say that the chief merit of 'Peeps at the Far East ' is its sterling hionesty and thorough fairness in treating of a people in this country but little understood and greatly misrepresented. The Church of Scotland may well be proud of Dr Macleod, for there are uiot many (either within or without its pale who have to the sanmC extent emancipated themselves from both religious aind national p)rejudices. Tle work is illustrated by many engravings, some of which, we regret. to say, are very badly excunted. Little uieed be said of the exeCllence of the writing,, MNr -Macleod's free, manlsn y Enghlish being well-known. We give a single specimen of his hih descriptive power; speakingr, of the Parsee mode of septilture, which consists in placing the bodies of the dead on the tops of their "towers of silence," hle writes: These towers, I need not say, are anway from any human habitation, anid, being situated among scattered pailm-trees, are greedail watched by foul vultures which roost in them. When I Visited the sp1ot, one or two tionted lazilv in the air above, as if weary from vain watching. Flocks clustered thick as bats amiong - I I I I I I I I the leafy tops of the palms, or in other places of retreat, unti the priests should again ascend, and leave on its summit the body of some one-parent, child, or friend. rben the air becomes lark with wings hurrying down to the horrid banquet! Faugh! It is not "mere prejudice" which fills one with disgust at the thought. It is not a mere difference between worms and ultures. It is the difference between a grossness palpable to the senses, :,nd the concealment which makes no impression calculated to disturb the remembrance of the past.

79. Placide, a Spanish Tale. In Two Vols. Translated from Les Battue- cas, of Madame de Genlis. By Alex- anderJaraieson. 2 vols. l2mo.jjp.204. 206. Marshall. ALTHOUGH the whole tenor of this Narrative is better suited to the genius of the French, and to the idiom of their language, yet it is elegantly, and we doubt not faithfully translated by Mr.Jamieson; and, allowing for a few inconsistencies, the story is, upon the whole, amusing and interesting. The admirers of Madame de Gcnlis's Works will feel curious to read, in order to form their own opinion of, her present publication ; of which she says, " 1 have never written any Work with more care or more reflection ; and the character of Placide is that on which 1 have bestowed the most profound attention. At all events, I think that I offer to the publick a Work written, though in a short time, with all the application which my feeble talents would enable me to bestow upon it. " Every thing which is said in this Work respecting the Battuecas, tbeir origin, their singular history, their character, their manners,&c. is strictly true. The description of tbeir mysterious valley is faithfully drawn. The adventure of the Duke d'Albe, who by so wonderful an accident discovered this small colony, is also an historical fact. All these details so curious and interesting, are to be found in the Dictionary of Aloreri, and in the travels of M. de Bourgoing (an author of much celebrity from his fidelity). Several Spanish writers have also spoken of these people, and all their accounts perfectly agree. This small and fortunate Republic existed in all the happiness of its obscurity, and was blessed in being unknown to the rest of the world, even so late as 1806; but it is doubtful whether, since tbat epoch, it hath not been disturbed by the sanguinary war wbich desolated Spain." Tbe situation of the valley is thus described." There exists in Spain, about fourteen leagues from the city of Salamanca, in the diocese of Coria, in the kingdom of Leon, and about eight leagues from Cuidad Rodrigo, a fertile valley, enclosed on all sides by a chain of enormous rocks form? ing around it a rampart, which during centuries had rendered this retreat inaccessible. This canton is called the vale of the Battuecas. It extends itself almost a league. During entire ages the entrance to this valley was truly inaccessible; however, it hath ceased to be so now. ?It is well known by a tradition preserved among tbe Battuecas, that towards the year 1009 the torrent of Tormes having changed its course, blocked up the only penetrable entrance to the valley. ? At the end of two or three centu? ries an earthquake altered, suddenly, the direction of the torrent which bad enclosed their asylum. The entrance of the valley, though still very difficult of access, was, however, more free: this great event made no impression on the Battuecas, for, satisfied with their lot, they resolved not to seek another residence."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lay Launs. By Mauy E. Christde. Stmhan and Co*, Limited. 0 0 - -- L - This is essentially a metaphysical novel, so muca g that those who take up novels merely for the sake of killing an idle half-hour are not at all likely to be charmed with it. It is replete with abstruse speculation, and a curiously indefinite psychology. The plot itself is simple enough. A young lady-of rank, Lady La has an infatuated attachment for a visionary journalist, Maurice Sterne by name. Her noble parents, from strong liking for his personal qualities, allow a marriage to take place. Then Lady Laura discovers that her former god is simply an idol of clay. Tb* regenerator of the age is only a Government official who writes articles in ultra-radical journals. Worse still, he has a Platonic attachment for her cousin, the Platonism of which Lady Laura does not at all appreciate. She has, in consequence, a violent fit of illness, but eventually recovers, while Cassandra, the cause of her jealousy, first prays for forgiveness, and then determines to devote her life to hospital nursing. But the plot of " Lady Laura," as far as the would-be interest of the novel is concerned, is a very secondary consideration indeed. To the exposition of certain principles of moral and social ethics we must look to be amused. To clearly define them would be indeed rather difficult, particularly as the authoress has not very clearly defined them herself At the end of the three volumes there is, without doubt, a sort of hint that life cannot go on properly without a belief in the definite existence of a Supreme Beng. On the other hand, in all the former pages affirm belief in the efficacy of certain moral conditions is alone considered to be necessary. We can only be useful when we are happy, and we can only be happy when we are loved by those we wish to be loved by. The views of the authoress on this subject are decidedly entertaining as well as instructive, though far from infallible.

Job Singleton's Heir, and other Stories

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
'Job Singleton's Heir, and other Stories' is a safe gift-book for Sunday school children, and a good book for the library in the servants' hall or the village lending library. It may find grace in the eyes of readers of higher culture, for the lessons inculcated are good and the stories are interesting; but the style lacks grace and lightness, and the moralizing is given with a set purpose, which will take away from the disposition to profit by it or to put it in practice.

Goddard, Julia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The idea that underlies ' Kaspar and the Summer Fairies' is good and subtle; it is a true child's faculty to see a wonderland in all things, and the stories that Kaspar weaves together out of what he sees are very like stories which a real child might invent. They are long and rambling, and have as little substance as gossamer webs, but they are the genuine fancies woven out of the sights and sounds of the things Kaspar saw around him. Julia Goddard must herself have the heart of a little child to be able to see fairy-land with the eyes of children.

'What the Swallows told Me' is an interesting story, gracefully told and prettily got up. We regret that it should have been the will of the writer to end the brief bright life of the charming little heroine. There was not the least reason why she should not have lived to grow up and be the comfort of her grandfather to his life's end, instead of leaving him to sit lonely and miserable after her death. Cheerful stories are much the best for children and young people.

Robert Ford, nicknamed "Master Bobby" by his fellow street arabs on account of his comparative culture and his gentle manners, is an orphan boy, a waif in a London court. He is a sturdy, hard-working little fellow, who resolutely endeavours to improve his position and to educate himself, and, above all, to keep himself " respectable." His praiseworthy efforts succeed, of course ; and a situation as an errand boy seems likely to lead Master Bobby to fame and fortune in later life. The entire freedom from affectation in style and sentiment is a pleasing feature of this little story.

Winifred; or, an English Maiden in the Seventeenth Century
Guernsey, Lucy Ellen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Both Mrs. Guernsey's books purport to be chronicles of the Stuart period, and the dialogue is appropriately archaic. Not only in language, however, but in plot and characters is there the closest similarity between the two. Both the heroines are governesses in a noble family, where there is a sickly child called Betty, who has disease of the heart, and requires perfect quiet. In either case the governess is the ministering angel of the house, and in either case she captivates the only eligible young man that the family can boast of. Equally jealous heartburnings are hereby caused to other claimants, who think themselves better entitled. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that these two books have been successively compiled from identical materials, the latter being an improved and elaborated edition of the former.

FICTION THE OLD TIME BEFORE THEM. By EDEN PHILLPOTTS. John Murray. 6s. This book is a collection of fifteen short stories told to us by Tom Turtle, who gathered them at the bar of "The Plume of Feathers" in Widecombe. The tales are rich in humour and racy in dialect. They reflect the warmth of an inn, the jests and sorrows of a countryside. Mr. Eden Phillpotts knows his characters, and portrays them with a sure and genial strength. There is no straining after effect, no touch of melodrama. The interest is always quietly human, and even the few descriptions of Nature are the cunning reflection of some rustic mind. There are many shrewd sayings scattered through these pleasant Wales and much sound philosophy. On the whole, the patrons of "The Plume" were a cheerful set-men who liked good ale and cider as well as a good story. Mr. Eden Phillpotts describes many types with admirable sincerity. He tells us of brave women like Sally Campion, of brave men like Mark Mumford, of folk "market merry," and of "hookem snivey" rogues. Perhaps the best of these stories are "For Valour," "A Bargain's a Bargain," "The Fur-lined Coat," " The Rope," "The Mystery of the Sailor Men," and "White Heather," which contains an exquisite description of the Dart at Swincombe Firs. But it is difficult to make a selection. Occasionally a fastidious critic may detect a lapse into literary language on the part of this Widecombe folk, but even here Mr. Eden Phillpotts may be right. Nowadays even the remote villager, thanks to the daily Press, has his journalistic moments. The stories can hardly be called finely chiselled. They are simple and rough, as if they grew out of the genial loquacity of the frequenters of "The Plume." Some of them depend for their interest on flashes of dialect that light up odd bits of character, rather than on any plot or episode.

Tales of Mu Landlord. New Series; containing Ponte- fract Castle* 3 vols. 12mo. London, 1819* (Concluded.) The singular circumstance of the king's portrait caused much uneasiness at Pontefract Castle. Ignatius attributed it to William, of Lindholme, an all-powerful wizard in that neighbourhood, who, with Martha Allen, had performed most marvellous exploits. The sudden death of Cornet Tucker, who had seen the spectre, gave some additional strength to the assertions of Ignatius with the credulous; while the more sensible of the party believed these things to be effected by secret but natural agents. Sir Arthur Beaumont related a long story of secret societies, which wrere organized for mischief, and, although Morrice was somewhat incredulous, yet he afterwards became convinced of their existence; ne having being disturbed in the night, by some persons who had got into his room, and whom he afterwards followed down winding ttairtaaes and serpentine paths* At length, he saw the whole party assembled in the performance of some mysterious rites; the assembly broke up, and Morrice, after pursuing a winding passage for some time, reached an outlet, through which be passeel, and there found himself on the skirts of an extensive park, where be saw the figure of Matilda Cottrel, which flew from him on pronouncing her name. Colonel Morrice, anxious to gain the road to Pontefract, or to reach some place of shelter for the night, saw a distant mansion to which be proceeded. After ringing at the great portal, and receiving no answer, he pushed the door, opened and entered a spacious hall, aud proceeded from thence to a saloon bung with pictures, one ot which was a portrait of Matilda Cottrel; in an adjoining room sat a party of commonwealth officers, apparently the remnant of au assembly lately dissolved. Among them were Sir Hugh Cbolmely and Sir Edward Rhodes, who had succeeded Rai osborn ugh, in the com maud against Pontefract Castle. Joyce, Desborougb, Hewson, and Harry Martin were also present. In another groupe there were the younger Vane, Brooke, and Sir Thomas Fairfax, who soon after retired with Thurloe, whom he had called in. When tbe general was gone, Joyce and some of the others sneered at him, and began to advocate what is now called the Spencean system, a divison of property, declaring that Fuirfux must come down as well as the rest. Listeners, it is said, seldom hear good of themselves; it was not, therefore, to be wondered at that Morrice should hear himself called a * milk-sop,9 * mad as a March hare,* who might* have had all his own way,' * been the head of their squad,9 aud * had the woman he's dying by inches for, into the bargain.' They highly praised Matilda Cottrel, and said half the young men in Yorkshire were anxious for ber. To the great surprize of Morrice, Colonel Cottrel entered the room, and he then found that he was in the house of that man who bad been bis bosom friend, and whom his heart, in spite of party, still proclaimed so. W7hen the party had quitted the room and left Colonel Cottrel alone, Morrice quitted tbe closet into which be had retired, approached bini, and threw himself on bis clemency. Colonel Cottrel, agitated hy the sight of a man who recalled so many painful recollections, reproached him for bis conduct and bade him retire. Morrice attempted to vindicate himself, and inquired for Matilda. ' Cottrel clashed his hand against his forehead.?There was a terrible pause : but pride came to the father's relief, and with a stilled voice he replied : ? " If by Matilda, sir, you mean thc widow of General. Rainsborough, you are now beneath her roof." ' " Great God 1" interrupted Morrice with a loud shriek, " what is it you say ? What horror have you conjured up ?? You cannot mean it?repeat the words : my ears ring, and L distinguish nothing." * " 1 spoke," replied Cottrell, evidently affected, but stifling his emotion under assumed solemnity. " I spoke, sir, of Sirs. General Rainsborough, my daughter, whose house this is. I spoke of a wife and widow, without a bridal bcd: ?one day following her husband to the altar?on the next, weeping over hi3 corpse. Let your heart speak of the bridal present you made her, or let Doncaster witness it" # ? Morrice stood stupified, gazing like a maniac, on. the speaker; and then uttered, with a swimming confusion ot thought, scarcely knowing what he said?0 Then, she stooped to malice and pique?she married to be revenged-*-" i ' V No, sir,'.' proudly interrupted Cottrell?" you slander her. Mv daughter is as steady in principle as admirable in talent. So, sir; she sacrificed herself, as she always does, to others?she sacrificed herself to the benefit of her friends, and the desire of her father." <<cOGod! what have I done to bear this?" ejaculated Morrice. " But she sacrificed herself," he continued, catching at the thought?" she sacrificed herself?you said that? thc angel?" ' " Sir," interrupted Cottrell, " I have said so, and will not recant my words. This is no time for paltry refinements. She loved von?doated on you?and this was the manner you repaid it, Colonel Moriice ; heaping coals of fire upon her head, by returning evil for good. Sir, you must bear the sting you have inflicted. I will not disguise the truth. There was a time when she implored nie to desert active life, and live with you, at a distance from the troubles of politics. At the moment when I assented?when she was occupied with this, and exhausting plans?the darling?for the future benefit of your children: nay, sir, you must hear it?that was the moment you chose for the first deadly blow you stuck at her, through me. Was there none but Colonel Morrice's hand to deal it? None, in the wide world ? What followed, has been in character. It wai fit that he, who destroyed the father, should destroy the husband, lt was fit that lie who beat down one prop of her life, and struck at the corner stone of the building, should bring the whole to the ground. It is as fit that you come now to trample over the ruins you have caused." ? " Kill me \ torture me!" cried Morrice, with unutterable agony. " i deserve it well. But where is she?let me see her, the injured one? Let me implore her pardon, and grovel in the dust before her?let her impose lier conditions. 1 am a child, and will be what >he wills ?will desert all things, and tear up the past from my memory. Only let nie see her, I ask no more?once more to see her.?You have feelings, sir?you have feelings.?If you deny it, my heart will break before you." " | ' " lt is too late, Colonel Morrice," said Cottrell, with an equal agony, though repressed by wounded pride. f? It is too late ! 1'he fatal secret has bee'n hitherto concealed, but it must be known. In the midst of this boisterous house I dared not utter it. But I confide it tirt to you. It is retribution which brings you to be its first depositary. There is no longer a Matilda now, for me to idolize?for you to regret and deplore. 1 know not how you may bear the knowledge You are a stoic, and may resist the shock ; but I am broken by lt, and the tomb will soon receive the fragments of this shattered body. Sir, my daughter had the spirit of a lady in her, and could not bear to be trampled on. She has been missing three days from this house."?Cottrell sobbed as he spoke?" It was but yesterday we discovered traces of her. At the edge of the canal, in the park, Colonel Morrice, we found her veil and shawl. Those are the only relics of Matilda Cottrell !" The groan which Morrice gave, as Cottrell uttered this, was like the parting of soul and body. His eyes were glazed ?a stilled gurgling rose to his throat.--" I have murdered her!?I?I "?he shrieked, and fell headlong on the floor ?' When the unhappy Colonel revived, he found himself in his own bed, at Pontrfract Castle, whither he had been conducted by a small party of Kaiushorough's dragoons. Colonel Morrice did not, however, suffer this circumstance to abate his zeal in the cause of royalty, become more necessary, as Cromwell had comedown, breathing vengeance both for the loss of Hansborough, and the disgrace his party had sustained. In an enterprize which Colonel Morrice headed, and seized three hundred head of cattle, he was met by old Dame Allen, who cautioned him against approaching dancer. His party wa$ attacked by a large body of the parliamentarians, which, however, they conquered, and took some prisoners, among whom was their leader who proved to he no other than Cromwell himself. Tbe rejoicings at Pontefract Castle were very great when Morrice returned and informed them of the character of their prisoner. Some were for putting him to death while others thought it better to make an overture to* him. Accordingly, Colonel Morrice visited him iii the cell to which he had been consigned, and implored him to heal the wounds of bis country and declare for the legitiinate monarch; but Cromwell refused all overtures and declared that the fate of the king was sealed. Morrice now determined, with his brother officers, that it was best that he should go as an envoy to his imprisoned sovereign; and, take Sir Arthur Beaumont and a hundred youths, who were prompt to share the danger of the task. In the mean time, Cromwell escaped from Pontefract Castle, re-assumed the command, and carried on the siege with new vigour; a breach was made in the castle-walls* Cromwell summoned them to surrender, but they dismissed the flag of truce. Captain Carteret was taken prisoner and doomed to death by Cromwell, whose presence being necessary in another quarter, confided the command to Lambert. Colonel Morrice returned to the castle with a Spanish page, who had preserved his life, and acquainted his officers that the king had been beheaded; a proclamation was then issued in the name of Charles the Second. Morrice now related to the party thc adventures of his last journey. He had been to Newport, seen the unfortunate monarch, and made an ineffectual attempt to liberate him ; and, when he fell into the hands of his enemies, he followed him in disguise, was in Westminster Hall during bis trial, and saw the dead body of his master exposed in White Hall, over which he and the Marquis of Ormond swore to avenge his death, and to spare neither blood or exertion in the cause of his surviving son. As soon as the return of Colonel Morrice to Pontefract Castle was known to the besieging army, Lambert pushed the sieije with still greater energy and perseverance. All hopes of relief being at an end, Colonel Morrice determined to be no longer a cause of destruction to his associates, resolvec4 to go to Lambert with a flag of truce, and to oiler himself in lieu of the six persons to whom quarter was to be extended ; this was not granted, but, to a second proposal, they allowed Morrice and his five companions six days to make their escape from the castle, at the end of which it was to be surrendered. Ingolsby was ordered to attend the Colonel beyond the lines, and expressed his regret at the part he had himself taken. The six who had been proscribed, the Colonel agreed should lea\e the castle in pairs; Morrice and the page remained the last, and, on thc fourth day, ventured forth with Blackburne; they were accompanied by twenty boree, and soon had to encounter a party of the enemy, which they dispersed. Sir John Digby and Sir Hugh Carte/et had marched out with the garrison, and made a desperate sortie as a last stake. Confusion was carried into tbe camp of the enemy. Lambert rallied his forces and renewed the contest with the gallant and desperate band. The page was wounded iu defendiug his master, and his hat falling off, discovered that this tel {-devoted attendant was a female. The Colonel fell by a powerful blow, ana was carried by his party buck "to Pontefract Castle. When he recovered, he proposed to his friends that he would secrete himself in a narrow chamber of the foundation of the castle, while they surrendered it according te* ! the terms agreed upon, uot'doubting but that he would i effect his escape. j Morrice remained in this pla-e some days, until the de. ! inolition of the castle was proceeding so rapidly that a longer stay became extremely dangerous; he then yentured forth, when he met a trooper, who presented him with a letter, which was from Ingolsbv, apprising him that Lambert bad marched off to distant quarters, anel appointing a meeting on the edge of Hatfield Chase, at eleven o'clock. Morrice had not proceeded far from the castle, when he met his former associate, Blackburn, who had been sent by Ingolsby, with letters in their favour, as he could not keep his appointment. Morrice and Blackburn journeyed on together, when they found stretched on the earth, wounded, a giant warrior, in massive armour, whom the Colonel recognised as William, of Lindholme. The dying mau begged they would convey bim to Lindholme, which having done, with bitter invectives, this mysterious personage breathed his last. In a MS. in the house, they found words of mysterious import?horoscopes of Oliver Cromwell and other persons, with all the paraphernalia of a sorcerer : and the rules and regulations of a secret society. Here also they met with Sir Arthur Beaumont, who said he had bearded the hell-hounds in their den. Another important personage was soon presented to them in the person of the Spanish page?the boy-woman, who had so nobly rushed between Colonel Morrice anel destruction, and who proved to be Matilda Cottrell. They now attempted to effect their escape?Beaumont was killed by the villain Ignatius Carteret; Colonel Morrice, Matilda, and Blackburne, reached the outer gate, but fell into the hands of the parliamentarians. The prisoners were conveyed to York, and Colonel Morrice put on his trial and found guilty. When Colonel Morrice was led from the court, amidst the tears of the assembly, a shriek was beard from the corner where lady Fairfax and several other ladies sat, and a female figure in a sable disordered dress, stood in front of the judgment seat. Judge Pubstone viewed her with dismay and astonishment; but he soon recovered his composure, and inquired by what authority she thus confronted the bench :? '" My name is my passport," said the extraordinary figure, still fixing the vacillating eye of Pulistone. " Justice, in the name of God !" she exclaimed, " 1 call for ju lice ! Who date refuse it to the daughter of the Parliament's governor?? Who shall refuse justice to the widow of Rainsborough >" ? Thorpe and Pulistone looked aghast, and there was a general echo of the name of Rainsborough throughout the court; for it was perfectly underwood that the illegal sentence upon Morrice vva^ a blood olfeiing to the manes ot the republican general. * "If you are the wife of Rainsborough, madam," snid Pulistone, *" your call for justice has not been in vain. The voice of your husband's blood has smoked to heaven, ami brought down its vengeance on the murderer." *" Murderer!" she replied, "is it for you, Pulistone, or you, Thorpe, or anv one tn this place, to accuse a soldier, and 4 man of honour, of murder? Look to yourselves! 'I "he ictions of the man you presume to condemn, have been performed before the light of heaven: in performance of his fctyto his country, and his king.

The judges interrupted, and commanded that she should bc taken out of the court :? ? "Stay, sir," Matilda peremptorily exclaimed, "the king was interdicted from speech hy Bradshaw, and you have denied hi* servant the -ame appeal.

The ardent and animated manner in which she spoke, moved all hearts, while Pulistoue trembled at her threats of exposing his infamy. In the interval between thc condemnation and execution of Colonel Morrice, .Matilda, in her disguise, as the Spanish page, obtained leave* to visit bin At length the dreadful day arrived, when the brave* Coomel Morrice was to meet his fate. When be reached the fatal spot, he found Matilda in disguise, whom h? tenderly embraced; she told him that her last appeal for mercy bad been in vain. On mounting the scaffold with Blackburne, the colonel saw the body of Martha Allen suspended from a lofty gallows; she had been executed on a charge of witchcraft. Morrice spoke to the crowd at some length, consigned his children to the care of the clergyman, and then sunk into fervent prayer. Blackburne addressed the crowd very briefly, and died exclaiming, ? Long live the king :*? * While this was going on, Morrice remained perfectly composed and abstracted in prayer. 4 His eyes were directed upwards with a celestial confidence, and they were lighted up with the same extraordinary radiance which before attracted notice. Above his,head the sun shone smilingly clear in the beautiful arch of heaven, as if unconscious of the bloody tragedy performed beneath his unsullied eye. The skyey scope ot bright transparent blue, directly over head, was laced towards the horizon with streaks of golden clouds ; adorned, in one place, with roseate masses, like isles and mountains of the blest; in another, broken with detached and silvery portions of vapour, sailing rapidly, like fairy vessels, through the unperturbed expanse. Fancy might have discerned the forms of light-robed spirits seated there: or striking their golden harps, and gratulating the escape of virtue from this dark and putrifying cell of half dead, half living corruption. But more substantial visions transported the dying thoughts of Morrice. He no longer prayed?his lips moved not?there was a smile upon his cheek, and his eyes were fixed in ecstacy, as if absorbed in divine communication. But there was one on the same scaffold, who neither prayed, nor wept, nor looked on heaven. It was the woman page. Shuddering with horror, she turned away from the moody hands of the executioner, and hid her face with both her hands. What an eternity of woe was in that moment of concealment I?Ihe person from whose papers this narrative is derived, was one ofthe number that pressed the fatal stage, ~iis eyes were on the restless figure of the page; and he states, hat when she withdrew her hands, so dreadful an expression of countenancenever smote his gaze: if thousands of years were to roll over him, the recollection would never be erased. It was an expression of unmixed immitigable despair. Neither, he declares, did he ever meet with anything distantly resembling itsappallingcharacter, but once; anel that was on encountering, in a solitary Grecian temple, an alabaster head of the young Medusa, w'ith eyes of bervl. It was the acme ofthe beautiful and the terrible, and might have suited well the fallen spirits ofthe Eastern Nephilim, when, seduced by Love, they lighted on the top of Carmel, anel bartered Paradise for passion. Such were the thoughts which passed through the mind of the narrator; but a moment dispersed them. 'I he explosion of a pistol, close beside him, pealed in his ear, and shook the frame-work ofthe scaffold. He turned at the report, anel saw the brave Morrice fall backward, perfectly dead, without a struggle or a groan. At the same instant he heard an hysterical laugh, and a voice indescribably exulting, crying out :? "Thank God! thank God, he has escaped the bloodhounds!"9 * As the words were uttering, his eye caught the glittering of a light stiletto, and while several persons rushed towards the dead man, he saw it twice raised, and twice plunged, with the decision of lightning, into the bosom of the person that grasped it. A moment revealed the suicide. It was the boywife, the woman-page, Matilda Rainsborough. The unhappy S#rl stood for about a second; and then staggering, fell towards e ridge of the scaffold, nearly slipping over it. Her head hung powerlessly beyond thc slight rail-work, and her glossy raven-black hair, loosened by the violence of the fall, streamed over the rough sea/folding, the bottom of which it pearly reached: while the blood, with which it was immediately soaked, pattered slowly, drop after drop, upoa the h s h c te w n ground. With unutterable sorrow, her startled friend, the clergyman, raised her like a crushed and bleeding flower in his arms, and supported her drooping head upon one knee. Horror and astonishment silenced all who witnessed the premeditated deed. The clergyman alone spoke. * " Is this your promise, Matilda, this your resignation ami repentance I Was it for this I listened weakly to the cry of kin and friendship, and sanctified an unblest union within the very chambers of the tomb ? Alas! unhappy girl f twice married without a nuptial bed?wedded to a corpse, and bedded on this couch of horrors, purpled with blood, and curtained by the shadow of death ! How hast thou destroyed thyself, and stretched an eternal gulf between thy soul and that spirit, now in heaven, whom thy wild and guilty impatience has set free f Couldst thou not wait the time of God ?" ' The dying Matilda made an effort to reply; but her tongue struggled vainly to speak, and produced nothing but inarticulate sounds. It was a spectacle of horror and sublimity at once. Leaning over the body of Morrice, dead for the cause of royalty, stood the living Morrice, who was destined to be the earliest instrument of its revival. On that scaffold were assembled, as on a mystic stage, the living and dead types of its extinction and reanimation?the expiring em* ber, and the regenerated flame. ' Matilda again grasped the arm of her reverend friend with earnestness, and tremulously prest her [his] fingers, through which the life-blood oozed and trickled upon her breast ' " Was this well done, Matilda," continued he, " to make me an involuntary actor in this dreadful tragedv, and stain my character with implication in murder and suicide ? Bul, alas !'* he added weeping, " why do I afflict you with reproof in this sad state ? Let God judge you! it is not for man?nor me." The fiend Brooke, disappointed of his prey, heaped re* proaches on the memory of Morrice, which Matilda vindi* cated, as long as strength would permit her, until her kin* dred spirit joined that of her lover, far beyond the reach af human vengeance. In giving so ample a detail of the story of Pontefract Castle, we have been anxious to enable our readers to judge for themselves of its merits. It will be seen, that the novel is founded on historical facts, blended with fietion ; that many of the personages are real characters who figured in the civil wars, and that neither the facts respecting them, nor their characters, have been much distorted. Where the author has deviated from history, he has been least successful; supernatural agency has often been invoked unnecessarily, and the account of the secret societies pushed beyond the reach of all probability. The language, though often forcible, frequently descends to a vulgarity of expression, which cannot be tolerated even in republican officers. The author succeeds best in the descriptive, and his portrait of puritanism is certainly well drawn. The indiscreet manner in which Pontefract Castle has been announced, by associating it with the deservedly popular works of Jedediah Cleishbotham, was as injudicious as it was unfair and illiberal. Pontefract Castle certainly cannot be compared with any of the Tales of My Landlord ; to us it appears to be tbe hasty production of a young man of talent, who, with pains and attention, might become a good novel writer. And freely as we have censured Pontefract Castle, we do not hesitate to say, that it is much superior to the ordinary class of novels, and would certainly have obtained a better character than it is likely to possess, had it not been for the invidious comparison which its title, as one of the Tales of My Landlord* ba* necessarily provoked,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
EVANL?l I!ARRLNGTON.0 RWYENTLY original in conception, rich in stirring incident and artistic delineation of character, exhibiting with photographic fidelity and delicacy of detail a deep knowledge of human nature under its most subtle and varied aspects, there can be but little doubt that the republication of the story of the fate and fortunes of Evan Harrington, tailor and gentleman, which met with such a favourable reception in its serial form-a most trying ordeal, by the way, for a novel, whose succes must mainly depend on its unity of design and the sustain. .t action of its Iranatis peronaz-will be cordially welcomed by all lovers of the higher class of fiction. For our own parts, we scarcely remember perusing a mare fascinating work. M3r. Mteredith has evidently taken in a kindly spirit the numerous comments evoked by certain artistic imperfections that detracted in some degree from the merits of his " Ordeal of Richard Feverel," and this, his second essay in this department of literature, bears abundant proof that the suggestions of his critics have not been thrown away upon him. "E Evan Harrington" posnewes one peculiar point of excellence which lifts it per salum aove the as of modern works of fiction. Its interest does not depend, as is the case with the majority of even the better class of novels, on the especial elaboration of any one element, be it incident, character, portraiture, description, or dialogue, or whatever other speciality the writer may look upon as his peculiarj./rte; but each and all of these essentials are rigidly kept in view throughout, without even the appearance of effort-the tout eysemble forming a powerful and iid picture of real life. The plot of the story is eminently original, and in these days, when ey subject bas been worn threadbare, and "adaptation" is the only refuge for " used-up" novelista and play-wrights, originality of plot should count for something. It would be for to our purpose, " well as incompatible with the limit of the present notice, to give even a bare resutnam of the main incidents. Suffice it to state, that the interest of the story centres in the loves and fate of Evan *AZr.. lim By Geoge Neredfb, Author of Te Ordeal a Sir Rchard Feverel."' The Shving of 9SbpK," &c. (Loudon: Bradbury and Evans, 11, Bouvefle swa.t 181L) Harrington and Rose Jocelyn, and the machinations of a certain Countes de Saldar, sister of Evan. The character of the Countess is a marvellous conception. Her father was a tailor-a most aristocratic tailor, it should be remembered -one who had gambled with royal dukes, bandied bon mots at the tables of mariuis's, ridden across country in the company of the lords of the land; in short, the very Deau Brummel of tailordom, who by the sheer strength of impudence, talent, and " deportment," had thrust himself through the lower strata of society into the upper crust of fashionable life: and the daughter of the "great Mel " inherited all her father's talents, good looks, and aristocratic aspirations. She marries a Portuguese " count," and, after a few years' residence in Portugal, returns to England as the Countess de Saldar, with a firm determination to ignore " the sLop" and all the vulgar connections of tailordom, and to make a way for herself and her brother Evan up the ladder of high life. A thorough-going female diplomatist, possessing great beauty and irresistible fascination of manner, with a most pliable and self-obliging conscience in some respects, and yet most delicately susceptible in others; every new obstacle in her path only serves as a new incentive to devise means to surmount it. Her religion, on which she particularly plumes herself, is of a somewhat composite character. Her ideas of Providence are closely akin to the feelings with which the ancients regarded the I personages of their mythology-a mysterious over-ruling power, whose office it was to look after heroes and the beau monde but which occasionally, in the most unaccountable manner, and generally at the most awkward moment, left its peculiar protegee in the lurch. hIer trust in Providence, therefore, though strong in the main, was not implicitlike an Oriental monarch, she alwaysbore in mind the possible contingency of her powerfil ally deserting to the other side; and, being forewarned, was fore-armed. Providence may fail her, or may thwart her most cunninglydevised schemes, yet with true Christian resignation she never murmurs, or at least nothing to mention, but immediately hauls off on the other tack to repair damages, presently to return to action with colours flying. The Countess's morality is on a par with her religion. The justification of the means by the end is her paramount principle. With her, success is the "measure of al thins." Nothing is criminal until it is discovered. 11cr surpassing genius hesitates at nothing. She is compelled at times, by the force of circumstances, to act sorely in opposition to her conscience, but is afterwards sincerely penitent and pious, and trusts to be forgiven on the score of absolute necessity. 1er brilliant wit, perfect self-posession, and irresistible manner, render her the admiration of the one sex and the envy and detestation of the other. In justice to Mr. Meredith's admirable delineation of this difficult character, we append one or two extrapte:"Into what a pit had she suddenly plunged! You ask whv she did not drive away as fast as the horses would carry her, and fly the veiled head of Demogorgon obscuring valley and hill and the shining firantment, and threatening to glare destruction on her ? You do not know an intriguer. She relinquishes the joys of life for the joys of intrigue. This is her element. The Countess did feel that the heavens were hard on her. She resolved none the less to fight her way to her object; for where so much had conspired to favour her-the decease of the generous Sir Abraham Harrinton, of Torquay, and the invitation to Beckley Court-could she believe the heavens in league against her? Did she not nightly pray to them, in all humbleness of body, for the safe issue of her cherished schemes ? And in this, how unlike she was to the rest of mankind! She thought so; she relied on her devout observances; they gave her sweet confidence, and the sense of being specially shielded even when specially menaced." Here is an extract from one of her letters, in which she is describing the company at Beckley House, where she is visiting:"'Mr. Drurnmond Forth. A great favourite of Lady Jocelyn's; an old friend. He went with them to the East. Nothing improper. She is too cold for that. He is fair, with regular features, very self-possessed, and ready-your English notions of gentlemanly. But none of your men treat a woman as a woman. We are either angels, or good fellows, or heaven knows what that is bad. No exquisite delicacy, no insinuating softness mixed with respect, none of that hovering over the border, as papa used to say, none of that happy indefiniteness of manner which seems to declare "I would love you if I might," or " I do, but I dare not tell," even when engaged in the most trivial attentions-handing a footstool, remarking on the sour, &c. You none of you know how to meet a woman a smile, or to engage her eyes without boldness-to slide off them, as it were, gracefully. Evan alone can look between the eyelids of a woman. I have had to correct him, for to me he quite exposes the state of his heart towards dearest Rose. " Again, further on, on the same topic " A lady is here who has run away from the conjugal abode, and Lady Jocelyn shelters her, and is hospitable to another, who is more concerned in this lady's mad fate than he should be. This may be morals, my dear: but please do not talk of Portugal now. A fine-ish woman with a great deal of hair worn as if her maid had given it one comb straight down and then rolled it up in a hurry round one finger. Malice would may carrots. It is called gold. Mr. Forth is in a glass house, and is w~rong to cast his sneers at perfectly inoffensive people." "My maxim in any house is-never to despise the good opinion of the nonentities. They are the majority. I think they all look up to me. But then of course you must fix that by seducing the stars. My diplomatist praises my abilities-Sir John Loring my style-the rest follow, and I do not withhold my smiles, and they are happy, and I should be but that, for ungrateful Evan's sake, I sacrificed my peace by binding myself to a dreadful sort of half-story. I know I did not quite say it. It seems as if Sir A.'s ghost were going to haunt me. And then I have the most dreadful fears that what I have done has disturbed him in the other world. Can it be so? It is not money or estates we took at all, dearest ! And these excellent young curates-I almost wish it was Protestant to speak a word behind a board to them and imbibe comfort. For after all it is nothing: and a word even from this poor thin mopy Mr. Parsley, might be relief to a poor soul in trouble. Catholics tell you that what you do in a good c(IausC is redeemable, if not exactly right. And you know the Catholic is the oldest religion of the two. I would listen to St. Peter, staunch Protestant as I am, in preference to King Henry the Eighth. Though, as a woman, I bear him no rancour, for his wives werefools, point-blank. No man was ever so manageable. My diplomatist is getting liker and liker to him every day. Leaner, of course, and does not habitually straddle. Whiskers and morals, I mean. We must be silent before our prudish sister. Not a prude? We talk diplomacy, dearest. He complains of the exclusiveness of the port of Oporto, and would have strict alliance between Portugal and England, with mutual privileges. I wish the alliance, and think it better to maintain the exclusiveness. Very trifling; but what is life !" And now for the hero and heroine. The characterof Evan Harrington is most artistically pourtrayed. The very opposite of his intriguing sister, frank and open-hearted to a fault, keenly sensitive to his fale position, and yet half-reconciled to it by his absorbing love for Rose, ready to sacrifice his best and brightest hopes to save his sister's reputation, fighting the hard fight between love and duty, self-relying, and at last self-conquering, the tory of his trials cannot fail to excite the deepest interest and sympathy in the reader. And what of Rose?-Rose, the "proud and defiant beauty," yet gentle and loving withal, full of unwavering confidence in the love of the man whom she loves, regardless of his plebeian origin and the world's verdict? For all this, however, we fear Rose will not be a general favourite with readers of her own sex. T'iere isa waywardness in her character, which, however true to real life, ought not to be left unexplained by the novelist, who is behind the scenes and directs the complex machinery of human character. To our mind-will Mlr. Meredith pardon the simile?-she resembles a kitten, which, as long as it is stroked in the right direction, purrs on complacently andt pleasantly enough; but rub it against the grain, and lo ! the fur crackles, and the claws are unsheathed incontinently. Humanity, however, is frail, and if we will insist on the novelist making human nature his model, is it fair to complain that the result of his labour does not reach our own ideal standard of perfection? The remainder of Mr. Meredith's dIramatis persona, being mainly papas, mniammas, uncles, aunts, sisters, and cousins of the hero and heroine, must of course coinei under the head of subordinate characters. They are nevertlelea, all-we may especially particularise Lady Jocelyn, Mrs. Mel, Caroline-another sister of Evan's-and poor Juliana Bonner-carefully and consistently elaborated. There is only one personage to whom we can take any exception, to wit, Mir. John Raikes. If the exigences of the plot absolutely forbid the total elimination of this gentleman, surely he might have been toned down to somewhat more sober and less obtrusive proportions. Good old Andrew Cogglesby, alo, smacks too much of that blessed institution (to novel writers and dramatists), the Dens ex inzaripm. 'I'he plot, however, is deep and involved, and we therefore must not grudge the author the recognised means of extrication. We trust Air. Meredith will take these comments in the spirit in which they are offered, as they are dictated by pure good feeling and genuine admiral ion for the versatile powers and richness of imagination so unmuistakeably evinced in the performance of his task. In our opinion, " Evan HIlrrington' is the only novel of the day that is entitled to a place on the same shelf with such works as the " Woman in White."

29. Harold the Exile, pp. 919. 3 vols. (Concluded from p. 154.) THE second volume of this Work is filled with repetitions of the charms of the Countess, who, as you may easily believe, is deeply in love wilh Harold, and consequently tries all the arts of a Syren, to make him brcak break with the ever-accomplished Gabrielle; and thereby seconds the views of the treacherous Berington, who, in short, marries the angelic Gabrielle, dissipates her large fortune, and use her so ill, that she dies of a broken heart, after having pardoned Lord Harold, upon a mutual explanation, which takes place between them a few days before her death. Lord Harold, in consequence of promises made to Gabrielle on her death-bed, breaks off with the Counteu of Marchmont; returns to London, and is now introduced by his mother to a Lady Emily, who, by the bye, has been for three years before desperately in love with him: his mother intreats him to marry her, to which, after some hesitation, he consents, with the declaration, however, that he could never love her as he did Gabrielle, but would do his best to be a good and honest husband, and make her happy. Unfortunately, Lady Emily's ",.Mind was not formed for moderate enjoyment; with her it was either ecstacy or despair, rapture or agony, and her imagination, imbued with the romantic reveries of her favourite Rousseau, beheld no medium between the transports of passion and the cold feelings of indifference. The ravings of a distempered fancy she regarded as the genuine language of love, and the idea of adoration was always associated in her mind with that of a beloved object." The consequence was, that ' "d Lady Emily, who had expected to find an adoring and devoted husband in the object of her ardent attachment, was hurt at the tranquil and unimpassioned affection of Harold, which was rather displayed in his uniform tenderness and attention, than by sudden starts of foodness or expressions of admiration. Neither his time nor his thoughts were exclusively engrossed by her, nor did he entirely relinquish every intellectual study and manly exercise, because their pursuit included a temporary separation from his fair partner. Her society, indeed, was always welcome; but an unavoidable absence did not call forth from Harold any of those violent demonstrations of alternate regret and rapture, which are the criterion of affection in romantic minds. In the eyes of Lady Emily all this was a direct violation of the laws of Love, which required, in her opinion, an exclusive devotion to the beloved object, and her husband coulld not possibly feel that sentiment for her, since he was able to find pleasure or amusement from any thing in which she did not partieipete. "1 Tbe visionary schemes of estatic bls and rapturous tenderness, in which her romantic fancy had delighted to indulge, were now completely baaished, and with a sensation of extreme uneasiness Harold beheld her lovely brow clouded by inquietude and discontent, and perceived that nothing but her natural sweetness of temnper enabled her to retain her usual appearance of good humour. Unconscious of any cause existing for such a change, he forbore for some time remarking it; but when he observed her cheerful gaiety of manners give place to silence and dejection, he could no longer refrain from enquiries, whose answer was a passion of tears, and an exclamation-' That she was certain be did not love her!' "' I Amd what leads you to think so, Emily,' replied Lord Harold, much shocked at this abrupt assertion. "'Beeause people that really love are every thing to each other, and can have no idea of any separate and individual enjoyment. Now you, Harold, find many pleasures in which I have no share, while I have no satisfaction in any pursuit in which you do not participate. In this case, then, it plainly appears that it is I only who love.' ' Harold in vain represented to her, that a mutual attachment was by no means incompatible with a difference of pursuit, or an observance of the common forms of society. Lady Emily was not to be convinced, and quoted a hundred absurd writers in support of an opinion as absurd, when, finding that argument on this point was unavailing, he gave up the attempt; but from that time he neither engaged in bunting, sporting, or any other diversion, which Lady Emilv did not share, and to avoid the uneasy feelings occasioned him by seeing the latter expose herself to fatigues and inconveniences unsuited to her sex and delicacy, they were soon altogether relinquished." We have thought proper to give this long extract, which, in our opinion, explains perfectly well the nature of the quarrel, which has ended in the present separation of Lord Harold with his present wife. The remainder is occupied by a second episode, in which a gentleman of the name of Fitzabin gets into the confidence of Lady Emily; is suspected by Lord Harold, who, in a duel, wounds hiin desperately, and, in his distress, applies again to the Countess of Marchmont, who lakes advantage of his present troubles, and entrapls him to a nocturnal rcudezvous, vous, where be is surprisd by -the Count her husband, who institutes a suit at law against bim, and recovers l0,0001. This of course makes much noise, and brins Lady Emily and her friends to a ifua determbnation of ofEering to Lord Harold articles of separation.-The letters of Lad Emily and her friends are written witl high spiritg and the pride of our hero is so much wounded, that he resists the advice of his best friends, and sanctions the articles of separation.-Here end the adventures of Harold the Exile. There are many incidental events besides; but they are hardly worth mentioning. As we have already exceeded our limits, we can only inform our Read. ers that the whole is well written, and shows, in a great many instances, that poetical enthusiasm in proe, which the Author knows well how to make use of in verse.

But the li man is A ceL His position in society lH a i that vast uuneyd reion called Nowsas, which so many of ber Majesty's poorer liea ive, and breathe, and suffer, and run a long course, and die. We say this, simply because the truth jut at this moment presses upon us; not to attract attention to the volumes before us, for Mr Blanchard was not precisely in the above predi cament. For many years, indeed, he was poor enough; anxious and disapointed eno h; and he struggled resolutely onest the hoasips of his destiny, like one on whose shoulders Fate had set a burtbhen that he Anew must be carried to the grave, and which, in fact, he did carry, until the most terrible of maladies came down upon and conquered him, as it has before and since conquered many an able man. For two-and-forty years he maintained his great battle with Fortune,and then gave up the contest. We knew him, for the last fifteen years of his life, well-for the greater part of that time most intimately; and we can safely say that a man of more kind, gentle, cheerful, and generous nature never came within the circle of our knowledge. He was utterly without malice or envy of any sort. With small, very small means, he nevertheless managed so as to bestow many benefits on others. A stranger in need, a friend in trouble, never found him wanting. He gave what he could. He was the most agreeable of companions: he always brought sunshine to one's board. Ill or well, busy or at leisure, his cheerfulness never forsook hima He had a kind word for every one; a laugh for those who were hostile or ungrateful toward. bimtself; a sublimation of gratitude and good-will for any little acts of kindness done or designed by his friends. We thought little of the admirable writer while we had the dear and valued friend beside us; but it needs not that we should add, he was also a man of fine wit and subtle thought, and no indifferent writer of poetry. The present volumes contain a collection of his prose essays, written on the spur of the moment, and scattered over various periodical works. At the head is a biography from the pen of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton; an affectionate and earnest trim bute; as pleasingly written, and with as strong a championship of the duties and righls of men of letters, as his delightful Life of ScAiaer. Who will not deeply sympatbise with its opening seatences that knew anything of Lamaf Blanchard I " To most of those who have mixed generally with " men who, in our day, have chosen literature as their Profession, the name f Laman Blanchard brings recolleeiam of peculiar tenderness and regret. Amidst a career which the keenness of anxious rivalry renders a sharp probation to the temper and the affections, often yet more embittered by that strife of party, of which, in a 4epresentatl1S Con. slitution, few men of letters escape the eager pasins and the angry prejudicethey recal the memory of a omptito, without envy; a partion, without al; firm, as the Ae in the maintenance of his own opinions; but geode as the gentlest in the judgment he passed on othe, "1 Who, among our London brotherbood of letters, do not mis that simple cheerfulnes-that inborn and ezquisite urbanityv-hat child-like redines to be pleased with all-that hippy tendency to rise every-menk am to be lenient to every fauk Whod not rcW that moto and delicate seslbUiity-o eaill wounded, and thersbre so careful not to wound-whic esemed to infuse a cerwa inellectual fine breeding, of forbou"ce MA sympathy, into every society where itimuated is goo wa Wbo, in convivial meengs, d g net Ms wil Met MAe Iee ever, the sweetness O' d se b iwtemiNg tetseanestns of that boseq ih md d s was worn so ligbtlythe id e of at t kindness, which softened the ry of yon uta s, and re e the nwr W1 o jlr is Yet few men bad experienced more to am dm tha Lam B dor b ute the atOrs hr i' re , of o o daily lbr, nd of td o I h._ h of ambition, which must lt In WaInm th whw retie nd of _ _ e =eshe byk time _a Isure, s w am yet ee draw hoa Wm untatred -a hr nj__Mu wad_ s(W TO be ba'M-or - glZe aidw t e" pms s ee . m sd nties hr these mere fselmet, ead kmtia lo WeM OWN smoe yet hnh d i bwha~w Meanallw saw W . dwl v as len - I I i I I Imut wmd 7 i mA slm -_ kmsebu 1_ X w ,S kw_ e 'in. ups I *ad am,'.

The circumstances of his family, however, were such as to prereat their takin- adrvantage of this offer, and llanchard was tberet.)re sent, as a writer, iilt ) tVie o)Tiee ol'a proctor in Doctors' Commons. The wearti ui'elfi; arising from this sort of labour sp-ediiy mini1tsted itself, ani coming upon a mind freih from school achievements, and imbued with a deep love of poetry, he became disgusted with the life into which hi had been forced (tfr he had no choicr'), and conceived a strong passion for the stage. At this time, his father was urgent that he tibou!(d leave the desk of the proctor for "tbe more utrzenial m('r!anism " of his own trade; and this, FAMled to the son's previous admiration of the histri',mtic art, fin-lly precipitated him upon the boards of; rc.;:witry t2atre.

His friends, e MU- I iag sSddely at his bouse, have found bim giving way to Wars and vebememt gief witbout appart cause. In mixed society be would strive to rallyrsoLetiOm with succes9- 0mteimes utterly in vain. He has been obliged to quit the room, to give way to emotions which seemed to tise spontuneously, unexcited by what passed around him, except as it jarred, undetected by others, upon the irritable chords within. In short, the nerves, so long overtasked, were g~viog way. In the long and gallant struggle with eircurnstaiceI, the work of toil told when tbe bour of grief ! ctme. " 66Still, to the public, he wore the mask-which authors wear unto the grave. Still were his writings as full of pleasant atmenity, and quiet and ready grace. Still, for the lovers of light literature, the bloom was as fresh as ever upon the fruits of his jaded fancy and grieving heart." We agree with Sir Edward Lytton that, had Laman Blanchard been born at au earlier day, he would have been compelled to put forth all that I was in him of mind and genius; and to have written thitigs not intended for tbe week or month, but ! for long duration. All that he wanted was time; tbe means of waiting for the seasons of inspiration; instead of being compelled daily always to labour for his daily bread. " But when all is said-when all the drawbacks upon what he actually was are made and allowed-enough reinmins to justify warmn eulogy, and to warrant the rational hope that he will occupy ama honourable place amor~g the writers of lis age. Putting aside his poetical pretensions, and regarding solely what he performed, not what he promiised, he unquestionably stands high amongst a class of writers, in which for the last century we have not been rich-the Essayists whole themes are drawn from social subjects. -sporting lightly between literature and manners. And this kind ol composition is extremely difficult in itself, requiring intellectual combinations rarely found. The volumes prefaced by this slight Memoir deserve a place in every collection of Belles Lettres, and form most agreeable and characteristic illustrations of our manners and our age. They pos4ess what is seldom found in light reading, the charui th.at comes froin bequer thing pleasurabl impressions. i They are sutff.-eJ in the sweetness of the author's dispoSiton ; they shun a11 painful views of life, all acerbity in observatioti, all gall in their getitle sarcasm. Added to this, th-v contain not a thought, not a line. fromir which the most anxious pareit would guiard hi4 child. 'They may be read with safety by the minst simple, and yet they contain enough of trulh and character to interest the most reflective. Such works muire than many which aspire to a higher flight, and aJddess tietumselves to Truth with a ruder and more vigrous courtr.hip, are calculated to enjoy a tranquil popularity, and a. tavoured station amanst the Dead who survive in };ook. In coiclulion. it seenii to me that, with but slight re,.rve and moditicatiorl, we mRly a:pty to our departed friend his own pathetic and beautitul elegy upon another: lie taught the cheerfulness that still is ours, The sweetness that still lurks in hunian powers; If heaven be full of stars, the earth has flowers! His was the se-arching thaught, the glowing mind; The gentle will t ) others' soan resign'd; But simore than all, the feeling just and kind. Iiii pleta~irei were as metodies from reedsSweet hooks, deep inusic, amid unselfiJih deeds, Fmindin inummnortal tlowers in human weeds. Trnie to h1i9 kind, nor of him wlf afraid, lie deem'd th.it love of GoJ was best array'd In love of all the things thlat God has made. fte deew'd man's life no feverish dream of care, 1t1lz t high pathway into freer air, Lit up with gol lemn him)pes and duties f~mir. I1 shwav'd hb.y wislomn turns its hours to years, Feeding the He.art on joys instead of fears, Anti wors~hm!s GoJ in smiilei, and not in tears. Ihic thoughts were as a pyramid up-piled 0ii %vho;e lar tup all aAiigel sto)id aid smiledyet, in his heart, %sas lie a simple Child. We mnvist re.peat ot' this Memoir that it i.3 most admirably cxecuted, and exbhits e herywhere sound , observation, ftine feelint, and discriminating taste. I The pre-sent volumes do not contain Mr Blanchard% poeticl w wrks ; hult We cannot detiv ourselves th. pleasure of introducing one of his So0. nets (a h1autilul piece ot verse) to the reader: lfOR ING. Wake from your misty neits-instinctive wake, Ye fine, and numberless, arid sleeping things! The Infant Saviour of all blossomings Fronma heaven's blue womb hath passed; amol for the sake Of E>arth, and her green family, doth make Iii air redemptioni and Soft gloryings. The world, as thotigh inspired, erectly flings 114 sha lowy coronals aw*a, to slake .1 AWj tinrt for hOA : and, one by one, The enanmou;e hilus-with many a startled dell, rountain an l foresit-'lush before the Sun! Voices and vints arc up, and waters swell: .4sd f/(wrere, lke cletfered ahlpSerds, Aare brg,;i Ta ope titr frJarasw uetA', and Aearely taug tell. 'The cessays consist chiefly of papers illustrative either of proverbs or popular fallacies (the last beming ackinmlcedge tfllowings in the footsteps of Ch,4rleq LamS); and if twere be not in them all that quaInt and subtle bea-aty for which the Eusavs of Ehi.i tre so eminent, there is nevertheless an ahbindance of vivctiy, shrewd obser. vation, and kindly feelig, which we should find it difficult to stc elsewherm It is imposmible . -l . a _ -% . .. a . . _ to read tlbmuu- th. vWumes without bein better and wiser tha w we bepa, or wifiout presuming no preui knowledge of him - enter. taming a strong aftetion for the uthor, and laumeiig his early and f iatl death. Some ol the paprs 'are fng of hastily, and are mainly eIs nmof aeuis ; but othm ha" a rn ValwYlna, MS hr all wbo will who ~ ~sebh so imewpM ibmt W I FTMYof h Ri elWvS ho 0 13p_ misled by friendship, if we may not sely pre. dict that these volumes belong to the books that will live. It was our intention to have made some extraet from the Essays, but we must defer the rigbt to another occasion. The book is beautifully produced by Mr ColD burn. There is a speaking portrait by Mr Maclise, eloquent in joyous and touching thoughts as poor Blanchard himself was; and several pleaing designs by Mr Kenny Meadows, Air Cruishank, and Mr Frank Stone. But a good wine needs no bush, and this good book needed not these addi. tions; except as tributes of affection from its author's sorrowing friends. Shehe/e from Life will be bought we trust, as it ought to be, quite as extensively for its own sake, and on the ground of its own merits, as for any personal or friendly association with the memory of Blanchard. But of even such a book it will not be misplaced to add that it is the only legacy left by their father to his four orphan children.

Its eves opened, bilt at tirst thev vere lifeless, and void of sight, and turned iil their sockets with al ghastly rolling, which, if it dlid not terrify tilt! Sleti'llader, made himn push ofl the strange lout fronm his on with a feeling of horror. Shortly after, the lips qIivered, anild were drawn apart into a tfiarfil grin, wvhielh shewved gumirs large and toothless, and expanded into a frightful gape, frozn whence it deep sigh, or rather groan, issited, along with a blast of vapotr, more like the smoke of gituinowder than the steam of breath. I.pon seeing this, Spiel mechanically shipped his oar over the stern of his boat, anl begani to skull her it little wity off; biut, retlect. ing that he was acting like a coward, lie put her head about again. In the meanwhile, lite seemed to have taken possession of the stranger and lie turned his eyes towards Trosk, and' said, inl a voice of uncommon expression, I 'Where am I :' This was uttered in Dutell; andl the fisherman, who was partially acquainted with that language, fronm having associated with whale-catchers and trnders fromt Holland, exclaimed in the sanie tongue, ' Who are Von ?'

' InI the name of (d !what iM the (artillian ?' cried the fisieraitan fervently.

' I say what is the Carunilait P' repeated Spiel, not hteditig the anlgish of the stranger. ' The ('aritillian is nothiiig now,' said tile other; Ibut onee site was as brave a ship as ever bjtore u mast.' I A ship !' cried Trosk. I Yes, a ship,' repeated the straniger; ' and when she was lost amonig these islands, shie carried more gold thIan had floated in atty vessel before her.' W Where was sIte lost, and when ?' exclaiaied the fisherman. ' It is nearly a huindred years since she was wreeked,' replied the little maii, anlid it vas in the night ; so that, though I wais on board her at the time, I kIiow not the precise spot, but I nm tcme hither to diseover it.'

The fishermen by ilegrees nre rediteed to povertv, allnd in one of the dark iinglits of Septeimber, Spiel, in desperation, resolves to resort to the forbidslex and( perilotis c'harimi. T'his FClene is very powerfiilly described; anil the lhorrors of the hoars dtirling wluicli thie hero 'f the story is lapt in the reeking hide of their last anld favotirite cow, render this part of the nirrative extremely striking. We regret tlu'it we cannot (Itiote it. In the end, ''rosk is transpiorted by the tomlpest froni the demioirtlleil spot to a place nearer the sen-shore. '' lie could norv distiiiguisli the( roll of the wvaveA on the shiore, elowinig as they were wvotl in calin weather, and lhe attemptedf to discover tile time 1)) the rise of the tide ; f'or there wars not tile lealst sign of dawvn, though tihe sky was lb illilantly enligiteneil. lie listelled atte ntivel', andl heard not only the brawling mirnmir of tlhe sea pimu rilg, among the sh in dles, ,huIt ;i hullust of silvelill lnmim4i Ilgled with it,yet so f'ainit thiat lie wa,,s 1l1t conviIced(. of its reality .

Again lie heard it lotider thualL before, ntd lhe fancied It approached him ; and, as it I conitiniled, he believed lie could distingii~sh the tune of a psahn he had heard suing lbv the crew of a D)utchl herring-duss which liad beeu off the Skerries in the preceding summer. a he fance ied he could perceive voice8 occasional v jill the notes, and sing the very words he had formerly heard; for, as I have said before, Trosk niderstood the langniage. Although, when the winds rose, he always lost the sounil(ls of thit singular concert, vet, when. ever there was a lull, he was satitfied that it gradiully drew nearer, and lie coud(l now trace its advance, winding slowly utp the glens from beilow, towards that in which lie was extended. At len:.gtli it was so distinct that lhe was per. smiaded it must have crossed the ledge that bouiled the ohriuik of the plain, and he endea. voured to raise his head, so that he might gain a view of the source of this extraordinary m(elody. There was a loose fragment of stone near him, and by dint of wriggling and pushing himself along like a seal, he contrived to elevate his head upon it, and, looking forth, lie beheld a long and gleamy procession ap. proaching towards him, over the quaking bo)g on which lie had at first b(eenI laid. Sorrow anid dejectioni were mnarked on the countenances of the beings composing the troop, and their hahsiliments appeared heavy with moisture, and dripping like fresh seas-weeds. They drew 'close up to him, and were silent. First came the musirians, whose instniments lie had heard so long and so anxiously, but he could not scritinise thiem much, for as they ad. Ivarieil opposite to him, they 'heeled off to the right and left, and took their stations on either side. The front space was immediately occupied hy a varied group, who appeared, h;i their delportment, to precedq some object of I great 'histinctioq, which, wbhesssey parted and tiled off in the sattie manner as the band, presented itself to viewr. This was a tall, bulky, though well-butilt man, whose capacity of belly w1S properivl alanced lby the protuberance (;f t sat hatrt which honour has assurmed to herself. His head was not little, ald his face ,appeared rather. swollen. His shoulders were wide, and vwere clothed in a full coat of broad-eloth, fashioned after the manner of thc fourth gene. ration past. Its skirts reached below his knees, round. which they curved. It wnas col. larless, blut sleeves vastl) *heep hung from the arms, the cuffs of which were adorned with cut -steel buttons of great cireurmference nid blrightness. lBroad hands of rich gold lace c-overed every seam nnd edge, more ghiriouis in the eves of the ieholder than the setting slun, and the lappils of a quilted vest hInin down from the immense orl of his bowels heavy with the preciouis nietal that braided them. Ilis tiighs were arraved in breeches ofI sc arlet velvet, silk hose disgisedl his legs, and large sqiuare..toed slhoes covered his feet, and lent their thongs to support gold buckles of great breadth, which glittered with precious stonies. On his hrapld was placed a long, flow. inug, flaxen, coiling svig, surmounted by a small three-coriiered cocked hat, hittoned up with gold banids, and a long, straight, basket-hilted sword hungt, suspended in a broad, buff.em. lbroidered heit, by his side. In his hand ho hel(d a gold -headed, clouided ground rattnn, grof great lngth an(n thickness a tillc lose lv his side walked a black boy, hearluig a long, twisted, grstesquuelyv-fashiioned pipe, which lie iicasioisnally offered to his lord, who stopped aliid ga ve a solemn lpiif or two, aind thieii pro. ceeded. When he canme immediately opposite to S piel, he stooxl still aisd erect, auid a usumbter of others ranged themselves on his right band and oI Iris lert, whose dresses were line, ltut not so splendid as their sueriior's, anid they bore pipes of common form only. Ilehrind these dievr ulp a group (of persons, niany of irholn vere ladies, soime hearing iifanits in their arims, others leadilg children by their hands, all dressed in strange and gorgeous apparel, though of fashioIns unknown to him who beheld them and, lastly, came a bodv of men and lads, with big loose trowiers, thick heavy jackets, and red worsted night-caps, whom Trosk instantly knew to be Dutch sailors. Each of these had a qiuid of tobacco stuck in his cheek, Aand n short blackened pipe in his month, which lie sicked in melancholy silence. Tho fisherman In still, and snwv this grim troop asselblile around him wvith feelings of mingled alarm and wonder; his heart did not snik, for it iuns kept alive by fearful ciuriosity, hut cold siveats gathered upon his brow. Presently, the prin. cipal figure looked roulnd, and seeing his atteiidanrts ull in their stations, lie took his loiln twisted pipe from the hands of the negro, and riegan to smioke in long arid deep-drawni whii h; and this seemed as a signal to the rest to followv his example, for, immediately, every mouth was in aiction, anid whirhever way Spiel cakt his looks, he beheld nothing tint glowing tutues and gleaming eves turned towards him, while wreaths of smonke rose up) from the multitude, and forme(l a dense cloud-like canopy abore them. Nevertheless, though he could plainly distinguish the features mnd the dresses of thls ghastly crew, lie could also nee the stars clearly glimmering through them, and now gleams of fire and electric flahes began to shoot across the heavens, and the sky grew more vividly bright than it had been. Still, though Trosk could behold all these appeeraners through the bodies of the phartoms, me coild also perecive that his ghostly visitaurts were closing slowly upon him, that their ranks grew more denbe, and the space between him and them more narrow, while their puffs became more violent, and the smoke rose up with redoubled velocity. The Shetlander was naturally a hold and, indeed, a desperate man, and he had come to the glen witih the desire of convening with beilgs of another world; bnt when he beheld this fenrful, strange, and unintelligible muiltitude crowded round trim, and pressing nearer and nearer, as if about to overwhielrr him, his cou. rage yielded, hiri frame shook, and the sweat ran c opiously down his face. Tire appearance of tIre black boy occasiorred hitn more terror than all the rest; for, never having seen a negro in those far distant isles, lie believed him to be a little devil, and his whitc teeth arnd whiter eye-halls looked terrific ngainst his sable face ; but his terror redoubledl, when, oft turnirrg his eves nli) to look at the sky above, lie perceived close behind his head that little drv withered maui who haid aecosted him in the skiff, sitting now as rigidly upright as hefore, hut twith a puipe in his mouth, which lie seemed to hold there as if in grave mockery of all the assembly. Trosk started convulsively, and a choking sensation seized upormi his thro;at; but, siummonintgr all his energy, he mastered it; arid directinig himself to the principal person before him, he exclaimed, ' In the name of him ve obe'v, who are ve ? and what trant ve altl with 'ue ?' Thre great niani gave three puffs, moro solemnrly thalen ever, upon this iinjuratiora, and then,, taking the pipe slowly from his lips, and giving it to Iris attendarrt, ire replied, in a tone of chilling formality, ' I am AIdret .anz Dun. drelilesv Vandler Sw;elter, tvhilome commander of tIre good shlip Carmilhan, (if tre city of Am. sterdam, homeward bound [Mrox batavia, iu tlv# I" Ist , w Ili 1' I & II'-' ilt i or I writ(i lilt it IV~{, ! 10 ' 11141 17I ' If 11 H4IlitIIf It' Vlst, t l 't)111 till' ' u ll u' ft,' ,, 1 I1 . . fi. ll, tIll' 1ii lit 4III till' ' pt 411 I'tlv l k ;'i k till', istw s va dst 11 1 4iIl t4 1,. , pt ; ,i.

VERGER'S PRIDE. By Mrs. Hexey Wood. Three vols., post 8vo. Bradbury and Evans, 1863. REMEMBERING the sensation which " East Lynne" created on its first ap? pearance, the "cabal" of which Mrs. Wex)d assured tho public that her seconel novel, "The Channings," was the victim, and tho quiet " gooely" tone of "Mrs. Halliburton's Troubles," which needed no cabal to secure that story its place in the third class, wo turned to " Vernor's Pride" with some inte? rest, to see what rank this latest production of tho authoress was entitled to take. Wo think it may rise into tho soconel class, as a novel above the average, to be read certainly by leisurely people who read novels as part of the business e)f life, but not to be taken in hand by those who can spare time only for really good novels?except for the Peckaby episode, which contains some rude fun. Brother Jarrum is a missionary from the New Jerusalem, and comes to preach to the poor women anel men of Deerham about the glories of the City of the Saints :?' Stars anel snakes! there's ease and plenty there; the houses have shady verandahs, anel sweet shrubs a-creeping round 'em; every maid's a lady, anel has her own parlour anel bedroom; grapes anel peaches are to be bael for the plucking ; there's a ball-room anel a theatre, anel lots of dancing?such a thing as oki legs isn't known among 'em. Then there's ducks anel turkeys, anel oysters anel fowls anel fish, and meats, and custards, and pics, anel pota? toes, anel greens, anel jellies, anel coffee, anel tea, and drinks, anel so many moro things, that vou'd bo tired of hearing the names.' But? " What's tho drinks ? " inquired Jim Clark, tho supper items imparting' to his inside a curious feeling ot* empti? ness. " There's no hick of drinks in the City of thc Saints," returned Brother Jarrum. " Whisky's plentiful. Have you heard of mint julep ? That is delicious. Mint is one of the few productions not common out there, and we are learning to mako the jule]) with sage instead, You should see the plains of sage ! It grows wild." "And there's ducks, you say?" observed Susan Peckaby. "It's convenient to have sage in plenty where there's ducks," added she to thc assembly in general. " What a lund it must be ! " " A land that's not to bc ekalled ! A land flowing with milk and honey ! " rapturously echoed Brother Jarrum. "Ducks is in plenty, and'sage grows as thick as nettles do here; you can't go out to the open country but you put your foot upon it. Nature's generally in accordance with herself. What should she give all them bushes of wild sage for, unless she gave ducks to match?" Then, as to the women's prospects, says Brother Jarrum,? "Women is not married with us for time, but lor eternity?as j tried to beat into you last night. Once the wife of a saint, their entrance into paradise is safe and certain. We have not got an old maid among us?not a single old maid ! " " No old maids, and no widdcrs," continued Brother Jarrum, wiping his forehead, which was becoming moist with the heat of argument. " Wo have respect to our women, we have, and like to make 'eui comfortable." " But if their husbands die ort'?" suggested a puzzled listener. " Thc husband's successor marries his widders," ex? plained Brother Jjirrum. "Look at our late head and prophet, Mr. Joe Smith.,?him that appeared in a vision to our present prophet, and pointed out the spot for the new temple, ile died a martyr, Mr. Joe Smith did?a prey to wicked murderers. Were his widders left to grieve and die out arter him ? Xo. Mr. Brigham Young, ho succeeded to his honours, and he married the wid? ders." This oration is made in Peckaby's shop, and after a time 1 bother Jarrum starts with a select party of intended saints from Deerham ; but, to Mrs. Peckaby's horror, she is left behind. Unknown to her, Peckaby, who is a mocker, and has to b^ reniinekul "of tho forty-two as was eat up by bears when Hwy mocked at Elisha," has had a private interview with the brother. '* 1 tolled Brother Jarrum, the very day afore the start took place, that if he took off mp wife, I'd fol lor him on and beat every bone to smash as he'd got in his body," interposed Peckaby, glancing at Lionel with a kno.ving smile. " T did, *-ir. Uer wa-* out "?jerking his black thumb at his wife?"and 1 caught Brother Ja mini in Iii** own room and shut thc door <>:i us both, and there f tolled him. He knew I mo:mt i;, too: and he didn't like the look of an in?n bar T happened lo have in mv hand: I .-aw that. Other wives' husbands might d > as they liked ; but I wa rut a going to have mine deluded ort'by them Latter Hay Saint*." However, comfort comes for poor Mrs. Peckaby; the brother sends her a. special messenger to say that a higher mission is reserved fen* her, anel she is te) be conveyed te> America "special, on a quadruple, which was a white donkey." " There's difficulties in the way of a animal on four legs which can't swim doing it all, that I don't portend to explain away. I'm content, when the hour comes, sir, to start, and trust. Peckaby, he's awful sinful, sir. Only last evening, when I was saying the quadruple might have mirae'lous parts give to it, like Kaitlin's had in the Bible, Peckaby he jeered, and said he'd like to see Halma's, or any other quadruple, set ort' to swim to America?that he'd lind the bottom afore he found the land. I wonder the kitchen coiling don't drop down upon his head ! For myself, sir, I'm rejoiced to trust, as I says ; and as soon a-s the white donkey do come, I shall mount him without fear." AVell, one pouring wet night ki this blesseel animal, the white tpiadruple,"arrives, accom? panied by two men. Mrs. Peckaby '' flings on her purple gownel," puts em her best shawl anel bonnet, mounts her bare-backed steed, and departs. "Rapt in a glowing vision of the honours and delights that would welcome her tit her journey's end,"' she doesn't miss her conductors till her '4 quadruple" has lost his way in a wood. She dismounts to loe>k for the path, and on her return the elonkcy is genie. She rubs her eyes anel pinches her arms. Have Peckaby anel Chuff, the black? smith, played her a practical joke!" Home she goes; storms at the doe>r; but Peckaby declares that his wife's gone off to Xew Jeru? salem, and, says Mrs. Green next eloor, "Ain't that your plum-cole >uretl gownel ? what's come to it !'" What had come to it! Patches e>f eleael white, looking ne>t unlike paint, covered it about on all sides. Chuff, the blacksmith, gave a great grin from his window : " Sure that there elemkey never -was painted ehown white," quoth he. As respects, however, the plot of the novel:? " Yerner's Pride" is a mansion and estate that Stephen Yerner is charged to leave to his nephew Lionel Yerner. Stephen has two step-sons, John anel Frederick Massingbirel, but his nephew, Lionel, is his priele anel dar? ling. Ile suspects John of having seduced anel caused the suicide of a beautiful maid? servant of the family, Rachel Frost; but John, to clear himself, shows Stephen Yerner a glove of Lionel's that he bael picked up on the brink of the pond that Rachel drowned herself in. The edd man takes this as a proof of Lionel's guilt, disinherits him, anel by his will gives *'Yerin t's Pride"' to John Mas? singbirel, and on his death without issue io Frederick, with remainder te) Lie med. The family doctor, West, knowing this, anel be? lieving that John has been killeel in Aus? tralia, lets his pretty ambitious daughter, Sibylla, marry Freel Massingbird, and jilt Lionel Yerner, a chivalrous young follow, who is deeply in love with her. Put Stephen Yernor, wheal on his death-bed, relents towarel.s Lionel, anel by a codicil leaves him his whole estate. This coeiicil Dr. West steads anel hides, so that his daughter and her husband may still retain tho property. Put Fred. Massingbird elies in Australia, before knowing that he had come inte> it, and his wide>w Sibylla e*omes back to England, ex? pecting to live with Mis. Stephen Veiner at Vern er's Pride. However, she finds her edd love, Liemel Yerner, in pe)ssossion, tis ne-xt ! devisee after J edin anel Frederick's death. He is, toe>, in le>vewith a beautiful simplo-natured ward of his mother's.

It was not like those snatched kisses ?f years ago. " My darling ! im\darliiig! God alone knows what my ? love for you has been." Lionel Yerner is the hero of the book, and his character is very fairly worked out. ! The strain that his proud sensitive nature j suffers from Sibylla's jilting, his uncle's ? coldness, his first wife's frivolity and com- ! plaints, anel the occasional breakings-thremgh j of liis underlying love for Lucy Tempest, are well represented. His uncouth anel kind j medical brother, James, too, and his proud , eeurect mother, have each an individuality of their own ; the slight sketches of Mother Duff anel her son Dan aro good. But the book would have gained in interest by being in two volumes instead of three; anel there are slips in the English which are scarcely j pardonable in a lady's writing:?"That is j the reason why I am presumptive enough to \ suggest the ielea te) you," (ved. ii., p. 171); j "Her fitful me)oel vexcel him above common" (ved. iii., ]). 7), are erne er two of the instances j we have notie*ed.

If Mrs. Wood woidd protluoe her books at longer intervals, and not enter the lists for the champion's title of "The Author of Most of the Now Novels," but conelense anel finish off her work better, she might, we think, elo herself mero iustice than her late works haye done her.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley. Edited by C. D. Locock. With an Introduction by A. dutton - Brock. 2 vols. (Methuen & Co.) This new edition of Shelley's poetry has several interesting features, and not least among them is Mr. dutton - Brock's Introduction. It is devoted to an estimate of the quality and significance of Shelley's work as a poet?to a reversal of Matthew Arnold's verdict upon him. Shelley, Mr. Clutton-Brock in effect tells us, was a beautiful and an effectual angel. He makes, in the course of his exposition, some very illuminating remarks; the sentences in which he calls attention to the momentum of Shelley's verse, and those?they are too few?in which he touches upon Shelley's sympathy with the spirit of nature, are full of insight and discrimination. " Shelley," he says, " in his happiest vein, is a landscape poet of a new kind. He shows us the whole universe subject to a rhythm and movement imposed upon it by the religious ardour of his own mind." And the main line of his argument?which is to the effect that a work of art, since its purpose is to convey emotion, must be judged by the quality of the emotion it conveys?is, we think, incontrovertible, as well as excellently put. Yet, in his application of the argument to Shelley's case, he does not satisfy us, and his general rehabilitation of Shelley ss in essence a religious poet is based, surely, on a misunderstanding. Splendid as was Shelley's natural poetic endowment, Mr. Clutton-Brock overrates, we feel sure, the significance, the scale, of his achievement. He writes, for example, that Shelley's blank verse " never becomes prosaic," that the music in ' Prometheus ' " never flags," that " other great poets of his time are often prosaic and trivial; Shelley never." Few will accept these judgments, and some will suspect that a certain insusceptibility to Shelley's periods of bathos is connected with Mr. Clutton-Brock's docile acceptance of his raptures. The lovely song in ' Prometheus,' ' Life of Life,' has the influence of a charm ; but Mr. CluttonBrock conjures with it excessively. Who, turning to it in its place in the poem, can read the opening stanza of the scene, On the brink of the night and the morning My coursers are wont to respire, without recognizing in Shelley precisely that prosaic and trivial element, the presence of which Mr. Clutton-Brock denies? the element of verbiage, in short?and without wondering whether something of the taint has not descended upon the immortal song itself ? Thy smiles, before they dwindle, Make the cold air tire,?then screen them In those looks. Are these, after all, the words of a song of passion for perfection, the " expression of a philosophy become faith ? " We can hardly?and this is our second point? call Shelley a religious poet without bringing first something like sleight of hand to bear upon the meaning of the word " religion." It was the reverse side of Shelley's pure goodness of will, of his inability to conceive an evil purpose or to recognize evil in himself, that he was totally unamenable to discipline. But for the ingenuous laxity of his nature, his mastery of language and of verse might have been incomparably greater. And similarly his emotions become more and more abstract in their bearing, not because life has been subdued under him, as a saint subdues it, but because, by refusing to be subdued, it has proved itself unworthy of his attention. This surely is the reason why his expression of passion loses value, and can fairly be called ineffectual in spite of its luminousness and beauty. In its detachment from life it has a quality of emptiness. The angel, in short, is beating his wings in the void, removed from us not by what he has renounced, but by what he has rejected. Mr. Locock's task in the collation of the MSS. and of the texts of previous editions has been performed with scholarly thoroughness and exactitude, and in his editorial judgment he has the pleasant faculty of combining critical acumen with common sense. He is particularly happy as an interpreter of disputed passages, partly perhaps because he avoids a snare which has been fatal to some of Shelley's earlier commentators, the temptation to show himself more poetical than the poet. On questions of prosody he is sometimes dogmatic without being convincing, and we doubt whether his principles or his instinct always guide him aright in the settlement of textual difficulties. There can, after all, be no positive settlement of difficulties which Shelley himself did not succeed in settling ; and when the poet was, as he was so often, of two minds about a passage, the casting vote should surely be allowed to the reading which tradition or the best judgment of the poet's readers has established. Take, for ex ample, the famous * Hymn of Pan' : Mr. Locock informs us that in the line Listening to my sweet pipings the word " to " has been struck out, in the Bodleian MS., at both places where the line occurs; and he actually receives the line, so amputated, into his text. Or take, again, the ' Indian Serenade.' The text of this is full of uncertainties; but does not the evidence make it likely that the uncertainties are uncertainties of Shelley's mind ? If this is so, the duty of an editor, we hold, is to determine which of the variants has found favour. For the memory of a poem and the associations which cling even about its most insignificant turns of phrase soon become identified with the spirit of the piece and seem to form part of its poetic value. The readings As I must die on thine and O press it close to thine again may be as good poetically as those which have been more usually accepted ; but they cannot seem so. The accepted reading, merely because it is accepted, becomes endowed with the magic of its surroundings, and its displacement is almost like an act of violence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
, I The Voyage of the Arrow. By T. Jenkins Hains. (Brown, Langham7& Co.) THE present volume is a long romantic tale, containing a most generous measure of the conventional elements of sea-story. The love of a woman runs through it, and battle, murder, and sudden death all play their part, with piracy, storm, and shipwreck as adjuncts of a stirring sort. We find, perhaps necessarily, less characterization and a good deal less actual observation of modem sea life here than there was in 'The Windjammers.' Romance is the main object in this book, and in pursuing it Capt. Hains shows himself not quite craftsman enough to be able to observe the same fidelity to nature and experience which distinguished his earlier work. ' The Voyage of the Arrow' will be none the less popular'for that; it is written with feeling and conviction, without gross negligence of truth, and with a swing and zest which should commend it particularly to young people.

Pratt Portraits: Sketched, in a New England Suburb. ?? By Anna Fuller. (Putnam's.) These little "studies of New England life are in the genre which the art of Miss Wilkins has done so much, to render illustrious. .The inspiration is the same, with ito constant effort to. .render "fine' qualities of ihe human spirit among unpromising surroundings ; and - it ~ the narrowness and weariness of the life painted is more conspicuous, and its homely, remote beauty Jess conspicuous than in Miss Wilkins's work, that is, perhaps, partly a matter of temperament and partly Because Miss Fuller writes of New England, suburban and sophisticated, Miss Wilkins of the simple village existence of New England proper. Of the individual stories, "Aunt Betsy's Photographs," "A New England Quack," and "A Yankee Quixote " strike us most. Aunt Betsy has her picture done " in front of the grapevine, her right hand in a black lace nutt, reposing upon the wicket-gate, and her voluminous skirts spreading on either side." The sitting is a secret one, and the dramatic production of the photographs in the family circle is the triumphant moment of the poor flabby; oppressed lady's life.

The Kuzzilbash ; a Tale of Khurasan. A TALK OF KHORASAN*. 3 vols. 12nio. Colburn. London, 1828. We regret that we cannot present our readers with the name of the author of the volumes before us, for two reasons : in the first place, they belong to a class devoted to a species of information which always requires the guarantee of a signature to prevent its fulling under the denomination of ' Travellers' Tales;' and, secondly, because the writer, being undoubtedly a man of talent, deserves a large proportion of commendation, and now-a-davs, thc town has been too much drugged with ' (ircnt I it knott'mi' to attach any ideas of sublimity to the obscurity they assume, or take much trouble in inquiring who they may be. The Kuzzilbush takes a stand mid-way between Anastasius and Hadji Baba, and is as far inferior to the one as it excels the other. The author is a man evidently familiar with his subject, though the historical suggestions necessary to a thorough understanding of his tale, are given rather too sparingly for one who wishes to suit manners with epochs, and contrast customs with circumstances. The book is likewise deficient in incident; its writer seems to want imagination, and the entire history of the three volumes might be told in a very few lines: though the book is full of very minute details. He has, in fact, strung two stories together, in order to eke out the legitimate duodecimal trio, in which form a novel must come to be printed if not to bc read. But we must turn to the book. It is designed to illustrate the manners of Khorasan, and the wandering tribes of the Turcomans, as they existed about the beginninu' of thc last century, at the period when the celebrated Nadir Shah, the Pyrrhus of mo.lcm Persia, succeeded in the most gigantic of his undertakings, and acquired, for a time, military possession of Mushed, (or, a.-* we have it in our maps, Meshid,) the noble and venerable capital of the Mogul empire. Ismael, the hero of the tale, denominated the Ivuz/.ilbash, a Turkish word, signifying liter, liv ' red-cap,' but by common acceptation a ' Persian soldier,' is son to the Khan of a small village on the skirts of thc mountains below Dereguz, in Khorasan, and born about the year 1115> of the Hegira, or 17*40 of our computation. Almost in infancy lie is carried off by a horde of Turcomans, who ravaged the territory of his parents. On this occasion an expedition, headed by his father, had proceeded to meet the marauders, and the catastrophe, one of the most important in the life of the Kuzzilbash, wc give in his own words? ' For some months every thing remained in quiet, but after that time rumours began to be circulated, that small parties of the Toorkomans had been observed lurking among some ruined villages, and in the ravines in our neighbourhood ; and intelligence having at length arrived, that one of these had approached nearer than usual to our village, my father, summoning his best soldiers, left home one evening in hopes of .surprising them. The night passed, not without anxiety;? but little did any of the family dream of the fate that waif hanging over them. ' In thc grey of the morning the sound of horses was heard, and the watchmen on the walls gave notice that the Khan was approaching. The gates were immediately thrown open, and several of the inhabitants, both men and women, went out to meet their friends, returning, as they hoped, successful, and laden with booty. But they were soon terribly undeceived; for, as the foremost of the troop came near enough to be recognised, the unhappy villagers descried the wild features of their Toorkoman foes, scowling frqm under the Kw* zilbash caps and turbans. A loud scream of affright told their enemies that .-they were discovered, and instantly spurring their horses to full speed, they pursued the flying wretches, making way with their swords to right and left, and entered the gates almost before the alarm had reached the few guards who remained on duty. All who attempted resistance were cut to pieces in a moment, while a party of the villains, dashing forward to my father's fortified palace, seized on the gates, which were beset with fugitives, before they could be effectually closed. ' Young as I then was, I can yet remember well the shrieks of horror and despair that arose as the Toorkonians, with their huge rough caps and hideous countenances, all smeared with dust and blood, burst into the private apartments : the yell of agony and frantic entreaty that burst from the old women and eunuchs, as some of the stern savages hewed them in pieces, while others seized on the younger females and children, still seems to ring in my ears. The nurse, who had tended me from infancy, was speared by two ruffians as I clung to her, adding my cries to hers, and 1 was covered with her blood. Child as I was, this outrage roused my puny wrath, iind, drawing the little dagger which was thrust into my girdle, I dashed it against one of the murderers, who instantly raised his spear with an oath, and would have pinned me to the ground, hut his companion struck the weapon aside with his sword, crying : " Hold, hold ! harm not the child! He is a brave fellow, and 1 shall keep him to attend upon my little Selim." ' In the mean time others seized my mother, who only thought of protecting her younger children ; but they tore them from her arms, and throwing them screaming upon the slaughtered bodies of her servants, hurried her along with all the younger females beyond the walls of the fort. According to their custom on such occasions, they carefully forbore to encumber their retreat with any whose old age, or extreme youth, might retard them on the march, or who were not likely to fetch a high price as slaves *. all such they mercilessly slaughtered ; and, as they dragtzed us along, we could see the work of death going on : we heard the shrieks, and trod on the mangled remains of our friends and relatives.' At length the pillage is completed, and the troop retire with their prisoners to the headquarters of the tribe, the camp of liydcr Beg, in the sandy desert nigh the banks of the Oxus. Mere he i* presented as a companion to Selim, the young .-on of one of the principal chieftains, and becomes ('oniestica'ied in his family. This gives *copc for the introduction of some splendid sketches ol' tho life and manners of thc tribe, and by far thc finest episode in the work, the tale of thc Kuzzilhash's love for Shirccn, thc daughter of his lord. We regret, however, that the sketches arc loo diffuse,and the talc too long for transcription in our pages : but thc following lively picture of the preparation for an attack upon ti neitrhbouring tribe, will give a good idea of thc author's spirited and graphic style. ' When the news of this disaster reached our camp, it filled every vine with horror and with rage. The ferment was dreadful; vows of vengeance were succeeded by the nio.?t energetic preparations. The elders met in council, while the rest got in readiness for the expedition, which they could not doubt would be decided on ; for the feelings of hatred and rage were too deep and universal to leave any chance of moderate, far less of pacific councils. Orders were immediately issued for every man able to carry anns to prepare for marching ; expresses bearing a like import were dispatched to all the camps in thc neighbourhood; and within six hours after thc arrival of the intelligence, three hundred men, well mounted and armed, with provisions for eight days, awaited but the signal to leave the camp.' ? Here all was eargerness and bustle. The men were buckling on the harness of their steeds, which were neighing, kicking, and jawing the ground with impatience. < fne was still busy fitting a spear-head to its (?haft; another cramming an extra number of arrows into bis quiver ; some were binding up the scanty supply of barley cakes, and grape-treacle,* or dried cheese, that was to support themselves and their horses upon the march ; others putting on such pieces of mail as they possessed, or adapting their dress to the purpose* of active exertion and sufficient defence from cold. But the greater number, already equipped, stood by their steed*, or were seated io the saddle, cursing the tediousness of those whose incomplete preparations ?till detail ed them. 4 Around and a moog the troops, the women moved hurriedly about, dealing out the necessaries of accoutre?tents or provision to their husbands, their sons, or their brothers. Most of the females, well-accustomed to such occasions, performed these offices quietly, as matters of course. But there were others, whose pale laces and uncertain steps betrayed their terror and anxiety, and proclaimed that they were agitated by newly awakened interest* of the tenderest nature for some among the hand. ' At length tlie whole, mounted and arrayed, awaited but the signal for moving. Many a gallant army have 1 seen since then, and 1 have fought in many a desperate field, brightened with victory or saddened by defeat ; but though these may fade from my memory or leave but confused recollections behind, 1 never can forget this day, when the career of military adventure was first opened to my view, bringing along with it the hope of freedom, and honour, and rapid advancement. As 1 vaulted on tlie gallant horse which my patron had provided for me, 1 felt as if the u hole Desert around was too confined for my course, and it required all my powers of forbearance to control the exuberance of my spirits, and withhold me from giving spurs to my steed and bounding headlong onward. The wise may smile at my boyish extravagance, but they will forgive it: 1 was but sixteen, and felt myself enrolled among men for the first time, armed and mounted for manly duty.' Ismael returns with the victors after the affray, carrying off with him a young female of thc hostile tribe, whom he designs as a present for Shireen. The remainder of the volume is occupied with his adventures in this his first love affair, which terminates in a very unpleasant denouement, and thc Kuzzilbash is forced to fly from the camp of Turcomans, leaving the erring Shireen to the mercy of her father. In a previous passage wc are introduced to Nadir Shah, the most important personage in the volumes. ' Meantime, mir revived feud with the F.ersanees kept us constantly upon the alert. F.ager to revenge our successful expedition against their camps, several attempts at surprise-* were made by them ; but though some blood was shed, ;ind some cattle were plundered on both sides, no derided advantage was '.ramed *. and tin' chief effect produced was the | rcventing either I tribe from undertaking iv-ie'luion**, as usual, against the Kii/./tlba.altes, or the Koords of 1'ersian Khorasan. ' In the coarse of time, however, both parties, wearied of this useless drain of strength and lo->s of time, as if bv mutual on-* nt, by degrees willingly desisted from hostilities, ant! turned their attention to more profitable enterpri-.es. Tl." northern pai t of Persian Khorasan was at this time in a stale of great cont..sion : divided among a multitude of petty chiefs, each al the head of a tribe, and possessing several strongholds and castles, with more or less territory attached to them, there was n constant struggle for superiority, attended with unceasing fra' s and bloodshed. Tliese chiefs, when unable to resist a powerful o] ponent, would frequently call in the aid of tue tribes of the Desert, who thereby reaped a rich harvest; for, independent of the stipulated price of their assistance, they never returned to their homes without ravaging some defenceless district on their way, and carrying thc inhabitants of such villages as tliey could seize, along with them into captivity. ' Among these border chiefs, Nadir Koolee Beg at this time held a conspicuous place. He was an Affshar, of no high rank, born in a village of Dereguz, and had raised himself by a fearless intrepidity, united to a sound judgment, to be one of the most redoubted lenders of this turbulent province. .Many and very contradictory accounts were given of his early career; and there can be little doubt, that, born as he was in a country at all times harassed by feuds iind invasions, aud at a period when the whole of Persia had fallen into political and moral confusion, the young Nader Koolee followed the fashion of the times, and took advantage of th. opportunities afforded hiui by Providence, as well as o: the powers of his own mind, to ameliorate his condition, and to raise his fortune to the level of his lofty and ambitious desires, lt is very probable that, in the course of this career, he may have committed acts which cannot be justified, if brought to the test of strict morality. But who was there, among all his countrymen, guiltless of suth deeds ? who was there, among the chiefs and nobles of that day, not only in Khorasan, but in all Persia, who hud not, in selfdefence, been forced to shed the blood of his kindred ? These were the days when the band of the father was against the son, and that of the nephew against the uncle ; when brothers were open or secret foes ; when the cup of the mother was not safe from the poisonous drugs of the daughter; and when even the husband dared not to trust the wife of his bosom ;?how was it poss ble, in such times, to distinguish the crimes which had their source in ambition, from those which were per| etrated in self-defence ? ' It is to the camp of this celebrated chief that Ismael now betakes himself, mid the first volume closes with his reception by the hardy warrior, and the siege and capture of Mushed. From a sketch of the luxuries of the conquered city, we subjoin the picture of an Oriental bath. 4 Another species of luxury to which I had hitherto been comparatively a stranger, was that of the baths, which were the constant resort of our idle youth, and which I now very regularly attended, for the sake of pleasant society as well as for personal enjoyment. ' I had not before suspected that these public conveniences were attended, not merely for purposes of health, cleanliness, and comfort, but as a lounge, where people met to hear the news and gossip of the day. There, early in the morning, might be found the grave Moolluh, emerged from his cold-vaulted outauglt I (chamber) in the Medressah, glad to come and repeat ' his prayers in an atmosphere of comfortable warmth ; the drunken debauchee, staggering in to get rid of his racking headache by sleep or perspiration ; the merchant, who left his caravanserai in hopes of meeting others of his trade, and perhaps of driving a good bargain -, or the newly arrived pilgrim, importing all the news only a twelvemonth old from Sheerauz, Kerinanshah, or Tabreex.?The soldier would tell of his battles and speculate on the great Nadir's next movement; whilst the young rakes would boast of their intrigues, or invent lies to make plain men stare. 4 In the spacious vault of the Huriumuims, half lighted by a fnw wretched lamps struggling for life with the moist misty vapours of the steaming reservoirs ; as the eye became accustomed to the thick obscurity, one might gradually perceive sundry groups and single figures, naked to a strip of cloth around the middle, and in a strange variety of attitudes. Some having happily undergone tho full operation, seated iu conversation, enjoying the enlivening fumes of the calleeoon ; some who, to a stranger, might seem to be undergoing the torture extraordinary, stretched upon their backs, while attendant familiars kneeling by them, or bestriding their bodies, rubbed, kneaded, or twisted them in the most outrageous fashion, milking their limbs resound with cracking of their joints, and the slaps which every now and then they bestowed on them. Others, again, undergoing the serious operation of having their beard and nails dyed; the former black, the latter ot ange colour. These are forced to lie still'upon their backs for at least three hours, having their beards, eyebrows, bands, and feet covered with poultices ol' pounded indigo or binna leaves, and never daring to move a muscle all that time, for fear of spoiling the whole operation. All such sights, to a stranger like nie, wi re full of interest; and though the novelty soon wore off, the other attractions of the place became strengthened by custom, and few days passed without my paying a visit to one of the best-frequented Hummauras.' Now follow long 6tories of revelry and love; they are neither so vicious nor so varied as the adventures of Anastasius, but still possess a world of interest. Herc, too, the author meets with thc 4 young merchant,' whose wanderings and exploits form the third part of the book, and the supplementary talc wc have alluded to. The scene then changes from Mushed to the anny, and N?.;;!;?? is about setting forward on a distant expedition. 4 On the night before tlie camp broke up, I was posted on a tuppeh, or hillock, on the right, which commanded a view of the whole extended encampment. Beneath nie, on the plain, lay scattered the tents of the army, white, and glittering in the moonshine. Many a dusky mass might be discerned among them, which imagination might shape into bodies of men and horses still in the attitudes of profound repose. The only sounds that arose on the still, culm air, were from the tinkling of the mule and camel bells, the neigh of a horse, or the faint clash of arms from a sentry, as he walked up aud down at his post, or when one of the horses, kept ready harnessed for use, .*liook his bridle-chains, or the mace or scymitar that lniuu at his saddle-bow, as he pawed and stamped wi'd impatience. 4 Presently the first dubious tinge of ('.au n stole over the East, and the quick rattle of a druin caine rolling on the stilne-ss of morning, lt was answered from many quarters, and in less than Inc inintites after, a murmur might he hean), whit li increased like the buzz of a swarming hive of bees, and au ob>ciu*e movement could be detected in the plain. Tin* cin'iers of the fires which had been sintered to die out, were now shook into life, and threw a red ami tl it Uering glare on the objects around. The t>-nr- vi h.di dotted the plain began one by one to fall ami d-am-ear ; and as the pale iind orange light mose in Hm *-!?.-, t!*e glimmer of arms, the Hash of helmets, o'" -ut,ul-, ai.d lance-points, broke from the dusky m.a-siv t"u;it formed on the ground where they sto.nl. le a lillie. time, I could distinguish the different ct.,; * laaainrr into their several divisions, while the lauir.i io,iou irs and baggage-cattle drew off by degrees, and formed into masses distinct from the fighting nun. lt was ;?, splendid sight. The morning was brilliant, and a heavy dew had lent a freshness to the early dawn, whiih Urfierce heat of the season denied to the later hours of (lay. The Shah soon issued forth from the extensive royal inclosure of crimson serpurdchs, preceded by multitudes of Shatirs and Punishes, ami s'-rroiualed by a splendid attendance of officers and gholaiims, all glittering in magnificent dresses, and mounted on beautiful horses. The appearance of his Highness's suite was less gorgeous ; there was no exhibition of finery either on his own dress or on that ol' his attendants; but the purpose-like, thoroughly wellarmed and mounted band that mustered around him, were composed of men whose weather-beaten aspect betokened hard service, as their steady and composed expression proclaimed unshaken resolution and devotion to their chief. 4 Such was the character of the army with which the hitherto successful and victorious Nadir inarched from Subzawar to meet the usurper Ashruit", and drive his cruel marauding Affghauus from the fair plains of Irak *. and it was with a glow ol* no common entliu*iasiii that 1 beheld them file olf, corps Ly co.* s, from their eiicainping-gro'.in.l, and oci |.y, ia am *. i-\;eiule*.l Columns, the road which leads to Mu/ ..ai.i..

We cannot conclude this hasty notice without siunuiiug up our brief opinion, that the book contains u vast fund of information, united to a copious spring of amusement. Wv shall look anxiously for its continuation, ami should it equal thc present specimen, wc have no hesitation in predicting their joint and lasting popularity.

They that Sit in Darkness. By John Mackie. (Hutchinson & Co.) The young Hterature of AustraHa is indebted to Mr. Mackie for a tale which, while it abounds in local colour from the authoritative brush of one who, as he puts it in the preface, " figured in a humble way as a pioneer of civiHsation " in the wilds of the northern continent, is also thrilHng enough for any boy's book. What more can one ask in the way of peril and adventure than to have half-a-dozen whites, including ladies, besieged in a cave by as many hundred blacks; furious onslaughts repulsed with terrible slaughter; provisions raided, and ammunition stolen; a thrilHng climb up an impossible cHff, and, eventually, a rescue in the very nick of time ? But it would be a grave injustice to class Mr. Mackie's book as merely sensational. The other interests of it are weU maintained; and one may safely say that no more accurate picture has been presented of bush life in wnat is probably the most grotesque corner of the world. The writer knows it weU?better, probably, than most people would care to do ; he teUs us that he has subsisted for weeks together "on crows, hawks, snakes, and currajong roots." He has a pleasant and graphic pen, and the description of the trial-scene in MacArthur is a very telling piece of work. The characterisation, too, is much above the ordinary run of " bush " novels. The heroine suffers from the usual tendency of Australian heroines to excessive versatility, but she is so genuine a girl that one need not carp at her prowess with the stock-whip and her astuteness as a detective.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGHWN"AYS AND BYWAYS IN DEVON AND CORNWALL. By ARTHUR H. NORWAY. With illustrations by JOSEPH PENNELL and HUGH THOMSON. (Macmillan.) This is at once a history, an itinerary, a manual of folk-lore, and a general gossipping chronicle of the two counties. It concerns itself with old times and new times, with manners and romance, with politics and witches, architecture and wreckers, hagiology and modern anecdote. It is in no sense a got-up book. Mr. Norway is a lover of the West Country, who has sucked in its colour, its characteristics, its superstitions, and who happens also to be a writer with a brisk and pleasant style. His book is so good that it appeals to the native Devon or Cornish man, not merely to the easily satisfied stranger. It is entitled to be examined on its own merits, It is no mere peg for the illustrator's delightful sketches. These are first-rate. The collaboration of the two artists, each with a style so markedly his own, has proved very happy. Mr. Thomson supplies the pictures of manners, of course; Mr. Pennell those of places. (For illustration see p. 74.) from" IN ighwmas and BJyways in Devon and Cornwall." (Macmillan.) (See p. 94.)

at Jhmvarlick; or, Round about the Bush. By David Macrae. (Glasgow Scottish Temperance League.) In the advertisement pre6xed to this work, we are desired to notice, that " the directors ofthe Scottish Temperance League having offered a prize of 2501. for the best, and a prize of 1002. for the second best temperance tales, and having attentively examined the whole manuscripts forwarded in answer to the advertisements, being ninety-nine in number, ?the second prize waa adjudged to the tale called ' Dunvarlick; or, Round about the Bush.'" We feel sorry for the gentlemen who had to read ninety-seven stories which were all worse than the one that obtained the second prize. ' Dunvarlick' is a nonsensical, sensational, ill-contrived story; full of very coarse fine writing and vulgar efforts at being facetious. A drunken railway enginedriver is the chief drunkard, who being almost reformed, having taken a twelvemonths' lease of total abstinence, relapses in the interim of renewing his pledge, and causes a fearful railway accident whilst in a state of intoxication. The collision, however, causes the death of the villain-in chief, and delivers the heroine from a very unpleasant dilemma. If teetotalism or temperance requires abstinence from fermented liquor, it ought to carry its provisions a little further, and prohibit foolish sensational novels to its own contributors.

At all Libraries. BY MRS. J. H. NEEDELL. PASSING THE LOVE OF WOMEN. By the AUTHOR of 'STEPHEN ELLICOTTS DAUGHTER,' &c. In 3 vols, cloth. Saturday Review (Nov. 5, 1892):?" The remarkable popular success gained by Mrs. Needell's last novel, * Stephen EUicott's Daughter,' naturally draws attention to that following by the same hand. ' Passing the Lovo of Women' will, we believe, enhance the reputation of the author. It is better and more closely constructed than its predecessor, the characters are more varied, if not more vigorously drawn, and the plot is at once more ingenious and simple. The portrait of Margery Denison is presented in her brilliant beauty, her gay humour, her lively talk, her tender caprice, in a way that justifies the worship offered by her two adorers. Not all tellers of stories can so explain their Queens of Society. The tone of the novel is elevated, but not didactic. It is interesting from the first page to the last." Gentlewoman :?" ' Passing the Love of Women' will add to the reputation of the authoress; the practised hand is discernible throughout. It is a treat to find a book in which everything is not subordinated to the love interest. Mrs. Needell's latest is far above its fellows." Covrt Circular:?"Mrs. Needell's story is ?not only interesting, but is told with a charm and dignity of expression that are extremely rare, and it ranks among the best books of the season." Liverpool Mercury :?" In speaking of this 3tory it is difficult to avoid superlatives, for it is elevated in character, rich in novel situations, is full of contrasts, and possesses the charm of conversational ability in a very high degree. From the first chapter to the Inst the interest never flags, the unexpected happens, and everybody is pleased, the reader not excepted."

George Canterbury's Will.
Wood, Ellen
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although Mrs. H. Wood possesses, in a certain degree, the power of riveting her reader's attention, she presumes on this power too far in her present novel. Had she contented herself with two volumes instead of the orthodox three, we should have been spared much useless reiteration, and need not have perused long chapters of conversations, which, though rather pleasantly written, are not by any means essential to the working out of the tale. Notwithstanding this defect, the book is, on the whole, up to the author's usual standard, meriting general but not particular or peculiar praise. The plot, however, is not striking, and may be said to display a weakness of design not usually attributable to Mrs. H. Wood's works. When we have said that an old man makes an unjust will, leaving his daughters by his first marriage almost unprovided for, in order to aggrandize his second wife and her only son, and that this second wife, soon after the old man's death, takes unto herself a second but not a better husband, who poisons this only son for the sake of the money that then accrues to the mother, we have unfolded the whole story. There are, of course, some minor collateral circumstances which concern the loves and lives of the poor daughters and a certain young barrister of preternatural goodness; but the pith of the novel is what we have mentioned above. It will be seen that this is not a promising subject; and, although Mrs. Wood does her best, it is not surprising she has not made anything exciting out of it. We may mention as a particular fault the number of death-beds and funerals we are called upon, in our capacity of reader, to attend. No less than six of the principal characters die, and their deaths are described in detail; while several outsiders die during the progress of the tale, whose departures from this world of woe are alluded to in general terms, without being honoured by any special mark of attention. This imparts a gloomy sentimentality to the book that, in the opinion of most people, will considerably detract from its merits; for, although the gloominess may possibly infect a simple mind with a gentle feeling of not unpleasant melancholy, its only effect on a more mature understanding is weariness coupled with derision. If, however, we forgive this too frequent intrusion of "the silent tomb," we cannot pass over the fate of Capt. Daukes, the poisoner of the tale, without the very strongest protestations. To our unmitigated and unspeakable horror, in a novelistic point of view, we find that this murderer is allowed to go unpunished, except by the paltry prickings of his conscience. Is the author aware of the enormous crime she is perpetrating in thus taking away from tall orthodox novelreaders their fondest hope and belief that condign punishment shall always be inflicted on the wicked, and that death is the well-established form of punishment for all offences except flirtation; and even for that crime if not committed "with extenuating circumstances." We are sure that, on reflection, Mrs. H. Wood will repent of having in this instance departed from the usual administration of fictional justice, and will not repeat the offence. In conclusion, we may remark that there are touches of nature here and there which are real and agreeable, and we have no doubt that ' George Canterbury's Will' will take a good place among the novels of the day, and obtain what we trust may prove a not unremunerative popularity.

A Dangerous Guest.
Jackson, Henry
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is difficult to refrain from using the very strongest permissible forms of condemnation when reviewing ' A Dangerous Guest.' It is a most irritating book. To say the tale is a shallow one, is to be guilty of making a too favourable remark concerning it. There is positively nothing in it, and that nothing is told in as dull a way as it could be told. A book of this kind wastes the time of the unsuspecting public and, still more, of the patient and long suffering reviewer; and if any member of either House is inclined to prevent cruelty to other animals besides dogs, horses and cats, he will try and obtain the prohibition of such novels.

Longleaf.
Lake, Elleray
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
'Longleaf' is a tale of considerable length, and its qualities are not very great. An Earl, of astounding wealth and still more astounding goodness, loves and is beloved by a lady of unsurpassable beauty, who once told a fib about riding a horse; and this is the only fault she has been guilty of. This lady, after the engagement, is discovered by the Earl to be illegitimate. Fancy the noble Earl's anguish! On the one hand, the most devoted affection, the gentlest nature, the loveliest form; on the other, the respect due to his ancestors and ta his revered mother. After a hard fight the "yeas" have it, and, contrary to the anticipation of the reader, the marriage ensues, and for a time all is peace. Then appears ripon the scene a bosom friend of the Earl, named Glen Ross. He is almost as good as the Earl; but, unfortunately for his reputation, he falls in love with the Earl's wife, and she, still more unfortunately for her reputation, falls in love with him, notwithstanding her former affection for her husband. After a brief interlude they run away, and the Earl, according to custom, has the usual brain-fever, and, equally according to custom, gets well again. The wicked pair lead a happy life for a time; but the lady, fiuding that her companionship is too much for her fond lover, quits him, and is shipwrecked on the voyage and drowned. Glen Ross shortly afterwards perishes, and the Earl, at the close of the book, has a second marriage before him, in which we wish him every happiness. This tale is, of course, unnatural; but its principal faults are the way in which it is dragged out and the childlike style of narration adopted by the author, who is evidently a lady. The author too has adopted most of the commonest faults of fourth-rate novelists. A perpetual reiteration of "Little he thought as he spoke these words of what was to happen," " These words were remembered at another time, when," ic, annoys a reader, as being such an infantile and worn-out method of gaining for the author interest and attention. Another trick is the perpetual insertion of moral reflections which are most painfully dull in nature—the merest platitudes, fit only for children's copybooks, and only used nowadays in the pulpit. Making allowances for these faults, we can still give the book a certain amount of praise. The author has evidently taken great pains, and writes very easily, with perhaps cn over-tendency to poetry and quotation; and, on the whole, the book is readable, and up to thcusual level of the novels of the day.

Margarita, or the Queen of Night.
anonymous
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The curate and the barber of a coming ago will, without doubt, deal with the sensational literature of our time as their prototypes dealt with that of Don Quixote. The so-called sensational seed, scattered far and wide by the literary birds of prey of the period, has germinated in Spain, bearing such fruit as 'Margarita; or the Queen of Night.' Spanish critics write it down, and are sanguine that this seed has fallen upon stony ground. Yet the Madrid and provincial presses continually issue translations of the most objectionable Parisian literature, and we fear, however, that the supply is simply consequent upon the demand. The ' Novelas Ejemplares,' if not ' Don Quixote,' were a protest against the tendency which resulted in that predominating influence of French literature, and which destroyed Spanish originality?an influence that has continued with more or less force until this present hour. Take ' The Castle of Otranto,' 'TheMysteries of Udolpho,'Monk Lewis Bowdlerized, season them with French sensation, and serve them up with spasmodic diction, and you have the ground-plan of ' Margarita.' Love, madness, murder, arson?man's perfidy and woman's weakness, intrigue, one and all are pressed into the service of this story. The hero, a poet and rich, visits a Madrid theatre. The Queen of Night, with natural auricamus hair, a faultless form, blue eyes and a brilliant complexion, winks, and he enters her box. She returns with him to his apartments and recounts her history, which occupies the whole night in the telling, and when morning dawns she goes home in the poet's carriage. His friend, a blase individual, who has not acted at all as a gentleman should, to another lady with whom our hero becomes acquainted in the moonlight near the Prado, marries the other lady, who will see him no more. He dies abroad, a filibuster. Margarita dies, our hero goes mad, and becomes sane just twenty-four months to the day after Margarita's death. The other lady, having meanwhile buried her husband, returns to the world (just twelve months to the day), marries the hero, and so end* the story. Why Viscount Follington, who is evidently master of the Spanish language, should have chosen to translate such an un-Spanish, silly, and rather objectionable story as this, when many characteristic and clever novels by Fenian Caballero and others remain unknown to the English reader, is a mystery to us. We have not seen the original, but is it not incorrect to term it the joint work of Messrs. Fernandez and Gonzalez?the author being Senor Fernandez y Gonzalez ? This is, however, of little importance, a* we fancy thi* very story will make no impression upon the English public, which is already weary of the sensation novel at home.

For Richer, for Poorer.
Lee, Holme
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quiet, good, and nice, if we may use such a word, the novel 'For Richer, for Poorer,' by Holme Lee, is precisely the sort of book that might be expected from the author of ' Sylvan Holt's Daughter' and ' Basil Godfrey's Caprice.' It is the story of a young clergyman of abilities, but precarious health, who goes through many struggles with an attached wife; but, at last, finds himself blest by fortune, and may reasonably be expected to " live happily ever after." If we were hypercritical enough to wish to find a fault in such a book, we might perhaps remark that the Rev. Harry Laniplugh's ultimate success in life would have pleased us more if it had been in some degree referable to his own exertions, instead of arising from the caprice of a rich relation. But perhaps, after all, the author is right. We cannot always trace our success in life immediately to our own acts. If a man does his duty in the place to which he is called, it is well; and, although the will of Harry's uncle - or, rather, the fact of his not executing a subsequent will - seems to be the result of accident, it may be argued, on the other hand, that the old gentleman's wayward mind was filled with a sense of his discarded nephew's consistent integrity, and that his new will was left incomplete from day to day because he had not the courage to disinherit the good young clergyman who had unintentionally offended him. In the course of the story we are introduced to a good many characters that are true to the ordinary experience of every-day life. Equally true are the descriptions of the little inland town, with its microscopic squabbles, jealousies, and cliques, where Mr. Lamplugh commences his career as head master of the local grammarschool, and the miniature sea-coast community ?a cross between a rural parish and a fashionable watering-place, where ho begins life again as a curate, and fails to obtain the incumbency of the new church because he is too good and quiet, while the other candidate is more fluent and grasping. Such scenes and places and people the author has fairly made her own, and portrays with the facility which can only be acquired by genuine experience and observation. The family complications, which form the inner plot of the story, are ingeniously devised, and the play of feeling is well kept up; so that we realize a sort of intimacy with the principal personages of the story. * For Richer, for Poorer' is not a novel of thrilling interest; but most people who take it up will read it with pleasure, and those who delight in domestic scenes will accord to it still higher praise.

' Estelle Russell' is a novel which leads the reader to hope that another work by the same hand may be forthcoming in due time. The author, without exhibiting extraordinary brilliancy, shows that he (or she) possesses in combination a certain set of qualifications which are not usually met with in the novel-writers of the day. This book, containing a large quantity of matter, but squeezed, by the judicious use of small print, into two volumes of ordinary size, will certainly be read without weariness, for the reader will find as he goes on that his interest is always kept up by something in the way of character or description or incident. A novel written in this way affords good promise; for it is clear that the author does not rely solely on one particular element of amusement (as incident, for instance) ; but that he is studying simultaneously the various means by which an interesting story can be constructed, and that he will avoid a prevalent weakness of the present day, namely, that of writing and publishing a novel depending merely on character, merely on description, or merely on incident. Upon the whole, though the various ingredients are judiciously intermixed, 'Estelle Russell' relies mainly on character; but the art of the author is shown in this, that the various important personages are neither guided throughout by their innate perceptions, nor drifted to and fro by every breath of outward influence; their difficulties and troubles arise from the genuine conflict between their natural strength and energy and the obstacles that are opposed to their intentions by the force of circumstances and the machinations of designing individuals. The scene is laid, to a great extent, in the South of France, where Estelle and her widowed mother are living. Mrs. Russell (or "Madame Rous- sell," as she is called by her French neighbours), is as designing a mother in the way of matchmaking as can possibly be imagined. The French families in the country around are quite as designing in their way; and while Mrs. Russell is anxious to "marry her daughter," a certain French Countess, her neighbour, is equally anxious to "etablir son fils." The contrast between the French and the English systems of match-making is seized upon by the author, and exhibited with much humour and spirit. It is perfectly charming to hear Mrs. Russell say, " You understand that I never could force her inclinations," and to hear a French mother reply, " There is nothing more dangerous than a marriage of inclination." There is true comedy in this; for it must be understood that Mrs. Russell intends to coerce her daughter by every kind of domestic tyranny, while at the same time she saves her character as an English mother by repudiating the continental principles, and professing to allow the young lady full liberty of choice. The author is evidently of opinion that the manage de convenance is not purely a French institution, though the principle of such marriages may be more openly acknowledged in France than among ourselves. With the true instinct of an English novelist, the author brings the forced marriage to a happy end at last, yet we cannot help thinking that probability is violated. It is scarcely likely that Estelle could retain her affection for her original lover for several years after both are married to other people, and then, after his death, by a sudden accident, become attached to the husband whose caresses she could scarcely endure during the early period of their union. Truth and propriety would have been better satisfied by recognizing the fact that Estelle and her husband could never really love, but might endure one another by a virtuous effort while young, and become Platonic friends in their old age. Apart from this point, however, we have little fault to find with a book which, upon the whole, is one of real merit. The French interiors that are sketched by the author will be new and interesting to most English readers, as will also be the unctuous demeanour of the Protestant pasteur, a little Pope in his own limited circle in Languedoc, and scarcely less arbitrary a pontiff than the genuine Popes of Rome, whom Protestants are taught to dread. The humour of these descriptions must be admitted by readers of all creeds to be spontaneous and readily appreciated.

FINE ARTS Mly Recollections and Reflections. ., By I Yoshio Markino. (Chatto & Windus.) XWE are becoming familiar with the peculiar imitation of the English language employed by Mr. Markino in his books, which, at first attractive, is now growing wearisome. His latest work, -which deals in the main with serious questions, suffers considerably from this hybrid dialect, where such words as " poetries " and " sceneries" occur repeatedly, and syntax is violated at every turn. Mr. Markino tells us that an English lady is kind enough to read his proofs, and we think it unfortunate that she has not made more corrections. To take an example at random, the sentence on p. 198, "There are quite many who mix up the sacred love with the dirty passion, and they go on to the extreme vulgarity," might have been revised with advantage. Again, the translations from the Japanese dramatists which occur in the chapter entitled 'My Thoughts about the Drama' entirely fail to convey the effect of literature when we get a tragic figure saying at a supreme moment:"This is not the place for the woman. You shall keep yourself silent. Now, Tosabu, whether you will kill me or I kill you, all depends upon the Heaven's will. Speak no more but duel, duel." Here, at least, the Japanese artist's attempt to create a personal style in English should have been temporarily abandoned and the service of his English friend called in. As for the content of the work, we do not find MNr. Markino's recollections very interesting or his reflections particularly profound. He has attempted to become a European, and we fear that he has fallen between two stools. He can in no sense be said to represent the Oriental outlook, and he appears to have failed to grasp the spirit of art and thought in the West. The most pleasant portion of the book is that devoted to his friend Hara, the Japanese artist whose death lie laments so sympathetically, and there is something attractive about the artst's childish delight in his new studio; but lie tells the reader so often that lie has no business capacity, and makes so many protestations of naivete, that our suspicions are aroused in spite of ourselves. The chapter called 'The Human Insincerity' evinces little real thought, and that devoted to 'PostImpressionists and Others' shows an astonishing lack of intuition on the part of an artist acquainted with the Oriental tradition. He confuses Post-Impressionists and Impressionists, and divides these artists into five classes-" Humbug, Degenerate, Lunatic, Eccentric, and Genius " (p. 208) ; and on p. 212 he says: " Now I put my question to the so-called Impressionists: 'Are they really not semiinsincere or semi-fool ? ' " This is perilously near impertinence. I It is difficult to judge of the original water-colours from the highly coloured reproductions of Mr. Markino's work which decorate the book. Here again the artist seems to stand between two traditions. He cannot suggest with the synthetic dexterity of the Oriental, or depict with the intense completeness of a Western master. His sketch of Darwin Tulips, for example, on p. 14, does not convey to us the exquisite texture and rare colour of these flawless flowers, and the arrangement of the drawing is uninteresting.

THE BAITLE OF THE STRONG. A Romance of Two Kiuos. By Giltert Parker. 6.. (llethuen.) Something of Mr. Parker's wonted jaunty air has disappeared. A ponderousness, most unusual in his work, weighs down twothirds, at least, of this story. But the reading of "' The Battle of the Strong" is not all disappointment. The plot is interesting, and the characters, even the heroine, far from tame. To Jersey folks the tale will especially appeal. Jersey dialect. Jersey landscape, old Jersey customs are made abundant use of. But to readers outside the island this insistence on local colour will seem to be at the root of the book's failure to attract as do the rest of Mr. Parker's. The local customs and folk-lore and dialect of Canada he has not laboriously - got up "-hence the lightness and liveliness of the Pretty Pierre stories. But the slow, heavy hand of the industrious new learner is evident in this story of Jersey in the days of the French Revolution. It is full of stirring incident, however, and sets forth most impressively the staunch loyalty to England amongst folk who had frequent and easy intercourse with France, the country of their fathers, in days that tested loyalty.

32   8450468   German Love, from the Papers of an Alien.
Feb 20, 1858  ENGLISH LITERATURE - History and Criticism - 19th Century
Examiner  : 2612 117 - 117
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
German Love, from the Papers of an Alien. Translated by Susanna Winkworth. Chapman and Hall. All the world knows, that, when the dominion of the world was divided, England got the sea and France the land, and to Germany was assigned the air. Neither England nor France have been so true to their charge as Germany. America meets us on our element, and France has been beaten on hers. Germany is still monarch of the mist, unrivalled and unapproached. Very characteristic is this "' German Love." It is airy and ideal, craving nothing substantial, hoping nothing visible. It is the attachment of a sentimental boy to a sick princess, whom he worships with the worship of a Catholic devotee,' and whom, nevertheless, he pounds with the hammer of argument, as if he were a Protestant divine. He is never so happy as when sitting by her couch. He never sits by her couch without talking transcendental things. And so he would sit and talk for ever; but alas! the prying, scandalloving world forbids. He goes, therefore, seeking rest and finding none, among the mountains of Tyrol. But to those mountains of Tyrol his sick love also betakes herself for the recruiting of her health, and so again they meet. The youth now for the first time mingles a faint human passion with ethereal love, and the princess, torn by a thousand fresh hopes and agonies, dies in assenting to his earthly aspiration. No doubt the story, as a story, may be condemned easily enough. "German Love " is not English love, and we can ill sympathise with a lover sick of mind, who dreams over a princess sick of mind and body too. But let us put aside the story and observe the thoughts contained in it. There is much fine criticism and rich imagery in the book, but its, great charm lies in the expression of the central thought, that deeper and stronger than the love, which is but mortal, is that love whose springs are not earthly, and which lives for ever. All human love is a flame kindled by the two! torches of Eros and of Anteros; but the fire of the one fades into ashes, while the fire of the other will outburn the stars. And this, which is the object of this little book, is a very worthy and noble thought; it only misses its full force by the setting of the story. Heavenly love all unalloyed is not even found in Germany, and few are the lovers whose food is is Theologica Germanica," and the didactic poems of Wordsworth or of Arnold. But let us not deny full justice to the German Lover. He would tell us that the love he advocates is on its earthly side more practical than that which we profess. Why, he I demands, are you men and women "strangers" to each other ? Why cannot a man love,--ay love,-a woman, without raising up in the act a whole cloud of shames and blushes aid talk about marriage ? Is there to be no lovel between the sexes PMr an %wt which Wordsworth deelared tht he felt for his Hiqhlmd Mary ? urely it w nota o in the dars when men Qad wOen bhad not become morbid (as you English and Fronch ar), and could speak naively, and feel simply, pure and ostural emotions. "It must have been otherwise in old times, els, how could Holuer have erested the levely, heilthy, delicate character of a Nausicaa I Nausies loves Ulysses at firt ight, aid says so on the spot to her companions: 'Ob, that such a man were called my husband, aid that it pleased him to abide here I ' Yet she is ashamed to be meen together with him in the city, and tells him frankly that if Fbe were to bring bome with her sucb a stately, handsome stranger, the people would say she had been to fetch a husband. How simple and natural is all this! And when she hears that he wishes to retuin to his own land, to his wife ad child, no lament escapes her; she vanishe, from our eight, and we feel that sihe will long carry the image ot the stately, handsome stranger in her heart, with silent, joyful admiration. Why is it that our poets know nothing of this love, this glad confessing, and this caIm parting? A modern poet would have made of Nausicas a feminine Wertber. But this is because love is to us no longer anything but a prologue to the coruedy or tragedy of narriage. I there rell' lio other i.ve left aow-a-days ? Is the fountain of this pure happiness quite dried up! Is love nol longer known as a refreshing spring, but only as au intoxicatihlgg draught?" Her word. reminded me of the English poet, who in like manner comlplains " From Heaven if this belief be sent, If such be Nature's holy plan, Have I not reason to lament What ruan has made of man ?"

EIGHTEENTH CENTURY LITERATURE. A Histor cf Eighteenth Century Literature (/66o-iySo;. By Ehmi'Mi Gt issi-., M.A. London and New York: Macmillan and Co. 'Po write a history of English literature between t66o and i 780 w ithin the compass of 400 pages is a task of no little difficulty ; but Mr. Gosse has accomplished it, and that excellently well. His book is full of facts, yet never dull; concise, yet never meagre. It abounds in criticism which is at once penetrating and brilliant ; yet there is no ' line writing.' Above all, his view of the subject, though embracing many details, is never distorted. Every figure appears in its right place, and is placed before us in its true proportions. While we may dissent from ? me or two of Mr. Gosse's opinions about this or that writer, it is impossible not to be struck with the insight and accuracy which mark his general survey of what is conveniently known as * eighteenth century literature.' The opinion may be safely hazarded that, while no period of our literature contains more of those books which no gentleman's library should be without, no period is so much neglected by the average man of decent education. He knows the names of the writers : in his youth he has possibly been obliged to read some of Pope, and some of Johnson ; it will be strange if he has not translated more than one Spectator into Latin prose ; and he is probably familiar with many lines from the A'/'X'r /// a Country Churchyard. He knows, too, well enough what is the right thing tobe said and thought about the writers of the Augustan and Georgian eras. But that is all. Let us hope that Mr. Gosse's book will do something to turn the hearts ofthe children to their fathers, and reopen for many of the present generation a fountain of unmixed delight. One of thc best chapters, perhaps, of Mr. Gosse's book is that devoted to the novelists. His account ofthe rise of the English novel, from the romances of the seventeenth century, through Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver's Travels> the Spectator anti the works of Marivaux, till it attained its proper form in Pamela and its successors, could scarcely bc improved upon. Wc are not sure that he appreciates fully the exquisite finish and beauty of Fielding's style ; but he scores an excellent point in remarking on thc contrast between the brutality of Smollett and thc conscious sentiment of Sterne, and in observing * how civilising a thing this conscious tenderness was in an age and country that were still in many ways brutally barbaric' (p. 271). On the other hand, it may bc doubted if the mctlkeval school of fiction begun by the Castle of Otranto really culminated in Sir Walter Scott. We should rather say that in Mrs. Radcliffe's novels, which may still be read with pleasure, it reached its highest level, sinking steadily thence into the depths of 1 he Monk, and expiring at last in the slough oi Melmoth thc Wanderer. Though it was not without its influence on the romantic mind of Scott, little, if any, trace of it is to bc found in Ivanhoe and the rest of his medkeval novels. With Mr. Gosses treatment of Dryden and Pope we have no quarrel; though we should call the latter thc most prominent literary man of the first forty years of the eighteenth century, rather than Swift. But wc think he does more than justice to Young and Collins, and a good deal less than justice to Thomson anti Gray. Thomson, Mr. Gosse admits, is the most original and influential poetic figure which exists between Pope anti Gray. That is the very least that can be said of him. Mr. Gosse does not take him seriously enough. Thomson, no doubt, partakes ofthe faults of his age. lie uses freely the set diction which is the characteristic note of so much ofthe verse of last century, and which is nowhere more curiously exemplified than in the Scotch Paraphrases. But, if he'could talk with the best of them of * plumy people' meaning birds), and bid us not let ' the tortur'd worm, convulsive, twist in agonising folds,' it was the same 'heavy silent little man' who could write like this : ' As yet the trembling year is uncont'irmM, And Winter oft at eve resumes the bret ve, (hills the pale morn, and bids his driving sleet-Deform the day delightless ; so that scarce The bittern knows his tinv, with bill ingulpht. To shake the sounding marsh ; or from tht- shu: The plovers when to scatter o'er the heath. And sing their wild notes to the listening wast--.' The truth is that Thomson was a master and inventor of style second only to Gray, whose pre-eminence in this respect Mr. Gosse acknowledges, and to whom he allows ' consummate attention to workmanship,' and ' the native faculty of a singularly delicate ear. Surely the author ofthe most touching as well as the most highly finished short poem in the language had something more than these. On the whole, the concluding chapter is the best in the book. We do not know where to look for a better review of the tendencies at work in the period which begins with the literary activity of Dryden, and closes with the death of I )r. Johnson. Poi some, that space of time must always have a singular attraction. It was during its course that English civilisation became conscious. With its sense of a 'politeness' superior to that of its predecessors, it has a superficial likeness to our own age with it< pet 'progress' in science and thought. In reality what a contrast ! What sanity, what good sense, what manliness in that age! What peevishness, what want of proportion, what childishness in ours ! But we fear thc gods will not show us such marvellous mercy and infinite love as to give us another Swift, who shall take a short way with our 'Polands anti Tindals, now such superior persons ; or create another like the Johnson who, in Mr. Gosse's admirable words, ' talked superb literature freely for thirty years, and all England listened ; he grew to be thc centre of literary opinion, anti he was so majestic in intellect, so honest in purpose, so kind and pure in heart, so full of humour and reasonable sweetness, and yet so trenchant and at need sm grim, that he never sank to be the figure-head of a clique, nor ever lost the balance of sympathy with readers of every rank and age.' Is not that good matter and good style ? 'lhere is an abundance of it in Mr. Gosse's book.

The Inqoldsby Legends. Annotated Edition. In Two Volumes. Richard Bentley. "Not less than four-and-twenty year have passed away," says the editor of these two volumes, the son of the author, " since a collection was made of the tales in prose and verse which had been published, chiefly in the pages of Bently's Mi8ellany, under the signature of Thomas Ingoldeby." During that time a new generation of readers has sprung up, on whom many of the allusions and sly sarcasms of the legends must be lost, seeing that the men and things referred to have in many asses been shut up in the irrevocable past, and are no longer familiar to us. Under these circumstances, it was a happy notion that suggested to the son of "Thomas Ingoldsby" an edition of his father's merry conceits, accompanied by such brief notes and explanations as might help the reader whQ comes to these ballads for the first time. Tho result we have before us; and we must complilwnt Mr Barhamn on the concise, sensible, and pertinent manner in which he has executed his task Even old admirers of the legends, who know many of them by heart, and are ever ready with a quotation, will find much to interest them in these notes There is also some new matter added, along with a chateristic frontispiece by George Cruikshank, representing " Thomas IDgoldsbg " sur. rounded by the various personages of the Legends.

The Puritan and Ahi Daughter. By J. K. PAvLDNoG, I author of " The Dutchman's Fireside.' In 2 vols. olf London: Delf. 1850. eta M1R. PAuWLDIG, an American author, is well known to Cal English novel readers by his extreuely clever fiction, iI T/he Dutchiman's Firetade, which has been reprinted hi, here in so naiiy chbeap formis. Probably it was the trc popularity won by that novel which induced him to an publish his latest work in this country, to secure WI tor it a copyright here, andI prevent the plunder to e which the former otl'sring of his braiLs was su'ojected co through the absence of an international copyright. The st1 two volumes before us will well eudure a comparison fo with the works of our I)vct English novelists. The to scene is laid in Awerica, in tib early days of the pil- ac griln fathers, when tirst they sought refuge on the ti shores of the New World from tile pvrsecutions of their sl. inhospitable father-land, little dreaming of the gigantic al nation that was to sprintr frotn theiir loins.

His ability is shown I; in the composition, which A) nods in passages of clever I nlld sparkling writing, sonietimnes highly poetical, at oit hers very liumorous, and Always raphic and dramnatic. T[le ultra-puritanms ot the time are sketched with somnethiig of a satirical lwn. but not untruthfully, for it would be hitlicult by any stretch of fatncy or caricature to exagge rate their fanaticism, their bigotry, and their tuncharitableness. The plot is inade out of the love of i r the only son of a proud cavalier settler for the daui-liter e of a stareih puritali, and we eatmot better exhibit Mr. IPAULIt:N(GS style anl cLoe our notice, than with his s portraits of THIE HEROINE AND TIlE HERM.

Outline Lecture on Herod*s Temple of the New Testa- ment. By W. Shaw Caldecott. With Photo-, graph of the Author's Model of the Temple. (C. H. Kelly, is.) Mr. Shaw Caldecott is one of the principal modern authorities on the Temples of Jerusalem. He has reconstructed all three of them as well as the Tabernacle of the Wilderness. His volumes dealing with each furnish clear pictures of their subject, elucidating the many obscure points to the satisfaction of his readers so long as they are not hypercritical. The author has already devoted a volume to Herod's Temple, to which all who find an attraction in that subject should have recourse. The lecture under notice is contained in a pamphlet of sixteen pages, and consists of skeleton notes on the same subject as that with which the larger volume deals. It is, however, enriched by a sketch, in black and gold, of the front elevation of the Temple as reconstructed by Mr. Caldecott, also a photograph of the author's own model of the Temple.

current literature. The Barbers Chair. By Douglas Jerrold. (London: Chatto & Windus.)?There is always a certain interest in the first of a large family, and therefore it was perhaps worth while to reprint The Barber's Chair in a collected form, because there have been so many attempts since to make current affairs amusing by trying to fancy how uneducated people would talk about them. Besides, Douglas Jerrold was a really . trenchant writer, while there is no evidence that he was capable of any thought too deep or too exact to pass without mutilation into a vulgar dialect. Short as the papers are, the machinery becomes tedious: Slowgoe threatens to leave the shop too often, and the strong-minded Mrs. Nutts impresses us with a belief that her creator wished ne could repeat his first success with Mrs. Caudle. The staple of the papers is an attempt to improve the current affairs of 1846 and 1847, with especial reference to the Spanish Marriages, the Equestrian Statue of the Duke of Wellington, and the Potato Famine, so as to teach the lower classes alternately to pity and despise the upper. Much of the wit is of the unpleasant sort which depends on a vehement assumption of belief in a religion which the author did not in the least understand, in order to disparage its professors or representatives by somewhat captious deductions from a somewhat arbitrary selection of its precepts. This is more obtrusive in the Hedgehog Letters, an earlier series, which deals largely with the surplice riots and the late Bishop of Exeter. It is every way inferior to The Barber's Chair, though the writing is quite smart enough to offer legitimate attractions to readers with a taste for plebeian Pharisaism.

Starlight, &c. By Walton Lewes. (Wisbeach, Leach & Son ; London, Simpkin & Co.) The first and leading poem in this collection is unpoetic in its theme, being written with the avowed object of proving something; or, as thc Preface has it, of "meeting the objection that reason rejects as incredible the scheme of human redemption, on the ground that," &c. ' Moonlight,' the second poem, is even less poetical. Sonnets and verses of a miscellaneous character make up the remainder of the volume. Under the head of Epigrams we have the following: ' Upon a model of a Cannon made of a Fragment of one brought from Sebastopol'? Formed of a fragment of a captured gun, This relic of Sebastopol's great fall, Here serves to point, instead of shot, a pun, Showing we've made proud Russia's arms look small.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Handwriting on the Wall:_ a Story. .?y Edwin Atherstone. 3 vols. (Bentley.) ? Mr. Atherstone is known for his affection for robust epic subjects. Having in blank verse exhausted all that could be said of Nineveh he has taken Babylon in hand. The .story of the last three days of 'i that ancient city are. here given, intermixed with ' details of the private life and loves and griefs of sundry individuals whose names are not mentioned in history. Cyrus and Croesus come out pleasantly,?the life of an eastern king is scarcely fitted to meet the decorums of daylight,?and Belshazzar was not a model monarch even in his own class, so he has to be considerably veiled. The hero of the book is a young Samson of a Hebrew, named Michael, who performs many wonderful feats of strength and heroism. Amongst others, he enters alone the hall where the king is "feasting with a thousand of his lords," seizes him single handed, and pitches him bodily into a yawning chasm. The scene is spirited, but the effect is marred by an anti-climax. The king is fished up by his lords. Cyrus, as hero and victor, gives him a long sermon on his past sins, and condemns him to be hanged. This second scene is intended to set forth the honour and glory of Cyrus, but it reads almost like a burlesque. The many virtues of Cyrus have been handed down by tradition; but it would have been a very questionable evidence of them had h i been capable of delivering the elaborate harangue which is herc set down for him on the very instant of his entrance into a conquered city. Whether it was intended for his credit or not, it is certain the climax falls flat, and is disappointing. In spite of the ponderousness of the subject, and the dreadfully long time ago since it all happened, to say nothing of the Delius and Lucknows which lie much nearer to our hearts than the fall ef Babylon, still Mr. Atherstone, by dint of his own strong interest in what he has written, and bis familiarity with details which show that he feels quite at home in that almost fabulous city, handles his story with a lightness and skilfulness which will carry the reader through the three volumes much to his own astonishment, for there are, we fancy, few ordinary readers who would not be disposed to swerve aside on reading the portentous title-page; but if they can once clear that fence they will find the road easier on the other side than they could have expected. The story is interesting in its way; the descriptions are gorgeous and often graphic; the style suits the subject, having a certain auoM-t-Scriptural flavour; and above all, there ?? evidence of conscientious hard work and research and painstaking which gives the work a title to respect. It is a great comfort, too, that it is written in prose instead of poetry, it makes it much easier reading; but it is very solid work after all, and must *be encountered in a resolute frame of mind.

ART. 23.-A Sermon preached the 1INh of January, I880, on the Open. ;ag of the Chapel atPoplar, after its bing repared and embellished at the sole Cost of the Hon. the East India Company. Published by Order of the Committee of Shippin . By the Rev. Samuel Hoole, A. M. &c. 8vo. is. G. and W. Nicol. 1804. Mr. Hoole has here given to the public a sermon which does him great credit. The following quotation is rather too long for our li. inits; but the necessity for a regular ministry is set forth in it, in terms so manly, and yet so unpresuming, that we will rather inconvenience ourselves than not offer it to our readers. Ignorance, in the majority of men, is helpless and unavoidable; they are busied from morning till night in procuring their daily food; and even were they less occupied, and had sufficient leisure for medi. tation and religious inquiry, they are, for the most part, incapable of searching out and of thinking for themselves. "How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?" The doubts and difficulties which obstruct the inquiries of others, who are willing and somewhat mgre able to inform themselves, are less likely to be removed by their own unassisted reasonings, than by the instructions of men who have made it their business to study and explain the sacred writings. Every science is best taught by its professors; and though Christianity be not strictly a science, nor indeed that kind of mystery, dangerous to be explored by common men, (which the Romish church would make it), yet in such a volume as the Bible, written in languages long since disused, alluding to customs and ceremonies almost forgotten, and containing, (as an apostle himself observed of St. Paul's Epistles, even at the time when they had just been published), "many tings hard to be understood, which they who are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do a1. the other Scriptures, to their own destruction;" in such a volume, I say, there must be much to exercise penetration arid knowledge, there must be much to call for the particular and minute investiga. tion of a peculiar order. And after all the helps that can be had, some obscurity will yet remain. Whoever attempts to make known, to creatures of such limited capacity, the councils and dispensations of the Most High, must adopt the language of the Apostle, "behold I .rhow you a mystery." ' But even should you allow to the clergy no such superiority of knowledge or discernment, yet may they not be able, by their remonstrances and warnings, to awaken those, who are too busy, or too idle, to exercise their own faculties ? There are a thotzsand truths, obvious as the light of day, which yet, in their commerce with the world, mankind seem wholly to forget. That we are mortal we all know; but when we see thousands laying up in store for this world, as though they were to abide here for ever, can it be superfluous to recal them to the recollection of their mortality > Were there no public religious exhortation, would men, of their own accord, meditate on these things in their private dwellings, and retire regularly into their chamLers, to commune with their own hearts? Would they search the Scriptures? Would they distinguish with ease its genuine doctrines? Would they fix in their minds its important precepts, and call upon themselves to believe and to reform? By thus contending for a public ministry do 1 begin again to commend nzyrey? God is my witness, before vwhom I stand, that I do not hold this language, to mqgn~fy mine oice, but from an honest conviction of its truth. WVere there no longer any ministers of the Gospel, I suspect that the Gospel itself, witholit some particular interposition of Providence, would soon be entirely disregarded.' P. 8.

Sep 1836  ENGLISH LITERATURE - 19th Century - History and Criticism
The Metropolitan magazine,  1833-1840 17 : 65 1 - 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Midshipman Easy. LITERATURE. NOTICES OF NEW WORKS. By the Author of " Peter Simple," " Ja- cob Faithful," &c. 3 Vols. This is a beautiful personification of a principle, a working out of character that is fiction only in the events in which it is shown, as in a multiplicity of mirrors, hut perfectly true and real in its moral identity. Had Mr. Midshipman Easy existed, he must, per force, have acted precisely as Captain Marryat has made him act; and, that he has actually been met with a thousand times in the naval service, all who know that noble service will testify, though the Midshipmen Kanya who have appeared on his Majesty's books have not been placed exactly in the same situation as this Mr. Midshipman Easy (par excellence) occupies in Captain Marryat's. We have given, in a long extract, in our preceding number, a specimen of what this exciting novel is. It was the opening of the tale, and with the sliest humour, and in the blandest style, covereel the most hiting satire. Of this, almost every sentence was pregnant with covert wit, of which not one, two, but three or four perusals were necessary to understand the full force. The paternal Mr. Kasy having allowed his good-nature to run to seed, which seed proves to be the dry fruit of democratical mania, carried out even to the Agrarian law anel a community of goods, becomes, as such a person infallibly must, a madman abroad, and a tyrant at home. Though he finds his beloved theory of equality plants thorns on his pillow, (the expression is pretty, though a little used,) and something sharper than thorns elsewhere, and everywhere else, he still follows it out, as all other democrats do, until it interferes with his own convenience; and, at length, notwithstanding the Junior Easy's assertions to the contrary, the old gentleman finds it just and expedient to send his son to school. This part of the story, which is not at all maritime, but strictly natural and highly amusing, will be found philosophical also. Now, the embryo Mr. Midshipman Easv inherits, from his worthy father, a most unconquerable predilection in all cases to argue the case, whatever may be the tense in which he finds the circumstances or the mood in which he finds his opponent. This leads the young philosopher into the most ludicrous situations, out of which he always extricates himself with glory, owing to the sound principle, upon which he always acts, of taking things easily. Should he be on the? horns of a bull, or of a dilemma, no fear for Master Easy, he will contrive to ?lip himself ofF softly from the one, without a broken bone, and to extricate himself honourably from the other, by making an easy cushion between them, from which to combat his adversary. But, as neither father nor son can make many proselytes to their doctrine of equality when united, like the Roman conquerors of old, they resolve to divide the world between them, old Easy undertaking to regenerate all that live on thc earth, vonni; Kasy all tho.se who reside on the waters. With a shamefully ample allowance, the latter goes to sea as a midshipman. Then conic thc laughable collisions between absolute authority and unqualified licence. Thc reader may suppose that, at first, in endeavouring to take all things easy, he of that name finds it goes hard with him. No such tliin.tr. He is imperturbable. Command him, he argues the case, and produces his minor?reprove him, he argues the case still, and produces his major?well, he is still unconquered ; then to wind up the debate, his superior officer proceeds to punish him?but he is not beaten ; he begins logically to draw his conclusions from his premises, and ultimately proves himself to be in the right, by taking his punishment easily. But the witty author contrives that a subject so apparently intractable shall, with all his whimsies, do himself great honour, and his country some service. By Mr. Easy's maimer of thinking and acting, he manages to rectify errors of much better and more experienced officers, and to perform achievements that would well entitle him to the epithet of more than the hero of an excellently written novel. But his many droll and highly interesting adventures, gradually work out an alteration in his levelling principles, by teaching him that, in this ever shifting world, everything will ultimately find its own level, worth and activity rising, vice, profligacy, and stupidity, sinking to the depths of their natural degradation, lu fact, Mr. Easy, though always liberal, becomes very gentlemanly, and a good Tory, leaves all notions of equality to the indulgence of those who have got nothing, and determines hereafter to preserve his station in society, and his very excellent estate of eight thousand pounds a year with it. Lucky was it for our midshipman that it was entailed ; for Mr. Easy, senior, not having been to sea to gain wisdom, goes on from bad to worse, from the whimsical to the extravagant, and from the extravagant to thc insane. All this part of the tale is a melancholy, but a true picture of our fallible natures. The love affair of our hero is merely an amplification of Madame de Stael's aphorism, that the tender passion is but an episode in the lite of man; but Captain Marryat has contrived to make his midshipman's episode a very exquisite one. The naval scenes, as usual with this author, are glorious. The storm, the fight, the imminent danger, are all portrayed in these volumes with the hand of a master. The delineation of the various characters that act with Mr. Easy, are also first rate. What a troop of creations has this writer called forth! We will not use the cant of criticism, and say, as that cant too frequently does, this is the last and best of his works. It is not better than " Peter Simple," nor better written than " Jacob Faithful," or a more true picture of life, as life really is, than " Japhet, in Search of a Father." Each of these works has an excellence peculiar to itself, which excellence could not, by any possibility, belong to the other. "Midshipman Easy" is inferior to none of Captain Marryat's preceding works ; we think that the world will prefer it to any of them ; but tliis preference ought not, and will not, throw his other productions into shade. We shall conclude our remarks by saying, that our author has given a perfect literature to the marine of our country? not merely originated one to be improved by others?and the world acknowledges that the fairest and the brightest fields of fiction are now to be found on the measureless waste of thc seas, over which we hope that England may be for ever triumphant.

THE object of this scheme is to provide a comfortable mainten. ance for a very respectable and 'useful class of individuals who in case of casualties, of sickness, or of age, are too often left without any other resource than the aid of a precarious benevolence. By becoming members of this institution domestic governeses and pub. lie teachers have an opportunity of relieving their minds from that state of insecurity and inquietude which is perpetually tormenting thebe, ho- have made no preparation agaihst the contingent misfortunes of life and the certain imbetility of age. The regulations of this society seem to be very judiciously drawn; and will afford not only alleviaticn to distress but encouragement to virtue. We trust that the subscriptions of honorary members will be large enough to enable the society to extend tho scale and enlarge the number of its benefits. The amiable Miss Eliza Hamilton is said to be the au thor of this performance.

The Academy, 1869-1902, 0269-333X  : 7 172 - 173

The Poetical Works of Percy Bysahe Shelley. -The Text care- fully revised, with Notes and a Memoir, by W. M. Rossetti. 2 vols. London: Moxon, 1870. This book contains a complete and revised reprint of all Shelley's poems, together with the addition of many juvenile verses, translations, and other fragments not hitherto collected, Shelley's own notes, and those of Mrs. Shelley, published in her edition of the poems, a new Life by Mr. Rossetti, and critical notes in explanation of the readings adopted in doubtful passages. This enumeration of its contents is sufficient to shew that the new edition is more complete and full of interest than any of those which have preceded it ; since it has taken nothing from them and has added much. Mr. Rossetti has executed the whole of his work in a spirit of enthusiasm and reverence; whatever faults may be detected in it will not be found to spring from any carelessness or presumption in the editor. Mr. Rossetti's admiration for Shelley is unbounded. The first words of his memoir run thus :?" To write the life of Shelley is (if I may trust my own belief) to write the life of the greatest English poet since Milton, or possibly since Shakspeare." In another place he says: " the archangelic feet, and brain, and heart, which quitted England in the spring of 1816, were never again to be repelled by that grudging and unwitting stepmother." Assuredly we have in these sentences a due amount of respect and passion for the poet who is named pre-eminently "the divine." Yet this devotion does not prevent Mr. Rossetti from fairly stating the events of Shelley's life: though highly sympathetic, he is not otherwise than temperate in his advocacy of Shelley's cause : even the coldness with which he speaks of Harriet Westbrook seems to spring less from the fact that she had grown worse than useless to the poet, than from some well considered estimate of her own unworthiness. The Memoir is remarkable for its moderation of tone; though it adds but little, if anything, to our knowledge of the facts of Shelley's life, it is graphic, and minute, without being lengthy. Its chief fault is affectation or impurity of style; abundant passages might be quoted in support of this assertion : it is enough to refer to pp. 39,55, 123, and the last sentence ofthe Memoir. Apart from these defects, the Memoir contains many passages of brilliant narrative and pithy observation. We are especially grateful to Mr. Rossetti for his well selected extracts from previous biographies; without unduly burdening his own Memoir, they add vividness and variety to our picture of Shelley. By far the most important part of Mr. Rossetti's work is that which relates to the editing of the poems. In his preface he very candidly and clearly states the plan which he has followed. To begin with, he omits nothing, however fragmentary, which, on due evidence, he believes to have been written by Shelley. For the insertion of some foolish early poems he offers an apology in his preface (vol. i. pp. 13, 14); but we are sure that every real student of Shelley will be glad to have these wild and rambling verses, " absolute and heinous rubbish" though they be. Of the text Mr. Rossetti writes as follows {Preface, vol. i. p. 15) :? " I have considered it my clear duty and prerogative to set absolutely wrong grammar right; as thus? ' Thou too, O Comet, beautiful and fierce, Who dreiost [drezu] the heart of this frail universe ;' and to set absolutely wrong rhyming right; as thus? ' Beneath whose spires which swayed in the red flame [light] Reclining as they ate, of liberty, And hope, and justice, and Laone's name, Earth's children did a woof of happy converse frame ;' and to set absolutely wrong metre right; as thus? ' This plan might be tried too. Where's General Laoctonos ? It is my royal pleasure,' instead of? ' This plan might be tried too. Where's General Laoctonos ? It is my royal pleasure.'" Occasionally too, he has allowed himself to resort to conjectural emendations. But he pleads (on p. 16) that he has made sparing use of them. It is a disadvantage that all his changes, whether grammatical or metrical, whether based on MS. authority or conjecture, are printed without notice in the text, and without references to the account and explanation of them given in the notes at the end of each volume. This appears to us a mistake. It would surely be better to select some edition, say that of Mrs. Shelley, and by means of annotations, brackets, italics, or any other expedient, however clumsy, to suggest emendations and display varieties of reading. In fairness to Mr. Rossetti we must add that he has most scrupulously followed his own method as explained in the preface, so that the careful student is safe in his hands. As regards restitution of rhyme and metre, it does not appear that the editor has always MS. authority for what he has done. Relying on the carelessness of Shelley and his printers, he corrects where he believes correction needed. To take this liberty with a poet's versification is surely hazardous; and what are we to say about corrections of bad grammar ? The instance which Mr. Rossetti gives in the passage already quoted from his preface, is the restoration of its proper termination to a verb in the 2nd person singular. Now Shelley was constantly in the habit of treating the 2nd person singular of his verbs as if the termination in est did not exist Wherever Shelley does so, with, as far as we have observed, one exception, Mr. Rossetti corrects him. There are, for example, seven instances of such corrections noticed on page 475 of vol. i. A passage in " Prometheus" (vol i. p. 328) is rendered cacophonous by the substitution of turrist for turned, where, had the correction been exact, Mr. Rossetti ought to have printed tumed'st. Another in " Queen Mab," page 36, is emended on the same principle. But Mr. Rossetti is not uniform : the celebrated line from the "Skylark": " Thou lovest, but ne'er knew love's sad satiety," he leaves, because " the sound of the lovely line would be so spoiled by changing the word into knciifst that no rectification of grammar is permissible." Would it not have befitted Mr. Rossetti either ruthlessly to carry out his work of grammatical rectification, or else to consider whether in all the instances of errors which he has corrected, as in the case of this line from the " Skylark," Shelley did not sacrifice accuracy of grammar to euphony ? If he did so at all consciously or deliberately, then it was the duty of the editor to respect his intention. If he did so by a blunder, for which he would himself have blushed, then why not correct the "Skylark" as well as "Prometheus," or "Queen Mab"? There is a line in one of dough's finest poems, "The Shadow ": " When thou ascended to thy God and ours," where the same grammatical error occurs. Would Mr. Rossetti have here insisted, in the face of MSS., upon printing " ascendedst" ? We suppose so. Yet it is not without question whether great poets are not justified by the modern tendency to lose inflections in dropping, for the sake of euphony, the harsh sound of the termination in est. We have said enough to characterise Mr. Rossetti's valuable edition of Shelley. The following stanza from " Lines written for Miss Sophia Stacey " may be quoted as a specimen of the hitherto unpublished poems :? " As dew beneath the wind of morning, As the sea which whirlwinds waken, As the birds at thunder's warning, As aught mute but deeply shaken, As one who feels an unseen spirit, Is my heart when thine is near it." The question of such difficult readings as occur in the " Stanzas written in Dejection at Naples," in some passages of " Prometheus " and "Alastor," in the verses called " Remembrance," and elsewhere, may better be treated in a critical essay than in a review. But with respect to all such matters we may safely say that Mr. Rossetti has shewn himself a careful critic and accurate scholar, if at times lie is needlessly innovating and subtle. The book is well got up and printed. The type, though small, and though the ink might well be blacker on the page, is distinct and beautiful. J. A. Symonds.

THE LITERARY EXAMINER. Journal of a Voyage in Baffin's Bay and Barrow's Straits in the Years 1850-51, performed hy H. M's Ships Lady Franklin and Sophia, under the command of Mr William Penny, in Search of the Misting Crews of Jf. M.'s Ships Erebus and Terror: with a Narrative of Sledge Excursion* on the Iee of Wellington Channel; and Observations on the Natural History and Physical Features of the Countries and Frozen Seas visited. By Peter C. Sutherland, M.D., M.R.C.S.E., Surgeon to the Expedition. Two vols., with Maps, Plates, and Wood Engravings. Longman and Co. These are two volumes upon Arctic regions, one of five hundred aud the other of six hundred pages in extent, making a work much longer than the writer had designed in tho first instance, not on account of any taste for bookmaking, or any verbosity of style, but oat of genuiue abundance in the matter to be told. Excellent books abound now on the Arctic regions, and it might be thought that there is little left to tell of life near the North Pole with which the public is not perfectly familiar,?especially little, one might say, for an observer who has no skill as a literary artist, and generally fails when ha attempts, aa he does not often attempt, to put bis feelings upon paper. The truth however is, that by using his eyes well, and seeing everything, and telling all he sees without any straggle to make it lively or interesting bj the force of pen. Dr Sutherland has made his entire book so lively and io interesting by tba force of truth, that we doubt whether any single work has hitherto presented a picture equally minute of the peculiarities of n=life within the Arctic circle. % Dr Sutherland waa qualified to write aa a medical man, obasrvant beyond tba average gift of bte fraternity, and with * taste for observation of the most et^lightened kind. Iota* raft in natani history, and uxmespeoiattyinoneofitemost negieetad branches, ineteorology, baa enabled tba writer to Sato a great eJttrai aa wall aa a mat taloa to hit book. AmWfofW inaner, fer example, K contains ametaorolojean*), leaotifiM for avery dar ip^twitUn the Arctic th* fjbtetbnof the winda with the defy chalker rf fen% Barrow's Straits, and there are reports in the appendix by competent naturalists on the specimens brought home in illustration of the botany, zoology, and geology of places visited. In the course of the volume the writer's taste for natural history displays itself in the most agreeable form. Dr Sutherland is not a man who would have shot the albatross. The Arctic fox is often seen on the ice at a considerable distance from the land. I recollect seeing a poor creature adrift on a detached stream of ice in latitude sixty-eight degrees. He was running from side to side of the stream, appearing to be quite alive to the dangers of his situation, but he never attempted to take the water. The ship, in which I was at the time, was moored to a grounded iceberg, and as the stream came down against it, and was divided by it, I had an opportunity of throwing pieces of whale's krang on the ice, as it passed close by the ship's stern, and I saw the fox devouring a hearty meal, as soon as he had discovered them. It was very gratifying to me to think, that my curiosity had led to some mitigation of the sufferings even of a poor fox. These volumes acquire additional interest from the fact that the voyago which they describe is one of those which has of late years interested the world most, as the most successful of the searching expeditions that have been despatched in hope of sending rescue to our missing countrymen. The voyage of Captain Penny, or Mr Penny, if we must not promote too high the master of a whaler, and the blue book that has arisen out of the collisions in opinion between Mr Penny and Captain Austiu, the genuine captain of her Majesty's service, are still fresh; if anything that has got into a bluo book can thereafter remain fresh in the public memory. The public has a strong opinion also that it is very much in debt to Mr Penny. The public is disposed to think that his discoveries on Beacbey Island, his exploration of Wellington Channel, and his longing look up the Queen's Channel over open water, have something in them that might liave been fruitful of the best results, if her Majesty's Government, or her Majesty's orthodox officers, could have been content to let such an unorthodox fellow as a whaling master keep the lead that he had taken. Having some notions of this kind the public will receive with interest a full and particular account of Captain or Mr Penny's voyage, including his own journal of his sledging expedition, and the reports by Dr Stewart, Mr Goodsir, and Dr Sutherland, of the expeditions from the ship in which they severally were concerned. Such matter includes not only an unravelment to the full extent that is possible of the best existing clue to Sir John Franklin's track, but it includes also the interest that is attached to travels which involve discovery of places that have been unvisited before. For such details Dr Sutherland's very minute account of the whole voyage will be sought by many readers. By others?naturalists?it will be sought as a work that is iu its whole extent interesting even when regarded solely from their points of view. Beyond these it has a charm for the most miscellaneous reader through the great abundance of its details, and the vividness with which it therefore represents the condition of an Arctic voyager. In this respect a surgeon sailing under a commander who is bound by no rules of etiquette, and tied down to no regulations of the service, is much better placed than anybody who goes out under the fetters of a rigid discipline. We do not mean to find fault with navy discipline; but freedom of action is of course so far impeded by it, routine is so universal and etiquette so rigid, that there is less room for that free play of circumstance, out of the study of which knowledge is obtained. For example: Since coming into winter quarters, and establishing regularity in the amount of labour exacted from the crews, the scale of victualling had undergone a modification, which resulted in a great saving ef provisions, without reducing the daily allowance below what would be, necessary in such a cold climate. It was always observed that in stormy weather, when the men could not engage in work or gymnastics, the amount of food consumed was considerably leas; and since coming into winter quarters, although the temperature of the air had been forty or fifty degrees colder, there was less demand for food than during summer, when the labour which each had to endure was almost intolerable. In serving oat provisions, our main object was to have the wants of the men supplied as adequately as possible: and as these depended entirely upon the amount of exercise taken, which varied very much at times, and upon the temperature, which also varied, the absurdity of establishing a scale of victualling for the whole year will be plain. In such a voyage as ours, where the object was to keep ap health among the crews, without undue waste of the provisions, which could not be replaced, the plan which had been adopted was based upon the mott correct principle, and any inefficiency that might attend ita operation would depend entirely upon carelessness in keeping correct accounts of the stores as they might be expended. It is well known that, when seamen know that they are on strict allowance, they will continue to receive it, although it may be much more than they can ase j bat if they have an idea that their commander it desirous that they should have enough without watte, the person who serves oat the stores to the cook receives intimation that their allowance it more than eau be used. Perhaps, tuen a system may appear to throw the ship's stores at the mercy of the crew, and without nay doubt H dots to; bot it it on tao taft side, aad those to tho snerchant navy who have tried it caa testify that there is a saving ia it, of which thor eeald have formed no idea. In tao article of bread, ia our Expedition, tho weekly allowance wat six poonda, aad, at that tate, we had eooogh for tarot yean. It wat served oat every eveafef, bat not weighed, aad tho result of tho not weighing system waa generally a saving of nearly a pound nor nan aerweaf.

Upon the battbg the cabins while in winter quarters Dr Sutherland writes: Pmm^ffm^m^k^mmHUfMlML ea beard ship dorina &Z!S?3*Q**i2^ wBwtjBMte*es*?^ ^?^BBUsBisBBaeos^sa?? s^smsT. ^ \^S1Z^^^ ^^^^Ez^l^r**^? j that the difference between the two temperatures uT?4L* ?~~^ be exposed alternately many times in tho day throa*W^*?, ^ ; would, even with the above moderate, and u the*iwi tiltlr> low range, be greater than the change which a pwtenlSIi?** ** | ence by being transferred from the severest winter ia (CW1 tho hottest part of the intertropical regions. For .? r*lB<? cabin of the " Sophia" +60* might often be exDeetSFft * *? open air, not unfrequently ?40? would douUlessbeSt*ili^^ end of winter. Between these two extremes there are 100 d1 *? fully three times as much as the difference between the mJ?lf,,^ rature of Greatf Britain and that of the tropics. But intki*1*1, should be heated up to +72? or more, and the air coolL a^* ?50?, which alto may be expected, the two extremes wonM iOeV* 122 degrees apart. Let 122? be added to +88?, about tkV ^ temperature of our winter months, and the result will bs +1*?* something unheard of, to far aa I know, in the hottest txonuJi!j- *" This will explain the difference of temperature to whick wT** alternately exposed; and it will show that two distant ?xnwll*' heat and cold can be endured with impunity when there isliuu^ no moisture present, and when those extremes are not owinr ton!* heating, but to low degrees of cold. It will also be clear, that J5i can hardly be more absurd than to increase the distance bet* these two extremes by the extravagant use of fuel, which osjrKl be used moderately, and is one of the most indispsnsable sjtSel an Expedition in the Arctic Regions. m The following remarks upon the temperature of the ships are exceedingly suggestive, and may be taken as one arnon* a thousand instances of the acute kind of observationin which these volumes abound. The temperature of the ships varied a little from tims to tine ic. cording to the force and direction of the wind and jts temperature.* In the apartment occupied by the crew, fifteen in number, on board the " Sophia," where there was a fire generally burning, it wu about -f 50?; but frequently it was below +30?. The beds there, and the chinks of the partition between it and the main deck, often produced large quantities of ice; but this never did any harm, for it alwin continued in that state. I often observed the temperature of the air which rushed in at the lower part of the entrance of that place io low as ?3? ; while that at the top was -f 50?, rushing in an opposite direction i and about midway between the top and the bottom, within a space of four feet, that being the height of the entrance, there wu a neutral point, in which the candle flame went neither out nor in, the lower part of it appearing to incline inward, while the upward inclined outward. In this there was a simple illustration of the phenomena of winds and typhoons, which rage acron and devastate tropical countries. In the cabins of the " Sophia," and in the reesMej, such as bed placet, and lockers around them, the temperature frequently came down to +20? or -f-18?. This, however, was only in the parts " around " the cabins, where great quantities of ice sccsmulated; but in the two cabins it varied considerably. At the top it was often up to -f-70? or -f-80?, while at our feet +24* wai common. Sitting on the sofa in the small cabin, where there was a firs gentrally, although not constantly, a thermometer at the height of a person's head was at +50? ; at his feet it was +16?. From obserring such differences, and knowing that there were still greater difference! when the external air at ?39? came into operation, we were very indifferent and careless about ventilation; for so long as the fires weis kept up, and the funnels carried away the smoke and the heated air, tho air within the ship would undergo renewal with; sufficient activity. Captain Penny's party had abundant experience in the intensity of cold, the temperature they endured falling at one period below the freezing point of mercury. Exercise in what an Arctic voyager would call cold weather produces extreme thirst and abundant exhalation from the skin, which of course freezes in the shape of hoarfrost under the clothes. Upon this subject Dr Sutherland says, I believe the true cause of such intense thirst is the extreme dry" ness of the air when the temperature is low. In this lt^J'*rt' streets a large amount of moisture from the human body. Thew* and extensive surface which the lungs expose, twenty-five times or oftener every minute, to nearly two hundred cubic inches of arr w, must yield a quantity of vapour which one can hardly spare ?"" punity. The human skin throughout its whole extent, even whets* is brought to the hardness of horn, as well as the softest "J"*" delicate parts, is continually exhaling vapour, and this ?"J**""! creates in due proportion a demand for water. Let a pevtw w examine the inside of his boots, after a walk in the open airalis ww temperature, and the accumulation of condensed vapour *??? finds there will convince him of the active state of the ?km. iw? found my stockings adhering to the soles of my Kilby s b^JVJTj walk of a few hours. The hoarfrost and snow which they <*"??"" could not have been there by any other meant except exhaiausi"*1 the skin. To such thirst, snow in the mouth addsonly fieenwnntnw. The use bf snow when persons are thirsty does net by JJ7 ^ allay their insatiable desire for water; on the contrary, ny**"? be increased in proportion to the quantity used, and tat "?JJJJJ with which it it put into the mouth. Por example, a psfioa wawjs along feels intensely thirsty, and he looks to his '^^jJJJJJj eyes, but hit good tense and firm resolutions are ??* *?

"^scientific habit of observation on tho part of Doctor h land caused these volumes in fact to be quite a mine ? \lent, that might bo made richly available by writers or ?*mC1 rs who desire to enliven and impress upon tho mind W^ientifi0 theories by apposite anecdotes and illustra. Of the masses of rock and shingle conveyed by ISLsturi deposited upon their passage, Dr Sutherland, ^Jother matter, gives the following examples. i* tn elevation of from thirty to forty feet, on a comparatively 1 nari of the west side of the island, we observed a block of granite 'thsttasingle flaw, measuring sixteen feet in length, fourteen in TvJSi and twelve feet in height, and resting on the hard rock taMth! which presented quite a different structure. How it came llilid at what time, were questions, which could be solved by faence to the period in which the island was still beneath the waters f the ocean, which was then occupied, as it is now. by thousands of bast, carrying each, perhaps, thousands of tons of rock, and scatter?* iUTtf the bottom of the sea, for many hundred miles distance fom the spot whence it had been received. The specific gravity of matte being 2 5, this block would weigh at least 186 tons; it would Suire a cube of ice, with a side of forty feet, to give it buoyancy in 12 water, and seven fathoms water to float it along. From this it ?.? be easily conceived what an enormous mass of extraneous niterial icebergs several miles in length and breadth, and drawing two to three hundred fathoms water, are capable of transporting from one place to another, without appearing to be in the least encumbered br it Mr Petersen told me that he once laid his nets for white whales in the month of October along the land, where there were only t few fathoms water, and, haring left them quite clear, he returned ina few hours to examine them, and, as may be supposed, was pleased to find that some of the buoyant parts had disappeared under water ; i rare sign, he thought, that the animals for which they were intended kid been entangled in their meshes, aud had died, and sunk to the bottom. He proceeded at once to haul them in, but, to his astonishment, they did not contain a white whale, but an enormous boulder, which he found it impossible to move on the bottom, or to disentangle; md the only way by which he recovered part of his net, was to cut roj the portion of it in which the boulder lay. A small berg had bea observed in the neighbourhood, which, in passing, took the opportunity of dropping one of its jewels into the nets. The following remarks, again, on the growth by the ships' company of mustard and water-cresses while, in their winter quarters, could have come only from an intelligent observer. Water-cresses and mustard were reared with great care, and they vere very highly prized. Several stems were examined, and found to be four to lire inches in length. The proportion of water which the yoong plants contained was so great, that one could hardly expect to derive great benefit from a few ounces of them every week. A portion wu exposed to a temperature of +90? to -f 100?, uutil it ceased to lose weight by further exposure; the remainder, containing all the intiicorbutic and nutritious properties of the plant, amounted to 6*5 per cent., which was not nearly one-half the weight of the seed tait had been used: the 93*5 which escaped, unfortunately happened to be water. I tried the same experiment several times with both j nutard and cress, so that I might, if possible, receive favourable imprewions with respect to the gardening; but the results were invariably the same, fur the water which escaped by evaporation often acceded 93 per cent. I could hardly credit that a plant grown in tae dark, and destitute of every trace of green, containing such a large proportion of water, and almost insipid with the exception of the ?end principles of the seed and its essential oil, could possess virtues wrthy of the slightest confidence. The young plants were less acrid Ass the seed, and the essential oil had almost all disappeared j their weight, too, was about half the weight of the seeds which produced atm. From so intelligent a witness, satiated as we are with jrifish out of the troubled watera in which Lord Derby and ? clumsy men go fishing, we may be willing to hear somewing of what might be done about the Reef koli Bank in wit ? Strait. h the end of May, and in June and July, cod-fishing can be "*bd en in this part of the Strait with great advantage. I have |*wi four lines, double-hooked, haul up upwards of six hundred ?in the course of four hours. The linet were many times not per-1 ftod to reach the bottom until they had hooked the tsh, and re-1 JW* to be hauled in. Halibut (Hippoghssus vulgaris) is also very **w?t.

Examiner  : 3280 790 - 791
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Voyage Bound the World. By the Marquis de Beauvoir. In Two Volumes. John Murray. In a modest preface the author of this journal of ' A Voyage Bound the World' craves the indulgence of his readers on account of his youth. He appears to have completed his twentieth year only a week before setting sail for Australia, and now ventures to " face the perils of publicity at twentytwo." His journal was originally intended for his relatives, but, having omitted what was personal and interesting only to his family, he now gives the remainder to the world. He wishes to relate simply and modestly what struck him most " in the glorious sights, curious facts, adventures and dangers of long sea voyages and distant countries," and hopes to be pardoned if he becomes too wildly enthusiastic in his descriptions of " exciting sport on the extensive plains of Australia, or the burning jungles of Java." These distant wanderings, however, were not undertaken by the author on his own account He was the chosen companion of one of the young princes of the house of Orleans, the Due de renthievre, son of the Prince de Joinville, who wished to make a voyage round the world. For the Marquis de Beauvoir's pleasant volumes we have nothing but commendation. They contain many exact descriptions of the men, manners, and institutions ofthe countries which he visited, and many picturesque sketches of Eastern life and scenery. The author writes with that youthful ardour and generous enthusiasm which would cover a multitude of literary sins. He has followed Lord Bacon's advice on travel, and has always taken care " to see and observe what is best" " Travel in the younger sort is a part of education," said the wise Chancellor ; and if that were true three hundred years ago, how much more likely is it to be true now that a voyage round the world can be accomplished in the same time that it formerly took a young nobleman to make the "grand tour." If all young men brought back so much with them from the countries they visited as the Marquis de Beauvoir, they would, indeed, have laid the solid foundation of a truly liberal education. Of course, if we chose to be hypercritical, we might find a few literary lapses and occasional blemishes in the volumes before us; but the work, as a whole, is exceedingly agreeable and interesting; one highly creditable both to the heart and to the head of the youthful litterateur. We need not dwell on the description of the passage to the Eastern hemisphere, and of the thousand and one unwonted sights which sea and sky afforded to the youthful observer. The first volume describes Australia, the country itself, its political and social institutions, its past history and its probable future. The author here ventilates the Chinese question, which is beginning to assume some importance in our colonies in the Eastern Seas. He pictures John Chinaman as an indefatigable worker, sober as an anchorite, and greedy of gain, who " with an insect-like patience, tenacity, and power of suction, is wonderfully successful in pumping up the riches of the country, and, his hoard once collected," in bearing it away with him. He discusses the propriety of the conduct of the Government in restraining the hordes of Chinese who invaded | the country on the first discovery of the gold-fields, ! but considers that the capitation-tax now levied upon all Chinamen on their first landing is only fair and proper: If, said some, the white race have, after innumerable dangers and enormous expense, planted their flag on Australian soil; if their sheep farmers have converted the wilderness into fertile fields resembling tbe counties of England ; if men like Burke, Sturt, Landsborough, and Leichardt have sacrificed their lives to open the country to civilisation ; if this race have made roads, opened ports, constructed towns and railroads, created a magnificent social, commercial, and political organisation, and formed a second country for themselves eighteen thousand miles from their native land?is it fair that the very day when the bird has laid its golden eggs, thousands of beings of an inferior race, having no thought or habit in common, and bringing with them a pestilential cargo of vices, should lay their hands upon the precious brood, aud arrogantly dispute its possession ? By what law j of the equality of man, can the colonists who have discovered and cultivated the country, who have established themselves in it, and made it prosperous, be forced to permit strangers to share with them their treasures, and carry away rich booty to their semi-barbarous country. Australia presents a great field to all the white races, without distinction of nationality. Grant that the Chinese element may be beneficial to the population of the Philippines, and amongst the Malay races of Java and Polynesia, producing there a half-breed race, which from the paternal side inherits greater intelligence, physical power, and industry!. But in Australia, thanks to a fine climate, and a healthy mode of life, the Anglo-Saxon race developes in its finest form on a virgin soil; here you have a nation starting up, and looking carefully to its future ; but the quickly-earned wealth of the Chinese digger contrasts too sharply with the poverty of the Irish immigrant on her first lauding. Think of all these little yellow men, with their slits of eyes, their flat noses, and skin like a shark's, becoming the happy husbands of the fair daughters of Erin, and the joyful fathers of a young Australia, a half-caste, bastard race, decayed and degraded, speaking a aemi-Asiatic language, with pagoda-chqrches and steam-junks ; think of these when there comes a question of voting, of constructing machinery,! of keeping up the impulse of civilisation given by the first j pioneers of the country! j No! this is not the future dreamed of by the young English colony! There were, unfortunately, only too many specimens of the Irish-Chinese before the Government resolved positively to stop the inroad of Orientals, who would carry away the gold of Australia, and leave behind them an original stain which no lapse of time could efface. As to allowing Chiuese women to enter the country, travellers, who have known the Celestial Empire thoroughly, I tell us that such a measure would bring upon them only a double portion of the most utter physical and moral corruption known under heaven. The Marquis describes with much vivacity a staghunt near Melbourne. With a hundred and fifty horsemen, and several ladies at the start, and the road filled with elegant phaetons and four-in-hands, he might well fancy himself on his way to Epsom or to a meet of the Surrey stag-hounds. However, he has not much time for instituting comparisons, for they are soon off at a terrific pace across meadows, cornfields, and marshes, intersected by deep ditches. The fences the Marquis describes as " really frightful ;" those in Ireland being nothing in comparison with them. His first day of parrot-shooting amidst the wild and magnificent vegetation of the Australian I forests was to him like a dream of enchantment Plunging into the woods in the early morning, while the stars were still shining, our sportsman prepared to salute the gorgeously-painted birds at the first rays of the rising sun. By the evening be and his friends had made a capital bag of eighty-five head of game?blue cranes, white cockatoos, but mostly parrots and parroquets, sparkling with colours " from ruby to azure." " Strange, adds the Marquis, forgetting the great natural law of compensation, "that 'the voice is not fine with birds so divine/ In Europe the woods resound with the musical song of birds, and the nightingale enchants one before day dawns, while here the most piercing and discordant cries make up their barbarous music" We can do no more than glance at the remaining chapters in the first volume, devoted to the gold mines of Ballarat, the political and social institutions ofthe country generally, the sheep-stations of the interior, and the growing colony of Queensland. Leaving Australia, the Marquis de Beauvoir and the Prince pass through Torres Strait, and soon find themselves rocking gently on the Arafoura Sea. They remark the mountainous aspect of the Island of Timor, the tangled woods of Sombawa, and the lofty volcanic peak of Bali?rising majestically to a height of 12,000 feet For two days they steam along the coasts of Java, and are nearly suffocated by the heat. At length, on the 10th November, their vessel anchors in a beautiful bay studded with islands, and commanded by lofty mountains. Landing on the crowded quay, they are shaded by the exquisitely green trees of the tropics, and surrounded by human beings dressed in all the colours of the rainbow. " Great cocoa-nut trees, covered with fruit, extend their golden branches over tangled thickets of mangoes and bananas, and tulip-trees that raise aloft the scarlet colour of their flaming blossoms. It was like a scene at the opera?Indian splendour,Oriental magnificence. We are at Batavia." They drive through the town in little open carriages drawn by Lilliputian ponies, like Newfoundland dogs, and brought from Timor. For more than three-quarters of an hour our drive continues, and we pass by the most novel sights. We skirt canals, where groups of thirty or forty Malay women are bathing, and are suddenly startled in their gambols by a pirogue, heavily laden with fruit, moving silently along by the aid of its languid paddles. Here comes a troop of native cavalry trotting " a l'Anglaise" ; their swords, as tall as their horses, trail upon the ground; their long spears touch the plumes of the cocoa-nut trees; these Malays, with their gingerbread complexions and hanging lips, are dressed up as European soldiers, and their bare feet decorated with magnificent spurs intended for jackboots. There, numbers of itinerant merchants, adorned with "langoutis" of the most vivid colours, traverse tbe streets at the peculiar trotting pace common to Indians; gesticulating, apostrophising the passers-by, and laughing loudly. It is the most bewildering, the most picturesque, the liveliest crowd I ever saw. Itwould take me hours to describe its thousand colours, the inconceivable specimens of humanity that compose it, its noisy pantomimic animation. But soon we cross a bridge, and enter tbe new town. Oh, what a garden of fairyland, what a verdant paradise this is! Literally speaking, there are no streets in Batavia; there are only splendid avenues, shaded by the most beautiful and luxuriant trees, which form immense long bowers, such as in Europe are only seen in a scene at the opera. The fiery rays of a pitiless sun can only at intervals penetrate this shade, but they deck all that forms it with marvellous hues; the many plumes of the cocoa-nut tree ; the slender branches of the tulip tree, which are all flower, ami scarlet flower; bananAS with their green leaves aa large as a man ; cotton trees, cpvered with snow white tufts; the travellers' palm, great fans of the most exquisite grace, from which a stream of a milky fluid springs, if you pierce the trunk ; finally, immense banyan trees, from whieh hundreds of creepers toll straight down, and taking root almost as soon as they touch the ground, climb again to the summit of tbe tree, twining round it in knotted garlands, only to fall again! One of these trees alone forms a forest surrounded by a curtain, a network of interlaced foliage and flowers, through which children in a state of nature, putting on one side the hundreds of creepers waving in the wind, can look at the boats and the swimmers passing along the canal. Fashionable life begins at Batavia at half-past four in the morning. At early dawn old and young wrap themselves in floating cotton garments and hasten to the pools to bathe. Between four and six is the time for walking, and in the afternoon everyI body sleeps. At six in the evening the European 'population lounge bare-headed to the Waterloo ! plain, where the military band plays, while " more than three hundred carriages stand in the shade of the great trees, and officers gallop about amongst the myriads of Javanese in holiday dress, glittering in the most brilliant Eastern finery." The scenery of the interior of Java appeared to the eyes of tho Marquis de Beauvoir a fairy-land, whose splendour would be almost monotonous to describe, but which always presented some new grandeur. Our author made friends with some of the natives of tho interior, and extracted from them not a little wit and wisdom. The Javanese are evidently believers in Darwin's theory, for they told the Marquis and his friends that " the monkeys are men like ourselves, but they are much cleverer and have never chosen to speak, so that they might not be made to work." We cannot follow our author to Siam, where ho visited the royal stables of elephants, the harem of the great king with a long name, which we havo not space to quote, and the Buddhist temples of Bangkok. Neither can we dwell on the interesting sketches which he gives us of China and the Chinese. We would not, however, conclude without quoting a few lines in which he cleverly summarises the peculiar characteristics of the inhabitants of " The Flowery Land:" Throughout all their works, though there may sometimes be perfection, there is no spark of light. All extremes meet here ; coffins are adorned and venerated, and the new-born infant is killed without scruple. Merit is sought in caligraphy, not in ideas. How can there be any growth of thought in a country where a clever man's whole life is spent in learning the alphabet? The result is that ninety niue hundredths of the population of China are unacquainted with half the signs which express ideas, and that they cannot understand the language of those who study for themselves, and not for the _ sake of imparting knowledge. The great scholars pass their lives brush in hand, endeavouring to trace with elegance, on a porous brick, pious sentences which will be uuiutelligible to the common people, and which, dazzling in gold in their pagodas, have no meaning to the minds of the worshippers. Their literature is nothing but a stroke of the brush, and the Chinaman, far advanced in material progress, remains fatally backward in the field of thought. We have heartily enjoyed this rapid 'Voyage Round the World,' and have much pleasure in commending the volumes to our readers. We have found them throughout lively, instructive, and agreeable; they will at once establish the reputation of the Marquis de Beauvoir as a careful observer and a clever writer.

The Athenaeum  : 1807 788 - 788
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Owen: a Waif. By the Author of 'No Church,' &c. " 3 vols. (Hurst & Blackett.) There is a great deal to be liked in this book; but it is not equal to 'No Church.' The writing is clever and pleasant, and the tone is good; but the story Ls lacking in interest, and drags heavily in parts?occupying so many years in the lives of its characters that the reader becomes a little fatigued and bored with them at last; and it is not easy to follow the "waif" through the many changes and To vicissitudes he undergoes before he arrives at a happy and prosperous conclusion in the last chapter. The opening scenes are, perhaps, the best of all. The description of the tent, full of wandering vagrants, on their way from a great fair in Markshire, is curious and striking. The good-natured Mrs. Chideny, who takes pity on the ragged boy, and persuades her drunken husband to befriend him on his road to London, is a character that it is impossible not to like. Owen, the waif, finds it so, at all events, and devotes his whole future to the good motherly woman, who has spoken to him the only kind words he has ever heard in his life. Deserted by his own mother, a halfcrazy drunkard, Owen attaches himself to the fortunes of the Chideny family, who keep a small and humble greengrocer's shop in Lambeth. While Tarby, the husband, drinks and fights in " the Cut, Owen carries on the business, and goes to market, and drives round his barrow, and supports Mrs. Chideny almost entirely by his own exertions. Tarby, however, becomes more than ever wild and reckless; and having killed a policeman in one of his drunken brawls, he is transported at last, and the "waif" is left in charge of the wife and child and the interests of the greengrocery concern in Hannah Street. Next, Mrs. Chideny dies, and Owen has the little girl on his hands entirely. By this time, however, he has made some friends?two brothers of the name of Dell; one an engineer, with a pretty little quiet niece; the other a formidable policeman, No. 92, an old enemy of Owen's; but at times of repose and relaxation?of " unbuttonment," as he calls it?92 is inclined to be friendly and sociable, and to give Owen the best of advice. The Dells have persuaded Owen to attend an evening school, and to read useful books in the few leisure moments he can find, and John Dell obtains for him a situation in the foundry of which he is foreman; and the Chideny business is disposed of, and little Mary put out to nurse with an old woman in the country. 92 retires from the service, and Ruth Dell, his daughter, obtains a situation as schoolmistress; and at a place called Onsted wo find the principal characters all collected round the focus of the Cherburys' country seat, Isaac Cherbury being the owner of the foundry where John Dell and Owen work. The mother Cherbury is a kind, simple-minded old soul, who patronizes Ruth and adopts little Mary Chideny, and is civil to Owen whenever he comes that way, which he does as often as possible, being very much in love with Ruth Dell. Ruth has, however, another lover?one Arthur Glinden, a young doctor, a jealous, exacting, irritable young man, who hates Owen mortally; but after several quarrels and reconciliations, Ruth eventually marries Glinden; and Owen goe3 out to Australia for six years. The author has the kindness and generosity not to insist on our following the hero to the antipodes, so wo are left Dehind with the Dells and Cherburys till Owen and Tarby Chideny return at the end of the six years, both with a little money. Owen set3 up in business with John Dell, and Tarby with his old enemy 92. Then a series of lovers' quarrels and anxieties begin. Owen finds Mary a very pretty and well-educated young lady, quite ready to marry him whenever he wishes it. But he fixes a twelvemonth as a time of trial, in consideration of bis ward's youth and inexperience?he being all the time terribly jealous of Isaac Cherbury, an eccentric gentleman, subject to bad headaches. Ruth is not happy with her husband, who is still jealous of Owen; and when he is happily disposed of by a railway accident, Mary begins to be jealous of the go un of tic th< m< dr D? ?? Oi lai an su fu th st Pi ai cc ac ri] in w D tl Ol ir b t( n si s< a a widowed Ruth, Owen's first love; and so they go on making themselves and each other very uncomfortable about nothing, after the manner of lovers, and it takes a great deal of explan*. tion and trouble to set them all to-rights again, they being what Mr. Cherbury would eau " very fussy people." The rest of the story relates to Owen's mother, who turns up again constantly, always drunk and abusive and disreputable; and John Dell, it seems, knew her and loved her in her youth, and will not desert her now, so he and Owen try in vain to reclaim her, and she at last dies in a refuge for the destitute, established and supported by Owen; and Ruth Glinden succeeds in bringing about a kind of unsatisfactory death-bed repentance. The moral of the wnole seems to be this?that Owen was a stern, hard, moral man, with no real religious principle. " If he had thought more of God and less of himself," his mother declares, he could have saved her eight years before. Owen acted and worked and strove to do what was right; but he had no heaven-born softening influence at his heart, so his efforts to do good were unsuccessful. Ruth and Mary and John Dell were thorough Christians, and therefore they succeeded better, and were able to carry out Owen's plans. We are, in all probability, intended to believe that Owen eventually became an altered man; but that is rather left to our imagination than stated as a fact. The main impression left on our minds is, that the story is wearisome, the conversations and descriptions well written, but wanting in interest, and that the events are* like angel visits, few and very far between.

Nov 16, 1861  ENGLISH LITERATURE - 19th Century|ENGLISH LITERATURE - 20th Century
The Athenaeum  : 1777 652 - 652
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notice to Quit. By W. G. Wills. 3 vols. (Hurst & Blackett).?Thia is an excellent novel?pleasant to read; and the moral thread that runs throughout is delicately spun, and not too obtrusive. There are sketches of real events, which are very well done,?the description ofthe making of the railway between Manchester and Liverpool, and the account of the draining of Chat Moss are very spirited. Mr. Gowan, the old stoker, who has become rich and dabbles in engineering patents, is a racy Lancashire sketch taken from the life,?his rivalry with George Stephenson, his geniality and rough good nature, his energy and natural talent, are all true to the type; he looks like one of the old Norse giants. Mr. Brone, the man of genius, with his real talent, and the vein of hollowness that underlies all hia moral qualities, the touch of falseness that makes all his intellectual qualities worthless, is well contrasted with the stubborn rectitude and strong veracity of Surgeon Heath. The triumphant success of Brone, and the heavy cloud of misunderstanding, calumny and poverty which Surgeon Heath has to encounter, hia silent, generous unselfishness, and the wily, calculated ostentation of Brone, who continues to reap the advantage of all that Heath does, is a good representation of the problem of Life, which struck King David as so hard, and on which he pondered till he was tempted to say, " surely I have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency"; but the career of both men is worked out to the end; and then it is seen that even if it were to bring no world of success, still, that a wise man would choose to be honest! This is not set forth in a homily, but unobtrusively shown in the natural progress of the story. The book is full of incidental scenes and sketches, which are excellent. The drawback to the volume lies in a certain dryness and harshness of style which are not pleasant; the reader feels this, without at first discerning the cause. Style is not everything; there are other qualities that rank before it; but style goes a great way to make a book pleasant reading. ' Notice to Quit' is a great improvement on the author's last work, 4 Life's Foreshadowings.'

Be this as it may, Rienzi has continued to grow in esteem, and is almost as much in de. mand at the libraries now as it was when first published. In the present form it may be possessed for little inore than the price at which it is to be borrowe(l, printed very bemutifully, on the best paper, neatly put into cloth boards, and illustrated with an engraving. Besides these attractions there is a preface by the author, written specially for this edition, in which he states that his aim was to adhere to history strictly in hisfact-, and through this medium of fictitious personages to endleavour to exhibit the causes of those facts. The theory is ingenious, and lie has not been unsuccessful in working it out. I

Untold, the Last of the Saxon Kings. LOUDON, SATURDAY, JUNE 17, 1848. REVIEWS By the "*A?th'or of' Rienzi,' * The Last of the Barons,' &c. 3 vols. Bentley. \x will be a misfortune attending the criticism of this new, and in many respects able, work of Sir E. Bulwer Ly ton, that those who write on it?and indeed those who read it?can scarcely determine whether to treat it as history or as fiction. If as history, it is written with too much of the air of mere invention; if as fiction, it includes too many of the details ofthe chronicler*. This is an evil attending the choice of the subject,?and one which, though many have made the attempt, only one author of the class has been able in any great degree to overcome. To tbis rare, and almost wonderful, exception it is not necessary that we should more expressly refer; but we must add that even in that case the experiment, however generally successful, occasioned many important distortions and perversions of facts,?and we will venture to say that it has produced, especially in the present generation, much doubt, confusion and error as to characters, opinions, and events. These observations are in a manner challenged by Sir E. B. Lytton's dedicatory preface, and by the notes which he has placed at the foot of his page and appended to each of his volumes. They appear to set up a claim for his fiction, notwithstanding his denial of the pretension, to the dignity and, importance of history. We hold it impossible to reconcile the two satisfactorily. Either let us have a production of mere fancy, or let us have a book depending mainly on its facts and statements the value of which can be measured by ordinary and known standards. The author commences with informing us that he has abandoned thc usual course of historical narrative in his incidents:?he makes a merit of perverting what has hitherto been received in relation to the connexion between Harold and Edith. "We admit at once that, for his purpose, he had 1 reason for making the change?because itrenders the story not merely more interesting, but on every account more readable. On this point Sir E. B. Lytton observes :?" The love ?tory of Harold nnd Edith is told differently from the well-known legend, which implies a leis pure connexion. But the whole legend respecting the Edeva faira (Edith the fair) whose name meets us in the Doomsday Roll, rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance; and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal, but which, on many accounts, I hope, may be intrusted fearlessly to the young." That is to wy, he made this important deviation because he did not wish to have his novel banished from drawing-room tables and the boudoirs of 'he ordinary readers of such productions. We should have complained less of aberrations of this kind if the writer had not been rather ostentatious of his authorities; from "hich he clearly means it to be inferred that ?n all the main incidents of his story he has adhered to the most authentic representations. *e do not dispute that in many instances he lias done so,*?but we think that he has thereby rendered his work less attractive. His archae*>gy spoils his book as a fiction?just as his departures from the same injure it as history, he has thus put a curb on his imagination, both ??regardspersons and events,?and would have produced a better and more popular work had he subjected himself to none of these restraints. As it is, the old figure of a man dancing a hornpipe in fetters recurs to the reader. We may be surprised that he can do so well, thus loaded, ?but feel sure that he could have done much better, unencumbered. In fact, the author has most succeeded where he has most rejected the inconvenient restraints to which he elsewhere submitted; and those portions of his three volumes will be read with most pleasure where he has given way to the variety and gracefulness of his own fancy and the vigour and boldness of his own imagination. The description, for instance, of all that relates to the war of Harold against Gryffyth, in Wales, is unsurpassed in interest and power by anything from his pen. We will select our first specimen from this part of Vol. II.; premising that Gryffyth, his queen, and his starving followers have been shut up in a mountain fastness, and that Harold, by a monk and a young Norman, has sent them a message of mercy on submission.? " As the monk ceased, the thrill of the audience was perceptible, and a deep silence waa followed by a general murmur, as if to constrain the King. Then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man. The red spot flushed the dark cheek, and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow. He made one stride towards thc monk, and said, in a voice loud, and deep, and slow, rolling far up the hill,?*Monk, thou hast said; and now hear the reply ofthe son of Llewellyn, the true heir of Roderic the Great, who from tlie heights of Eryri saw all the lands of the Cvmrian sleeping under the dragon of Uther. King was I bom, and king will I die. I will not ride by the bide of the Saxon to the feet of Edward, the son of the spoiler. I will not, to purchase base life, surrender the claim, vain before men and the hour, but solemn before God and posterity?the claim of my line nnd my people. AU Britain is ours?all the Island of Pines. And the children of Hengist tire traitors and rebels?not the heirs of Ambrosius and Uther. Say to Harold the Saxon, " Ye have left us but the tomb of the Druid and the hills of the eagle; but freedom and royalty are ours, in life and in death?not for you to demand them, not for us to betray." Nor fear ye, O my chiefs, few, but unmatched in glory and truth; fear not ye to perish by the hunger thus denounced as our doom, on these heights that command the fruits of our own fields! No, die we may, but not mute and revengeletw. Go back, whispering warrior; go back, false son of Cymry?and tell Harold to look well to his walla and his trenches. We will vouchsafe him grace for his grace?we will not take him by surprise, nor under cloud of the night. With the gleam of our spears ami the clash of our shields, we will come from tho hill; and, famine-worn as he deems us, hold a feast in his walls which the vultures of Snowdon illume their pinions to share !'*?' Rash man and unhappy!' cried the monk; 'what curse drawest thou down on thy head! W'ilt thou be the murtherer of thy men, in strife unavailing and vain ? Heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt causeto be shed.'?' Be dumb !?hush thy screech, lying raven!' exclaimed Gryffyth, his eyes darting tire, and his slight form dilating. ' Once, priest and monk went before us to inspire, not to daunt; and our cry, Alleluia ! was taught us by the saints ofthe Church, on the day when Saxons, fierce and many as Harold's, fell on the field of Maes-Garmon. No, the curse is on the head of the invader, not on those who defend hearth and altar. Yea, as the song to the bard, the cursk leaps through my veins, and rushes forth from my lips. By the land they have ravaged; by the gore they have spilt; on these crags, our last refuge; below the carn on yon heights, where the Dead stir to hear me,?I launch the curse of the wronged and the doomed on the children of Hengist! They in turn shall know the steel of the stranger?their crown shall be shivered as glass, and their nobles bc as slaves in the lund. And the line of Hengist and Cerdic shall be rased from the roll of empire. And the ghosts of our fathers shall glide, appeased, over the grave of their nation. But we?we, though weak in the body, in the soul shall be strong to the last! The ploughshare may pass over our cities, but the soil shall be trod by our steps, and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards. Nor, in the great Judgment Day, shall any race but the race of Cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth, to answer for the sins of the brave.' So impressive the voice, so graud the brow, and sublime the wild gesture of the King, as he thus spoke, that not only the monk himself was awed ; not only, though he understood not the words, did the Norman knight bow his head, as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct, flashes out from the cloud,?but even the sullen and wide-spreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment. But the spearmen and multitude above, excited by the tidings of safety to life, and worn out by repeated defeat, and the dread fear of famine, too remote to hear the King, were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators, creeping from rank to rank; and already they begun to sway and move, and sweep slowly down towards the King. Recovering his surprise, the Norman again neared Gryffyth, and began to re-urge his mission of peace. But the chief waived him back sternly, and said aloud, though in Saxon:?' No secrets can pass between Harold and me. Thus much alone, take thou back as answer:?I thank the Earl, for myself, my Queen, and my people. Noble have been his courtesies as foe; as foe I thank him?as King, defy. The torque he hath returned to my hand, he shall see again ere the sun set. Messengers, ye aro answered: withdraw and speed fast, that we may pass not your steps on the road.' The monk sighed, and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle; nnd a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there, that the King was alone in his fierce defiance. Then lifting again the rood, he turned away, and with him went the Norman." The above, and nearly all that belongs to it, is invention,?and very admirably invented it is. We know nothing much more animating and inspiring than the whole that relates to the Cat-King (as GryfTyth is called by the Norman), his struggles, his defeats, and his suffering.*. We venture to think that Sir E. B. Lytton w much mistaken when he represents, not merely the clergy, but the young soldiers and courtiers of the reign of the Confessor as well acquainted with the literature of Greece and Rome. It is true that as regards abbots and monks he is, in compensation, very severe. He does justice to such ecclesiastics as Lanfranc and Aclred; but he makes an abbot who figures prominently in one or two scenes ignorant ofthe commonest rudiments of Latin,?while a younger brother in his company is lost in wonder at the learning of his superior. The following is a short part of their dialogue.? "' The King's Norman favourites at least honoured the Church.'?' That is true,' said an abbot, 4 and, an it were not for two things, I should love the Norman better than the Saxon.'?' What are they, my father ?'?asked an aspiring young monk.?. 'Inprints," quoth the abbot, proud of the one Latin word he thought he knew, but that, as we see, was an error; 'they cannot speak so as to be understood, and I fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning.' Here was a sanctified groan:?'Count William himself spoke to me in Latin !' continued the abbot, raising his eyebrows.?' Did he ??Wonderful !' exclaimed several voices. 'And what did you answer, holy father?'?'Marry,'said the abbot solemnly, 'I replied, "Inprinis."'?'Good!' said the young monk, with a look of profound admiration." We have introduced this extract by way of contrast with the learning attributed to other classes. Even of GryfTyth, the Cat-King of Wales, we are told that "his mind had turned from the literature of Rome to the legends and songs and chronicles of his land;" nnd other personages, both Saxon and Norman, refer to Greek and Latin authors with fur too much familiarity. Homeric fables and Homeric personages are mentioned and alluded to by the characters; and though we may be willing to admit that more learning existed among our Anglo-Saxon forefathers than has by many been supposed, yet we most seriously doubt whether it is consistent with the state of knowledge of the time to put quotations from Horace into the mouth of a young soldier,?still more, that he should employ such in conversation with a rude Saxon from the weald of Kent. Of course, what the author introduces on his own account and in his own person in the progress of the narrative is not liable to any such objection ; and whether it did or did not require to be translated in a.d. 1052, it is quite clear that Sir E. B. Lytton is of opinion that it requires to be translated in a.d. 1848,?for we cannot call to mind an instance in which he has employed a scrap of Latin where he has not done his readers the favour to render it into English. Whatever might be the case in England in the eleventh century, wo are sure that Greek was not studied in Italy even in thc thirteenth century,?and that Dante knew nothing of Homer unless at second-hand. In connexion with this matter, we may here not unfitly notice the great number of Saxon and Anglo-Saxon words employed by Sir E. B. Lytton without explanation, even where explanation seemed most necessary. If the absence of this explanation should have the effect of inducing the readers of * Harold' to make themselves in some degree proficients in the great and noble language of their remote ancestors, so much thc better ; but in the mean time it might not have been improper to have added an interpretation, in brackets or otherwise ? provided it were really necessary that the author should go out of his way to employ terms so little understood by the great body of persons to whom he addresses himself. Sometimes the context will enable the reader to guess what is meant; but generally, we think, he will be quite at a loss for the meaning. We copy a few?and but a few?regarding which, we are confident, even well-educated persons will be at some loss: ?weregeld, lithtmen, ceorl suhcendinen cyst, mane uses, dour, cnehts, quern : which, with many more, are of perpetual occurrence. We say nothing of such words as thegn, which might have been more intelligibly and less cacophonously written thane,?or of zemmes, which Sir E. B. Lytton himself seems sometimes to use indifferently with gems,?but we should like to know what is gained by the rejection of a word having the same meaning and in daily employment. The author seems to have *'crammed" himself from Mr. D'Eyncourt's folios (as he admits in his prefatory epistle)?and then fancied that matters familiar to him must also be well known to others. This is an ordinary error. The great reputation which the author has justly acquired enables him easily to afford that such minor faults and blemishes should be pointed out. For this reason, we tell him that ne is not to suppose, because he sees in a plan of London of the middle of the sixteenth century two rings marked down for the baiting of bulls and bears, and because the sport may be mentioned by Fitzstephen, that these places existed on the same spot in the middle of the eleventh century. His mention of these rings forms part of a very interesting, but not a very accurate, description of London before the Conquest, in his first volume. The truth is, that we have no sufficient materials for such a description; and on this account we are willing to take Sir E. B. Lytton's fanciful representation,? which is highly picturesque. He is seldom at fault when he relies on himself and his own resources. One instance to the contrary may, however, be pointed out near the end of his second volume; where William, then Count? or Duke?of Normandy challenges Harold to bend his bow,?an exertion to which the Saxon noble is not accustomed, and which therefore he declines. The meaning of bending a bow is not, as Sir E. B. Lytton seems to imagine, the pulling of a cloth-yard arrow to the head after the bow has been strung; it is stringing a bow, ?an operation requiring both art and strength, and dangerous to the weak and the unskilful. Of the story itself we have said little; because the rude outline of nearly the whole of it is to be found in history?if history it deserve, at that early date, to be called. Tlie loves of Harold and Edith form but a small portion of the tale; ?and as that is the most imaginative portion, so iu several respects it is the best. The character of the heroine is delicately and touchingly drawn ; and her feminine sweetness and tenderness are excellently set off by, and contrasted with, the more masculine proportions and appearance of Hilda, her magical and mysterious grandmother,?who, from first to last, acts a very prominent part in all that relates to Harold's affection and to his ambition. She is a very grand personage, who adheres to the Saxon faith, rejecting the Christian creed, and resorts to all the solemn and awful incantations belonging to her ancient superstitious. It must be confessed that she now and then reminds us of Norna in Sir W. Scott's ' Pirate,' and of Meg Merrilies in his ? Guy Mannering'; but it is only for a moment,?and in such a manner as could not have been avoided by the author. What follows is a small part of a scene in which the two lovers and Hilda are introduced, in the second volume.? " * There is no joy for me,' returned Edith plaintively; 'and I have that on my heart," she added, with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone, * which at last I will dare to speak. I reproach thee, Hilda, that thou hast marred all my life; that thou hast duped me with dreams, and lett me alone in despair.'?' Speak on,' said Hilda, calmly, as a nurse to a froward child.?' Hast thou not told me, from the first dawn of my wondering reason, that mv life and lot were interwoven with?with (the word, mad and daring, must out) with those of Harold the peerless ? But for that, which my fancy took from thy lips as a law, I had never been so vain and so frantic; I had never watched each play of his face, and treasured each word from his lips; I had never made my life but a part of his life?all my soul but the shadow of his sun. But for that, I had hailed the calm of the cloister?but for that, I had glided in peace to my grave. And now?now, O Hilda?' Edith paused, and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command. 'And,' she resumed quickly, 'thou knowest that these hopes were but dreams?that the law ever stood between him and me?and that it was guilt to love him.'?' I knew the law," answered Hilda,' but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird. Ye are sibbe to each other, some five times removed; and therefore an old man at Rome saith that ye ought not to wed. When the shavelings obey the old man at Rome, and put aside their own wives and frillas, and abstain from the wine cup and the chase and the brawl, I will stoop to hear of their laws,?with disrelish it may be, but without scorn. It is no sin to love Harold; and no monk and no law shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together, form and heart"?' Hilda! Hilda! madden me not with joy,' cried Edith, starting up in rapturous emotion, her young face dyed with blushes, and all her renovated beauty so celestial that Hilda herself was almost awed, as if by the vision of Freya, the northern Venus, charmed by a spell from the halls of Asgard.? ' But that day is distant,' renewed the Vaia_' What mattera! what matters!' cried the pure child of Nature; 'I ask but hope. Enough,?oh! enough, if we are but wedded on the borders of the grave!" ?' Lo, then,' said Hilda,' behold, the sun^fthTS dawns again!' As she spoke, the Vaia stretchy her arm, and, through the intersticed columns of th fane, Edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward. Presently into the space of the eire! came Harold, her beloved. His face was pale jjiv grief yet recent; but, perhaps more than ever,diiaj.v was in his step and command on his brow, for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of Saxon England. And what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of man as the pare sense of power responsible in an earnest soul??Thon comest,' said Hilda, 'in the hour I predicted; atthe setting ofthe sun and the rising of the star.'?' Vak1 said Harold, gloomily, ? I will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies; for who shall judge of that powet of which he knows not the elements ? or despaetht marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture.'" The earlier portion of the story is perhaps too much made up of obscure history to be very interesting; and the only incidents in the first volume that may be said really to belong to a novel consist of the return of Earl Godwin and his four sons from banishment, and the declaration by Harold of his love for Edith,?who, as we have seen, stood within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity to him. The incidents acquire a more rapid movement in the second volume,?and the interest is powerfully wound up in the third. They, therefore, who pause and look back when they have arrived at the end of 300 pages will feel dissatisfied; let them wait until they have finished the whole, and their dissatisfaction will then be that they have come to the end of the work. It is not unusual in productions of this clan to find that the person intended for the hero ii not the hero in fact. Such, in a degree, is the case with Harold. In various parts of tht story he is not so much its hero as William, Duke of Normandy, the victor at Hastings; and Sir E. B. Lytton has drawn the character of William with such force and fulness that when ht and Harold are together it is not to be disputed that William attracts more attention, if not interest, than his younger rival. We do not say that the affections of the reader are not with Harold; but the genius, the resources, the mental power and subtlety of William engross our admiration,?and would make us feel certain, even if we knew nothing historically of the issue, that he must triumph. We admit all along the courage and generosity of Harold; but, as the author tells us, his parts are comparatively slow,?and when in Normandy he was outwitted, and would have been more so, hut for the sagacity and penetration of his little nephew Haco. This may be true as history, bot it is not right as art?and here we have a particular example of the difficulties of the historical novel. We cannot go thoroughly and heartily along with any hero whom we expect to set duped, and who we know in the end will be conquered.

The Works of Lord Byron. Vols. V. and VI. l6mo. Murray. POETRY has its superstitionists, as well as religion; and such persons should ever recollect, that they are seeking for pleasures in an art which is dependent upon the passions, not upon reason, not upon music, not upon mathematics. The effect is every thing; and although in nature extravagance or folly may denote an insanity which excites a laugh, there are nevertheless acts of demoniacs or lunatics, even of idiots, which produce both wonder and terror, and under such impressions nobody smiles. " Great wits to madness nearly are allied;" but, notwithstanding their eccentricity, to measure the poetical mind in its paroxysm of fine frenzy with a yard, like a linen-draper, resembles the application of the rule and compasses to electricity and vapour. There is no beauty or sublimity in mere smoke, but there is in certain forms of clouds composed of it; and yet the agent is a thing without parts or passions ; and when we reason about the virtues or vices of an author, we are talking about the stones or other materials of a building, instead of the form which gives it character. If we are maddened by the thrilling sound of the trumpet; why should we then condemn it, because it is not made of gold, but brass ? Now, there are those who may judge of the quality of goods by the excellence of the work, not the moral character of the manufacturer. Corruptions, it is true, may be intermixed, and be not only offensive, but dangerous, and, as such, be justly proscribed. So far to smooth our reception. We can add nothing to the endless discussions about Lord Byron. He had a most wonderful imagination, and knew that not to give it scope would be ruin, would be setting thunder and lightning to a tune to be played upon a fiddle. A true poet, the grandeur and beauty of nature was his study; and that is to be seen in the heroic savage, not in the clock-work man of business. We do not say that the former character is consistent with the existence of civilized society; no more are rocks and mountains with the formation of a good corn-bearing farm; but people who delight in the sublime and picturesque, do not seek it in Holland, but in Switzerland. They who go to see the play of Macbeth, do not expect to hear a lecturing Aristotle. Now there is in Byron every essential constituent of poetry ; and especially that very rare quality of it?the sublime. Byron is, as to poets in general, the archangel ruined among the brownies, Pucks, Robin Goodfellows, and the various sorts of monkey devils. His expanded wings make an eclipse; and when he flies, we feel his presence by a supernatural awe and sulphurous atmosphere. What was not violent was to him insipid. He would have had mankind always in batde; the wind always in a hurricane ; the day always stormy, with- out sunshine; and the night infuriated with thunder and lightning. But, notwithstanding, we would no more part with Byron, than we would with Milton; nor do we think that he who has no feeling of the sublime could elevate our nature beyond that of a passionless machine. But where there are not passions there cannot be happiness, and where those passions are not intermixed with the mind, "no abstract intellectual felicity; and what is existence worth, if, in the words of our author, it is only " Born to be ploughed with years, and sown with cares, And reap'd by death."?p. 264. Of course, after what we have said, we do not open Byron as we would enter a toy-shop, merely to look at pretty trifles, but as we would visit ^Etna or Vesuvius. In the sublime drama called " Heaven and Earth," we have Byron in full eruption. The following passage relative to the day before the Flood, flames with majesty: " Tbe abhorred race Which could not keep in Eden their high But listen'd to the voice [place, Of knowledge without power, Are nigh the hour Of death! [row, Not slow, not single, not by sword nor sorNor years, nor heart-break, nor time's sapping motion, [morrow! Shall they drop off. Behold their last toEarth shall be ocean! And no breath, [wave. Save of the winds, be on the unbounded Angels shall tire their wings, but find no spot; Not even a rock from out the liquid grave Shall lift its point to save, Or show the place where strong despair hath died ; After long looking o'er the ocean wide For the expected ebb, which cometh not, All shall be void, Destroy'd. Another element shall be the Lord Of life, and the abhorr'd [hue Children of dust be quench'd, and of each Of earth, nought left but the unbroken blue; And of the variegated mountain Shall nought remain Unchanged, or of the level plain ; Cedar and pine shall lift their tops in vain ; All merged within the universal fountain; Man, earth, and fire shall die, And sea and sky Look vast and lifeless in the eternal eye. Upon the foam Who shall erect a home ?" In the love-songs, there are many 'of the rose tint and odour. We are particularly pleased with the following: " And wilt thou weep when I am low ? Sweet lady, speak those words again; Yet if they grieve thee, say not so : I would not give that bosom pain. My heart is sad, my hopes are gone, My blood runs coldly through my breast; And when I perish, thou alone Wilt sigh above my place of rest. And yet, methinks, a gleam of peace Doth through my cloud of anguish shine, And for awhile my sorrows cease, To know thy heart hath felt for mine. Oh lady, blessed be that tear! It falls for one who cannot weep; forme na jamais raison la premiere Jins,' we wish to wait events. Such precious drops are doubly dear To those whose eyes no tear may steep. Sweet lady! once my heart was warm With every feeling soft as thine ; But Beauty's self hath ceased to charm A wretch created to repine. Yet wilt thou weep when I am low ? Sweet lady, speak those words again; Yet if they grieve thee, say not so; I would not give that bosom pain." It is evident, by the improvement which imitation creates, that the publication of works of splendid genius is productive of public good; and the more pleasure is derived from intellectuality, the weaker will be the hold of passion and vice. The poems here edited exhibit notthe goats' feet of Pan, as in " Don Juan," but the " ex pede Herculem ;" and we sincerely rejoice that real literary jewels are attainable at a price below that of common Jewimitations, of mere tyronian verse. Lastly, we would have those who weigh Byron as Michael is said to have weighed souls, to recollect that Byron was not a coal who was burnt in a grate, but one distilled into gas; converted into flame, not cinder. Now, without disputing the utility of the fossil under the latter process, its more glorious form is that of brilliant light. A character purely intellectual is that of a disembodied spirit; and it is not without its very important uses; for were it not for abstract ideas overpowering sense, how could man acquire superiority; or how could he think that he had an immortal spirit ? The action of sense upon the.soul is in such characters all that is sought from material pleasures ; and that forms the difference between the philosophical and glutton voluptuary.

The Power Behind. By M. P. WILLCOCKS. (Hutchin- son and Co. 6s.) A VERY great deal of careful thought and consideration has gone to the construction of this novel. It is no lightly thrown together story, relying for its effect upon one incident to which all else is subservient; there is enough material in the book for several short stories or sketches, and undoubtedly this would have been the best way of presenting them, for the binding holding them together is very loose indeed. Sophie, the granddaughter of an old sweetheart of Dr. Revel, is brought as a tiny child to live with the doctor and his dour, exacting, and severe wife. The doctor is an easy-going man, with rationalist tendencies and a great love for ornithology. He brought the child up to appreciate the beautiful and to be kind to all living things, but hardly fitted her to battle with life. Some little time after his death we find Sophie occupying a subordinate position at a farm and hostel owned by a family named Botterill. Living at the farmstead are three generations of Botterills, and it is in the drawing oC these three men that some of Miss Willcocks' best work is put forth, the subtle suggestion of heredity taking a different form in Sampson, Nicholas, and Moysey Botterill, and the manner in which each maintained the traditions of his ancestors. The Sophie traced for us until her guardian's death is consistent with her upbringing and easy to follow; but we search in vain for any further development. She is like the traveller who, coming to a spot where the road branched in two directions, tried each in turn several times and never continued very far along either. The reader cannot follow her step by step and feel that only one course was possible and must be pursued to its inevitable termination. This is probably because, reaching womanhood, love naturally clamoured for a place in Sophie's world, and we would hazard the opinion that the intellectual delineation of a person's character is more to the author's taste than matters of the heart. There are various indications that she has not escaped the spirit of unrest now hovering over the female population of these islands; hence her indefinite handling of Sophie's character. Nevertheless, no part of the story should be missed, for the incidents, taken separately, will be well worth the time spent in reading them.

Lucy Aikin has here produced j one of those episodes belonging to our national .: annals which add to the importance of facts ? | elaborated from many a source, all the charms ' i which are usually found in the inventions of ?'fiction. The period ol' the first Charles bas , ? been so often investigated, and so thoroughly i: discussed by the political partisans who stu1-; ?'reeded to the principles of those by whom the ? tragic drama was carried on and consummated, ?'that ir. would be a waste of repetition on our : j parts to enter upon any of the political topics' i which have been so warmly controverted.

The progress of luxury in dress, diet, fur. ' uiture, and decorations of every kind, had lally kept pare with the extension of commerce aiel the increase of national wealth. In the arti, h ;of court-dresses, especially those of nu n. the extravagance was such as no succeeding t:;i"" have attempted to emulate.

But the ilelicieacy was felt, and steps had already been ' taken fur enriching the countrv with a Mort; of lii'i-e immortal models bequeathed to the world j !?}'(iterian antiquity.

In the works of j Acontius, a man ol' abilities and various learn- j inir, who wrote under the patronage of Queen j Elizabeth, the following striking observation i 'occers:?'

' 1 believe.' says l'avle, in com-1 . meriting on this sentiment,' that the sixteenth [ century produced a greater number of men of learning than the seventeenth, yet the former ! age was not .nearly so enlightened as the latter. During the reign of criticism and philology several prodigies of erudition appeared through- j [out Europe. The study of the new philosophy i and of modern languages having introduced a' different taste, that vast and profound literature was no longer seen; but. on the other, hand, a filter taste has been dilt'used over the j republic of letters, attended by a more accurate : discernment. Mt'n are now less learned and i more able.' in conformity with these re-j marks, it is evident, that itt tiie period of; Charles's accession a lively curiosity after new j and various knowledge had begun to take, place in England ol' that exclusive devotion to I the ancients which lad prevailed from tin; lime j ol' the revival ol'letters; that few men aimed! at distinction by ciuuiating the cumbrous ern-j dinon of the founders of modern scholarship;! ;ind that general information began to be more! prized than what is technically called learning.! We lind it alarmed, that few works (d'merit j appeared in any coentry oi' Europe which were not speedily clothed iu an English dress. * * * j '? Female education, in the higher class, appears to have shared in the extension given to the objects of liberal pursuit. * * * " The progress of society was last leaving, behind the m;mners and institutions of the! feudal ages. * '* j " From this survey of the commerce, the arts, the luxury, the literature, the education, and I the manners of the age," the author, having j entered into many particulars too long lor quotation, observes, '? we may certainly conclude the general state of the country itt the accession ol'Charles I. to have been highly prosperous and rapidly improving. To its felieitv. however, au important alloy was lound in the abuses which had crept into the administration of justice ;ind every other department of civil government, through tho rapacity and corruption of men in power, and the a rbi tra rv spirit of the prince, which inclined him to disdain the limits of law and the control of parliament; and also in the oppression to which large bodies of peaceable subjects were exposed through the operation of unjust and cruel laws enacted for the enforcement of religious conformity. From many feigns and tokens, sagacity might have predicted, that whatever might be the jiersonal qualities of the successor of .Fames I., it was on conflicts between the maxims of passive obedience in | church and state, and the rising spirit of civil j and religious liberty amongst a moral and enlightened people, that the historic interest ol' i his reign and the crisis of bis fate must turn." Without; going into any other portion of these volumes, their spirit may be judged even I from the few insulated extracts within our I power to offer; and we shall only add, that all j the passages which relate to the munificent ; patronage of literature and the arts, and their i consequent progress till the fatal distractions I td' the country threw them into the grave of | puritanism and faction, are replete with in. j terest, and throw a melancholy lustre over i the troubled life and martyr-death of this hap.

NEW NOVELS. Roa0 of the World. By Agnes and Egerton Castle. (Smith, Elder & Co.) IT is possible that some readers will find a difficulty in rationalizing the conduct of Lady Gerardine, who is the heroine of Mr. and Mrs. Castle's latest novel. Lady Gerardine was formerly the wife of an English officer, for whom she had no confessed affection. On learning of his death in action, she marries, a little later, Sir Arthur Gerardine, the governor of an Indian province, whose pomposity and self-importance are excellently rendered by the authors. To her " enters " a certain Major Bethune, a friend and associate of her first husband, an obstinate, stiff man, with the request for Capt. English's papers, to assist him in his task of writing a memoir of the dead man. This Lady Gerardine flatly refuses, and it is only by a turning movement that the Major succeeds in getting what he wants; in other words, he secures the aid of Sir Arthur, who lays his commands upon his wife. Now the essence of this story is psychological, and it is Lady Gerardine's mind that is the subject. Here begins the first of the series of developments which furnish the story with its emotional values. The rationalization of a woman's heart is an absurdity on the face of its terms, so that there is no reason in the world why Lady Gerardine should not have moved upon the lines laid down. She had not loved her first husband, and she certainly did not love her second. So far she estranges sympathy. But one is driven by the authors' romantic investment of this Rose of the World into, first, a toleration, secondly a respect, and, lastly, an affection for her. The dead man's papers and letters, freshly read after a lapse of years, revive the past and the man. Unaccountably she had not opened his diary before. As she reads she realizes that she now loves the dead husband, the dead lover. To convince the reader of this required exquisite handling; but the authors have achieved their purpose. Awake to her realities now, the full shame of her situation pours upon the woman in a tide. This is treated with knowledge and insight, and with a certain courage and delicacy. It is probably the most subtle passage in the book. But we may not indicate the plot further. It will carry a reader along, and please those who stickle for happy endings. The value is not so much in plot as in psychology, and, as we have shown, this is entirely successful. The characterization is subordinated to the * Deutzia scabra. central study, but is quite adequate, and ti includes a very successful portrait of a young lo girl. Mr. and Mrs. Castle always write C with distinction and with oolour. If this is not the best of their novels it takes high b rank among them. a _ P

Tallangetta, the Squatter's Home: a Story ofj Australian Life. Bv William Howitt. 2 vols, (Longman & Co.) The Preface to these volumes is a singular example of absurdity. Mr. Howitt, intensely satisfied with his own performance, volunteers for the benefit of the reader a statement in behalf of a class of persons calling themselves, or called by their dupes, Spiritualists. He introduces a spiritualist, or hat and tableturner, into this story of Australian life, and endeavours to justify a stage-effect so monstrous by flinging a modest sneer at Prof. Faraday, and bursting into a digression on communications with departed friends, the Rosicrucian mysteries of Friar Bacon's Brazen Head, and a certain American Poet who has written things " among the finest since Shelley and Byron." We will not quote the passage that follows: to use a phrase of Mr. Howitt's, it is " smoke." From a plea for the irrational, he advances, by no natural process, to a panegyric upon himself. This is honest enough. We are gratified to learn that " a distinguished officer" in Victoria said " Mr. Howitt's volumes are not like the colony?they are the colony itself"; but it is more than amusing to find a long and somewhat ridiculous letter, from a gentleman who has never seen Australia, transcribed as a "still more remarkable testimony to the impressions of verisimilitude." With every willingness to credit Mr. Howitt as an accurate reporter upon life and realities in the Land of Gold, we cannot accept as " remarkable testimony" the opinion of a novelist who had merely " read some thirty books about that country," and found Mr. Howitt's " infinitely the best." Quitting the ill-considered and undignified Preface, we find in the novel a rather commonplace story, garnished with pictures, at once vivid and simple, of colonial life, especially among the squatters. We have, in fact, a nearer view of character and manners among the pastures and diggings than was afforded in the 'Two Years in Victoria.' Mr. Howitt opens his tale well, and in a way to excite an immediate interest. The curtain rises upon an old English family, wrongfully deprived of its possessions, journeying into the interior of Australia, to live at a station " until things take a new turn." The new turn is taken in due course, and the curtain descends upon the same family restored to England and to its rightful inheritance. The interval is filled with scenes in cities, and by flood and field, in the colony,?revolving, however, round Tallangetta, where the delicate squatters create a temporary home. Mr. Howitt paints a gallery of special portraits, and does his best to illustrate the kind of life led under such circumstances, in Australia, aa well as the human idiosyncrasies to be encountered, ?- as Dr. Spenser Grayson, the poet?Dr. Woolstan, the spiritualist?and Mr. Flavel, the seer. Not to repel the reader by dwelling upon these grotesque imaginings, we will extract a passage from a trial scene, in which Mr. Howitt's manner and the nature of his story are exemplified. A young man charged with murder is at the bar. An eccentric witness in his favour (Randall) has been badgered by the counsel for the prosecution.? " * Sir,' said Randall, * I have answered you many questions that have nothing whatever to do with the cause at issue; and now your position shall not protect you. I throw myself on the justice of the court, on the impartial spirit of my country's laws. I insist that you answer me one question. You have dared to probe my life, and endeavoured to blast my reputation before the world,?answer me this:?What did your father say when, at your vehement and repeated solicitation, he granted you a last secret interview beneath the Banshee Oak in Dunallen Park!' The haughty lawyer stood arrested at that question as by a supernatural blow which turned him to a statue. He appeared petrified by astonishment. 'My father; the Banshee Oak!' he stammered.?' Yes, your father! the Banshee Oak!' said Randall, outwardly calm, yet plainly and justly incensed. 'Your father, the venerable Loni Dunallen. Do you not see him,' said the homely-looking squatter, rising, as if inspired, and pointing to a particular part of the court, all eyes, uicludmg those of the terror-stricken lawyer, mechanically following liis finger?' do you not see him now, leaning on liis cane, shaken by grief as by a palsy, and his bare white head gleaming in the moonlight, as he says solemnly:? "You have banished your brother; you have killed your mother by a broken heart; you have disgraced your family; you have deceived and left utterly desolate your father, who now stands here alone before God in liis age. May you repent, repent; for rather would I see you lying dead on that Bod, than that the people of the Dunallen estates should ever fall into your power in your present unchristian, unregenerate temper.'" There was a sensation throughout the court, as if a thunderbolt had fallen on it. A death-like silence prevailed, and the proud counsel, who so lately had borne down all before him by his talent and audacity, suddeidy dropped on his seat, with his head on the table, and was even sliding to the floor, when some of the other counsel caught him, and had him borne from the court. The sensation throughout the crowd was inconceivable. No words could describe it. People, lawyers, all present sprung to their feet; all sense of order was lost. There was one loud buzz of voices expressing amazement at this most singular occurrence, and numbers hastening out to gain further intelligence of the stricken down man. At length the officers of the court restored some degree of attention. The judge, wonderfidly affected, rose and summed up, compelled several times to pause for composure; and when he dismissed the jury to consider their verdict, they almost instantly, by their foreman, pronounced, clear and loud, the words?' Not guilty.'" This is a melo-drama, but it is effectively worked up, and is a specimen of Mr. Howitt's narrative style. In description he is more felicitous. Take this sketch of the diggings.? "Twenty thousand people, at least, were all scuffling together like ants in an ant's nest, or tadpoles in a pool. The whole valley, through which ran the creek or brook, for several miles was in the act of being turned upside down. Close as the crowd could press upon each other so as to leave the prescribed number of feet for each party, they were digging, delving, throwing up earth, carrying away bags of it, supposed to contain the gold, to the creek, and there delivering it to other crowds who, at a long fine of cradles, were in as great a bustle, throwing in the earth, rocking it to and fro under deluges of water from tin dippers. There was an incessant noise of rattling cradles, and shouting voices. Strange figures all yellow with clay, and disguised in bushy beards, and veils to keep off the flies, seemed too desperately busy to have time to breathe. It was all one agitated scene of elbowing, swearing, hacking, hewing, and shovelling. Not a tree was left standing over the whole great space, and the sim flamed down on unsheltered heaps and holes of gravel, with a burning, sweltering force." The best chapters of this book are those which are more or less developments of Mr. Howitt's former volumes on Australia.

ATR"GARET DENZIL'S IISTORY.- Wn IIT:n ' Margaret Denzil's History " was runiiing its colre in the numb rs of the Cornit ill MI'azinca,.i, .1 variety of surmises were hazarded as to its authorship, generally incorrect, and in on instance strikingly absurd. It was attributed by one gosiper to Mr. ClirIes Allston Collins, and by another to Mrs. Gaskell.; a third recognised Mliss Thackeray's hand in it; a fourth was pOsitive that it was by Air. George AMacdonald; and some unknown oracle, inspired either by jocoseness or idiotey, proclaimed that it was written by no less dignified a personage thau the Queen. The story retains in its completed form the anonymousness which it Margaret Denzil s Hiurory. Annotated by her Husband. Two Vols. LondOu: Suith & Elder. preserved throughout its serial existence ; but we believe that we need not have any hesitation about inseribi)g on2 its titlepage as the atuthor's name that of Mr. Frederick Greenwood. It is strange that he should have thought it necessary to keep up his incognito, for the book is one which no livilng novelist need be ashamied to avow. It is written with (reat power ; its plot is original, its characters are treated with wonderful skill, and its laniguage deserves very great praise. To express at tall in words miany of the evanescent feelings and thouights which are represented its flitting through Aargraret Denzil's inijud, would have been no easy task ; yet Alr. (Greenwood has not only succeeded in relidering them articulate, but in inany instainces he hbis made their utterance its melodious ats it is intelligible. Margaret's inner life is full of poetry, blending with the music hich, .IS she .avys, is her "interpreter and muaster," andi her Lul(tnguae is cuIIstasitly suggCestive of their iuniison, while her husb;and's more prosaic nature is excellently typified by his simple and straightfrward speech. One great charini of the story is the -air of mystery which 1Iawgs about it. The book is one which should be readl 1 (Ijuiet and sec] ioin or much of its weird and dreaiiiy1 beauty ;wil be lost. 1Tere are passa.1g.s in it which. m11igh1t be lightly , i-<ed over by one who inct with theii in full sunlight, and :-eiTT 1'neil dby the busy hum of men, although1 they would exercise , stmge fascinlatioll, oVer him if he were to ratml thieal in the siliWIXO of the tight.

AMart aret's chairaeter is delineated with. reniarka;;lble delicacy -i d power. Her's is one of those highly-strung orgainizationl. icnch are over resp)onsive to all outer ifitcnuenes, alid oIn which the ; .Scori]S of life jar tuo painfully fr rest and c1itifurt. Of a thorolghly roitlItiC ntture, imitugination has more influence over her than IVeis , Alln1d 10A mnas her see, whenever she attempts to realize her life), at lnre enilIelliL-hefd story of her life. Her resolutions are the consequienices of impulse rather than of reflection, and after ev ry Lttenll)t to regumlate her cour;e upon fixed principles, she is olliged to yield herself to the current of events, and drift helplessly a;long with it. By no means stronrg-niiidedl, not even strong-willed, she is verI trusting and alfectionate, with an exquisitely keen atppreciation of all that is poetic and beautiful. S'ueh is the girl who, at the commencement of the story, is living with her ruppozed parents in a cottag'e afgainst which, she says, all the itnincts of her nature revolted-" so formnal and heavy with its walls of dull rt-d brick, its cold slate roof on which no 1,i',1 ever alighted, and its narrow windows staring like little Mfalityan eyes without eyebrows." Her chief happiness is to wand111cer about in the neighbouringr forest, and there one eveining the is roaming " in that state of double consciousness w hen the 5etses seem to think for themselves, and to leave the nind to its own indulgences." Down in a quiet pool, girt around by tree-, and overiihad.o)wed byv their branches, she takes it into her hia;la to bathe, and while bathing is nearly drowned. 'No oile whlo readlds then description of her adventure, of the strange ideas which flit acros;s her mkid, and of the singular niingaling of reality and unreality in what she sees and feels, will be content to lay down the book without nmakinr further accquaintance with it. The plis->ate forms in itself a delightful idyll, one which calls up a charming picture before the eye, and lingers musically on the ear. Her accident lead.s to her becomling adopted by her future hushaun'l, who takes her away froim the cottage in which she has been i)r'n Aht ip, and sends her to school. Ile is a kindly, true-hearted. .a;i'/r, whose misfortune it has been to become inarried to a wr-m-1;1n -who, without loving) him. the least, is inordinately jealous of lim. He does not venture to tell his wife about the child w0hom he has adopted], and who, as years pass by, grows into a bxealutiful girl. But at last MIrs. Denzil nmakes the discovery for htirulf. and about the sanle time her husband finds out that Ma1rnrgaret has become more dear to him than all the world be.>ides. Melnwhile, the (irl's quiet life has been troubled by a storm. The %fl of the mnistrtss of the school in which she lives, falls desDer;,i+ely in love * ith her, and she is by no nleans averse to hinm. Arthur Lainont is a very clever sketch. A thoroughly irresolute diatraclter, he is ever drifting about, the sport of circumstances, iflale to bear up agrainst adversity, or to turn prosperity to a---0lujt. Ile hit, excellent intentions, but he can never carry '>(&X1 out, and he has numerous good qualities for which he does riat get even the credit he deserves. In early life he allows him-cIf to be rufined for the benefit of a false friend, a man of an IUter selfish nature, who had been engaged to his sister CharLotte Iuit who breaks off the engageinent, making the ruin which isher. brought upon the brother the excuse for deserting the Charlotte remains. constant to the memory of the lover who havl treated her so ill, crushing all present enjoynent out of her heart, that she uay keep alive her sorrow for his loss, and sacrifiirl, ,all chances of future happiness on the altar of her unworthy dol She naturally (listrlists her brother, whom she regards as 'he e use of all her misery, and, when he falls in love with Mfararet, she determines to separate him from her. In this she SUCCeds, for she discovers a sccret which her brother would not &Ci AMargaret know for any consideration, and forces him to give up all pretensions to her hand. The scene in which the interview between the brother and sister is described is written with great power, and so is that which succeeds it, in whii h Alargaret, after bein, called iii to hear the result nf their discu.ssion, sits in her own room, almost unconscious of what has passed. Poor Arthur Lamont, driven wild by despair, is wandering outside in the darkness of the night, his thoughts bent on death, when suddenly he is arrested by the sound of her voice; for she had found that reflection was out of her power, and she had mechanically gone on with the verses of a hymnn, which she was singing when she was sutmmnoned to the roomu where the brother andF sister awaited ler. And as the sound floats out into the air, his resolution (gives way, and le falls sobbing beneath her window. She opens it, and bids hiiu a last farewell, and lhe disZappears for ever. Not till long afterwards does she learn his fate-iowv lie carried everywhere with hint a sorrowful recollection of the love he had lost, and how at last he dIed in a (listalit ulad, utterii-ngt her name with his LAt breath. Margaret falls ill, but recovers, and one (lay, when health has rettllrti(l to hi-r, she is surprised by an offer froin Mr. Denzil. H is w ife, he tells hier, is dead, and lie is free, SO hle asks her to iArry himii ; and he '' tired of roflnjace, ,slipieious of sentiment, sober at heart, ald -every conscious of helplessnjess," .accepts him.

It was ais if soinethinl wiser thlzai imyelf told tue I slhould imarry mny kind guardian, and be safe." Anid so the guardian and the ward are imarried, and a time of quiet happiness for buth of them ensutes, hle seeClhill h4 to grow young(fer and brighter every day, " like a m1ian who conies home to renew his earlier cheetfulness and vig(Jur, after years of travail and privation in s ;me n'eiote, inclement lanl," anld she feeling towards hini " a ciilident, gratefifl, (jliet loVe-fltioiC)tII without ral)ture, but not without repose"-perfect content, p1elfct faith that, surroundled by his care, she would " bC kept alae an(d warm in the iIidAt of a cold and danigerous world.'

The womian whom she used to look upon as her mnother, but who, as she now learns, was onlly her foster-miother, gains access to her house, and, aided by a imalicious neighbour, a 1)r.

Mlargaret asks hint a qnestion to whichl he is unable to make a reply, spell-bound by a secret -which weiguhs upon his m1ind, and she, evr acting on impulse, leaves his house, and, taking her child with ber, goes first to Madame Lanilnt, a:lnd then to SOlile friends of that lady in Paris. We need not give an explanation of the mystery in which she and her husband are involved. Time enables Margaret to solve it for herself, and she discovers that she lh~as wronged hill and that she may return to him without Iisniv is)g . So she hlastens hiomie full of expectation (of the happiness that awaits her there; and, arriving quietly at the well-known house, tells the servant who admits her not to let Mr. DeZIzil know she has returned, and, stealiiv- to her room, prepares herself to give a surprise. ' Once upon a time, when my hulsbatnd stond at the foot of the stairs, and saw me descending in a certain simple ni ew dress, he l)awled out in the sing-song manncr in which children chant their rhymes, ' LD)wn she cstaie, as whito ais milk, A rose iM her bosom as soft as silk 2 I renmiembred it, and took care to wear the dress. rihere was no rose to wear, but I could put on a bracelet with his portrait in it and so I did. ' lh' hlhe'll uinderstand at a glance,' I said, as I viewed myself in a glass, after all these artful preparations were comnpleted; ' for I look-Nes, I do look well and glad! '" The scene which ensues is of a very painful aind unpleasant nature ; but the skill and power with which it is (le.scribt(dl give it a (Trim attraction. M.1argaret finds Dr. Calamy with her husband, and to her surprise Mr. I enzil appears stupitied at her entrance, not even t.akingf the hand she offers him. She tells hinM that she has beconle convinced that she had judged himn wron-ly, and that she has come back to be happy again with him. But all he answers is " Poor little girl ! and then, while the tears come intto his eyes, lie turns away front her to the wall. At last, the miserable truth comes out that Mr. Denzil's first wife is still alive, baving feigned (eath in order to satiate her jealous hatred of her husband and of MAlargaret. 1-laying contrived to delude him into the b~elief that she hlad committed suicide, shc had disguised herself so successfully that even he could not recognise her, and then, fs the pretended Dr. Calamy, indul-ed in the nmaliciou-s pleasure of sowing mischief between hinm and his new bride. And now, with all a mariac's excitement, she revels in the misery she has produced. SO ends the History. '1 he last we hear of Margaret is that she living with lher boy in seclusion. She has seen her husband once only since that fittal niighlt: "We were alone, with our boy upon my knees between us. Poor little Ishmael! he kickel and crowed in evident amu.3ernent while wo embraced together over him f)r the last time. For I could not and do not blame his father. I know hinm to have been honest at least, from first to last. And time may mend all yet: I dare o) say I hope so. Without such a hope-(wicked as you please)-we should be already, and in this life, 'portions and parcels of the- dreadfal past.' " As to Mr. Denzil, he returns to his old calling as a sailor, after having (iven tip to his first wife the fortune she had brteiight him, and seen her s-ail away with it to her former homne in Bermuda. He has been severely punished for his fault in first niarrying for money, and then falliiiw in love with a young girl wl)ilc he was still tied to an o01( w ife. So flr, morality is aveined ; but somie olbjectioni UUa3y possibly be nitdfle to the reader's sympathies being enlisted on the side of a married man's passion for any womanm but the one who legally belongs to him. We cannot help pitying Mr. 1)Dnzil ; but his cl;haracter,for which the author who invented imi iiis respon.}>1Wle, is open to censure. Mlargaret's is (quite uisullied, and its uca("tion is one of which AMr. Greenwood may well be proud. Ae sha.ll look forward with great interest to his next work ; but wu (;ca scarcely hope to find in it as charming a portrait as tlat of the heroine of the present history.

62   3160018   A DIPLOMATIST&apos;S WIFE IN JAPAN.
Sep 1899  BOOKS - REVIEWS|ENGLISH LITERATURE - Bibliography
The Bookman 16 : 96 164 - 165
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A DIPLOMATISr's WIFE IN JAPAN.0 I have not often oFeaed a more delightful book of travel than Mrs. Hugh Fraser's '"A Dij lomatist's Wife in Japan." The two hundred and fifty illustrations are also admirably chosen, though they are not always quite well enough reproduced. The head-pi.ces and tail-pieces, the oddments of illastration, if one may use such an expression, are delightfully Japanese, but they are not introduced with quite the daintiness that a Japanes2 would demani. I have stated these objections at the beginning of my review, because I have no others to urge. It must necessarily be classed as a bouk of travel, but it is really something better. It might, perhaps, be called a * "A D.plomati6C's Wdfe in Japaa." -y Mrs. Hugh Fraser. 2v vi. 36s. (HIutcbtn:on.) book of foreign residence. Mrs Fraser lived in Japan for some years. Her late husband was the British Minister to the Court of Japan before Sir E. M. S itow. S'le had, therefore, the entr6e to everything that a foreigner is admitted to see ia Japan, and she noted nearly everything she saw with sweet womanly sympathy and a woman's observant eye. She is molerate when she is on debatable grou-id, though sometimes she feels imp -lled to speak out strongly, which is gen~ral'v the case when she is discussing the undiplomatic behaviour of Englishmen, from Rclyal princes down to English merchants. That the Yokohama merchant has sometimes been aggressively English is not to be denied, but on the other hand, it is not to be deni d that our Ministers in JApan have sometimes eschewed the Yokohama English as if they were lepers, though until the Cniro-Japanese war created a new state of affairs in the far East, the only raison d 'ttre of our Minister in Japan was our having large merchant communities there. Mrs. Fraser's book is largely based on letters which she wrote while she was living in Japan. There is a great advantage in using old letters when one is writing a book of this kind, because those which are written during the first part of one's residence in a new country convey impressions much more clearly than those which are written when the conditions of the new couniry seem ordinary (though when Mrs. Fraser first went to Japan such extraordinary things as the sexes bathing together naked, and onus being drawn by riksha boys almost naked, were ordinary enough). On the other hand, the letters written during the later part of one's residence are naturally distinguished by a deeper knowledge and feeling. Mrs. Fraser, who is a sitter of the celebrated novelist, Marion Crawford, writes charmingly when she is engaged upon such a labour of love as a description of her dear Japan. None of her daily experiences seemed common or trivial to her. Perhaps in this matter her S Ruth Italian training stood her in good stead. Writing to relations still in Italy, it was natural that she should dwell on the things wh-ch constitute so much of the charm of both countries. In Japar, as in Italy, the masses are very poor and very simple, gentlemen--and artists-by nature, made cheerful and patient by spending the larger half of their year in a brilliant and exhilarating climate. Both are accustomed to venerable and exquisitely beautiful public buildings, small as well as large; both have picturesque religions very comforting to the poor. In both countries one's servants are apt to become one's friends, owing to the charm of their disposi ions and their natural grod taste. In both the common articles of dom.estic use among the poor are wonderfully elegant Therefore every charm in the home life of the humble Japanese told with double effect on Mrs. Fraser's receptive mind. She was writing from the Italy of the East to the Italy of Rome. I have read no book on Japan whic'i c-nveyed the charm of everyday life in Japan like this. At the same time I have read no book which, when it is on tl:e subject, explains more cleai ly the nature of the Government of Japan, or what the S-shi and the Samurai, the Regent Families, and other classes, who are constantly mentioned in any book which deals exhaustively with Japan, exactly are. She shows what a great part the principal cl ins, such as the Choshiu and Satsuma, still have in the Government of Japan. At the same titre she describes such things as the Boys' and Gills' festivals, Japanese theatres, and Japanese temples, with a picturesqueness and terseness combined which her brother could not have excel'ed. Yet she makes one very curious slip for a woman who has been brought up in literary surroundings all her life; she calls Mr. Henry Savage Lan'or, the artist whose explorations and sufferings in Tibet have made him one of the most celebrated of modern travellers -Walter S. Landor. Even if Walter Savage Landor had lived to be one hundred and tw nty Listead of ninety, ha was an author of European reputation and not an aritt, and Walter S. Landor is a clumsy and inelegant way of expressing his name. She tells very prettily how Mr. "Walter S." Landor pain ed the Japanese Countess Kuroda in her house in 1889. She give3 a wonderfully complete picture of picturesque Japan in the last years before the war with China. It is minute, it is sympathetic, it is brilliant; no one else has done it so well. She also, having the best information at her disposal, tells the story of the attempt on the life of the Cesarevich, the great earthquake, and other conspicuous events which happened in Japan when her husband was British Minitter there. To read Mrs. Fraser's book takes me right back to Japan. Her writing on Japan his a great deal of th- charm of the late John Addington Symondss writing on Italy. She writes like an artist, not a kodaker. DOUGLAS 5LADEX.

Tales of Mt/Landlord. New Series ; containing Ponte- Jract Castle. &ebtefo of fltln Kooks. 3 vols. IJino. London, 1HID. The popularity which the productions of the renowned Jedediah Clcishbotham hud so justly obtained, caused considerable interest to be excited when a new series of the Tales of My Landlord were announced. To allay the public anxiety, the printer hi Scotland has entered into a controversy with the London publisher, denying that the new tales were by the old author. Of this dispute, the details of which preface the present work, we shall say nothing, as the public are sufficiently acquainted with it; but, as we are perfectly independent of both authors and booksellers, and eau safely say, in the language of the great charter, c we will not sell, we will not deny, we will not delay justice to any man;' we shall, now only, "ive an account of the present novel, and afterwards offer such opinions as an attentive perusal of the work may suggest. Pontefract Castle is an historical novel, and relates to that eventful period of English history which includes the civil wars; the principal hero of the tale is a Colonel Morrice, who was Governor of Pontefract Castle at the time of its surrender to the Parliament troops, and who afterwards suffered in the cause of his exiled sovereign. The heroine is a Miss Cottrel, the daughter of Colonel Cottrel, governor of the castle at the time that Morrice obtained possession of it. The novel commences with Colonel Morrice and his friend, Lieutenant Au st wi ck, reconnoitering Pontefract Castle ; the former enters it, where he encounters General Rainsborough, a staunch republican leader, who had bern sent with a message to Colonel Cottrel, and was on the point of laying despatches before him, when Colonel Morrice entered. Here was also present, Matilda Cottrel, the daughter of the governor, who, as the heroine of the tale, we shall honour with giving the author's description of her person:? ' This young lady was a fine tall girl, to all appearance of about twenty years of age. No one could look, or did indeed ever look upon her, without being unaccountably intended. And yet it was neither the faultlessness of her beautiful figure, displayed to full advantage by thc tasteful simplicity of her dress, nor the contour of her face, which, in fact, could not he pronounced entirely and regularly handsome, so much as the extraordinary expression of her features which ri vetted and compelled, as it were, the attention. Indeed, no Grecian sculptor ever formed a fairer clearer forehead, nor a more perfectly arched eye-brow, nor a more rectilinear nose, nor a lip and chin which approached so near the beau ideal ot the happiest imagination ; but her countenance wanted that which gives animation to the plainest set of features, the lumen purpurea, so characteristic of the spring of life. It w as perfectly pale, though fair as an alabaster bust, and the spectator would have judged, that the heart to which it was the frozen index, could never have known tiie influence of passion, but for the fixed and melancholy ga/e of her large black eye. lier hair was raven black, but of a glossy brightness, perfectly unusual, and where it escaped fi om the unornamented bandeau that confined it, covered her neck and shoulder with a profusion of natural ringlets.' Itainsborough, after being introduced to Mon ice, hy the governor, avowed bis suspicion, that be was a traitor to the good cause; Morrice repelled the accusation, and the dispute might lune been serious, butfortheinteriererceof the governor. Raiusborough then set ott"for Doncaster, w herc his troops were lying; the night was dark, and he lo-t his way; at length he found himself in a deep and widely extended mora-*; a variety of lights were seen dancing hefore him, and all the paraphernalia of a funeral, moving with slow and orderly regularity, on the treacherous soil, winch threatened to swallow him up alive. Alter pas ing through vaulted domes, whither he had been conveyed hy two familiars, he encountered a lady, whom lie suspected to be Matilda Cottrel. A blow on his shoulder* deprived him of recollection, and he next found himself at the dcor of a cottage, where an old woman recognized him,?told him he had st en the hermit of Lindholm*',?bul him make his peace with God, and warned him of his fate. While Morrice remained in Pontcfract Castle, an unsuccessful attack was made on it, on behalf of the kim:. He afterwards caused a large body of republicans to be introduced to the governor, as ready to contribute to its dcb' nee, but at the same time caused Serjeant Ii roo kc, a suspected spy of Gainsborough, to be discharged. Fresh charges against Morrice reached the governor, aral he then ({tutted ' the castle. In a few days, under the disguise of a boor, j who had come with a waggon load of provisions, he got j into the castle; Captain I'aulden soon afterwards enter* d, and, after a rencontre, in which Colonel Cottril was se. verely wounded, the king's party gained possession. Morrice now found the domestics of the castle, to thc amount. of fifty* ranged within the gateway, to oppose his progress ; these were a singular incongruous mass, such as Falstaff would not have inarched through Coventry with ; .mil, as the author here gives a good description of the puritans of that dav, we shall insert it:? ( The hosts of Xerxes could not have assembled a greater variety of arms ; for there was every description, hom the <!uir.;fork to the frying-pan. Nor was there wanting a Hannibal t> reconcile and mould together so many inconuruou-. auxilui^. This was no other than Hezekiah Fight-the-good-fight i'uvioy, the pastor of Pontefract, who, to add to the ridicule of hi> steeple-like appearance, was mounted that day on an obi white mare; like him, as he said, who " goetli forth conquering and to conquer." By tue side of this worthy, as an adjutant and Fidus Achates, was his friend and compeer, Master Ebenezer Turnbill, grand scullion of the castle, and purveyor of white broths, custard, and plum-porridge to the craving diaphragms of the round heads. This hero of tue kitchen, whose fair " round ft belly," apparently " with good capon lined,'' seemed to throw an incumbrance in the way of his military efforts, was larding the earth and puffing and blowing, as with aloud bellowing voice he echoed thc shrill pipe of his elect commander, and charged them to stand firm in thename of the Lord. In short, the whole discipline, which consisted in singing psalms through the nose, was very laborious to a man of his constitutional complexion ; but there was a military fire in his nose and face, which made amends for a defect of breath. As soon as Morrice made his appearance at the gate-way with a few cavaliers, he poured his voice before him like Fingal, and led oft* the first psalm, which was responded to by the whole band, in every variety and dissonance of accent. Then Hezekiah, turning up the whites of his ey^f and lifting up one hand to the clouds, bade them on and not fear, for the victory was their's. " For the Lord," snuffled he, " shall go before us, and his glory shall be our rearward, (hhugh, hhugh.)?Not by strength, not by power, but by my law, sayeth the God of Jacob. As birds flying, so will the holy one deliver Israel. Passing over us, he will protect us, and redeen: us from the hands of the scorners," (hhugh, hhugh.) ' " Have done with this blasphemy, Purefoy," said Morrice, "betake yourself to the peaceful duties that become you, and forbear to lead these poor creatures into trouble." '(i And you, ye dogs," said some of the cavaliers, " he off to your kitchens and stables." * " For shaine, get off your horse, Hezekiah," repeated Morrice, " no hann will bc clone to any one?1 give quarter to all. ?Disperse, and be sober." ' " Sober! I defy thee, false tongue,0 hiccupped Hezekiah. " And ye, mine elect, in whom my soul rejoiceth, fight, I say, for the sake of the Lord and for Israel. Have i not promised ye victory this day ? Hearken not to the voice of the charmer, charm he inver so wisely?but gird your swords about your loins, and light like valiant men. Behold, are yenot armed with armour of righteousness, which is musket proof." 4 " Oh, it's all as nice as ninepence like," responded his adjutant, the cook. * " And this is the sign I give unto ye this day?Verily, while I lilt up my stab', ye shall prevail over the Philistines. Therefore, I -av unto thee, Kbenczcr Turnbull, stay my arm, even as Aaron did stay tilt: hand of Moses, until the going down of?? 'Morrice gawa nod, and a volley of Wank cartridges was discharged in the faces of the redoubtable host; and Blackburn, at the N.inie moment, getting behind l'urefoy, pulled him from the wiiii<' hor^c, and threw him on the ground, as a fisherman dor* a ll.Hinder. 4 " I lie sous of Zeruiah have prevailed " he snuffled out.? (lllniht liiiuh !)' The whole party was secured, and Morrice proceeded to the chnmherof the governor, whom he found wounded, and who cast a look on him which comprised scorn, agony, humiliation, and loathing.?Matilda also was there ; she rose *??(???rnfu!ly as he entered, as if his presence contaminated the air ; but, at a subsequent and more private interview with her, he, with some difficulty, convinced her that his conduct arose from his ardent attachment to his sovereign, zuni not from any want of respect to her and her fumilv* but on the contrary. Wliile Matilda, who had been melted to tenderness by the apparent sincerity of his professions, and the tears :ind si^hsnf the lovers were mixed toother, ii loud summons was heard at the door, and Matilda quitted the room. Morrice refused to take upon himself the government of the Castle, which he resigned to Sir John Digby. Most of the prisoners were liberated on parole, and the governor and his daughter retired to a small villa, which he possessed i-i the adjacent country. The royalist party, at the Castle, was reinforced by several noble cavaliers, milong whom were Sir Marmaduke Langdale, Lord JJyron, Sir Hugh Cartret, his son, the | tl v Major, and a nephew. Ingratius Cartret, who, having i read himself into infidelity, and not read himself out of it, became the bigot and apostle of his new faith and in propagating it, discovered as much zeal as the fanatics did for the covenant. There was also an imperative captain, of the name of Clavering, and a military dandy, a Sir Arthur Beaumont, who was an admirer of the extraordinary theorems of Ignatius. To such men was the last chance of sinking royalty consigned, and it was not lons; before they were called upon to show their competency or inefficiency for the task. The seizure of Pontefract Castle was received by the Parliament with mingled feelings of astonishment and disgust ; and Cromwell, whose whole soul was then occupied in consummating his intrigues for dispatching his unhappy monarch, then a prisoner, in Carisbrook Castle, instantly determined on measures to regain a post so im* portant. Orders were immediately despatched to Rainsborough, for the vigorous siege of Pontefract, and a detachment, under Lambert, was sent to watch the motions of Langdale, and prevent his co-operating with the be* set ged. The defeat of Sir Marmaduke Langdale, and his imprisonment in Nottingham Castle, followed, when Colon* t Morrice formed a most daring enterprize, which he only confided to Paulden and Austwick, who volunteered their services in any cause which Colonel Morrice would undertake. Accordingly, on the 30th of October, Morrice, Austwick, and Blackburn, attended with twenty-two horse cuirassiers, under Captain Paulden, all picked men, left j the Castle. Austwick went as a spy to Doncaster, to ascertain whether their project was suspected, and returned with information, which induced the party to push on to that town ; which Morrice and eight followers found means to enter from the south, saying he had letters from Cromwell to Raiusborough; Austwick and Paulden got admittance to the chamber of the General, whom they seized, and were carrying away with them ; but, on getting into the street, and not finding, as he expected, a strong body of horse to support his seizure, he began to struggle, crying ' to arms.' i Ile dashed a pistol out of Paulden's hand, and was struggling for his sword, when his lieutenant, hearing the scuflle from above, came to his assistance. The affair now became serious; there were two to two, for the man on horseback had his hands fully employed. The general's auxiliar immediately saw how matters stood, and seizing the fallen pistol, prepared to dis* charge it almost in contact with Paulden's head; but Austwick watched his motion, and, with a rapid movement, ran him through the body. Rainshorough still continued the contest ' " Surrender, General," said Austwick; " if you refuse, we must kill you in self-defence, as our lives are in jeopardy; take quarter and surrender, and not a hair of your head shall be touched." 4 But Hainsborough turned a dca fear to the charge, and though already wounded in the neck, struggled fiercely with his antagonists, now dragging them with him to the ground, and springing now upon Ins feet. At last, getting possession of his slain attendant's sword, he shortened it, and made a desperate lounge at Austwick. There was no longer any time for compromise. The lieutenant nimbly avoided the thrust, and, in the same moment, drawing his tuck, stretched him dead at his feet/ Paulden and Austwick joined their companions, whom they had left at* the bridge, and the whole party regained Pontefract Castle in safety. Colonel Morrice left them to pay a visit to the witch of Hatfield, whom he learned was a pensioner of Maria Cottrel, and the same that had foretold the fate of llainsborough. He found the wretched creature nearly double with age and infirmity, and Hopkins, the witch-finder, taking depositions against her. Amongst the most prominent in deposing against lier was Hezekiah, accompanied by his constant satellite, Ebenezer Turnbull, who declared the old woman to be ?one of the veriest she wolves of Sathan, that ever plagued the flock of the faithful.' ?"What has the woman done?" quietly asked Morrice, *' she appears to be in no lit state to speak, or be spoken to, and very incapable of bearing the intrusion and turbulence of the crowd I see assembling." < n Verily, those eyes behold a vain thing," said Hezekiah; *' it's all sorcery, and craft of Satan. No one knows the many ways he has of deceiving :?one day his familiars will appear in full health, with a comely face, like mine, (which verily the Lord hath made like brass against its enemies,) and the next day, you shall see them at the point of death, with scarce as much skin upon their bones as would make Satan a drum to alarm their consciences.?(Iihuh, hhuh!)?This weak woman hath, at this moment, the strength of Goliah and Sampson, albeit she shammeth weakness; and verily,I doubt not, but if she were to rise from her bed, and mount her broomstick in yon corner of her room, she might carry away an unsanctilied portion of the house, and all of us with it."?(Hhuh, hhuh!) '?t Lord deliver us!" said the crowd, stepping back, and objecting strongly to a joint flight in the above-mentioned aerial journey. ' " Take her to the pond," said one who assumed the right of advising, from his ofiice of parish barber. u Throw her into the Don, that will prove her a witch or an honest woman at once." ' " Your advice is very good, Mr. Lathercheek," said the witch-finder, who had little more consideration than those around him?" but, while 1 sit here, I mean to see justice done, and 1 must hear evidence before I decide. Come, Mr. Purefoy, to your charge; the woman denies that there is any guilt in her actions." ' " Where are we, where are wc ?" said Hezekiah, rising on tiptoe, and pronouncing the words with a strong nasal twang?" What will not the father of sin deny, through the windpipes of his vessels ??(Hhuh, hhuh.)?For thou Knoweth he goeth about seeking whom he may devour. And, touching this wretched Jezebel here, this is what I know of her, which i> little, seeing that I like not the paths of the wicked, nor the seat of the scornful, more especially when it is a witch's cross-seat; but 1 delight rather in the ways of pleasantness ; where, the land seemeth good, and floweth with milk and honey, and where the fruit thereof is for thc healing of the bowels.?(Hhuh, hhuh.) ' " But, to the point, to the point." ' u The fool is hasty with the tongue," replied the inexor* able pastor, " but the wise man weigheth his words. Your worship, this same Martha Allen has, to my knowledge, bewitched many of the Lord's flock; for sundry of them, at divers times, have come to me and stated, (offering to take their'davy of the same,) that, without any visible reason, that they know of, they have withered away; yea, truly, the flesh has fallen from the bones; and when they died, they declared on their death-beds, that this Martha (look, how she fixes her wall eye on me?pray God, it may not be an evil eye,) killed them, and that they saw her often about their beds, threatening them, with a frowning and angry look. Say I true, neighbours?"?^! huh, hhuh.) ? " Yea, yea; very true, Master Purefoy?"' Ebenezer TurnbulPs charges were quite as strong, but less puritanically delivered. Colonel Morrice interfered, and threatened Hopkins, that if he dared to injure the unfortunate woman, he would subject lum to the same tortures at be inflicted; at the same time declaring his name, and that he waa in the service of King Charles. ' The poor beldam started up in bed?shrieked at th?* name of Morrice, and sunk back again, exhausted. The name was caught, and re-echoed on every side. * " He's right!?he's right! Its the brave Colonel Morrice/' said they?" the governor of Pontefract Castle. Hang the vile fiend.?Let's see whether he'll sink or swim?he'll prove no conjurer, I warrant ye." ' Hopkins stood transfixed with terror, like a housebreaker caught in a trap; while Hezekiah attempted to sneak off, but was stopped by the mob/ Morrice intreated them to keep the peace, and, after giving him three cheers, they suffered the discomfited heroes to retire. He then entered the cottage of the old woman, where he remained two hours; after winch, he returned to Pontefract Castle with the most exhilarating tidings, Sir M. Langdale having escaped from Nottingham Castle. A few evenings after, the conviviality of the brave cavaliers waa interrupted by the entrance of Hezekiah, at the head of the domestics, declaring they had seen what they termed a ghost, or spectre, but which, on examination, Colonel Morrice suspected might be an enemy, who had gained entrance into the castle by some secret avenue. While the party were laughing at Hezekiah's apprehensions, Ignacius Carteret entered the room and announced a still more ominous circumstance,?the full length picture of the king, painted upon painui, had separated between the head and shoulders, and the wood uti which the former was painted, had fallen to thc ground.

The greatest disgrace iu France is want of courage?in I Hyland, want of money. The one is, perl.aps, not more reasonable than the other. This state of things produees a deplorab'e effect on the minti, and makes the philosophic observer fear that this country of Bacon, of Newton, and of Locke, will soon make rapid aud retrograde steps towauls hmbaiiMii. lt appears certain that they read much less than they did. they have no! limo, and books are too dear. The rich, w ho think of nothing but enjoyment, hive oilier pleasures than those ofthe mind, anti the ono destroys the aptitude for tho other. The little which people of ibshion in general road is never of Hie best. Truly useful reading requires an application which is troublesome to them; and when by nccident they read good works, it is like seed thrown on a barren soil, which brings forth no fruit. The middle class is the only one which studios usefully for society, and that class will soon be unable to study in England. Now, we conceive, that no plague worse than idleness can befall a country; that, where any class, or number of individuals, can loiter away their time, not merely listlessly, but injuriously,"from illuming to night," in " coffee-houses, hiliiurd-rooins," and other kinds of what assumes the name of amusements, they suffer in their own persons ; their connections suffer also; and their country sutlers with them. Has not France must woeful reason tn complain ofthe consequences of idleness iu ber community ? Would it not have, been infinitely to ber advantage, had those who were the instruments of her calamities some years ago, been employed in exertions of honest labour f* The man who busily plies the loom, or the hammer, is too much and too beneficially occupied, to hire himself at a few shillings a day, for a massacre of his fellow citizens. That a city so vast as our metropolis, should furnish idlers enough to do mischief, while it is confessed, is lamented; but, this only proves the general conviction, that, were every man al Ins post, the security of tde public would be tbe more solid and peiii'.aueut. One of the laudable arts of Covernmeut is, to find occupation for every smd ; aud, though it is not possible to effect this, strictly speaking, yet the immense and constant demand for labour in Finland, should be pla*eu among the felicities, not among the disadvantages, of the pet,plc. Wv have known minor politicians who con.iiul <l the cost to the nation of a public M-dht, supposed to occupy a sintle d:.y ; il amounted to thousands ot pounds, in the labour, ike. &c. suspended tor ihe time. Tiny proceeded to ci'.i iilate that arising from the visits ct the Sovereigns : the result would have appeared tn:'lui ul, reduced to F.t nrh lures. The attack aud defence of the house of Sir Francis Burdett, his escort lo the Tower, and his exp* clod procession, winn released, aniounttd t?> a sum, which, us we hive not the figures at hand, we are unwilling to state. In short, every honest niau anion.1 us knows, thal '* the hand of the diligent lnaketh rich," but " idleness clothes a mau with rags." As lo the progressive barbarity of our times, the translator has entered his protest against the conclusions dravvu by his author: we insert his words : lu thc short time the Author spent in this country, as he visited -cotlaud as weil an most ot the manufacturing towns, lie had not tillie to become acqu nilled with the actual habits of th*' people; nor dues he seem to have heard of thone novel establishment ?*, the innumerable " Book Societies," v hu h are to be found in almost every town ; by means of which many single copies of Hit se works, aud of tiie better kind too, pass, almost as soon as published, into the hands of a great number of iiidividuils; after which they arc frequently sold, sit reduced prices, lo poisons who are eager to avail themselves of so much easier au opportunity of possessing some portion ol' the literature ol' Ibo times. Thus, the effect of Ibo " dearness ol' books" is also, iu a consider bte degree, prevented. This is not all: it consists with our knowledge that the number of books of education now furnished by the press, is beyond ;dl former precedent: that good books, or what obtain lhe character of good boeiks, are emulated in immense numbers, fruin country presses, as well as in Lomieiti editions ; and that, could the whole- bee-ahulated, it would demonstrate an astonishing increase of readers, and students, within the last thirty years, in the couulry of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. lt is true, neve i the less, that eiur London traeh smeii ile light iu ihe appearance of wealth; and were it free from deception, it might piiss without censure; but, while the public has no other means ol binning a judgment on the value of a stoek of goods, than by the- specimen shewn at the shop window, this advantage will continue to be taken, notwithstanding the condemnation of it by >1. Say. Nowhere are the efforts made to attract purchasers pushed further than iu Lugland. Hence that dressing ont of shops, those extravagant and fantastic ornaments, which are ill-signed to compel attention. Hence those- numerous advertisements-, those* goods offered at less th; ii prime cost; that air of <-;ii u kery, which flukes ail fore igueis. Lven the managers of tin* principal theatres boast, in the- most pompous style-, of the applauses which their actors ^(,i*e *eci letti fioin an t inapt un tl audience, au audience which, to a certain e-xteut, tliey had composed themselves. To announce to the public a mw undertaking, or even a simple change of residence, au unmovable bill af the corner of the- streets is not sufficient ? ami they carry about like banners, in the midst of the busy erowal of london, walking no'ices, whieh tbe passengers may rrael without losing a miuute. As lo our foreign c inineree, it might well bid defiance to the utmost rigour and vigilance of the Continental System, y\. Say, himself, being judge.-? His statement justifies our assertion. Speculators of every nation were enabled to pure base gooels iu England, and to procure.-, at au advantageous rate, the money to pay for them. If they bought au article at Birmingham which cost a pound sterling, instead of paving twenty four fra.ms for the pound which they were obliged to [emit for it, it cost them only eighteen francs at most ; so that they might be content without gainingWhat do 1 say? They might be content even to lose ou the goods, since-, by the exe flange done, they gained if/ per cent., a fourth part of the sum to be remitted. So then, the worst towhirh Napoleon could force this turbulent gen* ration was, to exert industry, somewhat mort than foi mt riv: to labour mort- diligently, ni order to intel tin pressure ol' the expellees necessarily incurred in defending the Sacred Island against dis visitation, and, ut I* n.th, hurling him limn his throne. By this diligence, wt sold our productions cheap ; and his tormented slaves could .ilford lo defy his most lt rnfic prohibitions ! So much for his Berlin and .Milan Deere*s! against this '* nation of shopkeepers." Nor is fbi* all : the habit ol' industry formed by necessity, will continue its action for many a day to come. If to this he added, that consummate skill and care whitb wo have repeatedly pressed on our population, we confess, that the secret is manifest on which we depend tor that favourable reception in foreign mutkets, which is now indispensable to us ; and for the continuance of that superiority which bas hitherto be* n assigned to our productions by tbt verdict of the world at larg*. Let it not be thought that we are insensible to the difficulties of our couutiy : we both set them, and feel them : hut, at the same time, we indulge the persuasion that tiny are not insurmountable ; and while we look at them steadily, wt equally steadily look around, to disct-ver?not the shortest, but,?the best method ol' surmounting them. Nor let this nation abate its gratitude to these worthies in every department ot Hit State who have been conspicuously successful in humbling the foe. Our merchants, our manufacturers, our engineers, with others beyond number deserve statues, mi our opiniou ; hut we trust they have received, generally speaking, more substantial rewards.? Mot so, our military chiefs : where is ihe Briton who will not rejoice in the ability of his country to continue to reward the posterity of the Hero of Blenheim, and the family of the Hero of Trafalgar. Says M.S. I do not know up to what point political justi- e requires that the money of a nation should be given to ii citizen who has done nothing for it, anti who is not recommended by any particular talent or virtue, simply because fortune has made bim the brother of au admiral who lost his life in a naval engageiii) nt. This is what the- family of Nelson annually costs the liiiglidi nation '?

rICTXON. Tue Bus/hranyer of Van )iemnan's Land. By ('CI.kRIES ROWCROFT, Esq. author of 1Tales of the Colonies," &e. In three vols, London, P4AC. Smith and Elder. MIR. RowCROFr'S "Tales of the Colonies" was a curious, an interesting, and an able 1)roduction, and its success was equal to its merits. Three or four editions attest the public appreciation of the spirit and power with which he depicted scenes unfamiliar to them, and a state of society which has not its like in any other spot upon the earth's surface. But the genius that appeared to preside over the com. position of these tales seems to have forsaken the author, as if its fire had been exhausted by the first effort. Whether Mr. RowcRoFr has fallen into the fatal error of writing too much or too hastily, or success has made him careless, wve will not venture to determine, but certain it is that neither of his subsequent works has approached his first in excellence. Nay, instead of improving with time and experience, practice produces upon him the reverse eilect, and this last effort is inferior to either of its predecessors. Its design is, as its name implies, to exhibit in the form of a fiction the most striking features in the life of a bushranger in Van Dieman's Land. For this purpose he has selected one Mr. Sillimnan for his hero-a character borrowed from the stage of the Adelphi-an exported, not transported, Cockney, who carries into the bush the airs, and thoughts, and language of the City, and plays the fool for the amusement of the audience. The other characters are equally of the true nielo-dramatic cast-an amiable nobody, created to be persecuted, -a deep designing villain,-with " natives," " convicts," and "mob," ad libitum. The hero, Alark Brandoni, must have been written for 0. SMITH, although Mr. RowCROFT takes care to assure us that there is a moral aim in the narrative of his adventures, namely, to destroy "a dangerous notion, prevalent among those especially where a misconception of the truth is most mischievous, that a transportation to the penal colonies is not, as the law intends, a punishment." We hope his readers will profit b)y the lesson he teaches, and take care to keep their hands from p)icking, and stealing, seeing what an unpleasant thing is transportation, as dtepicted by Mr. ROWCROFT.

Rubbing the Gilt Off
Hollingshead, John
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Old Leares Gathererd from " Household WVords." By W. HENRY I W'ILs. London: Chapman anldl Hall. pP 4137. Rubbiing thc Gilt O,: a l'est.end Book for all Jleaders:. By Jonii IiOLLINGsirmi). Lon(lon: John Camiden llotten. pp. 204. W E PLACE THESE TWO BOoKS TOGETHER, because W they are not only similar in their natures, but also cognate in their origin. Although Mr. 1lollingshead acknowledges that somc of the papers which go to the making up of his new volume have appeared in other publications-one, indeedl in the columns of the CRITIC-it is froiI OIlouseholl lVWords that he has (drawn the major part, and Mr. W\'ills the entire, of his nmatcrial. And not in tbis respect only are these volumes similar; both are supposed to contain descripitive pictureq, photographically correct, of certain phases of social life. Mr. Wills may be more (lescriptive than Mr. Hlolling shead, an(l 'Mr. HIollingshe.d more analytical than 'Mr. Wills: the object of c.elh is the same, to paiit things as they are, and(I sluggeA what they olulht to l,.. (Canld(iiir compels uv; to tell M1r. llollinshieinl thait we like his new volume very much lk 1 s tlm:rn . h nlr 1i, i llls,"andl wve will ilmtorin lhimm why. 'T'hle latter was :a c')Illec tiii (oit ktKCIIS ilitel1(10i1 to) illS tiittC s9imne of those de{ets in our commercial svstevim which lead to those( r(eltl s which our Bankruptcy and ('Cntral Criminal Courts are eonst:aitly, developing r. There unav have bee n soimle little exag-eratiin used il bringing out " the highl flights " of tlil-el pictures, lmit no more than tile licence concelded to artists rivcs w warrant for. Takin?, thlen altogether, they were truthful, and exhibited no sintill amount otliterarv skill. They essayed to bring no good thing into contempt, they supporte(l no error, and the did not pander to any popular prqjimdice. But it is not so, we regret to say, with the volume before us. By his title, " Rtubbing the Gilt Off," ad by hlis (ledication to Mr. Bright, as the exponent par excellerc of " the great truths of political science,' it is easy to see that Mr. 1[ollintzshlead is of opinion that in this hook at least he has (done his work as a great political regenerator. Ile gives us clearly to un(lerstalid that he is not to lbe humbugged. TO him, at ally rate, gilt gingerbread is not the gold of Oplir ; so lhe remorselessly rubs ofl' the tin coating to lirove his strong common sense. Other maen may lie ledl astray l)v fine phrases about our " glorious constitution," and may be apt to believe that the represcaitation of people in P'arliament, trih lbv jury, and other such matters, are properly managed-but not Mr. llollinigscia(d. Bless vou, he sees through the swindle, and liesit -tes not to tell oui, in good round terms, how e('regioushy stupid yVoul must be to prvsurve your faith in the 60sondiless of aniy part of' our law, legislative or executive. Now, much as we admire the abilities of Mr. 11ollitirgsleanl, when exercised within their proper sphere, we muist make tree to tell llim that lie has vet to prove his capacity fir dealing with such sulljects as these. We' do not adlopt the tonle of those high ndll mighty critics who lay it down broadly that the writer of light literature, the author of amusinglf essavs, the indliter of novels, has no business with public matters of importance. Such a doctrine we hold to lie absuid and tintenable, for when imian proves his capacity fur sustaining an argumient, it is no matter what lie has bela' usually aeustomiedl to do, pirovided be argues with knowvled1q and wvith loigic. INhat, therefore, we have to complain against Mr. HIollingshead is, that lie is untitted to deal vith the sulbjeets which lie attempts to handlile in this volume, not becauise be is a lighit writer, hut because he (does not undelristand them. In commercial swindles, dodlges, nani inatters of that kind, lie is au fait, he knows all about them ; blut of' Parliameuntarv representation, of the law of the lanidl, of the principles of our coistitt ion, he has much to learn. It is the case ot' Mrs. Partington over again, wbo was great at a puddle, lint not competent to deal with the Atlantic Ocean. Trhe first sketch in 'Mr. Ilollin2gshcad's book is entitled " The Humiliation of Foimnoor.." It is aimed :fagisnt the election of meinbers of' Parliament, and thle way in which seats are hought :ind sold amid (ilioted( in the nmirket like any kiindl ot goo(ls. That there lalrt' grrave dlefeets in tIme piCr-elt systeml, :iod s re nei(l for r2form, nolon Call deliv ; but it is oill-g a little tot) t1r to state that for twenty thousand pounds a ticket-of-leave man umay lie re turmied, for five-andtwenty a Zulu Kaflir. and fbi' an additional five thoumand an ouranoutali. 'T'11e no1tion of' mal:ling a Inemibler of Parlian'lent olit ot( tlis particular species of Sinia is not entirely miew, having been alreadly treated with some bhimour by Mr. Savage. 'T'he same tenidency to ex aggeratioln pervades th3 whole of Mr. iiollingsbhcad's volumms, oCCalionalilv relieved by a little self-contraldiction. Thus, after rea!Iing thle ;' Pet of the Law," ''we ina be led into believing that the C'riminal Law, far from being (distastefill to evil-doers, is, in realitv, a svstenil under which they thrive and tlhuri!i ex(ceedimiig ; hbut %when tIle samie system has to be painted in black colours as the instrument for oppressing an innocent man-Air. Barber, for instance-it i. represented as the cruellest and mnost Draconian of codes. It is amnulsing also to see how, in his zeal, Mr. Ilollingshead regardv nothing as either too smnall or too great for his reformnig abilities In one paper he dooms the Iludson's Bay Company to perdition; ir another he exposes the errors of theatrical management-proving that be is equally capable of governing an empire and directing a dramatic speculation. in "rThe National Christmas Bill" he audits the national balance-shect in a style to which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is certainl) not accustomed; though this outpouring of political wisdom may, perhaps, stand excused for the usehul picee of information which it contains, that Divi Did is "the pod of the 'ctsalpinia coriuria, used in tanning and dycing." Finally, Mr. lHollirslleaad is as hard as he can be-and he can be very hard in'lee(d-upon our colonial system and the organisation of her Majesty's household: proving that, as a reformer, he would be equay at homo either in Government House, Calcutta, or the butler's pantry in Buckingliain Palace. Ilavillg thus had our little word of remonstrance with Mr. IHollingrshead upon what we conceive to be the defects of his book, let us add that the sketches of which it is composed are, like everything else that conies fron his pi)cn, smartly and vigorously written, and that, if they (lo not convince, they at least serve to amuse. For the fact that Air. 1lollinrshead has lost nothing of his dramatic power, whatever may be his deficiencies in political knowledge, the following extract will be good warraint: The same cvening, towards du3sk, Messrs. Alabaster and Ermine arrived, and took up their quarters at Ir. Snarlington's villa. Bill Manacles having been installed as a reSident, vas taking his supper quietly and thankfully in the kiite hen. Over the wine. in his snug dining-room, Mr. Snarlington opened the buincs' of the niglit.-" l'be person I have selected to be returned in my place for the h.rough of 1 " vnoor is one Bill Manacles-a ticket-of-leave man."MIr. Ermine, villl a little morc difficulty than usual, preserved his accustomed colMPosLure ; hut Mar. Alabast'-r grclv livid, and spilled his port.-" A-a-ticketof lba ve nian ? " inquired Air. Alabaster, in a tremulous voice. Mr. Ermine was making Some petncil calculations upon a small slip of paper, and said nothing. Exactly 8o," returned Mr. Snarlington.-" It is now upwards of tiftyyears," began Mr. Alabaster, in reply, becoming gradually more composed, " since I began my professional career; and, during all that time-"-" Can we see the man ?" asked Ar. lErmine, iuterrupting his retrspective partner. Mr. Snarlington ran- a bell; and, in a few seconds, the proposed memuber for Fogmoor stood in thle doorway".- ill," said his patron, " take a chair." Bill did as he was requested. lle looked cleaner than he did the (lay before; but he was still rough and grizzlv.-"And this is the man," said Mr. Alabaster, addressing Mr. Suarlinigton, who is to h1 ave the honour of representing Fogmoor? "-"I doant know much about tbe 'onour, measter, either, 'struck in Bill Manacles, annoyed at MIr. Alabaster's tone. " Fomnoor be a tdirtylplace at best o' times."-" Do you wish to ask lhim anly question ? " inquired Mr. Snarlington. Mr. Ermine said "No; " while iMr. Alabtster muttered, retlectively, "A ticket-of-leave man!" "Bill," said Ml r. Snarlingten to the proposed member, " you can go!" When he hadt left the room, Mr. Snarlingtun turned to the two partners, and took up the conversation by saving, in a manner unusually lively for him: " Bill Manales and Foginoor, gentlemen! W\'ill you favour me with the price? "-"Mr. Snarliington," said M1r. Ermine. " tis will be a task requiring uncommon tact and perseverance."-" M11r. EIrmine," said Mir. Snarlington, "you know that an orang-outanig may be returned for Fogmnoor at a certain price.'-" Mr. Snarlington," said MIr. Alabaster, " since the notorious case of the prize-fighter, who was elected for the town of Bunipslev-in tthe-Mud, in eighteen hundred and - Mr. Alabaiter," sail1 Mr. Sna:rlington, " do not wish to press for your terms until the n.ornin 1. tood night! " Saving which Mr. Snarlington left his guests, and went to bed. Tlie roext mornjing at breakfast hr. Ermine alone met AMr. Snarlington. M1r. Alabaster liad returned to town.-" Sir," said Mr. Ermine, "w e have arranged that I sha3' undertake this election individually, as a matter of policy on the part of the lirm. This case may attain a disagreeable notoriety -though I do nut anticipate that it will-and it is better that only one of our lirm should be engagedl in it. My price. sir, to guarantee the election of Mr. WYilliamu Manacls-that, I believe, is his name?-will be twenty thousand pounds; fifteen thousand dtOwn."-" Sir," said Mr. Snarlington, " in the present state of political morality, any notoriety you may obtain from tbis case will only add to the cxtent and profit3 of your business. You shall have your price." Saying which, Mr. Snarlington drew a cheque for fifteen thousand pounds, and the election of Bfill-or, as lie was nowY called, Mr. l illiam-Manacles, was considered to be a settled thing.

Old Leaves, Gathered from Household Words
Wills, W. Henry (William Henry)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------y
 Mr. Wills is a writer belonging more exclusively to the matterof-faet school than d1r. Jlollingrshead does. His thirty-seven essays, all taken from the pages of Household lVords, are simply thirtyseven very skilfully-written picces of reportingg. But reporting is an art, a very useful one, and we intend no disparagement to Mr. Wills when we thus pronounce upon his composition. It does not even exclude an occasional touch cf poetry or pathos; though we halt' suspect that that whenever any such occur in these essays they are due to that " other hand," whose assistance Mr. Wills candidly acknowledges, and to which lie aflectionately inscribes his book. Lon(lon is the volume which M\r. W'ills has perused most atteritivelv, and whence he Iais drawVn his inspiration. Almost every one of these sketches is front that source; and often 'when some (quaitnt and invlterious title leads us into the supposition that we -ire to be taken (Lown into the couimtrv, it is still the great mletrop lis that sul)pitvs the thellme of Mr. W\ ills's pleasant gossip. Thus we run our fin-,vr down the table of' contents and stop at -"The I I-art of MlidILothian." Hlere we get away froni " the Great Wen, " surely. By no ln(alls; it is an exceedlinwly graphic and weil-written sketch of Smithialeld larket. But Why "ithe Heart of Mid-Lotbian?" Who can tell ? Then again, " A Popular D elt:sion"-why, that might be anything: so it illeght, but in this particular instance it happens to be Billingsgate Mlarket, one of the N-cry last things in the world that we shuuold ihave tholluht oh' callii.g, a dldusion in any shape. Under the verv rnral title "A Curious Dance round a Curious Tree," we find an (evenigll part) at St. lul's hIo pital. There is sonie eccentricity in thlee titles. 3 'lie Bank of England supplies 1Mr. Wills with subjects for three very amnusing essays, containing a ,r( at deal of information very well told; the I'ost-office furnihcs tOo more; the police-station, the i railway depot for lost property, thc Crystal Palace, a glass factory, a pawnbroker's shop, the opening of Parliament, the Custoim-house, Epsom racecourse, all come in for their sbare of treatment-a treatment which is always fit, always graphic, and never fails through pretentious endeavours to get above the subject. Let us take for a specimen the following episode from the night charges at a London police station: A very indignant matron with a very livid face, a trembling lip, and a violently heaving breast, presents herself. "Wl'hich I wishes to complain immediate of Pleesemen forty-two and fifty-three and insistes on the charge being took; and that I will subt)tantiate before the magistrates to-morrow morning, and what is more will prove and which is sayinz a gr at deal sir!"-" You needn't be in a passion, you know, here, ma'am. Everyt'iing will be done correct." -" Which I am not in a passion sir and e;erythink shalt he done correct, if you please!" drawing herself up with a look designed to freeze the whole division. " I make a charge immediate," very rapidly, " against 1'leesemen forty-two and fifty-three, and insistes on the charge being took."-" I can't take it till I know what it is," returns the patient inspector, leaning on the window-sill, and making no hopeless effort, as yet, to write it dlown. " hlow was it, ma'am ?"-" This is how it were, sir. I were standing at the (oor of mv own 'ouse."-" Where is your house, ma am ?"-" W'/here is my house, sir?" with the freezing look. " Yes, ma'am. Is it in the Strand, for inqtance ?""No, sir," with indignant triumph. " It is not in the Strand !"-'- WVhere then, ma'am ?"-" Where then, sir !" with severe sarcasm. " I ope it is in l)oorylane."- In Drury-hine. Ant wh.it is your name, ma'an ?'-` .My,/ nallie, Mir ?" with inconceivable scorn. " My name is Mlegby."-" Mrs. Mlegby ?""Sir, I ope so!" with the previous sarcasm. Then, verv rapidly, I keep a cofft ehouse, as I will substantiate to-morr'ow morning am1 what is more will prove and that is saying a great deal." Then, still more rapidly, " I wish to make a charge immediate against Pleesemen forty-two and tifty-three!"" \Vell, ma'am, be so good as to make it."-" I wtre standinr at uily door," falling of a sudden into a genteel and impressive slowneFs, "in conversation with a friend, a gentleman from the country, which his name is Ilenery rLupvitch, Es-quire-"-" Is he here, ma'ain ?-" No, sir," with surpassingscorn. " lie is not here! "-"1 Well, ma'am ?"-" With Ilenery Lupvitch, Ei-quire. and which I had just been hksuing directions to two of my servants, when here come between us a couple of female persons which I know to be the comrniowutdirt, pushed against me."-" Both of them pushed against you ?"-' No, sir," with scorn and triumph, " they (lid not! OQe of 'em pushed against me." A deail stoppage, expressive of implacable gentility.-' Well, ma'aum, did you say anything then?"-" I ask your parding. Idii I which, sir ?' As coi)n4elling herself to fortitude under great provocation.-" Did you ao v anything?" -"1 ope I did. I savs, ho]w ilare you do that, ma'am?" Stoplpage nuain. E.xpressive of a severe ;desire th at those words Le instantly taken down.-" Yon ,;aid, how dare Vou (do that?"-" ' Nobody,' continuing to quote with a loftv and abstracted effort of memory," 'never interfered with you.' She replies, ''hat's nothink to you, ma'am. Never you mind.'" Another pause, expressive of the same desire as before. Much incensed at nothing resulting. " She then turns back between me and Ilenery ILupvithlu, Fs-quire, ant cominits an assault upon me, which I am not a acquisition an(i will not endoor, or what iS more submit to." What Mfrs. Alegby mneans by the particular expression that she is not ,an acquisition. does not appear; but sl:e turns more livid, and not only her lip hut her whole frame trembles as she solemnly repeats, " I ain not a acquisition.""W'ell, m%'am.

PARABLES FROM NATURE. By MARGARET GATT r'. With Illustrations by ALIcE B. WOODWARD. 3A. 6d. net. (Bell & Sons.) There are certain books which should be in every library, nursery or adult, and one of these books is " Parables from Nature." Every child who is old enough to have stories told to it will love to hear Mlrs. Gatty's little tales of birds and animals and flowers and children. The grown-ups love the same tales because they are already old friends, and because of the simple, beautiful style of their telling. This edition of the " Parables " is a most desirable volume to possess; it is handsome, tasteful, and generously illustrated. 'Miss Woodward has evidently found herself quite in sympathy with her subjects ; and her frontispiece, illustrating what is, perhaps, the best known of all the " Parables "-" A Lesson of Faith"gives the keynote to the whole; it is original, natural, simple, and, without violating the limitations of bird and insect life, gives just the right suggestion of thought and speech in that life. As a gift-book for children, this collection of stories is perennially suitable, for not onlv does it captivate the child-mind by its intimacy with the animal and vegetable world, but, the nature lessons being alw\ays accurate, thiey inform w\-ithouit tears, so to speak; and the happy child learns scientific facts while drinking in romance.

urbettoA) of $eitt Booard+. I Memoirs of the Life and Writings of William Ilayley,' Esq., the Friend anid Bioqrappher of Cowper, writhn by .Ii If himself. With Extracts from hisj t 1~I private Corre.spondence and unpublished Poetry. And Mlemnoirs of his Son, Thomas Aiphontso Hayley, the young Sculptor. Edited by JOHN JOHNSON, L.D.D. Rector of Yaxham with Welborne, in Norfolk. 2 vols. 4to. pp. 999. London, 1823. OxNE thousand quarto pages, save one,devoted to the life of Mr. Hayley, whose chief claim to notice is expressed in the title -' the friend and biographer of Cowper', and to ' Thomas Alphonso Hayley, the young sculptor,' of whom, the world would never have thought or heard, but for the parental fondness or vanity of the father,- actually startle us, accustomed as we are, to see subjects spread over large volumes, which might have been comprised' in an octavo sheet, and whole poems of several thousand lines, without a single original idea from beginning to -end. In the present instance, we look in vain at the literary and personal character of Mr. Hayley for any thing that can justify even the expectation, that the public will go to the expense of two bulky though elegant quartos, for his memoirs. It may, perhaps, be urged on behalf of the editor, Dr. Johnson, that as Mr. Hayley was his own biographer, he took the work as he found it, and did not think himself justified in reducing its bulk. As to the publisher, perhaps, a still better apology may be made; since it appears, that in consequence of an agreement made by him with Mr. H-ayley, that his auto-biography should be delivered for the press on the author's decease, t very considerable annuity was secured to him during the last twelve years of his life-an agreement, the terms of which were honorably kept by the publisher. We cannot, however, but consider the vanity of that man as inordinate as his avarice, (we give it no harsher'name) who could deliberately sit down and wvrite two quarto volumes about himself, ior the mere purpose of raising money upon them ;-uoney, too, which he must have felt some doubts of his publisher ever realizing, unless, indeed, he was more sanguine than any -author we have ever met with. But what are really the claims of Mr. Hayley's memoirs to such a niche in the biographical library? We do not see what right he has to rank high among the individuals of his day, and the editor of his memoirs does not claim this distinction for him : for, with all the partialities of friendship, he is comrpelled to admit, that, although his writ- I ings are distinguished by ease and gracefulness, they are yet, occasionally, characterized by feebleness of diction. 'leat, in his personal character, he did not, like the good Berkeley, ' possess every virtue under heaven,' is certain. We confess, we are, generally speaking, partial to auto-biography, when kept within due bounds, and written with becoming modesty. The life, too, even of a literary man, who pingles much with the eminent of his day, can scarcely fail of being interesting, unless it turns too much on self and too little on his times and contemporaries. In the introductoryparagrraph, Mr. Hayley, who writes in the third person, tells us, 'though ever devoted to retirement himself, he has so much intercouse with many of the most remarkable characters of his time, that- a fair and full account of him must, inevitably, be a work of considerable extent and diversity. The idea of it led to a division of it into bopks and chapters, each book terminating with some renmarkable event; the first, for examples with the entrance of the young poet into that university, to whose tribute of public gratulation on the birth of the prince of W\ales, he contributed an Enalish ode, before he began his first residence in college.' Now, really, there is nothing remarkable in this-hundreds of young men go to college every year, a period of interest to themselves, but a matter of no moment to all the rest of the world; then, as to having his ode printed in the I I I i I i I Cambridge Collection, what is there in that ? Who does not know that there is more good poetry written out of college than in it ? And it is, really, no very proud distinction, nor proof of extraordiiiarv talent, to appear in the Cambridge Collection. The first book closed with the remarkable event, that Mr. Hayley went to college-the seconld book concludes-with his leaving it! Il our observations on the vanity of Mr. Hayley, we must not be understood as considering these volumes as destitute of interest, for they combine, with his own personal history, some good notices of his contemporaries. Of the ' poet,' or the 'hermit,' for thus he always speaks of himself-his life passed so tranquilly, that there is scarcely an incident in it to distinguish it from that of the mere student and man of letters, and there are few classes of persons whose lives are more monotonous: nor, do the letters between the ' Poet' and 'his Eliza,' which are scattered in thick profusion, Irelieve it; for the epistles between a man and his wife, like all other family concerns, naturally possess but a very limited interest, and can seldom be considered of any value out of the family. If we find little in the auto-biography of Hiayley to notice, we find still less in the continuation of the editor, whose labours consist in merely inserting some hundred pages of letters, from the author to himself, without any connection, either with the memoir or with each I other, and with scarcely a single remark. I These letters certainly show Mr. Hayley in an amiable light, and acquaint M with what we learnt in the title-page, that he was the friend of Cowper, but, 1 surely, it was not necessary to make ns wade through some fifty or sixty letters I for this purpose. One or two of these 'letters we shiall give, premising that Mr. I Havley generally addressed the editor by the name of Johnny:I I Dear writer of in'. isible and inaudibe preftaces ! 'Your very good friend Lady Hesketb. being perfectly convinced that you most be dead and buried, has expressly requeed me to wnte your epitaph, which I have dote in manner and torw foIlowing:- 'ON JOHNNY OF NORFOLK. 'Here Johnny lies; who, gentlest of good men, Fe!), lorro. strnck, in fear of f-'s pen: Fearing his pencil too, in shadowy strife, His tghost jumped back again to fleshly life: " Heaven let not him," aifrighted Johnny said, Write of nie,livilig! or pourtray me dead!" t I'IIpiI11 cYour I)enevolent spirit *wl approve thsis sincere tribute of rearet anl at: tteCti-on, I aim, my (dea*r Johmnny, W liether you are in the flesh1, or otit of the flesh ever your ftifectioniate I It M I T.

Adjo.' The next letter relates almost exclusivelv to his friend Cowvper:Mv dear Brother in affliction,-I reqttested our kiii(d sympathetic frieid Rose to t-}hank vou fior yOUr' aflectionate niourntul, remiembrrance of the atllicted Hermit, and to give vou some account of mne, when I was hardh alllc to (rive any saccount of myself. Since tle second (f tlls long, but now expirlig month, thle second fatal Friday ! (when my dear angrel departed, as our beloved Cowper Ihad departed oln tile preceding Friday) I have existed in that feverish agitationl of recent antruish in the heart, which you will easily conceive; and by too great an esertion, in atten('n, illy young friend Meyer to Kew, and occasionally to London, after his endearing attention to the funeral of the angelic youtlh, whose loss we can never cease to feel, I have rather encreased the feverish tendency in my old shatterred frame, and seem to myself in a sort of middle state, between life and death. I amn now trying, bv quiet and solitary meditation, to nurse myself inlto a firmer tone of mind and body, that if it should prove my destiny to remain a few years longer in this vale of tears, I may not be utterly an idle heavy piece of lumber on the earth. ' Youl I hope, nly dear Johnny, will feel yourself impelled by tile inore active promising season of your life, and by your affectionate zeal for the honour of our dear ' The editor supposes these curious lines must have adverted to a reluctance, expressed by him, to write a preface to the octavo edition of Cowper's Homer, lest he should provoke some painful criticism on his very inexperienced and insufficient pen. But more than twenty years baving elapsed between his first receipt of the letter and his re-perusal of it on the present occasion, he cau only class himself with the reader in expounding the riddle. Should the reader class himself with hill, in thinking the letter not unworthy of insertions as a fair specimen of the occasional playfulness of the author's style, the riddle contained in it will be sufficiently solved.' 4't A chesnut, raised by the editor, from a Dut he gathered in the chesnut-walk of the grounds of Weston-Underwood, described in "T6he Task," in the auturmn of the year in which Cowper died.' I I i departed bard, to cherish his mnemory, as you have nobly cherished his declining health and I hope to see you distinguish yourself, as you ought to do, in the character of his biographer. rIhe life of every poet, as afnihal)Ie as cowper, (if, indeed, there ever existed, or ever may exist, another poet so pefectily ailiable,) should be written by an intimate triendJ., completely sensible of his virtues, anld enarnoured of his genius. You have every advantage for the successful accoinplins!ment of so soothing a task ; and if vou Imodestly suppose, that you may want any kind of literary assistance, you know you maty freely command two very zealous and sincere friends in Rose and the Hermit. Has the formier sent you a little inscription for the enguralved portrait of Cowper, which hie requestedl tie to write, and which, to oblige him, I wrote extempore, though with a head and heart full of pain, in mny recent visit to himn ? XAs the miiultiplicity of his avocations may not have left him leisure enoutgh to copy for you this trifle, it shall find a place on this paper; so here it is for you; and if you have it already, you will forgive the repetition: "' ON THE PORTRAIT OF COWPER. '"Behold the bard, who captivates all hearts, In humnour's frolic, or in falucy's flight! To all),whom verse can touch, his verse imparts Sweet relaxation or sublime delight." ' And now, my dear Johnny, let me scold you for cruelly withholding from mne all those particulars concerning the grave ofour dear bard, which, by your mysterious intimations concerning them, would prove highly soothing to my heart and fancy. You kindly meant, perhaps, to draw me by these mysterious intimations to visit the interesting spot; and in some propitious season I shall hope to attain that mournful gratification. In the Tnean time, have the charity to tell me every thing that relates to the friend, whom I loved so tenderly, whose memory is hardly less dear to me, than that of my angelic child, the most mild and magnanimous of martyrs ! 'Ah, my dear Johnny! what have we both lost in those two departed spirits! and what an inestimable treasure do we still possess ill the recollection of their admirable endowments ! Adieu? Write soon, and continue to love Your affectionate afflicted hIE R AIT.' Here we close the ' Life of Hayley,' and, although his friends and admirers may bear with so heavy a tax on their patience and pockets, yet we cannot but condemn it as injudicious and uncalled for. Were authors generally to turn their own biographers, and send their Memoirs to the world ill so expensive a form as those of Hayley, a private fortune would be exhausted in lives of our contemporaries; but there is, happily, a corrective in public opinion, which regulates the supply according to the demand.

THE LAME ENGLISHMAN. By Warwick D)eeping. 6s. (('apse Ll.) Tue Lame Englishman was unsensational in appearance, but romantic in spirit. His name did not help him much, either. ir it was Thomas Smith: moreover, he was respectably well oft. and his mother was always writing to remind himni to wear his white muffler on cold nights. He resented all this, and, thoughi he was a verv decent fellow, he allowed it to prey upon his mind so much that hie became morose. However, he was living-for the timebeing-in Rome. and the year was 1849. Smith xvas interested in the cause of the people, and thus lie came to meet a vcry perfect heroine, who, unfortunately, was already married to a fat Italian. In spite of his lameness, Smith was accepted for Garibaldi's regiment, and he saw his full share of fighting (and remarkably well it is described) before NMr. Deeping sees fit to wind up his story on p. 370. 'We wish 'Mr. Deeping could have gone on for a little, for " The Lame Englishman " is a very good novel indeed. For its clever study of a certain type of character and for its general interest " The Lame Englishman " is worthl' of a very hill place among this season's novels.

Host (Janet), Tbs Fottrth Gbnwution: Reminiscences, 12/6 net. Constable Mrs. Ross, as her title indicates, and as hundreds of readers know, comes of a family distinguished through several generations. Her grandmother ? a Taylor of Norwich?was Mrs. Austin, the translator of many German books and the " santa protettnce'' of scores of Italian refugees. Her mother, Lady Duff Gordon, whose beauty and charming personality made a strong impression upon all who met her, was a friend of Carlyle, of ' Eothen' Kinglake, and, above all the rest, of Mrs. Norton, who wrote to her some of her most characteristic and witty letters. Mrs. Ross herself was painted, as a child, by Watts, and in her girlhood was the original of Meredith's Rose Jocelyn. Her * Reminiscences,' which touch so many men and women and so many countries, have the pleasant flavour of her direct and simple nature. The numerous portraits are singularly interesting : a full-length photograph of Watts, in which his fine, picturesque head surmounts the formless coat and trousers of the fifties, provokes an involuntary smile ; while that of Meredith at 35 shows us how magnificent must have been the appearance of the young man who wrote ' Emilia in England * and ' Evan Harrington.' Of Mrs. Norton there is a portrait by Watts the original of which, in the Dublin Gallery, has been cruelly disfigured by the addition of a frill and shoulders that almost succeed in destroying its charin and distinction. When these horrible appendages are covered, it becomes the most attractive likeness yet published of that beautiful woman, while the strong resemblance to her grandmother, Elizabeth Linley, attests its truth. But, indeed, there is no end to the delightful things in this book. Who that loves the London of the past can read without a twinge of sur?rised envy that Mrs. Ross remembers [ary and Agnes Berry; or that, in the forties, she dwelt in that Queen's Square (now, alas ! modernized into Queen Anne's Gate) which was honoured by the residence of Jeremy Bentham, James Mill, and Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Pendennis ?

NEW NOVELS. The Shuttle. noff IXXr, By Frances Hodgson Bur- nett, (nememann.) The author excels in the sympathetic presentation of American women, and though the beautiful heiress from New York has become rather hackneyed in English fiction, we must admit that she is here made unusually attractive. The international relations of England and America are also viewed with originality and humour, yet in no grudging nor cynical spirit as regards either country. Here and there we notice discrepancies chronological and otherwise. Married women have had control of their own money in England for a good deal more than twelve years, and it is surely a libel on the average Early Victorian husband to represent him as incapable of fetching and carrying for his wife. The story, which, though rather long drawn out, maintains its interest well, possesses a villain of the " half - beast, half - devil " type affected by the author, and some slightly over-coloured melodrama. Among the minor characters, a deformed child and a commercial traveller deserve special praise.

Travels through thc United States of North America, the Country ?f the Iroquois, and Upper Canada, in the Tears 1795,1796, and 1797 ; with an authentic Account of Lower Canada. ?y the Duke de la Rochcfoucault Liancourt. 2 Vols. qto. 2/. 14*. Boards. Phillips. 1799. lHE druggies of the firft inhabitants of a new and untried country, the alternate fucceffes and disappointments which they experience, form an intereding fubje6t of contemplation, as well as an inftruftive leffon for fubfequent adventurers. The Vaft country now comprehended within the territories of the United States, the varied foils, and the different productions, Viii long contribute to fupply this intered or this inftru&ion. The (lore is exceedingly copious; and, though our prefent traveller has united great attention to no common abilities, much mud remain for future inveftigation. 4 It is to the philofophical enquirer, of whatever nation, that fuch details as the following volume contains, concerning the date of life and manners in America, are likely to be the mod acceptable and indructive. The progrefs of colonization ; the firft diffufion of new inhabitants through unappropriated wades ; the duggi(h aukwardnefs of infant hutbandry ; the relapfe into barbarifm of thofe outcads from polifhed fociety, whom their fortune conducts into regions, where they can converfe only with the wildnefs of rude nature, and where they are deditute of all the accommodations of the arts; the timplicity of government, and of life and manners, that is natural in countries where population is fcanty, and in which the fubdivifions of labour, and all the complex accommoda* dons of fociety, are unknown ; the curious contrail between colonial and favage manners, and the effects of the collifion between barbarifm and civility; topics interefting to philofophy, above almod all others in the hidory of human nature, and, of all, the mod imperfectly known; are to be now, for the fird time, fully elucidated, by a vigilant and unremitting obfervation of the phafes of focial life in America. For the purpofes of afcertaining and iliudrating the mod important principles of general polity and jurifprudence, how often have philofophers in vain attempted to explore the forgotten and unrecorded beginnings of civil life ! How often lamented, that the mod intereding period in the progrefs of fociety, diould thus be prior to the age of enlightened obfervation ! How often and how ridiculoufly laboured to fupply the deficiency of records by that fort of theory which has been pompoufiy chridened Conjectural Hidory !' Vol. i. P. v. While we acknowledge the judnefs of fome of our tranflator's other remarks, refpedling the peculiar intered that we mud feel in the picture thus prefented to us of the vigorous progrefs of the fcions chiefly from our own dock, we cannot fully agree with him in his opinion of its importance in the view jud flated. The different fettlers admit no comparison. Thofe who emigrate to America from Great-Britain, France, or Germany, carry their own ideas,either civil or political; they are, in a great degree, civilifed, their manners are formed, and their views concentred in fome focial union. The colonies of ancient Greece and of Rome had little of fuch civilifation: they were only lefs favage than the aborigines whom they found, and their chief fuperiority confided in their milU tary fcience. They were gradually foftened and refined when peace had fucceeded to conqued; and they owed their laws and regulations to fome fuperior genius, or fome civilifed ilranger. It is indeed true, that the back-fettler, in America, foon degenerates into the Savage date of the earlier Grecian colonids; and his views mud again expand, as circumdances favour or force their evolution. Yet it is difficult wholly to eradicate what has been fo forcibly implanted; and the Sueceflbrs of each nation, which has Supplied the colonids, are dill didinguifhed by their peculiar manners and Sentiments. The author is one of thofe benevolent noblemen, who, having loofened the chains of a frantic multitude, differed by hs excefles. Difappointment has Soured his temper, and given an afpenity to his remarks. Though protected, and in Some degree Supported by Great-Britain, he bears in his bofom the utmoft rancour againd this fodering parent. Let us attend to his own words. 41 am at a lofs to account to myfelf for the various perceptions, which prefled upon my mind, and prevented my feelings from being entirely abforbed by gratitude, and by the pleafing fenfations it naturally produces. I love the Englifli more, perhaps, than any other Frenchman; I have been condantly well treated by the Englifli ; I have friends among them; I acknowledge the many great qualities and advantages which they poflefs. I deted the horrid crimes which dain the French revolution, and which dedroyed Sq many objects of my love and edeem : I am banifhed from France; my edates are confifcated; by the government of my country I am treated as a criminal or corrupt citizen; fevered from all I held dear-, I have been reduced to extreme, inexprefiible mifery, by Robefpierre, and the red of the ruffians, whom my countrymen have differed to become their tyrants; nor are my misfortunes yet confummated?and yet, the love of my country, this innate feeling, now fo painful to me, fo clafhing with my prefent Situation, tnlds an abSolute Sway over my Soul, and purSues me here more cJoSely than elsewhere. This Englift flag, under which I am Sailing over lakes where the French flag was So long difplayed; theSe forts, fheSe guns, the Spoils of France, this condant obvious proof of our former weak ne Ss and of our misfortunes, give me pain, perplex and overpower me to a degree which I am at a loSs to explain. The SucceSs, lad year, obtained by lord Howe, which the Englifli mention with more frankneSs, bec au Se they fuppoSe our intered to be intimately connected with theirs; the eagerneSs they diSplay in announcing new defeats of the French, the accounts of which are prefaced by the aflurance, that Englift triumphs and exertion (hall reinflate us in the pofleflion of our edates, and followed with congratulations ; all thefe common topics of conversation, which our ?uefts Seem to introduce with the bed intention, prove more painful to my feelings, as J am neceflitated to hide my thoughts, jed I ftould be deemed a fool by the few, in whofe eyes I am no jacobin, po Robefpierrian, and becauSe I am, as it were, at croSs purpofes jtith mySelf. And yet it is a Sentiment rooted, deeply rooted ia my foul, that I would continue poor and banifhed, all the days of my life, rather than owe my reiteration to my country and my eftates, to the influence of foreign powers, and to Britith pride. I hear of no defeat of the French armies, without grief, or of any of their triumphs, without my felf-love being gratified to a degree, which at times I take not diffident care to conceal*. And yet, notwithdanding thefe feelings, the confefEon of which may appear ridiculous in my prefent fituation, I cannot difcern the period, when anarchy (hall ceafe in my ill-fated country, and liberty, regulated by wife and efficient laws, afford happiness at lead to thofe, who are not banifhed; when France (hall reft her glory on a fafe and lafting foundation.' Vol. i. P. 262. The confeflion of thefe feelings is not 4 ridiculous' only ; the indulgence of them, for a moment, is unjuftifiable; and perhaps M. de Rochefoucault might have confeffed fomething Hill more reprehenfible. He travelled atthe time when the Britim influence was gaining the afcendency 5 yet he tells us that he found every one in the French intered, every heart open to the French, every voice congratulating their victories or lamenting their defeats. This opinion would not have been fo ?warmly exprefled, had it not been known that it was pleafing to the traveller; and, after the confeflion we have transcribed, we may believe, without a great breach of charity, that the general predilection was not differed to languith without the cheerings of his approbation, the flame not permitted to decay, without the animating; gale of his applaufe. We may add, that, at the time of his vi fit, the commercial treaty between Great-Britain and the United States had not long been concluded ; and it meets, as may be expected, with his drong reprehendens. Having given his reafons, he hints that thefe were the topics of his arguments in converfation, teemingly with a view to prevent the treaty from receiving the approbation pf the congrefs. We can never difapprove the generous fupport of French emigrants by this country, but we mufi lament the depravity of many individuals, who avail themfeives of this protection, to difcover the unprotected part into which the dagger may be mod fecurely planted. We have noticed the conduit of La Fayette and Peroufe in this refpedt, as well as of our traveller. May we never have occadon to add to the lift! Againft M. de la Rochefoucalt, the governors of Canada appear to have been on their guard. Lord Dorcheder forbade his travelling * ? Thefe " Confejpons d'un Emigre'" wh/ch ingenuoutly exprefs the true fentiments of a very confiderable part ot the emigrated French nobility and pentry, are not, it feems, unworthy of the notice of foreign powers, and efpccially "of our government. A French emigrant, who acted in the Weil Indies as ficldofficer in the Britith fervice,, regretted that the " pavilion cheri" was not waving at the matt-head of the vefTel, on board of which he was going to combat the French. ^-Tmnjl. A through Lower Canada; and general Simcoe, perhaps, equally knowing the tendency of his vim, made him the vehicle ot Such intelligence as he withed to convey to the Gallo-American government of that time, and amuSed him with plans which he could not intend to carry into execution. With this political depravity at his heart, we cannot be always pleaSed with the man ; yet we cannot but edeem his acT count of rifing colonies, druggling with difficulties, with difeafe, and often with want. The defcriptions are clear and explicit, and the obfervations, in general, are judicious. As we cannot follow him minutely, we (hall give a (ketch of his tour, and felcc5l a few of the prominent features of the picture. In the earlier part of the tour, he proceeded from Philadelphia to Morris-Town ; thence, northward, to Wilke(barre, the Afylum, Friendfmill, Geneflee; and, wedward, to Buffalo Q&ek, Fort Erie, and Lake Ontario. He vifited the Britifh fcttlements on Lake Ontario, in Upper Canada ; and, having returned to Fort Ofwego, repaired to Albany, Bodon, and Philadelphia. The account of the Dunkers, in the neighbourhood of Lancader, is intereding; but thc principal tenets and the general conduct of this Society are well known. Their vow of chaftity is apparentlv not better obServed than their pretended Selfdenial in other refpects. Even in this democratic, or rather republican Society oS monks, the principal affumes didindtions of rank.

DrunkenneSs is the prevailing vice, and, with few exceptions, the Source of all other evils. A fpirit, or rather habit of equality, is diffufed among this people, as far as it pofiibly can go. In feveral inns, especially Such as are fituate on leSs frequented roads, the circumdance of our Servant not dining with us at the Same table excited general aftoniftment, without its beSpeaking any bad intention.on the part of thofe who manifefied ir. The inhabitants exhibit to drangers finking inltances boih of the utmod cleanlinefs and ex-, ceflive naftinefs. They are much Surprised at a refufal, to deep with one or two other men in the fame bed, or between dirty (beets, or to drink after ten other perfons out of the fame dirty glafs; and they wonder no leSs, when they See drangers neglect to-waft their hands and face every morning. Whifky mixed with water is the common drink in the country. There is no Settler, however poor, whoSe family do not drink coffee and chocolate, and eat Salt meat at breakfad. At dinner comes fait meat again, or Salt fi Qi and eggs; and at Supper, once more Salt meat and coffee. This is alfo the general rule in inns. An American fits down at the table of bis landlord, and liej down in the bed, which he finds empty* or occupied but by one perfon, without in the lead enquiring, in the latter of thefe cafes, who that perfon may be. We have hitherto fortunately efcaped a perfonal trial of this lad American cudomf but were very near experiencing it at White's. * The roads are good, where the foil is io, the road by Lancader excepted ; art has hitherto but little meddled with the roads in Pennfylvania. Such fpots as are bad and muddy are filled up with trees, placed near each other; when thefe fink into the ground, others are laid upon them. Over fmall brooks, bridges are thrown, which conti ft of boards, placed on two beams, laid along the banks of the brook. Thefe boards frequently rot, and remain in this condition for months together, without its entering into any one's head to replace them with others. We have paded feveral fuch bridgeSp with great danger to our horfes, from the bad condition of the boards. All this will be better in time; yet I mean to defcribe things jud as they are now. Creeks are generally forded. Acrofs fome, which are very deep, wooden bridges are thrown; which, however, are not fuch as they diould be: the boards, or fmall trees, with which they are covered, are neither fo good, nor fo clofe to each other, as might be wiflied.' Vol. i. P. 68. Dr. Priedley is fettled at Northumberland; and M. dc la Rochefoucault gives fome anecdotes of this celebrated emigrant and his family. * The perfecution experienced by Dr. Priedley would hardly have driven him fo foon to quit England, had he not expected to enjoy in America that high celebrity and didinclion, which were promifed him by fome dattering friends. His celebrity was, however, of no long duration; the Americans are too little fenfible of the value of that knowledge by which he has acquired fo didinguifhed a rank among the literati of the age. They concern themfeives but very little about dogmatical difcuflions of the Bible, and the tenets of the Unitarians ; and would readily give up all the experiments on air for one good and profitable fpeculation ! The periecuted from various countries have, in thefe late years, fought an afylum among the Americans; fuch arrivals, are, therefore, no uncommon fight to this people; and they have not much time to lofe in vain civilities. Under thefe circumftances, the refpect diown to Dr. Priedley, who is a profound philoibpher, an admired writer, a celebrated chemid, and a vidtim of the Englith minidry, did not lad long. A few dinners, given to him at New York, where he landed, and at Philadelphia, to which place he afterwards proceeded, formed the whole train of honours which graced his reception. His fpn, who arrived in America fome time before him, had bought lands, where all the Unitarians, and oil the persecuted of old England, were to join and rally under the doctor's banner. This fettlement was to enjoy a didinguifhed protection on the part of the American government; and to fecure to the doctor a name, as chief of the feet, and founder of the colony* Bot thefe hopes have already vaniflied. No Englifhmen have arrived to purcbafe his lands * and the government of the United States, even that of Pennfylvania, did not confider the project of the doctor's Settlement as more important than that of any other individual. The condant praife of his uncommon merits as a natural philosopher induced his friends -at Philadelphia to folicit for him the profeflbrftip of chemiftry in the college, which they obtained; but this place was far beneath the expectation of the doctor, as well as of his family ; and it became neceffary, even for the prefervation of his celebrity in Europe, to withdraw from a Scene, where bis attempt of attracting univerfal attention had completely failed. 4 He therefore removed to Northumberland. The lands, purchafed by his fon, were Situate in that county, though he had actually reSolvcd to relinquift the idea of founding a colony, which would have bad no colonids but his own family ; yet his removal to Nor* thumberland, at lead had not the appearance of an intention to abandon, in fo abrupt a manner, a project which had already been announced to the world. 4 As Mr, Guillema rd was (lightly acquainted with young Prieftley, and more particularly with Mr. Cooper, who has alfo fettled in Northumberland, we were induced to prefer halting at that town, rather than at Sunbury, though both lay on our road; that I might gratify the wifh which I entertained, to be introduced to a man fo juftly celebrated. The project of forming the intended fettlement in the country is entirely relinquifhed ; Mr. Morris has generoufly taken back the greater part of the lands which young Priedley bought of him lad year, with all the formalities prHcribed by law. He bas alfo found means to difpofe of the red, and has bought Some fend near the town, which he is now clearing and preparing for cultivation. The doctor has built a houfe, to which he intends removing about the end of the Summer. His modes of life and drefs are nearly the fame as in England, the wig excepted, which he has laid afide. He frequently laughs at the world, but in a manner which clearly appears not to be from his heart. He fpoke with great moderation of the political affairs of Europe, and in very mild expreflions of England. He is now buded in the inftitution of a college, for which (ix thoufand dollars have already been fubferibed, and leven thoufand acres have been afligned him, as a free gift. In this eftablifiiment, of which he has drawn up a proSpectus, there is a prefident's place, doubtleSs intended for himfeif.' Vol. i. P. 74. Our traveller afterwards reprcfents an auderity of manners, and a peculiar claim of precedence by Dr. Priedley's family, as reafons with many for declining to Settle in this neighbourhood. We are Sorry to obferve, alfo, that the domedic hours of the philoSopher are not Soothed by friendship and good neighbourhood, Some mifundei Randing having taken place be- tween him and his neighbour Mr. Cooper. With excellent talents, he might have been what he withed, had he not aimed at every thing. At Friendfmill, M. de la Rochefaucault met with a fe?t of fe* ceding quakers. The chief of this fe?t was a female quaker, who aflumed the title of the All-Friend, arid fuperintended the fpiritual concerns of the fociety, * keeping her (tate* with much dignity, under the idea of fomething fuperior to humanity. Yet the prying eyes and inquidtive difpofition of our author feem to have detected circumftances not altogether fpiritual in fome part of her conduit; and a young novice was a witnefg of a converfion not unlike that which is mentioned in the Bath Guide of the facetious Anftey. At prefent, from thefe and other caufes, her influence is declining : but Jemima may, perhaps, poflefs diffident worldly policy to carry on her farce to her lad moments ; and Rachel Miller, her af&ftant, may continue it a little longer. The eftablifhments of captain Williamfon, on the north of Friendfmill, and between Jemima's territory and Lake Ontario, are on a very extendve fcale. His plans, and the foundations of his fuccefs, are explained at length : yet it cannot be concealed, that epidemic fevers taint the otherwife glowing profperity of thc eftablifhment; and there is a (Inking contrail between this, and the diftrift of the Maine, on the north-eaft of Bofton, where the cultivator, though poor, appears healthy and happy. The country, in the midd of thefe fmall lakes, fituated on the fouth of Lake Ontario, is defcribed from actual obfervation. The (ketch of Indian manners, obferved in this fpot, offers nothing very interefting. The Indians were regaled with rum, and they were, of courfe, in the French intered. With the fame treat from Englifh hands, they would have been adherents to ourcaufe. The mineralogical obfervations, in this part of the tour, we will feledt. * In the vicinity of Philadelphia the rocks are all compofed of granite or gneifs. The mod common is a granite interfperfed with mica, and you frequently meet with large ftrata of mica or talc. The drata of thefe rocks incline towards the horizon, forming an angle of about forty-five degrees. The layer of earth, fpread over them, is generally a fort of fand of the fame quality as the rock. Under this bed of fand, a hard fort of clay is frequently met with. 4 T|iis large mafs of granite is interfered by veins of horndone, calcareous fpars, and other lime-Hones, with very good marble. On the banks of the Schuylkill, and efpecially near Norriftown, a vein of fine marble flioots out of the furface ; it is connected with the rock of granite, which, towards the north-wed, borders upon the Fiver. 4 The direction of all thefe veins generally forms a right angle with that of the ftratum of granite, and they ufually drop in a line perpendicular to the horizon. 4 In the whole neighbourhood, no petrifactions are Sound of marine animals and plants, or of any thing Similar; but in holes, dug in the ground, as well as in brooks, a done is frequently met with of a loofe and granulated texture, which is eafily pulverifed, and bears a clofe affinity to fluor. K 4 Further northwards, the foil, which before was much covered with mica, begins to be lefs fo, and the rocks contain lefs granite. Near the creek Perkioming, a reddifli argillaceous flate is found, with which the country in general abounds, till you come within nine miles of Reading. Here begin ftrata of a done of a light grey, and Sometimes of a blueifli colour, which breaks into large Square pieces, and Seems to be a Species of fluor. 4 On the road to Reading, at a Small diflance Srom that place, are found large mafles of a kind of pudding-?ftone, confiding of fragments of gneifs and flate, imbedded in a dark grey baSaltes. 4 Near this Spot is found calcareous Spar, but in Small quantities; and in the vicinity of Reading is much lime-done. 4 We were told, that pudding-done, in this country, is never found in drata; it is commonly of a dark red colour, which is rather dull. * 4 The country about Lancader, alfo, abounds in lime-done, but without any impreflion of marine animals. The adjacent drata confifl of a greyift flate, and (ink deep into the ground. 4 On the banks of the Sufquehannah a dratum of fandy loam covers the perpendicular veins of gneifs and flate, which, at times, form confiderable mafles. 4 Near Middle Town the rocks are of a reddifli colour, and contain much clay. On pading the Peters' mountains, you meet with much granite; yet (late predominates. The rocks, which form the bafes of the mountains, or the deep banks of the river, on the road from Northumberland to Afylum, exhibit but little variety in a mineralogical point of view. In fome places, the flate breaks readily into Small plates, which are made ufe of to cover the roofs of houfes. No granite appears any more; and both in brooks and rivers freedone is found, with impreflions of Sea animals and plants. Quartz disappears by degrees. The Soil confifis of Sand, except in plains, meadows, and low grounds, which are covered with either rotten plants or vegetable earth. The ground, in general, is So much covered with earth, that a traveller, who has no time to explore rocks and done-quarries, will hardly be able to form a complete and discriminative idea of the minerals of this country. 4 Near Loyalfock dones are to be found, which have the appearance of bafaltes. Some contain mica, but in a very Small proportion. Above ASylum the rocks are of an argillaceous compofition. The foil in the neighbourhood is, Sor the mod part, rich and fertile. The drata incline with a lefs acute angle, and frequently run pa- rallel to the horizon. The done, when broken, appears of a tedaceous texture, and its grain refembles metallic particles, not yet per* featly formed. Free-done is frequent, and fo is bafalt. Broad level plains, expofed to inundation, form the greater part of the territory, which extends towards the didrict of Genetfee. At Painted Pod, the water rofe, in December 1797, nineteen feet above the common level for the dimmer months. The depth of the layers of earth, and the fwamps, greatly obdruct mineralogical refearches. * The fird drata, in which I found marine bodies in their native beds, are in the vicinity of the fmall lakes, between Lake Seneca and Crooked Lake. Near Friendfmill and Frienddanding, oyder-diells, with remains of other tedaceous animals, are found in a foft argiU laceous done. Farther wed the argillaceous dones difappear, and are fucceeded by calcareous. The country grows more aud more flat; but wherever the nature of the ground, or morafles, did not prevent us from examining into the nature and form of the drata, they ran nearly parallel to the horizon. They are, for the mott part, of a calcareous compofition, and contain numerous remains and impreflions of fea animals. Of this defcription are mott of the dones in Big Plain, on the Buffalo Creek, on the banks of Lake Erie, at lead at its extremity, the only part which we traverfed, and on the fouthern bank of the river, as far as Niagara.' Vol. i. p. 187. Thefe fa?ts feem to diow that the lakes were once a part of a vad mediterranean fea, dividing the eadern from the wedern part of America ; and thould the weight and force of the waters dedroy the rocks, which form the vaft cafcade of Niagara, the lakes above, comprehending a vaft extent of fea, would equally difappear for a time, increafe thofe below, and at lad leave the whole a dry, probably a fertile ground. At prefent the.country, to the fouth of Lake Ontario, refembles that on the ead of the Baltic. It is gradually left by the water, and has all the imperfe?tions of a fituation thus emerging from the deep. The defcription of the Fall of Niagara we mud feled. * At Chippaway the grand fpe&acle begins. The river, which has been conftantly expanding from Fort Erie to this place, is herc upwards of three miles wide; but on a fudden it is narrowed, and the rapidity of the dream redoubled by the declivity of the ground on which it flows, as well as the fudden contraction of its bed. The channel is rocky ; and the interfnerfed fragments of rocks encreafe the violence of the dream. The country is flat and even to this point; but here a range of white rocks arifes cn each fide of the river, which i's contracted to half a mile's breadth. This range is a branch of the Alleghany mountains, which, proceeding from Florida, previoufly to their reaching this point, interfect the whole continent of America. The river, more clofely hemmed in by the rocks on the right, incroaching upon its channel, branches into two arms, one of which flows along the bank, formed by the rockf on the right; and the other, far more confiderable, being feparated by a fmall ifland, makes draight on to the left, and fweeps through a bafon of done, which it fills with much foam and noife. At length, being again obdructed by other rocks, which it meets on its right, it alters its courfe with redoubled violence, and along with the right arm ruflies down a perpendicular ledge of rocks one hundred and fixty feet high, nearly half concave, and probably worn out by the incelTant impetuofity of the waters. Its width is nearly equal to that of its bed, the uniformity of which is only interrupted by an ifland, which feparates the two arms, reds unftaken on its rocky bafis, and feems, as it were, to fwim between the two dreams, which ruft down at once into this dupendous chafm. The waters of the lakes Erie, Michigan, St. Clair, Huron, and Lake Superiour, and of the numerous rivers, emptying themfelves into thefe lakes, inceflantly replace the water that thus daftes down. The water of the falls tumbles perpendicularly on the rocks. Its colour is, at times, a dark green, at others a foaming white, brilliant throughout, and difplaying a thoufand variegations, as it is druck by the rays of the fun, or, according to the time of the day, the date of the atmofphere, the force of the wind, &c* The water, which ruflies down the rocks, rifes in part in a thick column of mid, often towering above the height of the falls, and mixing with the clouds. The remainder, broken in its perpendicular defcent by fragments of rocks, is in continual agitation; Spouts and foams, and cads on (hore logs of wood, whole trees, boats, and wrecks, which the dream has fwept along in its courfe. The bed of the river, formed by the two ridges of rocks which extend a great way farther, is Still more narrowed, as if part of this mighty dream had vanifted during the fell, or were Swallowed up by the earth. The noiSe, agitation, irregularity, and rapid deScent of the dream, continue Seven or eight miles farther on, and the river docs not become Sufficiently placid for a Safe paflage till it reaches Queenfiown, nine miles from the falls.' Vol. i. p. 218. In Upper Canada, our author's observations are very particular ; and he traces the plans of general Simcoe with precifion and minutenefs. He does great judice to the Spirit of cnterprife, the extenfive views, the judgement, the prudence, and, in general, the great abilities of that governor; but cenfures him for his old animofity to the Americans, imbibed during the war of the revolution, and ill concealed in his common converfation. It requires no deep penetration to fee that the fentiments of the general, on thefe fubjedts, were defigned for the American government ; that he knew the character of his visitant, and managed his converfation accordingly. He fpoke daggers, but ufed none. Our author, from his converfation with the Canadians, re- peatedly inculcates their hatred of the Englifh, and predilection for the French. He could do no harm in Upper Canada, which, he is compelled to admit, is chiefly inhabited by loyalids ; but, in Lower Canada, he might have difleminated poifon, had a war enfued. Yet he feverely cenfures lord Dorchefter for refufing him admiffion within thefe territories: as well might he centure the condrudtor of a lazaretto for guarding againft a peftilence. That it would be ufeful or indeed expedient to refign Canada, or to allow it to be incorporated with the United States, is a queftion too delicate or too profound for our traveller's politics, and unflt to be difcuffed in this place. The arguments adduced by him are evidently thofe of a partifan, with no political acumen. The fur trade of Canada is reprefentcd as detrimental, without the profit of the goods, in which the afliftants are paid: but, on this head, we didruft our author's reprefentations. The crooked politics of the profefled pal tifan are too cotifpicuous in his reafoning on this fubjedt. From the detail of general Simcoe's plans, there is little doubt that thc wrhole of the fur trade, with all its profits or lodes, may, if fuch bc the with of our government, be retained by Great-Britain. In the way from Upper Canada to Albany, our author paded through the didridt of Saratoga. He fpeaks of the difadrous events of general Burgoyne's expedition, with what we confider to be, in his fttuation, an indecent warmth. In this part of the tour he alfo difcufles the treaty of commerce with America, which, as we have faid, he warmly difapproves, chiefly for this reafon, that it muft feparate America from France, * her true and natural ally.9 America has Cnce feen how well France has deferved that title. The tranflator afcribes the inveteracy to England, evinced in this work, to an anxious wifli for a reconciliation with the directory. But whatever may have been the means of effecting this at the moment, thofe which the traveller has adopted mud alienate thc Americans from the French ; nor does he conceal, that every Frenchman whom he met cordially detefted the Americans by whofe government he was protedted. At Bofton, his hatred to England blazes with little control, and is concealed with lefs referve. Injurious and malicious infinuations are conveyed in pointed terms; and ' the humiliation of England' is declared to be the objedl neared his heart. Our traveller, difappointed in his vifit to Lbwer Canada, executed his intention of vifiting the didridt of the Maine, to thc north and ead of Bodon, through which he originally intended to have come from Quebec. His objedt was to ville fenerai Knox, whom he met in his journey from Albany .to ?orton. This didridt is poor and infertile; but it bedows the chief of Wedings, health, and the inhabitants appear contented and happy. The fiftiery forms a valuable and important object in this part of America, and the details are full and apparently accurate. The picture is very different from what the other parts of America afford. Indead of agriculture, fifheries, fhip-building, and lime-burning, are the chief employments; and the inhabitants can thus procure corn from the more genial foils of the United States, at a lefs expenfe than they can cultivate it. Our author endeavours to (how, that they might raife a fufficiency of it for themfelves ; but this is the (hallow policy of modern reformers; for each didrict: ought to produce that for which its climate is bed fitted, and which can be obtained at the lead expenfe of labour or time, and the other wants (hould be fupplied from various regions. The facts, however, and the date of the difterent Settlements, in this part, which M. de la RocheSoucault records and defcribes, are important, as he had the bed means of information. 4 The country is healthful, though much colder than the great land-holders are willing to allow. Fogs and rains are more frequent here than in the more fouthern parts of America. The maritime fituation of the province of Maine, contributes, no doubt, to increafe the humidity of its atmofphere. The perpetual dampnefs on the fea coad produces a greater occafion for warm and conflant fires there, than in the interior parts. But, however rigorous the climate, it is diffidently favourable to the production of maize, and of excellent hay. Nor is there any jud reafon for fuppofing, that wheat and other grains would not thrive in it, if carefully cultivated. * 4 Life is ufually long and healthy in this province. It is not uncommon to meet with old men of the age of eighty or ninety years, though the general condition of the people be but miferable, at lead in that part of the country through which I accompanied general Knox. Save the brothers Almas, we found none who could be faid to be even moderately intelligent. They are univerfally poor, or at lead live as if they were fo in an extreme degree. The habitations are every where poor low huts. Every where you find a dirty, dark coloured, rye meal, and that not in fufficient quantity. The fort of frefli meat to be feen on any table is that of lambs, which are killed, not So much for the fake of procuring a good difh, as to prevent the (heep-dock from becoming more numerous than is defired. In (hort, of all America, the province of Maine is the place that afforded me the word accommodation. And, ccnfidering how little reafon I found to praife the accommodations of many other places, what I have now Said of Maine mud be regarded as an affirmation, that the condition of human life in that place is exceedingly wretched. 4 The common drink here, and throughout all America, is grog, or a mixture of water with rum or whifky. It is made alfo with gin or brandy, but not in thefe parts. * A fort of beer, made from the twigs of the fpruce-fir, is likeWife drunk here. MoIatTes, and occationally maple tree fugar, are joined with the fpruce twigs, in brewing this beverage.' Vol. i. P. 443. The remainder of this part of the tour, through the Maflachufets, Rhode Idand, Connecticut, and New York, to Philadelphia, contains a valuable account of the trade and agriculture of thefe provinces. Along this coad granite appears to abound; but occafionally fandttone, fchiftus, and limedone, occur. Through the whole of the tour, agriculture and its various operations and inftruments were obiervel by our traveller with particular attention. The climate, and the date of the thermometer, were alfo carefully noticed by him. We may add, that his defcription of the northern and eaftern re ions of ' the United States may be confidered as a valuable, and generally faithful, account of a country hitherto little known in its minute details. (To be continued.)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE LITERARY EXAMINER. The Rectory of Valchead, by the Rev. R. TV. Evans. London: Smithy Elder7 and Co. 1830. This is a book of extreme spiritual beauty, and constitutes in itself one of the strongest persuasions to the cultivation of a Christian habit of thought. This effect is produced not by any elaborate examination of testimony, or well-ordered array of proof, but by exemplifying the beauty of holiness in a particular family, and by the happy adaptation of Christian principles and consolations to the wants and necessities of social existence. The virtue of the book lies in the felicitous representation of this family in its various epochs of weal and woe under the genuine influence of the religious spirit. Religion is not made a matter of dogma or opinion, but a pervading sentiment, an atmosphere of light, which gives its hue to every action, feeling, and thought. The author is a man of great talent and learning, who has laid every thing at the feet of his creed. He has not learned Greek to read the fathers, or to controvert the positions of Gibbon ; but both Greek and Gibbon he looks upon with a heart overflowing with the spirit of Evangelism. He is evidently one who has never searched for proof, or sifted testimony; he has been taught the loveliness of Christianity when his heart was most susceptible,?is yet, and will ever be, animated by the impression of it. He does not deal in texts, in quotations, in authority,?for it is not by piecemeal that he makes up his case; by long and early study, by example and by precept, and perhaps from the possession of a peculiarly amiable temperament, he has imbibed the spirit of his system?and now he breathes it he writes out of it, not ot it or about it. We often hear of the admirable morality of the gospel; but we rarely see any other than nominal Christians?the most devout persons, except on solemn occasions, have adopted the worldly system ; and it is difficult any where to find an individual whose actions are really influenced by his belief. Real Christians are probably more rare than real Jews. But here we have the working of this Christian system exhibited not in vain phrases of admiration, but in recording the principles and actions of a particular family, guided by this parent ?a very patriarch under the new dispensation. A religion is a system by which every social transaction must be regulated, or none?it must either rule or rot; from the instant that a creed ceases to be the universal guide and standard, it proceeds to its fall. We have said that Christianity is almost nominal in England ; it has, in fact, ceased to preside in spirit over even the most solemn occasions. Mahometan ism, as yet, is as much the code of the soldier in battle, as of the Dervish in his cell; as yet, it is ali pervading. Christianity is admired and neglected. We go to church, and to pray, but the whole is a ceremony,?except the tithes. If Christianity is ever to resume its sway, we trust it may be the spiritualized Christianity of the Rectory of Valehead, where the system is shown as one which regulates our past action, or most casual thought, to the best end; which, as it was doubtless originally intended, is as much calculated for a moral guide to conduct, as a religious creed for belief?which as forcibly teaches the duty of man to his fellows, as it regulates his aspirations to the Deity. The family of Valehead, as here described by the last survivor of it, is a small community of holiness; the rector, who is the parent and head of rt, has infused his own spirit into his household; nav, further, into his parish; and were there such a rector in every parish, and a succession of such to be reckoned upoo, we might count upon his influence, and Curly give ourselves up to an ecclesiastical government; but human nature is too well understood for us to look upon such schemes, excepting ia the light ol a new Utopia?or lather aa old Utopia newly lighted up by the ingenuity aid ability of tl* nineteenth century.

TUB VALUE OF GARDENING AS AN AMUSEMENT TO CHILDREN. " He did not encourage us in taking the care of animals as our amusement, while be promoted our love of fostering plants to the utmost of his power. I perceive the wisdom of his distinction. In the former case, the passions of the creature provoke iu return the worst passions of its master, and its occasional resistance to his whim and caprice rouses iuto ac tion the elementary feelings of tyranuy. Besides, its condition in the creation comes too near our own to suggest much beyond the usual routiue of thought in a child. But in plants there are no passions to combat, there is no victory to be gained, which, in proportion to its completeness, inflicts on the conqueror himself the deeper moral wound. They obey implicitly, and show a kind of passive gratitude by faithfully exhibiting in their growth and appearance the smallest exertion of his hands. At the same time, the child soon finds, that, however foud he may be of indulging a cruel caprice or curiosity, he must forego it here. They can yield nim no homage of cries and groans by which to feed his feeling of power. But the beauty, tenderness, and delicacy of forms by which they return his labours, win his heart, &ud call forth its best affections. At the same time, every thing concerning them leads him on to the contemplation of an agent besides himself. Between the placing of the root in the ground, and the putting forth of the blossom, he perceives that a hand must be working when his own is idle, and without whose working his own would have been uselessly employed in the very first instance. Day after day, he comes to see more ana more the subserviency of his operations to those of this hand, and that continual working of Providence, which, from its familiarity, escapes our view in looking on ourselves, presents itself here almost palpable at every turn, and God is walking in the garden as in Paradise of old. Such was the process, as far as I can now conceive, of my thoughts: in addition to this, I reaped an inferior, though important advantage? I was led to note times and seasons, and learn the value ot an opportunity. u But our fondness for the garden, and familiarity with its objects aud operations, laid a fund for moral and religious illustration, whence my father dealed out to us with no sparing hand ; he followed, indeed, the example of a greater teacher still, who hath bidden us look at the lilies of thc field, who figured himself under the vine, and cursed the unbelieving Jerusalem in the barren fig-tree. Such illustrations come at once to the heart; they refer us to scenes of pure and innocent delight; and we feel a lurking flattery, despite of a melancholy feeling of the frailty of tenure which such types exhibit, at the being compared to flowers, glad that we can in any degree resemble and call to mind these beautiful and innocent tribes of creation. From the laying of the seed in the ground till it appear in the pod an hundred, or perhaps ten thousand fold, and come again into our hands to re-commit to earth, what a series of analogies for moral illustration ! Birth, infancy, youth, manhood, old age, and death, are thrust upon our reflection by a single plant in one short summer. The dew, the rain, the duly attempered heat, remind us of our blessings ; and the blight, the frost, the shears, warn us to prepare against equally sudden visitations. Every flower, too, from some peculiar characteristic, enforces its peculiar moral. The lowly yet fragrant violet, the tall flauntiug, but ifl-odoured poppy, the ubiquity of the hardy daisy, the snowdrop timidly opening the year, the foxglove glowing with rich purple, and glorying in the scorching heat of Midsummer, and the dismal-looking Michaelmas daisy, crying out to the rest of its tribe, like the poor prophet of Jerusalem, u Woe, woe, woe, for winter is coming I" and struck down at last in its speech by its icy dalt. All these convey their appropriate lessons, and my father stored himself well from their treasure-house. Thus, in one sense, every tree in the garden was a tree of knowledge; and the style of thought, produced by its moral associations, made it somewhat savour of tbe fragrance of innocence and wisdom which sanctified its blissful predecessor. *fc Trifles often show forth peculiarity of character with more decided effect than more important occasions. Our gardens proved this maxim abundantly: for, not only was it easy to distinguish which belonged to a boy, ami which to a girl, the latter cherishing the more delicate-hued and tender, the former the more flaunting and sturdy ; but, among those of the same sex, a remarkable difference was discernible. One of my brothers, who was afterwards a merchant, was an utilitarian, and his border was only such plants as were on the list of domestic economy. I was his next neighbour; and his sombre troop of sage, lettuce, and thyme, made a singular contrast with my showy array. 1 have heard many a hearty laugh, both from family and friends, at my centra) group of gaudy orange lilies, surrounded with knots of poppies, and my tall, stately, soldier-like hollyhocks, which took their stand there in their due season. My father would often amuse himself in viewing these characteristics, and would delight us by playfully entering into the merry rallies, which, with all good-nature, wc freely bestowed upon each other. We little thought that he was in mind going far beyond amusement, and that our most careless moments were to decide our future destination. But be was right. I verily believe that my garden sent ne off to India. ii1 P61**'^ a str*f Kti*8 violet or two yet lingering at thc foot of the wall where was once the plot of that sister, whose death 1 have already mc ntioned to you, as the first occurring in our family.

Lei the scholar and te raslie tell a story to a child: the former will soon be obliged lo yield um pah? to hit le? scampi ished riyal. Hence, the ciuld is continually imtibing the servant's notions, aud hangs upon his lips. Il gives us a glorious idea of God's economy when we find the care or neglect of the minds of our servants rewarded or visited ia the minds or our children, and are aware that not only what we have sown in the one we shall reap in the other, but also what we have allowed the great enemy lo sow in lae one we shall also reap in the other. The servant, in many respects, forms a most important medium between the parent aud child, delivering to it, in a form suited to its capacities (to which the parent, especially the tallier, often finds it most difficult to descend), what he has received in a form adapted to riper years. And, as the food which the mother eats is of too strong and stimulating a nature to be given immediately to her infant offspring, but in her breasts becomes wholesome milk, so passes the father's knowledge through the bosom of a faithful and pious servant to his child, coming to him thus in a form more suitable to his young faculties. Great, therefore, was my father's concern upon the right instruction of his servants, and great I acknowledge to have been the good which 1 have received from him in this indirect manner. Prom our old gardener we received, perhaps, the best portion ot' this indirect ly-transmitted knowledge. As we stood by, and watched with childish curiosity his various operations, and beset him with inquiries, as he sowed the seed, planted the root, pruned the bough, or dug and turned up the worm, while the sound of his spade brought the robins to him, birds to which, in children's minds, a kind of sacredness is attached, he had always some moral or religious application ready, which came pithily to our understandings, and impressively upon our hearts. Oftentimes, too, on these occasions he would, half in the way obtaining information, which he supposed we might have received from our father, half iu the way of instruction, examine us in our knowledge, and betrayed, I remember, amid all his authority, and impression that we were to be, in no long time, vastly his superiors upon that head. In fact, he treated us much iu the same way as our great house-dog had done when we were younger still, who, while he would playfully throw us down, turn us over with his nose, lay his immense paw upou us, or take our hands or legs between his fearful rows of teeth, yet in all plainly discovered, hy a peculiar manner, how well aware he was that he was dealing with future masters. I shall always think it a good sign of a child to be fond of the gardener, if at least he be such as ours was. TIIK POOR. 44 O, my friend, you yourself well kuowr how much, how very much is to he learned from conversation with the poor; learning thc conditions of our nature from them and from the rich, is the same thing as drawing precepts from practice and from books. To see punishment following sin, put aside the many delays formed by wealth and influence, all the stays which break the sinner's fall, and let him gradnaliy down; put these aside, and go to the poor. See, there, intemperance, sickness, want, following each other, without a single stage between. O, among the poor, justice is poetical indeed! To see real sickness, put aside all its artificial consolations, set a pallet for a bed, patience for palliatives, a family starving from the sick man's intermission of work, in whose ghastly faces he may count the weary days of his illness, and which salute him more ghastly each succeedingday: set this for a family which brings exery morning smiles on their ruddy countenances to cheer him. On one point, indeed, I have observed that the poor mau has ample compensation. Look at his death-bed?ho has nothing to lose, and all to gain, and therefore quits life with a resignation seldom seen among his richer brethren. fc* My father used to remark, that none can experience the full rights and advantages of Christiau citizenship, unless he maintain the relations which connect him with the ranks both above and below. To cultivate the knowledge of those above, requires little encouragement. The whole world cheers us on. But, to be properly acquainted with those below, requires no ordinary urging. Christ only is our encourager here ; here lies our trial; and here our grand reward." a father's feelings on meeting his family in a morning. *? Our family rose early: for indulgence in sleep was always reprobated among us as an injury done to nature, both in body and mind?hut my father was ever earliest. Whoever first entered the room always found him engaged over Scripture, or some volume of divinity, which he then laid aside: at this time he was more than usually cheerful. As each entered the room, he regarded them with a fixed aud penetrating look, from which a benevolent smile round his lips took oft* all that could make it the least disagreeable. I have heard him explain it: he would say, I know no feeling so exquisite, though it has been every day repeated for so many years (praised be God !), as that of the sight of my family in the morning. Having myself risen quite a renovated being, no particle remaining of that weary, and perhaps painful, load, with which 1 yesternight pressed my bed, and seeing them whom I then parted from^ returning to me with smiling and healthy countenances, 1 experience a renewal as it were of my existence, and, fresh myself, seem to receive my children afresh from the hand of God. I look and scrutinize their features, that I may discern in them traces of that blessed communion, from which they arc just returned to earth, and given to me again, and when I press their hands, feel an union with them which is ouite unutterable. And do you think, that upon such an occasion I do not look forward to that last morning of universal rising, when the good, having cast off the bondages of pain and care with which they lay down to rest, shall rise in heavenly vigour for everlasting day; and I, too (I humbly hope), shall receive my family at the hands of my Saviour, not one member wanting, never to part again* Oh, the thought it my continual stay and comfortP* The volume likewise contains a great deal of poetry, io a similar strain with the prose. Its aspirations ara of the same ardour and intensity as the poetry of the Divine Herbert, to which ii bears a suiking resemblance, excepting ia the absence of the conceits which, in Herbert's age, were indispensable, even in sacred verse.

Sketches of Natural History. By MARY HowITr. Effingham Wilson, WHEN we saw the name of tIowitt on the title-page of this book, we thought that if it contained only half as many lies as the History of Priestcraft was stuffed with, it would be a very saleable book. Ilowit's text is, that ninety-nine hundredths of mankind aie fools, and he would be their oracle-and we only wonder that a mind so sweetly attuned to nature could have been linked to a heart of granite It would be a great malady for Mr. 11owit to write for children; but while his much, very much better half writes as she has done here, she will perform an essential service to the rising generation. The book is beautiful, both in the poetry of nature and of paintng, and we cannot too strongly recommend it.

Edinb. 1825. at I Constable & Co. London. Hurst, Robinson, hill & Co. ev Tilis volume would have had stronger claims to I upon attention, bad it not been preceded bv such too superior publications as Captain Basil hall's, the and other travels, which have shed so full a light WI over the countries of which it speaks, that little En was left to he gleaned by new adventure. Mr. out Proctor, however, as agent for the Pleruvian Loan wil Contractors in London, had some opportulities hoi of picking up new inforrnation, and this lie has bat communicated intermixed with older and well- ant known matter, and in a style far from being the tra purest in a literary point of view. We do not, tht therefore, feel called upon to enter at any length we into his work-from wbich two or three quota- asi tions will, we are stue, be better than a larger number. wc There was, nevertheless, something novel, ret though patriarchal, except as to the candle part coi of the ceremony, in the fashion of his journeying arross4 the Andes. pa 1'IThe post-house," lie says, "v was very re- du spectable, consisting of one large room, into co which the door opened, which served for parlour th and bed-room to the family, while we were ac- is, conimiodated with a separate sleeping-chamber, co with wooden benchies, on wbich we spread the se beds. Finding that I must exhiect only one apart- pi ment for my family during the nwhole journey, I ar made uh) my mind that tile two femnale servants of mIust sleep in the room with us ; I arranged mat- se ters for this very purpose thus : the fenmales al- sy ways went to bed first, anti on a (toncerteti signal pi the candle was extingumished, anti I used to come fu .nd iindress; in the motning- I rose before tile room was light." ni With this arrangement Mrs. P'roctor and her Ih; maids appear to have been equally satisfied ; yet w it was unquestionably a droll sort of blind-mnan's- 1I buff. In this way tile party got to A'alparaiso--- ri which, savs MNr. P. " enjoys a *ery considerable b trade: ol an average, there are as mtanv as eightv f. vessels continually in the harbour, includimi, the ti old hulks called the navv', and the national yes- at sels. 'TIhe ordinary nmiber of British shiilps nil) o be about twenty, and nearl) as many North n Americans. Business ill the customn-house was I carrietl on in the most tedious and perplexing hi manner, because no regular system was esta- Ii blished ; and the clerks vere so open to briberv, ii that nothing could be done without it. TIle town is full of English, MImany of them of the lowest i description, aid of titm worst chmaramters; they i act as brokers, smiugglers, &c-, and ipotinve on tihe poor stranger arriving with a consignment of goods, and gti eralyv lhave bini to relput hi" cre&l:ity. 'Tbe pirinciPal exports from (C'hili are copper, I wheat, barley, hides, and hmri'4F;s in t/' ltin-e i latter articlctK Valpataibn hmb a vers considialle i coasting trade with Peru and (iuaywluil. It is one of the most unpleasant places in South America for a residence; for, independently of tl.e frequency of earthquakes, the town is so completely shut in by hills, that the heat in summer is dreadful: the place too is the sink of the whole country, so that the native population is of the worst kind. A night very rarely passes Without a murder; and foreigners. at the time I was there, seldom thought of going out after dark. 'rhe nx' tives of Chili are coonsidered the most bloodthirsty and uncivilised of all the Spanish Anmericans ; and though they show a great deal of outward l oliteness, they have recourse to their knives on the smallest provocation. Such is the case even in Santiago. I was enjoying the promenade of the Tall onte evenbing, and was suddenly startled by a person on horseback, who came galloping down the walk at full speed. Ile rode over a man and killed him on the spot, and continued his course without even looking back. Most of the English rushed to the place, while the native promenaders never took the least notice of the transaction, but saw the body carried off with the greatest apatliy. Within a day or two after this circumstance, an English officer in the Chilian service was riding out of the city, wheli he saw a man attacking bi-4 wife with a knife. The officer jumped oft his horse to intercede for the victim, when the hlusband immediately ripped up the officer's bowels and killed him. Mlurders are generally perlwatrated in the most cowardly manner by stabs in the loins, and the villain is out of sight before it'wounded person can turn round to face lhis assassin. Theaccountoftle PcoNlines, however.(now working by English capital) is the most interesting page of the volume; and copying it, we conclude: Before the traveller arrives at the town, liw passes over an elevated plaiu, covered with cattle during the pasture season, forming an agreealile contrast to the mountains that encircle it. At Ithe beginning and end of the rainy season, that is, in the months of December and Mlay, it is considered dangerous to cross this plain. in conse(quence of the tremendous thunder and lightning prevailing there. It is thought that the clouds I are attracted by the hills, and by the (1uantity s of metallic substances contained in them: they seem to vent all their rage on this level spot, anl spread terror, and even death; scarcely a season LI passing without accounts of new victims to the vfury of the storms. *'lie town of Pasco, properly so called, is fair going to decay, the vein of silver being munch e - 'r hausted vhicih attracted the population ; but, 't what is termeed the (Cerro (le Pasco. or hill of Pasco, from its metallic wealth, was rapidly rising into consequence before the revolution e broke out. The town is two or three leagues y farther from lima than Pasco itself, and is siLe tiated among the miines in a valley enclosed by o- uountains, and many of tIme buildings are erected iy on tIme slope of thme bill fromm wlmichl it derives its ;lm namie, and % uih is the source of' it~ coiist Iue.t(is It is a large straggliijg a11ce toiliosetI lirinciig pallyv of inlerior dwellings, with a few good t- houses interspersed amon, them without formy, ing any regular streets. ; *The climate is at all times unpleasant, and 'st in winter it rains almost immessanItlv, amCompa:y nied by thunder ;umud lightiming. fonmm wich a le number of accidents annually lhappve.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE IXTKBBUPTED WEDDING. Thr Intrrr>'pfrd Wedding. A Hungarian Tale. By the Aul lior of i% Marj- Powell/' &c. (Griffith and Fa min.) IN the " Interrupted Wedding " the author of that pretty hook, "Mary Powell," employs on the Hungarian rising in 1848 her vivid power of throwing herself into scenes different from the present. Thero is less of story whereon to hang the graphic incidents described than in those books in which tho manners of our own forefathers aro illustrated. The feelings which goaded tho peasants and nobles to war are shown in tho conversation at tho castlo and at tho villago wine-shop, and the misery of such war by the sufferings which the persons of the story experience during it. Tho peasant is for a long timo separated from his newlymarried wife, made prisoner, wounded and left for dead in his attempt to escape, and ; returns to find his cottage burnt, his mother fled, the noble wi io was improving the con- j dition of those ii his estate killed; yet such is his spirit of resistance to tho Austrian i rule that he employs himself in driving pro- | vision carts for the army as long as the war j lasts, being unfit for activo service from his j wound. The noble loses his life for the j cause, fighting against his former friends J and comrades; and his sister, who in mis? taken heroism joined the ranks, also shares tho same fate. This is tho story ; but the j interest of the work does not lie in tho story, but in the pictures, the incidents, which this talo serves to string together. We feel our? selves in an unknown land, so different are the habits of the Magyars from ours, their impulsive minds partaking of the fire of the East. We recur to the time when this hero? ism was shown in that repulse of the Turks which turned the tide of conquest and set Christendom for ever free from danger of their attacks. Here are ono and all roused to resist the infraction of their ancient con? stitution. Tho men haste to the light, tho women encourage them?nay, themselves here and there join the ranks; and why:' The feelings of the multitude are thus ex? pressed :? "The Constitution ha? been despised." "It has! it has!" "We will maintain it." "We will! we will! " " Kossuth is the man for us. Eljen Kossuth!" "What does all this mean?" said Paul to a man who was dining at the same table. Tlie man shrugged his shoulders and said, " lt means war, I think. The French Kovolution lias been like fire -et to dry crass ; and now it has reached us. Our foolish king is not the man to put it out. Instead of quieting matters, he has written to our Tala tine that we have no right to a ministry of our own?our money, anny, and our frontier guard must henceforth be given up to Austria." " And are we going to put up witii that ? " " Not if we can help it," Thus they are lighted up; the very dwarf joins the army, and does good service on horseback, returning wounded and crippled, but rejoicing that he was a partaker in the glorious resistance. To turn to the other side, how pathetic is the scene of Wildenheim finding the dead body of the Countess, who, forgetting "that woman should save life, not take it away/' had joined the army as a hussar, and wras killed in a skirmish. Just as she was, in her grey dolmany and crimson cap with its glistening heron's plume, her light Turkish sabre at her side, her hands crossed on her bosom, her face composed as if in slumber, with a sweet inexpressible smile on her lips, they carefully wrapped her in a large clean blanket, and, at daybreak, reverently deposited her in the grave. Wildenheim, within a few days, had thus lost the two persons dearest to his affections and imagination, both ranged against him in this fratricidal war. It is curious at the present time, when thc name of Kossuth has almost disappeared from public ken, to recur to his character as it appeared to contemporaries and countrymen. " Wherein lies the spell by which this Kossuth of yours wins all hearts ?" " Mainly in his in? tegrity," said Count Matthias, "though he is felt to possess commanding genius. But genius alone won't carn* the dav ! In the lons run there must bc goodness too. Kossuth's race has not long begun, but, from the opening of Ins career, when he used to report the debates, which were circu? lated in manuscript allover Hungary, we felt what was in him. His eloquence combines reasoning and feeling. Travel from one end of the country to the other, and you will find but one feeling about him! In the lowliest hut on the Puszt* at in j populous towns, the feeling is just the same. Should | it even not pleaso God to grant his efforts success, the peasant would still bless his name." There aro also characteristic touches of tho | Ban Jellachich, the harsh iron soldier, led by i tho blandishments of tho court, and of Gorgei, I whoso defection from the popular cause and j surrender of his forces were the death-blow I to the power of resistance. ' There is a certain air about many of tho incidents which prepares us for tho author's postscript and notes, giving her authorities for all her chief ovents and personages. Yet tho feeling on passing from tho story to these notes and postscript is like that experienced on turning to portraits from imaginative pic? tures, however good they may be. No one could read without this feeling the history of the Jew* Bar Simon, who east aside the Testa? ment presented to him with scorn, and, open? ing it afterwards, without recognising it, at the Sermon on the Mount, was so captivated by it that it became his favourite study. To take his own account:? At that time I despised it, afterwards I read it, was converted and healed. It was within me as a burning fire ; at the last I spake with my tongue. On the Sabbath it fell to me to expound the por? tion of Isaiah that had been read. I said : " This day is this Gospel fulfilled in your ears. Be it known unto you that by Jesus Christ of Nazareth, who was crucified, must other men be saved. There is no salvation in any other." At this word they cried out : " Cast him out! for it is not fit that such a fellow should live!" The book is one to be read with great interest, all tho more from its assisting to fix in our minds events of our own day, so readily forgotten from not yet having passed into standard history.

The Scottish Advent urercrs ; or the Way to Rise ; an Hi st cr ie a I Tide, by Hector Macneill, Esc;. ?J vols. small Svo. 12s. Blackwood. FEW objects arc of jmore importance to society, than the i tate of education anions that numerous Ci and very useful dat?, who are rared immediately above the lowest. These compose the betr*?r crder of mechanics and tradesmen; they not only themselves perform ;? great part of the business of tht Society, but superintend and employ the bulk of the labouring community. They do not merely worii with their hands, but require a verv considerable share of intelligence and information. Their situation too renders them liable to certain errors iu the mode of training their families. In general, they have * propensity to look upwards': the j are ambitious to remove themselves, as far as possible, from the class immediately beneath, and which is apt to claim a connexion with them. xl. all their habits, they are ever disposed to an imitation'of the gay and fashionable circle*; and this tendency has become peculiarly strong in the present age, which has been distinguished by the genera! diffusion of luxury throughout all ranks. No one has exerted himself so zealously and indefatigably in the counteraction of this reigning error, as the author of the present work. To expose it has been the grand aim of all his recent publications; and as he never undertakes any, which has not some benefit to the Iiubiic in view, his present undertaking rchtts to a quotion intimately connected with the same object. It is the established practice, in this country? for every one who can give his children any education at all, to srtul them for three or four vears to a grammar school; and this forms often nearly thewholeof thc instruction conferred upon them. Mr Macneill conceives, that, for those who are neither born to an independent fortune, nor destined for the learned professions, such an education must be wor*e than useloss, and can have no effect but that of giving them a distaste for the occupations in which their life is tobe employed. Ile insists, that if the time spent in learning mere words were employed in acquiring a knowledge useful lor the common affairs of life, vou mr men of this rank would be much better prepared for the part which they were to act. He illustrates this opinion by the history of two youths, one of whom h is received a good education in tiie ordinary sense of thc word; that U, has been rendered master of all that the grammar school can teach: the other according to his plan, has been initiated only in useful and practical branches. Trom the opposite reception and success wliich these two young men experience, when thrown unassisted upon the world, he endeavours to prove the superiority of one system to the other. In endeavouring to convey an idea of the manner in which this work has been executed, we do not conceive, that our readers would have reason ta thank us, for giving them an outline of the story. Thev will probably be much better pleased to trace it themselves, as it is unfolded by the author in the course of his narrative. We shall only mention, that the two young mea are hurried, by a disasastrous accident on board of a ship of war : and the first part of the work is chiefly employed in delineating the difference of their feelings and conduct in such a situation. Mr Macneill was peculiarly qualified to execute this task, having, as he mentions in the preface, been himself enured during the course of several years, to the habits of a seafaring life. It is rarely that persons qualified to delineate these manners, have had such good opportunities of observation. He shall therefore give a specimen of this part of the performance. It relates to the incidents which occurred immediately after our two heroes were placed in the very unpleasant situation above alluded to. " The boatswain, who was naturally a humane man, and, as far as was consistent with his duty, kind and indulgent to the seamen, had the two lads birthed and messed; and telling them to be of good cheer, and not cast down with their misfortune, assured them, that if they conducted themselves properly, and minded their business, they should be taken care of! " You have had a hard brush I find, my lads." said he, " at the commencement of your service, but that's nothing at all against you, but rather in your favour. We seamen must lay our account with meeting with these things every day in our lives, and the sooner we meet with them the better. All you have to do is, to attend to 'your duty, obey your order*, ?rder?, and do every thing as well as vdu can, and there is no fear of tour coining on.?We have no idlers, no skulkers here, every one must be active and alert!" So saying, he left them. " It was not long ere Tom found himself well enough to proceed on rieck, and explore the general scene that was moving around him. He was anxious to observe the nature of a service to which he was a complete stranger; but Andrew, whether from indifference, reluctance, or real illness, remained below in his birth, pleading his inability to move from the pain of the bruises wliich he had received in his Newhaven battle. Amidst all the misfortunes that had lately befallen kim, he had preserved his Horace, which now not only servedus a com[)anion to him in his hours of raeancholy solitude, but acted as a balm to his wounded mind, and a balsam to his sores, superior to any which the surgeon's mate could apply. As his prolonged confinement rather surprised the boatswain, who ?was informed by his attendant that the wounds in his head were completely healed, he paid him occasional visits to rouse him into action, and had invariably found him poring over a little book, which he read at the faint light of a small tallow candle, placed in a horn lanthorn. Wondering that a book of so diminutive a size could occupy him so long, and suspecting that he was " shamming Abraham," he one evening accosted him, after his usual salutation of Well, what cheer shipmate? in the following terms: " What! have you not overhauled that little book yet? Damn my eyes, there can't be much stuff in it? yne, I think, might get through it in an hour or two, and here you have been at it every night for near a fortnight?Let's see what like it ?wt ? is." said he, snatching the book out of Andrew's hands, and opening it? " O! I'm blasted if I understand one word of it!?What the hell is it ?" said he, turning to Tom, who had just come down. a It is Horace," answered Tom. " Horrors /" exclaimed the boatswain, " what the devil has he to do with them??Why, it's no wonder why you are melancholy, my lad! But wre have horrors enough to grapple with here, without looking into a book for them, so I wou'd advise you to chuck it overboard, and come upon deck, and look at something else. Here's your messmate, who has been bustling about from morn to night, overhauling every thing he could set his, eye on, and inquiring about every thing he did not understand. That's the way to make a good seaman, and, if I am not hellishly out of my reckoning, he'll make one very soon.? Come, come! you must remain here no longer?the surgeon's mate tells me that devil a thing's the matter with you; so remember, I expect to see you to-morrow-morning on the main deck?there's no shamming Abraham here?every man must do his duty." In the course of the narrative, we are introduced to the family of the Timbertones, in which Mr Macneill has exhibited twro opposite errors; o;ie, that of endeavouring to force a taste for music, where it does not exist, the other, that of checking it where it has been naturally implanted. The following family dialogue will afford a very good specimen of the manner in which this subject has been illustrated. " She (the daughter) loved her book, her pencil, and her needle; but none of these were permitted to interfere with her musical tasks, as her mother,fiveor six timesa-day,bawled ?ut, out, " Sit down to your piano, Arabella ! you have been a great deal too long from it: Sit dow n to your piano, I tell you !" 44 The girl at hist became so hates*ed and worn out with this irksome aud incessant toil, that, no longer able to endure it, she entreated her mother to release her from what was so unpleasant; but to no effect. ?* Would you give up a branch so indispensibly necessary for every young woman who has the least pretensions to genfeelity and fashion?" exclaimed the sagacious mother. *< Do you see one exception among all your intimates or acquaintance ? and would it not be disgraceful to you, as well as to us, were you deficient in what is now considered as the most important and the most elegant part of female education ? ?Impossible!" 44 lt may be important to those who receive pleasure from it, and who are qualified to give pleasure to others," said Arabella; u but that is not tiie case with me. I would not give one farthing for all the music in the world, nor can I expect to arrive at any perfection in it, when I have neither a voice sufficient to reach one octave, nor an far to distinguish treble from common time." 44 That's nothing," rejoined the judicious mother?" alf this will come by practice. Your Master lt 11s me so, and that a good Timeist <an be made without a musical ear; ;md as for your voice, he savs it is not yet nearly formed, but that vears and daily practice will renner it not only sweet but powerful !" r 44 Now what the Master says must be roust use, mother," lejoinedArabella ; 4* for there is Betsy Nightingale, who is much younger than i am, and who can with ease reach nearly three octaves, and has bealle* so nice an car, that before her first month of instruction was ouy, she could distinguish the smallest discord : But Betsy has a natural genius for music, and I have not, mother." 44 Really, my dear,"said Mr. Tiinbertone, (who all this time had been listening to the argument), 441 cannot help thinking that what Arabella says is very just. Neither you nor I, you knowr, have the least taste for music, nor ever had a musical voice or ear in our lives; how then can we expect such qualities in our daughter? And since such gifts are not the portion of all, why should we strive against nature, and render the poor girl miserable for nothing?" 44 Hold your tongue, Mr. Timbertone," said his wife, impatiently** ** you know nothing at all of the matter.?Will any body pretend to say that music is not to be acquired by practice alone, when every parent in Edinburgh gives it to their daughters without the least exception ??And pray, Mr Timberton?, what a pretty figure should we make, if our daughter was deficient in any branch of education, especially in one which is now universally admired, and considered as the very first accomplishment a young lady can possess ? Suppose now, for instance, that we had an evening party ; could we possibly avoid giving them an entertainment, which they all lay their account with?music, both vocal and instrumental ? And should we not look very foolish, and very contemptible, *Mr Timbertone, if instead of our own daughter contributing to this entertainment, we should f)e under the necessity of applying to the daughters of others, and consequently acknowledging to the whole company, that we had neglected to give Arabella what no mechanic's daughter in Edinburgh is ignorant of??Impossible, Mr. Timbcrtohe I We should be the towa tmvn talk?the ridicule of all polite society, and our daughter looked down upon wherever she went!? No, no, allow me to know these things better, if you please. I don't interfere in your business, Mr Timhertone, and I beg yMU may not interfere in any plans of mine for instructing Arabella, who must be educated as other young women of fashion are, without the exception Jf one article. " Very well, my dear," answered Timhertone very placidly,?" I shall hot argue the point with you; but allow me just to observe, that what with musical instruments, musical books, and musical masters at haifa guinea every three lessons, I am already out of pocket above L.250, and Arabella, by her own confession, not one bit the better for it." " You are much mistaken, Mr Timhertone," said his wife briskly;?" infinitely mistaken !

The Last of the Fairies. By G. P. BL James. Esq. With Illus- j trations from designs by John Gilbert. Parry and Co. This is a pretty little book, prettily got up, though its ornamented borders are somewhat heavy for its small page. It i seems designed for a Christmas book, though it comes as late as the winter weather. It is a tale in Mr James* usual manner? made up of love, war, romance, and old costume ? without a particle of fairy land, but not without heartiness as well as grace. It comprises the period from Worcester fight to the restoration, turns upon the Cavalier concealments and sacrifices of that stirring time, and finds its " last of the fairies " in a young royalist maiden, playing hide and seek with her lover in an old castle ruin. It ends happily, as a Christmas book ought to do; and is very nicely illustrated by Mr Gilbert.

Oct 16, 1852  ENGLISH LITERATURE - History and Criticism - 19th Century
Examiner  : 2333 660 - 661
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE LITERARY EXAMINER. IJ The Writings of Thomas de Quincey. In seven volumes. ac - Boston, U.S. Ticknor, Reed, and Fields. Thirty years have elapsed since the Confessions of an English Opium-eater amazed the readers of the London Magazine by their extraordinary union of intense reality and the most magnificent dreaming. Unveiling, or seeming to unveil, hidden chambers of the brain, where scenery more gorgeous than the waking and healthful mind ever conceived was presented in long array, they supplied also, with a vividness worthy of the phantasms, tho actual experiences hy which those visions were suggested. The power of the magic-key of opium itself, which unlocked these hidden resources of the fancy and intellect, as the subterranean gardens were revealed to Aladdin, was subsidiary to the revelation of the capacity of the mind, under solemn stimulus, to people its visions with thoughts and to expand its thoughts to dreams. The author seemed, in his own splendid descriptions, *' to bear a charmed life." An habitual drinker, at the height of his enchanted heing, of eight thousand drops of liquid poison, was a physical wonder whoso experiences could not lack interest; but when the mind of this Slave of the Drug was found to be enriched with the exactest learning and choicest imagery of the antique world, and capable of " large discourse of reason," tho secrets which he told of the delights amidst which he had rested and expatiated, assumed an importance and dignity with which the inward story of an individual life is rarely invested. We became familiar with the awful scenery of his dreams, by a vivid perception of the incidents of his truant boyhood;?his wanderings, his bunger.his strange companionship; his most affecting romance of Oxford street; nay, even of the visit of the turbaned Malay to his cottage among the mountains;?as they have their antitypes in his visions. Whether the direct tendency of this exhibition of a noble intellect ruled by the influence of opium was that of invitation or of warning, we need not now inquire; hut the effect of the disclosure was great; and although the London Magazine was enriched by tho successive Essays of Elia, and the fresh Table Talk of Hazlitt?the finest productions of both those writers?the Opium-eater for the time eclipsed them. This contribution seems to have been thc first appearance of Mr de Quincey as an author. For although he had attained the age of thirty-six; had lived to read, to think, and to talk; and had been a familiar and welcome associate of Coleridge, Wordsworth, Southey, and Lamb ; he had never (unless perhaps in some contributions to tho Friend) given his meditations to tho world. Since then he has, at different times, communicated avowed essays to periodical works ; and the result of those labours now lies before us comprised in seven elegantly-printed volumes, provided hv enterprising Boston publishers for the expanding circles of American readers. The Confessions; with a Continuation of them, describing a relapse into the old slavery and its more fearful penalties; comprise the first volume of the series,?and, it is almost needless to add, the best. The first work of an accomplished student of thirty-six, embracing the most striking passages of his own intellectual history, unfolded at a sudden impulse, but with elaborate skill and careful expression, could not, in its nature, have equal successors in the same department of literature ; and as many of Mr de Quincey's writings are professedly autobiographical?and all have frequent reference to his own being?we state only an irresistible consequence when we describe them as more or less imbued with the spirit of the first outbursting essay. They appear to us, indeed, to he excellent in proiwrtion as they are akin to it?as they partake of its dreary extravagance and fearful questionings ?? of sense and outward things;" and to become vapid and verliosc when they treat of details set" in the light of common " day." For we cannot help thinking that thc influences of opium are to be traced in all Mr de Quincey's writings; blending with the highest operations of his intellect, which they raised and solemnized, and, in their collapse, irritating the emotions of the less noble parts of his nature, and sometimes distorting to itself, and through itself to thc world, tho characters of his associate poets. Let us add that but for the injustice which may result to them, especially to the chief object of Mr de Quincey's intellectual idolatry and personal dislike, Wordsworth?from those erroneous impressions?weshould hehappyto close our notice here, with the expression of our pleasure at the introduction of the works of an author of great ability to the world of American readers. Believing, however, that the pictures reflected from the writer's conceptions are not just, and thinking that the licence he has assumed in unveiling them, even if tbe portraiture were faithful, is beyond tbe privilege of authorship in relation to private life?we feel bound to accompany our admiration of Mr de Quincey's merits with an attempt to show that his impressions of character, and his notions of an author's right to make public exposure of private frailties by way of retaliation for private wrongs, are attributable to the false medium through which his strangely-blended powers and weakness have led him to contemplate his own claims nnd obligations. A large portion of these volumes consists of recollections of tbe intercourse of the author with Coleridge, Wordsworth, .Southey, Lloyd, and Lamb-?often interesting from tbe vividness of detail, but sometimes becoming painfully trivial; and too often indicating an opinion that, to an offended scholar, life has lott all its privacy. Of Mr de Quincey's notion ol tbe right of an author to avenge a private grievance by public exposure of the personal historv of tU^TT^ treatment of Mrs Coleridge on her first introduCtl f^ reader is a striking example. Passionately desiri! *lhe acquaintance of her husband, the author had f ll ^ to Bridgewater; had found him the guest of wealth r him had been received by him with the greatest LiJ^ ds; after being delighted with three hours' ellS?; ?d had been introduced by him " in a frigid mainer "torP -' whose personal appearance Mr do Quincey describe u V?*' alludes to the well-known infelicity of the marriL* ? had united the poet to an exemplary ladv whnJ; ? ch later life he did not cultivate. The author woceTdTt''? full justice to this lady's character and maternal conduct' and, so far, all is well; but he cannot avoid communicant ' tho public a very private grief of his own, or intimating he might have redressed it, as thus. * Meantime I, for my part, owe Mrs Coleridge no particuk, ?? hty ;and I see no reason why I should mystify the aWnalrf f?!1" ridge's Life or Habits by dissembling what ia LtorioTto f C?le* thousands of people. An insult once offered by Mrs Coler'd J female relative of my own, as much superior to Mrs Colerid^r o* spirit of courtesy and kindness which ought to preside in th ? course between females as she was in the splendour of hei IT?' would have given me a dispensation from all terms of considers? beyond the restraints of strict justice. My offence was the hs'?n procrastinated in some trifling affair of returning a Tolum g a MS.; and, during my absence at a distance of four or fireTh ?f dred miles, Mrs Coleridge thought fit to write a letter, filled with tr?" most intemperate expressions of anger, addressed to me, whom sha did not know by sight, and who could, in no way, be answerable forms delinquencies. " This antiquated gossip would probably have drawn a smile from the lady to whose unfortunate position it relates, if she had read it in her lonely lifetime; but it supplies a curious instance of the effect of long solitude, excited by opium, on a thoughtful and elegant mind, in investing trifles which touched itself with importance, and in disturbing the medium through which the actors in such trifles are surveyed. To these causes we attribute the disproportion with which matters personally affecting the writer are regarded in his retrospections, aud the distortion which has sometimes marred his portraits of others. The delineation of Wordsworth's personal character, to which the autobiographical portion of these volumes is largely devoted, exhibits, we believe?judging only on the evidence the books themselves supply?the most striking results of those influences ; and it is for the purpose of suggesting to the reader, to whom the personal character of that great poet may be interesting, the propriety of considering the various passages in which it is depicted in these volumes in connexion with the avowed resentments of the writer, before he adopts it as just, that we now advert to the subject. The caution is the more necessary because the suggestions of unamiablc peculiarities which abound are accompanied by uniform homage to the poet's genius, of which Mr ile Quincey was one of the earliest admirers, and bas always been one of the most eloquent defenders. In early life, he sought out the poet who was the chief object of his ingenuous admiration ; was welcomed hy him with cordial respect; and was invited to share such hospitality as the noble poverty of the cottage beside Grasmere could yield. He afterwards resided for many years in Wordsworth's immediate neighbourhood, and became acquainted with the most minute details of his history, and the inmost arrangements of his household. Those details and arrangements he developes perhaps with only a free use of the licence which modern autobiography assumes : but when he descends to chronicle the accidents of social demeanour ; to take the most evanescent traits of wayward humour, and give them a fixity which make3 them false; and to interpret thc feelings which lie suppressed by the courtesies of social life, according to his impressions of long-past scenes ;?we think he unconsciously but greatly exceeds even that license, and sets a dangerous example to coarser minds. Thus, adverting to his first introduction to the companionship of Wordsworth aoa Southey, he says: I could rtad at once in the manner of the two authors that they were not on particularly friendly, or rather, I should say, *?~ tial terms. It seemed to me as if both had silently said- J'? too much men of sense to quarrel because we do not Part'^ *"'j1 jn each other's writings; we are neighbours, or what passes foi n the country. Let us show each other the courtesies w"?"ce becoming to men of letters, and, for any closer connexion, ottjT"T^ of thirteen miles may always be sufficient to keep us from '** after life, it is true-fifteen years, perhaps, from ^}u*T^Z^n circumstances combined to bring Southey and Word;,wortl1 w ^ intimate terms of friendship; agreement in politics, ^7?.^,, happened to both in their domestic relations, and the sort 01 w ^ for different opinions in literature, or, indeed, in anytlJW"?* But, advancing years and experience are sure to bring wita w * .^ at this period, Southey and Wordsworth entertain* a """T ^ but did not cordially like each other. Indeed, it wouw ?" strange if they had. A And, thereupon, Mr de Quincey proceeds to 6** "^ reason for this want of cordiality that Southey "?J^J,. " cularly elegant habits in the usc of books, wmw ^ worth, on the other hand, " was so neghgent/V^, " indulgent in the same use, that, as ^the*V"^i*? " expressed it to me some years afterwards, J**"**^ " staying at Greta Hall on a visit, ?To wtrodoce w^ ^ "?worth into one's library is like letting V_Y\L?*ds " * tulip garden.'" And then the ?to*W*t**^ rf bis to illustrate this peculiarity of his friend by a wrong ^^ own; and tells us how ?? on a level with the%**?Z ^ ?? at the tea-table in his little cottage at ^n^Tlk]smm "the colloctiTe works of Edmund Burke, r^'?asam lettered ?? Burke's Works, "the collection bao^beew^ for twenty years (with a digression as to o>W^2aLsii --and how Wordsworth took down tho i?g*JgShtl cut open its leaves with a knils ooilod wi* mm* wp? Kpen eaten with dry toast. Instead of calling for a clean knife, Wordsworth positively ?? tore his way into tho heart of the ., vuiume with this knife, that left its greasy honours upon every -? nage." It is right to add that the injured owner of the fated clunie disclaims any concern for the value of his property, as he says, " whatever might he made good hy money at ,. jj^ time I did not regard," and explains, ?* I mention -? the case at all only to illustrate the excess of Wordsworth's ?> outraces on hooks; " aud, recurring afterwards to the same subject, admits that " Wordsworth's habits of using -? hooks were not vulgar, not the habits of those who turn ?? over the page with a wet finger," an abomination which we are informed was perpetrated at Cambridge " by a tutor and -? fellow of a College,*' who it is consoling to know " was <? bred up a ploughman and the son of a ploughman." These tales of the library are chiefly notable as instances of the importance which long-past trifles may assume to " the ?? philosophic mind" of an Opium-eater; hut the record, which we have also just quoted, of an impression of the hollowness of the regards of two professed friends, detected amidst courtesies by which they desired it to be hidden, and published in the lifetime of at least one of them, though referable to the same cause, and capable of tho same excuse, belongs to a bitter class of social treason, lt is enough that, in our day, the sportive conversations of the table should be reported, and the personal habits of the studvaud the drawing-room " set in a note-book, leaned ?? and coun'd by rote ;" but if those innocent disguises, by which indifference or partial liking are hidden, which kindness itself spreads over the imperfections of temper, and which nurture the cordiality they assume, may be torn away by auy guest admitted to such implied confidence as authorship has permitted society to retain, all men whose celebrity may render their intimacies the subject of public criticism must take heed whom they admit to share them. Mr de Quincey does not leave us to guess at the causes which induced him to regard Mr Wordsworth's domestic character with a hostile eye. Perhaps much is implied in the passage in which he complains??* Professor Wilson "and myself were never honoured with one line, one allu ??sion from his pen; but many a person of particular ??feebleness has received that honour"?a complaint indicative of the morbid sense with which Mr de Quincey regards his own concerns as necessarily matters of general interest; fur, although his fine scholarship and remarkable powers of conversation had obtained for him the admiration of the small circle in which he lived, they were, during the period to which this complaint refers, unsuspected by the world. Rut in the illusions which have beset his middle life, even his domestic quarrels are momentous; and therefore he has devoted some ten pages to expound the various causes of personal estrangement from one who remained an intellectual idol, though an idol of mixed metal. They consist first of an exposition of the alleged arrogance of Wordsworth, not generally exhibited, but allied to particular themes; a failing at least that we should scarcely have thought" a fee grief due to a single breast." But afterwards descending to nearer griefs, the autobiographer acquaints us with the fact that he " had for the comptroller of ?' his domestic menage a foolish, selfish, and ignorant old '?maid," one too, who had, "once lived with the Wordsnorths," and who ?? for his service had been engaged at "high wages by Miss Wordsworth herself;*'?that this servant made false statements about her master to the Wordsworths, which he would not descend to contradict;?and "the result was," says Mr de Quincey? That erer after I hated the name of the woman at whose hands I had sustained the wrong, so far as such a woman could be thought worthy of hatred; and tbat I began to despise a little some of those who had been silly and undeceiving enough to accredit such representations ; and one of them especially, who, though liberally endowed with sunshiny temper and sweetness of disposition, was perhaps <" person weak intellectually, beyond the ordinary standard of female *eahness. Hence began the waning of my friendship with the Wordsworths. But, in reality, never after the first year or so from my first introduction, had I felt much possibility of drawing the bonds of friendship tight with a man of Wordsworth's nature. He seemed to ne too much like his own Pedler, in the * Excursion,' a man so diffused amongst innumerable objects of equal attraction, that he had bo cells left in hts heart for strong individual attachment. I was B?t singular in this feeling: Professor Wilson had become estranged ?nm him ; no one could be deemed fervently his friend. Whether the illustration of Wordsworth's temperament, drawn from Wordsworth's genius, is graciously exhibited by one *bose admiration formed bis first claim to the poet's acquaint ?ace. we need not determine; this has at least a semblance tf philosophic thought, sufficient to excuse an observer not toad by ties of apparent friendship;?but what shall be said of the sequel ? Mr de Quincey proceeds to develope " the strong reason" which he alleges Coleridge had to be pranged, by accusing Wordsworth of having "drawn 'such a picture of Coleridge and his general efficiency if. ^Sjrt not to have proceeded from the hands of a 'friend"?and this to a lady and gentleman who purposed *JW.e Coleridge with them on a visit to London, in the Jope to wean him from opium. He gives this alleged cou?MkL?f Wordsworth as the cause of a rupture u which rather .??** it8eI* b7 kP96 of t*me? and tne DurniP? aim of t ??rce recollections, than by any formal reconciliation or Pw-on exchanged between tbe parties ;M so that, if there rf ?wb a rupture, it waa healed m?ny years before Coleh? r^?--wnatevcr Wordsworth had said or done, had ?Jg been forgiven by Ute only sufferer. We ask. then, rr?* ?* ?wociate of these poets, wno, in aid of his own 2*?*1*, calla wwh a scandal from the depth of yean ***** oblivion of forgiveness, does not regard bis relation **P*rtywhom he aocoNt, throagh a medium so dis- turhed hy the accidents of his being, as to reuder him incompetent as a judge, and questionable as a witness ? We have occupied so largo a space in tho ungracious duty of urging the readers of these volumes to apply the passages which disclose its author's resentments to the appreciation of those in which he delineates his associates, that we have left ourselves little spate to estimate tho excellences with which they abound. All the details of the author's'early life, studies, and boyish successes, are admirably told in them? overlaid sometimes by illustration, and encrusted with perpetual episodes?but even in their exuberance redeemed by a singularly pure and impressive style. One of his extravagances ?" A Vision of Sudden Death," may vie with the Confessions, out of which, indeed, it seems to " arise like an exhalation." lt is a fantastic and terrible voluntary played hy a magician's hand on the most awful chords of existence, lieminiscenees there aro of Lamb, of Lloyd, and others, in which (although thero are some palpable inaccuracies, as the multiplying the female victim of the literary murderer Wainwright into two sisters, and dividing the insurances between them, whereas poor Helen Abercrombie alone bore the insured lifo and alone paid the forfeit) no personal grievance has affected the truth of pictures, striking in form and colour, and set in a frame-work of golden reflection, which may be perused by those who knew the originals with entire sympathy, and by strangers with curiosity well satislied. Our exceptions have been taken in sorrow, not in anger, for the sake of justice to the dead and example to the living. In spito of the errors wo have deplored, wo believe the claim which Mr de Quincey, makes to an original dignity of intellect to be just; we believe implicitly in the claims to early and ripe scholarship which he prefers ; we admire tho richness of his fancy, the acuteness of his reasoning, and the occasional elevation of style so becoming to stately thought;?and when we reflect how nearly akin the weaknesses to which we impute his errors of vision and judgment, are to the solemn strengths exhibited in his inward revelations, we are reminded that others, liko him, "aro of such stuff as dreams are made of," and may need, in their degree, the allowance they should give to one more gifted, but more visionary than themselves, until ?' our little life is rounded by a sleep."

Autobiography of an Indian Officer. OUR LIBRARY TABLE. By Major H. M. Conran. (Morgan & Chase.) The author of the book before us has committed an unpardonable offence against society by writing when he had nothing to communicate which would be either profitable or interesting. Even that narrow sect which delights in so-called religious experiences will be disappointed, for the author's religious experiences are limited to an account of the action and reaction on each other of a morbid mind and a diseased body. All through the book are scattered evidences of the truth of that which we state, as well as of extreme uncharitableness, the pride which apes humility, and of military incompetence. There is scarcely in the whole chronicle of twenty years' service in India during very stirring times, a single incident interesting to the general reader. The following extract shows the morbid state of the author's mind: "Thisart(water-colourpainting), after rising to its zenith at College, where I carried off the highest prizes in each successive term,wasat the period of my religious convictions, for ever abandoned, partly through the idolatrous influence all studies had acquired over me, in dragging my soul towards earthly things, and partly from the effect of climate and sickness in debilitating my faculties." Again : "Inordinate affection to some earthly object has from my earliest youth been a besetting sin with me." Once more, speaking of the death of a pet otter, Major Conran thus confesses his iniquity : " it taught me a lesson no more to waste my best affections on beasts that perish." As to the diseased body, we have numerous instances scattered through the work, and we draw attention to the fact, because his ill health seems to have been by his own confession mainly caused by excessive addiction to some deleterious quack medicine. He talks about companionship with "lively Christians," and relates how he used to hold interviews with natives, and with non-commissioned officers and men on religious subjects ; but we find that he voluntarily deprived himself of opportunities for influencing young officers for good, by not attending mess. Want of charity is repeatedly shown. The following passage gives us an instance: " I had on two occasions, slight collisions with my commanding officer ; once when I declined giving the use of the government tents for the celebration of Roman Catholic worship." His incompetence as commaifding officer of a battery when inspected by the General, he himself confesses in a most naive manner. We have on our table Results of the Magnetic Survey oftfie Colony of Victoria executed during (he Years 1858-18G4, by G. Neumayer, Ph. D.

86   8444697   Oliver Cromwell: an Historical Romance.

Examiner  : 1703 595 - 596
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE LITERARY EXAMINER. Oliver Cromwell: aa Historical Romance. Edited by Horace Smith. 3 vols. Colburn. Mr Smith's share in this romance is limited to twelve pages of prefatory matter, in which he touches on the vexed question of the character of Cromwell. We have no intention to follow him into it, for the philosophy that would give the creation of such a character to circumstance alone, is of so slippery a kind that we could not hope to keep our footing in the discussion. Let us merely remark that such a mode of judging Cromwell by no means consists with the largeness of intellect that is in the same breath claimed for him. It reduces him to the mere armed partisan and violent self-seeker. It changes the lofty dreams and aspirations that alternately check and impel his course, as we view it in the larger arena, into the mere conscious management of a selfish religious creed, with which he at one time quiets his nerves, at another encourages his passions, and at all conveniently subserves to the mere wild and wayward humours of his army* And it is at least perhaps well to reflect, in any case, without going into the truth or error of these differences, that great as men of Cromwell's kind are, they are never among the greatest. All argu* ment and discussion respecting them ultimately tend to this. The will goes before the intellect in them, and commits it. Their orb is never finally complete and triumphant. It takes justice and a delicacy to be that,?beauty added to strength,?the smoothness of an equilibrium. We have only another remark to make on this portion of the book before us, and it relates to a matter more easily determinable. Mr Smith is in error when he states it as an undisputed fact that in the most excitable period of his life, and when the parliamentary opposition was in its strongest force, Cromwell proposed to withdraw from the approaching conflict by emigration to America. Ile alludes, we suppose, to the current story of the histories, that, on the eve of the first parliament of 1G40, an order from the King in Council arrested the departure of eight ships bound for New England and filled with puritan families, among whom were Hazelrig, Hampden, Pym, and Cromwell. No authority ever existed for this story beyond the circumstance of certain vessels having been certainly stopped in the Thames at about that time by such an order. Yet the authority of fact should be clear and indisputable, to avail against such deficiency as the anecdote exhibits of all the moral evidences o. truth. The mind cannot bring itself to imagine such spirits as these yielding with pitiful easiness to despair of country. Nor is it possible to imagine a less plausible date than that fixed on for the incident. Hampden had recently fought the case o? ship-money, his name was in all mouths, and everything proclaimed that the harvest of what had been sown in the suffering of many years, was now at last on the eve of being reaped in triumph. If distinct proof against the story were wanting, it would nevertheless, to thinking men acquainted with the temper of the time, be more than doubtful. But we can show with little trouble that the hostile evidence greatly outweighs the favourable. In the same part of Rush worth's Collections where the original order is to be found, a subsequent proclamation, which the historians forget to notice, completes the anecdote. In thia the following passage occurs. " Howbeit upon the humble petition of the merchants, passengers, and owners of the ships now bound for New England, and upon the reasons by them represented to the board, his Majesty was graciously pleased to free them from their late restraint, to proceed in their intended voyage." So that, in fact, there is prettyclear evidence that all who had embarked for New England on board the eight ships in question, pro* ceeded to New England. There is as little doubt that they did, as that Hampden, Pym, and Cromwell did not. These men knew their duty better, and had staked too much upon the then approaching issue to doubt or to despair. Deep indeed had been their responsibility for all the blood that was shed in tho after conflict, if it could be shown, as in thia much reported but worthless anecdote, that the great itv* terests in dispute had been by them at any time accounted of suth light and trivial import.

The first if a picture of Cromwell, at introduced upon the scene: * As as spoka, they drew ap their hots** before tba dear of tbs last**) wayside aosteJry.a low aad whitewashed teneaasat isihosnairil ia deep woodlaads, aad Bustling aa it wars laud tbs verdant foliage of jessamine aad woodcuts: while warmed already of their essuag by the clatter of hoot* sad tao soaad of voices, the puritanic perena of sain* host, bear, tag oa high a hage aaa sssoky flambeau, stalked forth to asset thom. Oa his lesa aad starveling iona Ardeaae cast bat a passing glance, being employed ia scratmixing, by the illumination which streamed fall upon them, the features of his singular companion, who bad paused for a moment to allow Cia horse to drink, and to bola a whispered conversation with the landlord. There was, however, nothing familiar to him, though he probed his memory to its lowest depth of youthful recollection*, ia that manly yet ungraceful figure, or ia those lineament* harsh and ill-favoured to the verge ot downright ugliness. Ill-favoured was that countenance, indeed, with its deeply-furrowed line* and its sanguineous colouring; its f uoken eyes, twinkling below the penthouse of the heavy matted brows; sad its nose prominent, rubicund, *ad swollen. Yet was there a world of thought ia the expansive temples, and the massive forehead, ana an exSressioo of firmness that might restrain an empire, in the ownward curve of the bold mouth, and a general air of high authority and indomitable resolution, pervading the whole aspect of the maa. The head of this remarkable-looking individual, at a period when the greatest attention was lavished on the hair by all of gentle birth, was covered with coarse locks, already streaked with gray, falling in long disordered masses on either cheek, and down the muscular short neck, from underneath a rusty beaver, steeple-crowned, and unadorned by feather, loop, or tassel. Inatead of the cravat of Flanders lace, he wore a narrow band of soiled and rumpled linen; and his sword, a heavy iron-hilted tuck, waa not suspended from a scarf or shoulder-knot, but girt about his middle, over a doublet of black serge, by a belt of calfskin leather, corresponding to the material of his riding-boots, which were pulled up above the knee to meet the loose trunk hose, fashioned, as it would be supposed, by some ill country tailor, from the same unseemly stuff with his cloak and doublet. The only part of his appointment*-, which would not have dirgracea the commonest gentleman, waa his horse, a tall gray gelding, of great power and not a little breeding; yet even he was badly accoutred with mean and sordid housings." The second is a peep into a little nook of English scenery: u It waa an angle in one of those broad green lanes, which form so beautiful a feature in the rural scenery of England. Carpeted with deep unfaded verdure, through which meandered a faint wheel-track; bordered by hedges, so thick and tangled as to resemble natural coppices rather than artificial fences; embowered by the fragrant honeysuckle, and spangled with the dewy flowers of the yet sweeter eglantine; decked with the golden blossoms of the broom, the fringelike fern, nnd the haunting bells of the white and crimson foigloves; canopied by the dense umbrage of the broad-leaved sycamore, the gnarled and ivymauUed oak, or the lighter and more graceful ash; and watered by a tiny brooklet, that stole along, now on one side, now on the other, of the rarely-trodden path, here tinkling over its many-coloured pebbles with a mirthful music, there silently reflecting the tufted rushes, and the mossy log that spanned ita surface with a s vi van bridgethat solitary nook might well have furnished forth a tiringroom for Shakspeare* wild Titania.'* The writer's political tone is just and generous in the main, but when he talks of Henrietta Maria he says ill-natured and unmerited things, and when in the last few pages of his book he gets into the scrape of the protectorate, he commits all the mistakes that are natural to a young and overheated admiration. We take one passage in illustration of this remark, and a Yery remarkable illustration it affords. It is an extract from what purports to be a letter written by Milton, descriptive of Cromwell's dissolution of the Long Parliament and of his vault into the seat of supreme power. " Needful it was for England's weal, for her salvation I might say, that the self-seeking carnal-minded junto, who arrogated to themselves the rights and titles of n parliament, nnd who, having once liberated, were now striving to enslave their country, should be cast forth from the highplaces of their usurpation. And by whom could they be cast forth save by the excellent nnd most wise person whom I am grieved to sea that you do atilt mistrust ? Deeply, ?wet deeply, waa he moved?nnd fervently, with tears and prayers continually and supplications earnest nnd importunate, did he beseech the Ruler of nil mortal councils tbnt thia cup should pass from hiss?but it might not ha granted. Had Cromwell benn ambitious, would ht nt once have yielded up tnt power which ht for a short time assumed, to a new-chosen parliament assembled nt tnt earliest ??Truly, had he ao willed, he might hare than batu king?but no f he laboured for his country's weal, and ht has won it! And again, if ht ht now Protector of the land, wielding tat aword of execution, nnd weighing with thu balances of justice?I pray you, how vms ht so eminently raised above bia fellows F Did ht so elevate himself, carving his way through patriot opposition to that thorny stat of power ??Doth ht tit now upon unruly and MwUbaa; necks of subjugated nnd rebellious citisena r Ob! no.

Wkm Om**** oiortlwsai Um Go* ti* Oonsswnwoaitn, fa waa 'not *<w ?*^sw**kwww1n n summit of power. We cannot refer to tbe strange combination of 'circumstances that enabled hun to do this; suffice it that it was so. The Dutch were virtually subdued ; tbe Portuguese and Danes had submitted; and with all the other powers of Europe the leaders of the Commonwealth were at peace. They were in sole possession of the Spanish trade; their power at sea was giving law to the world ; they had given safety to each man's home and were gradually diminishing each man's burthens ; property and liberty were safer than it had been since the Saxon period; commerce was reviving throughout the land ; and on the day of their dissolution there was more money in the public treasury, and more certain returns in the public revenue, than had been known since the early days of Elizabeth. Finally, they had then resolved to submit their stewardship to the judgment of the nation; to test, by new institutions, the capacity of the people for republican government; and to stand or fall by the result. Deprived of the nobler means of establishing their great case, they appeal to the result of the government of Cromwell. By that, in our opinion, they stand immortally. Again, it is not true that the dissolution by Cromwell was a matter of sudden and irresistible inspiration. It was a matter of elaborate arrangement, and of very various and exquisite machinery. If it was a passionate impromptu it is the longest on record, for it lasted upwards of four and twenty months. No doubt he shed a great many tears about it during the whole of that time. His fluxional faculty of tears was always amazing, but we must be excused for thinking that the only sincerityproved by tears is that of some actual impression on the nerves of the weeper; whether to any right purpose, or to the purpose pretended, is another question. Some of the most fluent tear-shedders we have known, have been insincere and selfish. The poet Cowley said a bitter truth of Cromwell when he remarked that he loved to say and do senseless and fantastical things, only to show his power of doing or saying anything ; and rejoiced in the extravagance of his ways as the fullest demonstration of his uncontrollable sovereignty. The contempt of decency he showed so often was no more than the lowest form of this love of power. His very tears, we suspect, were self-worship. He took pity on himself for not being all, or being able to do all, which his egotism craved to be or to do. Further, it is not true that Cromwell yielded up the power he seized by this dissolution to a new chosen parliament; it is not true that had he willed he might have been king ; it is not true, but the very extremity of falsehood, that it was by resignation of a " free-elected parliament'* he seated himself in the chair of the Protectorate. This new chosen, free-elected, parliament, was r.o parliament at all. It was a convention, summoned on principles unheard of in all time before. No elections took place. The qualification of the members was sanctity of principles and holiness of life; their nomination proceeded, heaven directed, from Cromwell and his military council; and the summons to each man bore the name of Oliver Cromwell solely. Nor, even thus chosen, was their resignation voluntary. It was as much compulsory as that of their predecessors. As the existence of this convention sprang out of cheat and delusion?though its career was lifted into respect by the unlooked-for gravity of its counsels and the wise determination of its measures?so its abrupt and iniquitous end was nothing more than the natural consummation of its origin. It is an unpardonable ignorance of history to say that Cromwell might have been king. Twice, with an eager impotence most sad in such a man, he stretched forth his hand to snatch the glittering bauble, and twice it was dashed from him by his republican officers. His downfal dates from this. Here, for the first time in his life, he failed, and the sole charm which seemed to have supported him through life perished in that word. To declare monarchy the best form of government, and to be tdd hat you shall not be monarch, was in his case to feel that he held the chair of another. Finally, it becomes us to protest against such language as this we have noticed, being placed in thajmouth of Milton. It is a desecration of the fame of that great poet and wise politician. It it true that before Cromwell had shown the uses for which he sought the supreme power, Milton had addressed him with all the grand anticipation of grand deeds. * To govern," he said, ?? three mighty states by thy counsel; to recal the people from their corrupt institutions to a purer and nobler discipline ; to extend thy thoughts and send out thy mind to our remotest shores; to foresee all, and to provide for all; to shrink from no labour; to trample umlervbot and Uar to rjie<es all the snsM of pitasore, and all the entangling seducoaents of wealth and power J~w*se we mattera so arduous, that in covsyawlsimoT^thep^ ofchfldren.

Beau Brocade: a Romance of the Road. By Baroness Orczy. (Greening, 6s.) " Beau Brocade, a Romance of the Road," is the descrip^ tive, if condensed, title of the three hundred pages of very conventional sentimentality which form Baroness Orczy's novel.. " Beau Brocade " is all that a highwayman with such a name should be : handsome, chivalrous, brave, faultlessly attired, in spite of the fact that his nights are frequently spent in a ditch ; the rescuer of distressed damsels and the plague of choleric county magistrates. The "Romance of the Road" is very much the same as any other Dick Turpin tale. The gallant outlaw first frightens the lady, then dances with her on a lonely heath to the pastoral strains of a shepherd's pipe ; he saves her brother, a Jacobite fugitive, from the King's men ; is wounded in her service and staggers to her feet, a pale but fascinating wreck ; is pardoned by a gracious Royal Duke, and is last seen holding the lady " closely, very closely to his strong, brave heart," murmuring " My dream ! My wife ! "?a very satisfactory if commonplace finale.

The Athenaeum  : 1544 689 - 690
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bareheskr Towns. By Anthony Trollope, 3 vols. (Longman & Co.) En.er.lno tlie episcopal palace of Barchester we find, at once, that ' The Warden' was an uncompleted story. Mr. Harding is again upon the stage, with Eleanor, Tom Towers, and the Jupiter. There is, however, a new bishop of the diocese, Dr. Proudie, successor of Dr. Grantly, with Mrs. Proudie, of evangelical ambition, supplemented by a loose-jointed Lowchurch chaplain, Obadiah Slope. But we again make acquaintance with the loud, clear-voiced, overbearing Archdeacon, the tyrant of his father and father-in-law, who has a theory about oblong dining-tables, and sets down any obnoxious brother asa" beast." Thus, Mr. Trollope baa not to contend against the difficulty of interesting us, at the outset, in his personages or in his narrative; wc are by no means strangers in Barchester; but he has, perhaps, to meet a worse difficulty,?that of prolonging successfully the interest of a tale which seemed some time ago to have been brought to a natural conclusion. Yet we doubt whether * Barchester Towers' is not a more satisfactory book than ' The Warden': it is certainly more dramatic in its construction; the characters are more varied; an infusion of romance gives lightness and brightness to the ecclesiastical picture. It may still be said, indeed, that Mr. Trollope has a happier art of drawing sketches from life, and striking off pungent sayings hot and vivid upon the page, than of elaborating the action of a novel: nevertheless, the incidents that lead up to the marriage of Eleanor, if to some extent conventional, are yet contrived witli skill, and will engage the sympathies of other readers than those who appre- date the excitement kindled in a cloistered city whenever a bishopric or deanery is vacant. Parallel with the many wooings and one love of the youthful widow moves the tearful tragedy of" Obadiah Slope,?tragic in all but its consummation, for tho oily Obadiah?beaten, thwarted, slapped in the face, confuted, confounded, detected in the act of kissing a married lady's white hands, discarded by his querulous patroness, and driven with shame from the Eden of virtnal episcopacy?is comforted at last, contracts an offensive and defensive alliance, till death them do part, with the opulent relic of a sugar-refiner, (including a house in Baker Street,) mounts a metropolitan pulpit, and ripens in the golden warmth of patronage until the soul of sweetness, enriched within him, suffuses his plump rotundity, and he ages, and mellows, and excites the envy of the irreligious and the poor. This reverend Slope is the Low Church personified, and it is Mr. Trollope's pleasure to mock his ral hair, large hands, weazel eye, and sardonic intonations. Perhaps some of this sarcastic finish is unfairly applied; but we are to take ' Barchester Towers' for what it is?a satire on men and opinions in a certain corner of the eecles-ia; and if Mr. Trollope makes Low Church ridiculous he does not make High Church sublime. To say the truth, the entire establishment, as here represented, is but a worldly well-spread table, with a hundred covers for baked meats, purple and amber juices glittering in globes of crystal, and all the spiced dainties of Samarcand and Lebanon, to tempt the taste of the shoeless and the scripless. No stirpliee'1 party in England can complain that tho novelist insults it by flattery. To go a little further, human nature itself has not much excuse for being aggrieved on that score,?unless it be the unpolluted babe-like nature of the ex-Warden, who is satisfied that he should not holli his wardenship, and that he should not accept a deanery,?or the warm, honest, crystal-transparent nature of Eleanor Bold, who has to rebut the courtesies of Obadiah Slope with a tingling blow from her ivory-wristed hand,?to reject the explanations of Bertie Stanhope with sweet tears from her eyes, and who ultimately takes up a definite position in her mortal state as Mrs. Arabin, wife of a blameless doctor and a dean. Bertie Stanhope is a caricature. The mundane-minded Dr. Stanhope stands dimly in the background ; but the Signora herself, with her loveliness and her wiles, her fascinating insolence, and ready points of repartee, is brought out with singular force and fancy. With respect to the other characters, Signora Neroni, last but one of the Neros, (in reality, however, only a Stanhope,) is the most conspicuous siren among the sinful. She has a beautiful face, and a perfect bust, but has been crippled by the violence of an Italian castaway, her husband. Infidel philosophy and sensuous vanity occupy her remaining days; and with almost harrowing humour Mr. Trollope describes the victory of her sensuous charms over the conscience, the worldly scruples, the heart encased in carrot-coloured flesh, of Chaplain Slope. As an example of Mr. Trollope s boldest method ot writing, we will connect two passages relating to the passionate interview between Mr. Slope and Signora Neroni:? *" Mr. Slope, as was his custom, asked for Mr. Stanhope, and was told, as was the servant's custom, that the signora was in the drawing-room. Upstairs heaccordingly went. He foundher, as he always did, lying on her sofa with a French volume before her, and a beautiful inlaid writing case open on her table. At the moment of his entrance she was in the act of writing. 'Ah, my friend,' said she, putting ont her left hand to him across her desk, ' I dkt not expect you to-day, and was this very instant writing to you-.' Mr. Slo*)e, taking the soft, fair delicate hand in his, and very soft and fair and delicate it waa, bowed over it his huge red head and kissed it. It was a sight to see, a deed to record if the author coidd fitly do it, a picture to put on canvas. Mr. Slojie was big, awkward, cumbrous, and having his heart in his pursuit, was iH at ease. The lady was fair, as we have said, and delicate; every thing about her was fine and refined; her hand in his looked like a rose lying among carrots, and when he kissed it he looked as a cow might do on finding such a flower among her food. She was graceful as a couchant goddess, and, moreover, as self-possessed as Venus must have been when courting Adonis. Oh, that such grace and such beauty should have condescended to waste itself on such a pursuit!?'I was in the act of writing to you," said she, 'but now my scrawl may go into the basket;'and she raised the sheet of gilded notepaper from off her desk as though to tear it.? ' Indeed it shall not,' said he, laying the embargo of half a stone weight of human flesh and blood upon the devoted paper. ' Nothing that you write for my eyes, signora, shall be so desecrated,' and he took up the letter, put that also among the carrots and fed on it, and then proceeded to read it.? 'C-racious me! Mr. Slope,'said she, 'I hope you don't mean to say you keep all the trash I write to you. Half my tune I don't know what I write, and when I do, I know it is only fit for the l>ack of the fire. I hope you have not that ugly trick of keeping letters.'?' At any rate, J don't throw them into a wastepajH-r basket. If destruction is their doomed lot, they perish worthily, and are burnt on a pyre, as Dido was of oki.'?' With a steel pen stuck through them, of course,' said she, ' to make the simile more complete. Of all the ladies of my acquaintance I think Lady Dido was the most absurd. Why did she not do as Cleopatra did? Why ditl she not take out her ships and insist on going with him'. She could not bear to lose tlie land she hail got by a swindle; and then she could not bear the loss of her lover. So shu fell between two stools. Mr. Slope, whatever you do, never mingle love and business.'?Mr. Slope blushed up to the eyes, and over his mottled forehead to tho very roots of his hair. * * A nd so she continued to insult him, and he continued to bear it.?'Sacrifice the world for love! * said she, in answer to some renewed vapid declaration of his passion, ' how often has the same thing been said, and how invariably with the same falsehood!'?'Falsehood,' said he, ' Do you say that I am false to you '. do you say that my love is not real V?' False ! of course it is false, false as tlie father of falsehood?if indeed falsehoods need a sire and are not self-begotten since the world began. You are ready to sacrifice the world for love'. Come, let us see what you will sacrifice. I care nothing for nuptial vows. Tlie wretch, I think you were kind enough to call him so, whom I swore to love and obey, is so base that he can only be thought of with repulsive disgust. In the council chamber of my heart I have divorced him. To me that is as good as though aged lords had gloated for months over the details of his licentious hie. I care nothing for what the world can say. Will you be as frank ? Will you take me to your home as your wife '. Will you call me Mrs. Slope before bishop, dean, and prebendaries!' The poor tortured wretch stood silent, not knowing what to say. ' What, you won't do that. Tell me, then, what part of the world is it that you will sacrifice for my charms?'?'Were you free to marry, I would take you to my house to-morrow, and wish no higher privilege.' ?' I am free;' said she, almost starting up in her energy. For though there was no truth in her pretended regard for her clerical admirer, there was a mixture of real feeling in the scorn and satire with which she spoke of love and marriage generally. 'lam free; free as the winds. Come; will you take me as I am? Have your wish; sacrifice the world, and prove yourself a true man.'?Mr. Slojie should have taken her at her word. She would have drawn hack, and he would have hod the full advantage of the offer. But he did not. Instead of doing so, he stood wrapt in astonishment, passing his fingers through his lank red hair, and thinking as he stared upon her animated countenance that her wondrous beauty grew more wonderful as he gazed onjjt.? 'Ha ! ha! ha;' she laughed out loud. 'Come, Mr. Slope; don't talk of sacrificing the world again. People beyond one-and-twenty should never dream of such a thing. You and I, if we have the dregs of any love left in us, if we have the remnants of a passion remaining in our hearts, should husband our resources better. We are not in our premilre jeunesse. The world is a very nice place. Your world, at any rate, is so. You have all manner of fat rectories to get, and possible bishoprics to enjoy. Come, confess; on second thoughts you would not sacrifice such things for the smiles of a lame lady?'?It was impossible for him to answer this. In order to be in any way dignified, he felt that he must be silent.?'Come, said she,?'don't boody with me: don't be angry because I speak out some home truths. Alas, the world, as I have found it, has taught me bitter truths. Come, tell me that I am forgiven. Are we not to be friends?" and she again put out her hand to him.?He sat himself down in the chair beside her, and took her proffered hand and leant over her.?'There,' said she, with her sweetest softest smile?a smile to withstand which a man should be cased in triple steel, 'there; seal your forgiveness on it,' anil she raised it towards his face. He kissed it again and again, and stretched over her as though desirous of extending the charity of his pardon beyond the hand that was offered to him. She managed, however, to check his ardour. For one so easily allured as this poor chaplain, her hand was surely enough." By far the larger proportions of ' Barchester Towers' is ecclesiastical in its interest; but we have quoted that which will show that Mr. Trollope is not occupied only with the dialogues and dealings of Church men or Church matters. It should be added that Tom Towers, oracle of the Jttpikr, is an ally of Obadiah Slope, and thunders in his behalf in vain.

La Belle Nivernaise, and other Stories. By A. Daudet Translated by K. Koutledge. (Routledge & Sons.) ? M. Alphonse Daudet is, except in 'Tartarin,' never more charming than in his children's stories. There are said to be heretics who maintain that with the same exception he is never anything like so charming. Therefore it was well that Mr. Routledge should translate and that the firm of Routledge should publish ' La Belle Nivernaise' and its companions, with M. Montegut's abundant and appropriate illustrations to season the dish. The translation is very fairly done, though some of the old stumblingblocks occur. " This maimed one "?not in Carlylese sense, but simply for " thia cripple"? is not very pretty, and is quite unnecessary. Messrs. Cassell continue to make a number of welcomeadditions to their " National Library," such as Fielding's Voyage to Lisbon, Arthur Young's Tour in Ireland, Mungo Park's Travels in Africa, and a reprint of Mr. Woolner's delightful poem My Beautiful Lady, which deserves to enjoy popularity among all classes of readers. ?Messrs. Routledge have printed in their delightful "Pocket Library" Byron's Werner, Campbells Poetical Works, and The Lady of the Lake. A handsome record of the sale of the first portion of Lord Crawford's library is before us in the shape of a large-paper copy of the Catalogue, issued by Messrs. Sotheby, Wilkinson & Hodge, with a list of the prices and the names of the purchasers. We are glad to receive from Messrs.

qf Fashionable Lfe, Practical Educationi, 64y Miss Ed.gcwort11, A uthor BL3Iinda, Castle Rackrent, Tales of Essay on Irish Bull>, &c. 3 vols. 1imo. London. Johnson. 1809. This is another set of tales from the pen of the most original and beautiful tale-writer of th-e present day. Every body knowvs, every body aimires arid loves, the chasteness and utility of the Mloral Tales and thre Ponrular Tales, the onedirected to youth, the other to people in the mi(ddle stations of life: the pir sent volumes are Tales of Fashionable Life, an(d are calculatc(l to be quite as cap. tivating and usefil as either of thc autlhorAS former publi. cations. The objects of each of the tales in the present volumes are well l)ointeed out by Miss Edgerwortl's father, who writes her pr'efiac. " The first of the stories is called I Ennui.' Th e caures, curses and cure ot this disea-e are exemplified, I hope, in suchi a niaTmler, as not to make the remedy worse than the (lisease. Thiebadld tells us, th1at a Iprize essay was read to the Academ))y of Berlin, which put all the ju.dges to sleep. 'Almoria' gives a view of the consequenices, which usu. ally follow the substitution of the gifts of fiortutie in the place of nmerit; and it showvs the meanness of thosel, w ho imitate manners, and hauist company, above their station in society. Difference of rank is a continual excitement to laudable emulation ; but those, who consider the being admitted into circles of f~ashion as the summit of human bliss and elevation, will here find how grievously such friv olous ambition may be disappointed and chastised. " ' Madame de Fleury' points out some of the means which may be employed by the rich, for the real advan. tage of the poor. This story shows that sowing gold does not always produce a golden larvest; buit that knowledge and virtue, when early implanted in the human breast, seldom fail to make ample returns of prudence and Telicity. "; 'The Dun' is intended as a lesson agrainst the com.. mon folly of believing that a debtor is able by a few cant phrases to alter the nature of right and wrong: we had once thoughts of giving to these books the title of "' FashiE owlable Tales." Alas! the D)un could never haave found fav'ot i r witi fahiloriable rCeaderS. '' ' MaIciiLvriiiT' is avicoto vhich the littie great hav recourse, to shiew their seconid-rate ab0)ilities. Infrimies of gallantry upon tihe Conitinent frequeiitly letd to political intriorU(I: aino1 rst us the atteml-)ts to introuce thiNs i/m. prove ent of our mauners have ! yG4 yet bs successful ; but there are, however, somne, who III eVt ry thing they say or do, shew a predilection for thki Io I,-r Iainde(d V wis(loin." It is howed that the pidtlure lihre rieprcsnted of a mavlawzvrer has not been made alliriiig." TI'ese are- all the tales ot the l)preslnt 'volmes; and Mr. Edgewv-orti has left the rev'cwer Iit'e to >ay of them. ' Ennui,' as a story, is rathr (dull of' incident till towards tVi middle (o chil(fdel''" is ;(reworth's ,story are, ho iln c1 ah': the ' frolij St('e) to 11L-*)2, lic. oi on a{ilibitiol . 4slr\ ) l} f{ it.

IYN 1' x1 1. ia( , o bther I lIst-Iltiulls. 7S (d. Ifl t. Iiariap. 1 It is, exp)lainei(d in the preface that the writer has not hesitated to attack sonie accel)ted hypotheses - coicerning the character an(l attributes of certain deities. anmd that he has attempted to reconstruct ' the natures of Osiris, Isis, Thoth, and several other divinities.' The book con- stitutes therefore a new departure, and outside the points enumerated, a comparison of Mr. Spence's Xviews on totemism in Egypt with those of Sir WXallis Budge in " Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection," will show that there are grave matters at issue between this new and the older Egyptology. While the iecognised authorities do not love one another, as their books testify, they are liable to present a united front against new comers bearing a message of their own, and Mr. Spence is likely to meet with some unsparing criticism. The beautiful coloured pictures of Evelyn Paul will, no doubt of themselves, be sufficient to condemn the work from the standpoint of strict scholarship, and the imaginary element in these w\ill be discovered also in the text. The fact, however, w\ill remain that the scholarship which is apart, as a rule, from any literary gift, could never have produced this handbook of Egyptian mythology and official religion, which will bring many to a knowledge of the charm of Egypt who would be left untouched and unenkindled by the vast collections of archxologi:-ts. In a work of this kind the pictures of Evelyn Paul will help to bind the spell, for they breathe the Egyptian spirit, howc.'er little they may owe to monuments and papyri. For 'Mr. Spence's particular purpose there is enough and to spare of these in the other illustrations. Mr. Spence, unlike most of the recognised authorities, is a student of the science of religion at large, and is learned in the mythologies of Mlex.co and l'cru, as his earlier works prose. But what is termed the science of religion will not open the door of the old temples without the science of mysticism, under which light " the natures " of Osiris. Isis and the other divinities suffer yet another change, for %within these solar andl lunar gods, as under veils, there is found hidden the legends of the soul.

Sports and Anecdotes of Bygone Days. By C. T. S. Birch Reynardson. (Chapman & Hall.) Doun the Road; or, Reminiscences of a Gentleman Coachman. (Same author and publishers.) Is * Sports and Anecdotes' the veteran author has recorded the reminiscences of a long life chiefly passed in sport and pleasure, to judge from his book. It goes without saying that one who is able to write intelligibly on the many and varied incidents of no fewer than sixty winters and summers, largely devoted to shooting, fishing, and driving, together with a certain amount of hunting, has a good deal to say of interest to sportsmen both old and young. To the former he will recall events almost forgotten concerning the Nimrods of a past generation. To the latter he gives serviceable information, the result of long experience. Mr. Reynardson declaims any effort at fine writing or polish of style, but we are somewhat disappointed to find a large amount of slang used by himself, and the very reverse of fine language put into the mouths of some of his characters. Still, in what our author calls the "good old times," maybe people drank harder, quarrelled oftener, gambled more, and did other things in a more reckless way as well; they also swore harder. In these degenerate days, if so they may be called, the insulting language used by our forefathers towards one another in the hunting field would not be tolerated for a moment. It is, however, even now generally conceded that masters of hounds, if able, generous men in their position, are allowed a certain amount of licence when everything goes wrong?fox, hounds, and horsemen included ; but it may be doubted if any master of to-day would treat an inoffensive clergyman to the abuse showered on him by one of Mr. Reynardson's hunting celebrities. The earlier pages of ' Bygone Days' aro taken up with hunting, and particularly with an account of the " Cottesmore " and their country in 1826. The reader is introduced to such well ? known names as Lord Clan william, Sir James Musgrave, Sir F. Burdett, Mr. Frank Forrester, Lord Hilton, Mr. Horatio Ross, General Grosvenor, and Lord Alvanley, who wore boots of enormous size, and of whom so equipped a capital picture is given. Many are the feats and anecdotes recorded of these excellent sportsmen not alone in hunting and shooting, but in other respects as well, even in the bottles of wine they some of them were able to consume at a sitting. General Grosvenor seems to bear off the prize as a thorough old sportsman as well as a most eccentric one. He seems to have had an objection to duns, a not uncommon dislike even in these days. But his tailor, after many demands for a settlement, at last became importunate and had to be paid, the gallant general calmly remarking to the man of cloth at the time: "I tell you what, Mr. H., you are abad tailor, and if I had thought you would ever have expected to be paid I would never have employed you." Mr. Reynardson sneers at stag - hunting, and depicts in picture and prose " the antlered monarch of the waste," and in opposition " the quondam antlered monarch," the former standing proud and defiant on the hill-top, the latter shambling along, without any antlers and dead beat. That this may be a true representation now and then is probably the case, but for real stag-hunting we recommend to our author's notice ' Stag-hunting on Exmoor,' lately reviewed in our columns, as a means of disabusing him of the idea that hunting a stag is generally such a farce as he, evidently from hearsay, asserts it to be. In punt-shooting at ducks and geese the author seems to have been most successful, as he declares that on Lake Maggiore he killed no fewer than six hundred and fortyeight ducks and mallards in a "few weeks." These ducks, too, were uncommonly fine birds, as they fed every night on the rice-fields near Pavia. This sport was carried out, we are told, under a hot sun, probably in early autumn?a time that, in our ideas of duck shooting, which are connected with wild wintry weather, would militate against the enjoyment of it. Mr. Reynardson gives a curious account of how the peasants of the Campagna catch woodcock at night. The cattle there all have tied round their necks bells, which jingle continually as the animals move from one spot to another when grazing. To this souud the birds are well accustomed. Our ingenious peasant proceeds to tie a similar bell round his waist, and armed with only a landing net, such as anglers use, he sets forth. The birds, seeing no cause for suspicion in the well-known sound of the bell, allow such a close approach that they are captured with the net as they sit or feed on the ground at night. On bright moonlight nights only, we presume, can they be so taken. We read on, for our author's style is usually pleasant and chatty, we may say conversational, dipping into accounts of fishing and other sports, mixed up with anecdotes and a good deal of surmise and argument, till at length we are brought up with what is so well known in the navy as " a round turn "?Anglice all of a sudden? by an account of the execution of " Carl Cadwaller." Certainly this is a ghastly subject to introduce amid scenes of fishing and shooting, and, strange to say, it is the bestwritten chapter in the book. Mr. Reynardson and some friends, one fine day in July, when in Germany, drove off to the execution, placed their carriage within a few yards of the chair in which the culprit sat in order to have his head sliced off, and saw the whole performance from beginning to end. They also noted every motion of the condemned and of the swordsman, and all the horrible details are vividly described,?how the executioner first made a feint at the man's neck with his weapon, and then cut it neatly through at a blow; how the stroke resembled the cutting in half of an unripe pumpkin with a large knife ; and how, when the law was carried out, body, head, and chair were carried off in a cart filled with straw. There is some satisfaction in learning that the spectators of this ghastly scene on reaching home had no appetite for dinner, especially as the principal dish consisted of a " calf's head "; no wonder, as Mr. Reynardson says, " I have hated the very sight of calf's head ever since." To turn to pleasanter themes is a relief. An anecdote may be quoted that is worth reproduction, and there are I many as good in * Bygone Days':? " A noble lord, now dead some years, on arriving at his home in the Highlands, summoned his keeper to know how things were going on. He had a lot of very nice Skye terriers, of which he was very fond. After having asked about the grouse and the deer and whether there were many grilse in the river, and so forth, he proceeded to inquire 'Well, Sandy, and how are the little dogs?' ' Ah, weel, my lord,' said Sandy, * they are no doing so bad neither. Peckles is no so weel, my lord.' ' Pickles not well ? I 'rn sorry to hear that. What's the matter with him 1 Not much amiss I hope 1' ' Ah, weel, my lord, I 'm dootish about Peckles.' ' But what a the matter with him ?' ' Weel, my lord, I 'm dootsome about him, I 'm dootish about Peckles.' * Well, but surely you can tell me what's the matter with him.' ' Weel, my lord, Peckles 'll no doo, my lord.' 'Well, but you can tell me what state he 's in. Is he likely to get better, or is he going to die, or what ?' ' Weel, my lord, Peckles is deed.'" Mr. Reynardson has made several excursions to Ireland, and falls into the error, common to Englishmen when writing of their experiences in the sister isle, of attempting to set down in print the Hibernian brogue. This feat is an impossibility, and it is rarely that vivd voce the Irish tongue can be even fairly imitated by the "Sassenach." Such sentences as " Lang life to your anner! Sure it's a kind gintleman ye are, that would never let a poor widdee be wanting amalethismorning!" no doubt sounded well enough in the streets of Ballina, uttered by some old crone with supplicating hands and cunning face, but nevertheless when placed in print they do not bear looking at by a critical reader. In the chapter on Ballina we find Maxwell's well-known story of the major who asked all the beggars to call upon him, and on their doing so told them that, instead of the expected douceurs, " devil a penny" they would get from him as long as he was in the town?a story published in ' Wild Sports of the West' sixty years ago, a book, by the way, made memorable not only by its sporting adventures, but also by the thrilling romances and the never-to-beforgotten tale of the " Blind Seal" which it contains. Our author has also a good deal to say about seals, more especially in the skinning of them. Of the skinning of a seal he gives us a picture, or rather his artist doe8,for there is nothing particularly striking in the incident or the suggestion. In fact we cannot, with the exception of the original portrait of General Grosvenor by the author's father, congratulate him on the illustrations in his book. They might have been far better and more to the point. They suggest the idea of the artist being left to his devices with orders to draw a certain number of-illustrations ; and these are unfortunately of an inferior description. The new and improved edition of Mr. Reynardson's earlier volume will be welcome to many, for it contains much that is amusing, especially the story of Mr. Reynardson's yellow coach:? " Before leaving England, being full of visions of driving my own coach all over the world, I bought a large yellow coach, a regular 'drag, and four-horse harness. I started with my I family, meaning most fully to buy horses on the other side of the water. I grew, however, fainthearted, and my pockets got low, and when the wheels required greasing I could not find the wherewith to grease them. So I posted and travelled 'voiturier' with my great yellow coach, eometimes lugging my harness with me, and sometimes sending it by ' roulage,' till I thought I should have gone mad with the bother and trouble I had. Sometimes I lost it altogether, ?nd sometimes the Douaniers at the frontiers detained it, wondering what I could want with harness and no horses. They gave me all sorts ?f trouble ; still the harness stuck to me, and we got to Milan. From Milan I was persuaded by a friend to go on to Rome, and the harness wu again sent by ' roulage' to Rome, where I was quite determined to get some horses, ' colite que coule.* When I reached Rome no harness had come, and when it did come the idiots? lor I can call them nothing else?would not let it enter the 'Holy City'.No power could induce the officials to loose their hold of it. It was a (contraband of war,' and they would not let me pay duty for it, or let me even see it. At last I got an audience of a good-natured old cardinal, Cardinal Toati, who, upon my giving him the ' word of a Britisher' that I would not sell it, liberated my harness. What to do with it when I had it again I knew not. I could not find any horses ; and if I had, I had not the cash to pay for them, and so, after much bother and perplexity of mind, I sent the infernal harness all the way back to England.When I and my family and the yellow coach got safely back to England, not without much regret, I decided to sell the old yellow companion of my travels. It was a very good coach, and before leaving England had cost me 113 sovereigns. I .held out stoutly for eighty pounds for it. No one seemed, however, to want it. I came down in my price ; still everybody did not run after it, as I had hoped and expected. I advertised it; I stood it at livery ; I put it in the Pantechnicon for many weeks, at half-acrown a week ; I put it to stand at Tattersall^ for many more weeks to the ' same tune.' At last I grew desperate and reckless, and having consulted Messrs. Tattersall, they advised me to ' sell it for what it would fetch.'.I took the precaution to take away a very good pair of lamps I had had made for it and put in the old ones, and begged Mr. Tattersall to do his best for me. fie used all his persuasive eloquence, which we all know was great, and having brought all bidders to a standstill, he pronounced the following : ' For the last time, going for six guineas; for the last time at six guineas ; it's to be sold. Oh! gentlemen, you'll surely not let such a coach as that go for six guineas ! Have you all done, gentlemen; for the last time at six guineas; going for six guineas, for the last time,' and bang goes the hammer. He gave me a check for six pounds, keeping the shillings, as is usual on such occasions, for the firm of Tattersall and Company. So ended my yellow coach !" In concluding our notice we cannot but admit that Mr. Reynardson, notwithstanding his sufferings from lameness and rheumatism, has had long experience of sporting matters, and has always acted the part of a true sportsman. He has used his ample resources for over half a century as a means of enjoying himself, though he has had many cares besides the failure of his yellow coach, and now he has written down his experiences, and we have no doubt these will be a source of pleasure for younger generations of hunters, anglers, and shooters, if only as showing how their fathers did before them. We read with a feeling of sadness the concluding lines of his last work, ?and here quote them:? /'It is true that many years have elapsed woce the anecdotes I have related took place; but they all come as vividly before my eyes as if they had happened yesterday. I was then young and full of go ; and though crippled by a stiff hip from my accident, I could enjoy everything except riding, for I then Buffered no pain and was up to everything. Lying out in gunning punts, and such like proceedings have, I fear, not conduced much to my comforts, as I now suffer terribly from rheumatism and such like discomforts. I love, however, to look back on my younger and happier days, and I still delight to sing, Oh sing me the songs which to me were so dear Long, long ago. Long ago! and am constrained to say with Horace, Eheu ! fugaces. Postiiume, Postbume, Labuntur anni."

MEN AND WOMEN OF FR.%WCE. .Men and rinue of Frasne dupiaq the Last Cetio'e. In Three Volumes. Be'ntley. IF Mr. Bentley accepted this work in the belief that it was original, we venture to say that he has been grossly deceive(d. It is French from tile first page to the last. *We have no tinie to hunt up the originals, hut the internal evidence is conclusive as to these sketelhcs being translationsand we will add, very indifl~rent translations; an opinion the following samples will prove. The common French idiom, rcdre 1r (hAchf des cAamps betrays a translator, and a bad o(e, forr Le has rendered it literally, " Ali, sire, is it not enough for to-day to have given mte the key of thefields P' B w vay of literalness also rtead this: " iShe is rehearsing her part with tliat animnl Lafontaine, who makes half my pieces." " Ifomme dt'eprit" is translated " a man of spirit ;" tind for a sententcv to Euzzle the English reader take this: "1 As soon as Fontenelle presented inmself at the Academv the old satirist took the ielld against lhint. Every. where after the visit of Fontenelle followed that of Boileau." Whow oulH imagine that this meant to *leseribe how^ Fontenelle wanted to he elected as a Member of the Academy, and that every visit lie paid to the members to solicit their votes was succeeded lbv a visit from Boileanl lndeed, the whole style of this work is not only iransparently (;allie, but is, as we said, a very ind(liflrenit translation. Yet no winie is on the titlepage; no hin t is given in the prefaee (which is dated F mehrarv. 1832.)2) that the work is a translation, and we began it under the iAoa.jide impression that some English autihor hmla4 produced a companion wvork to Miss Kavanagh's llomi rlif if -,nce. Nevertheless the book is extrenely aiusiig.n It wias worth translating for the gay picture it presents of literary and artistic France durinlg that wonderful epoh.

Such an omelette soavffl/e of literature it would le lp(latitry to criticise, so we will content ourselves wvith this brief indication of its natupe, and select an extract or so.

" Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain and Ireland during the Middle Ages."? The Metrical Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester. Edited by W. Aldis Wright. In 2 vols. (Longmans) A new edition of the chronicle of Robert of Gloucester has long been urgently wanted. Although the work has no great literary merit, and its value as an independent historical authority is almost confined to a few incidents of the Barons' War, it is from a purely philological point of view of the nighest importance. It is in fact one of the books with which every student of the early forms of English ought to be familiar; but until now it could be read as a whole only in Hearne's edition of 1742, or the reprint of 1810, both of which, if not " scarce " in the bookseller's sense of the word, are at any rate not generally accessible. It is needless to say that Hearne's edition, though an admirable performance for its own day, does not satisfy tbe requirements of the present time, even apart from the fact that it gives for the most part the readings only of one, and that not the oldest, of the many extant MSS. In the present edition the text is founded on tbe earliest MS., and the readings of seven other copies are given in the notes. That the work is published in the " Rolls Series " is perhaps on one account to be regretted, as the plan of the series does not admit of any notes except those illustrative of the various reudings; but the disadvantage is compensated for by the very moderate price at which the volumes are issued. Mr. Aldis Wright's Introduction does not enter into philological questions, but it contains a thorough examination of the sources from which the chronicler derived his information ; and there is an excellent glossary, with references to the passages in which the words occur, as well as a complete index of proper names. The editor's remarks on the authorship of the chronicle, and the new materials which he has contributed to the discussion of the question, are likely to lead to a good deal of controversy. The work exists in two different recensions. The older of these is represented by three MSS., one of which forms the basis of Hearne's edition. The later text coincides in the main with the former down to the death of Henry I., but from that point onwards is entirely different. In the earlier text the history from the accession of Stephen to the year 1270 (where the chronicle ends abruptly) occupies 2,900 lines; in the later text the same period, together with a few sentences bringing down the story to the accession of Edward I., occupies only 590 lines. In explanation of these facts three hypotheses are prima facie possible. We must either suppose (1) that, as in the case of Piers Plowman, both texts proceeded from the original author; (2) that the longer text represents the original work, and that an unfinished or mutilated copy of it was complettd by some later hand; or (3) that the earlier part of the work and the two continuations were written by three different authors. The first of these suppositions Mr. Aldis Wright decisively rejects; and his opinion appears to be well founded. If the divergence of the two texts had begun with the reign of Henry III., it might have been a plausible conjecture that the author in preparing a second edition of his chronicle had found it expedient to suppress the strong expressions of sympathy with the rebel party which appear in the narrative of the Barons' War as given by the earlier text. No such motive, however, can be assigned for the re-writing of the history from the reign of Stephen; and, besides, an author who remodels a work of his own is sure to leave some vestiges of the original form of expression. We may, therefore, take it as proved that the original author did not write the shorter of the two continuations. Whether he wrote the longer continuation is a question which Mr. Wright leaves undetermined; but he is inclined, " on a priori grounds," to favour the hypothesis of duality of authorship. I should not like to dogmatise in opposition to the opinion of so high an authority, but my impression is that the internal evidence points the other way. The original author and the earlier continuator have, at any rate, a great deal in common. They both use the same south-western dialect; their style and versification are indistinguishably the same; they both display the same fervent patriotism and detestation of foreigners; and they both reproduce many passages from the metrical lives of saints, commonly ascribed, on the ground of identity of style and metre, to Robert of Gloucester himself. Now none of these characteristics, except that of dialect, tan be found in the later continuation. The metro is, indeed, formally the same; but the rhythmical complexion is sensibly different, and the style is decidedly less fluent and vigorous. With regard to the authorship of the metrical lives, Mr. Wright sees no reason for ascribing them to any of the three writers whom he believes to have been concerned in the chronicle. The whole question needs to be carefully re-examined in the light of the new facts contained in the present edition; but at present it appears to me that the preponderance of evidence is in favour of a common authorship of the metrical lives and of the whole of the older text of the chronicle. The current designation of the chronicler as " Robert of Gloucester " is derived from the earlier continuation, which mentions the author's Christian name, and contains evidence of his intimate acquaintance with Gloucester and its neighbourhood. If it should hereafter be established that the older text of the chronicle is the work of two different authors the name of Robert of Gloucester will still belong to the writer of the portion which ranks as an original historical authority. It will be awkward, however, to have to refer to " a nameless writer" when quoting the following famous passage: 44 pus com lo engelond * iu to normandies hond ? Sc be normans ne coulee speke bo * bote hor owe speche * & speke frenche as hii dude atom* & hure children dude also teche * So l>at heiemeu of Hs lond * bat of hor blod come ? Holde!* aile bulke speche * bat hii of hom nome ? Vor bote a man conne frenss * me telb of him lute* Ac lowe men holdeb to englies * & to hor owe speche 3ute' Ic wene ber ne beb in al be world ? contreyes none* bat ne holdeb to hor owe speche' bote engelond one* Ac wei me wot uor to conne ? bobe wei it is * Vor be more bat a mon can* be more wurbe he is." I am unable to see any sufficient ground for the editor's somewhat startling suggestion that the earlier portion of the chronicle was first written in the reign of Henry I. Mr. Wright is, of course, quite aware that the language of the existing text is that of the end of the thirteenth century, and he apparently considers that the original form of the work was prose. Whether it was probably in Latin or in English he does not say ; the common theory of a French original he elsewhere explicitly rejects. His principal argument appears to be drawn from the following passage, in which the writer is speaking of the abbeys founded by King Edgar and St. Ethelwold: 44 Vor ey3te & fourty abbeys * hii rerde in this londe echon; Ar vre king bat we abb rb nou ? adde yrerd so vale ? To monye him wolde benche * viftene bi tale." On this passage the editor remarks : 44 The king here referred to, 4 our king that we have now,' is apparently King Henry I., who, after Edgar, was the greatest founder of monasteries. But, as it is impossible that the Chronicle, in its present form, can have been written at so early a period, it is more thau probable that the reference in this passage was taken from the original document which the versifier had before him." It is to be regretted that Mr. Wright has not given a paraphrase of the last two lines, the meaning of which is by no means transparent. The only sense I can put upon them is something like this: "Before our king that we have now had built so many as even fifteen abbeys he would have thought he had done too much." If this be an admissible construction of these obscure words, they would appear to be a sneer at Edward I., whose want of liberality in Church matters the chronicler alludes to in another passage, which is quoted on the next page in the introduction. After referring to Edward the Confessor's gift of twenty manors to the monks of Winchester, he says: "Fore God, the next King Edward that came after him did not give them quite so much in all his kingdom." According to my interpretation the parallel between the two passages is curiously exact: in each case Edward I. is compared, to his disadvantage in the matter of generosity, with an Anglo-Saxon king. Mr. Wright justly rejects the notion that the chronicle is a translation from a French original. The only ground that can be [ alleged for this supposition, apart from the analogy of Robert Manning's work, is the occurrence of such forms as the March (Mercia), Picards (Picts), Daneis (Danes), Lonireis (Londoners); but it is not probable that a translator would have copied such forms from his original, unless they were already in English use. Even the statement that the poems of Wace and "La Estoire Seint Aedward" were among the sources used by the writer is considered by the editor to rest on no sufficient evidence. With regard to the literary qualities of the work, Mr. Wright's verdict seems a little too severe. 44 As literature," he says, ** it is as worthless as twelve thousand lines of verse without one spark of poetry can be. Here and there we find a trace of the quiet humour in which gentle dulness delights, but of this the instances are rare and widely scattered." Certainly it would be in vain to look for poetry in Robert of Gloucester, but he is by no means so dreary reading as this criticism would suggest. Mr. Wright's judgment is perhaps a little coloured by the weariness of a laborious and not wholly congenial task. The long list of errata is explained by Mr. Wright to be owing to the fact that in the first instance he took the readings of the Harleian MS. from Hearne's edition, which he afterwards found was not to be trusted in minute points of orthography. The volumes appear to be printed with remarkable correctness, the only mistakes I have noted being " morten " for morten on p x. (Preface), and " Bebeu " for Berni on p. 892. Henry Bradley.

? ilwonartj Labours aiul Scenes in Southern ? Africa. 10XDOX, SATURDAY, XI-U'TI-IMIll-Ill 17, HUi?. REVIEWS Rv Robert Mofl'at. Snow. The' grand avenue to the interior of Africa, leads from the Cape Colony : it is easy of access, and commanded by thc Hritish nation. In this opinion, wliioli xve have boen always disposed to maintaini w'-' nYC "ow 'u"y oomfirmed, by the iicriivil '*f M>\ M(l'fdt's interesting' volume. Tlie , hird and boundless plains of the Cape Colony, Si-aiitilv clotli'-d w'th vog( talion, have awakened I ar-iviiu disposition in th. ir pastoral inhabitants, ' f.d tiUii-'ht them how to face all llie dan<_crs and ilillie'iiltie-s of lon;.:* journeys. Hence it i--, that the traders of the colony think n ot 1 ii ii tr of travol]i:i2 l,-f*<> or 1.."<>() mil's into the interior, where tliev ?|Kntl a year or more at each visit, harti-r?iiil'witli the natives. Nor is this kind nf adventure confined to a fexv; there are, perhaps, not i ?s than -00 persons in thc eastern division of tho Cape Colony at present i ligated in traflic with the interior. Hut at what distance is the '!.l),il)!e limit nf these' trading journeys . Where xviii thev stop, or hoxv far can they reach.' To these interrogatories we can only reply, that at the f.irthest point hitherto reached by these expeditions (in the vicinity of the southern tropic), there is no visible impediment to their j further progress. Open plains, less naked and barren than towards the south, still invite them .sward, and from the natives they uniformly ', experience friendship and hospitality. Ouxvard, ' therefore, xve doubt not, they xviii continue to j mareil. j Hut, in the meantime, Christianity and civilization have struck deep root on the southern j frontiers of the indigenous nations. The Hatla- j pi., about l.'iO miles north ofthe Orange Uiver, \ we now laying aside their savage manners, and ; patiently submit to missionary training. They '< road the Scriptures in their own language?an [ advantage which they owe chiefly to Mr. Mot- I fit. New be it observed, that the language of j the Batlapis, which i.s at present taught gram- I matic.illy at the missionary schools, extends, with j slight variations of dialect, for many hundred miles through the interior, and is akin to all the htiguages of Africa, that of the Hottentots excepted, south of the equator. Indeed, the family of languages here referred to, extends several degrees, probably, beyond the equator in the interior of the continent, and as far as Caniaroons on the western const. In a fexv years, therefore, we shall have an adult generation of Batlapis trained in the missionary schools, .'nd disposed to associate with Europeans, while their language and traditional acquaintance xvith sitive customs, will still enable them to engage ssi easy intercourse with their wilder brethren. Ihese people, who are great travellon even in eil*pie-sent condition, and have explored the interior some hundred miles beyond the linc reached by l.uropeans, will doubtless derive ?'??'sli courage, as well as curiosity, from knowle, and will elfectually aid us in penetrating ??' the hitherto inaccessible regions of equatorial Africa, Hut before we indulge in speculations on the Climate results of missionary labours in South Atrica, xve must give some account of their carly ''"gross; or rather xve must follow the career of "r. Moll'at, from his first entrance into the wildness, till he succeeded in planting a garden in !i!e midst of it. In Us 17, our author commenced teaching among the Namaquas in tlio desert north ?' Cape town, and in the folloxving year, removed totlu; northern side ofthe Orange Uiver, to thc wis of Africaner, a Hottentot chief, once the tcr'? uf thc Cape tanners. Thu society of \\ ild Hottentots ami outcast Mulattoes, oilers little I hat is agreeable, and unthill!*; can be inure ililli and monotonous than the even-day lite of the desert. Speaking ol' a journey in the bush, our authur observes :? *' Sniue may think tl,nt this mode of lite iva-- it. great sacrifice ; bat habit inanes it nitieli less so than tiley suppose, lt is true. I did iV.-i.-l it ;i sacrilice to liave nothing itt all to iat, and to bind the stomach wiih ii thong to prevent the gnawing nt'lumber; and thus, tinder these circuir.stuucis, to lire;ik the bread ol' edt:-..ii lit'e to tlie peri.-liing heathen. Water was in general very scarce : isoiiietiiiies in small pools, stagnant, and with ;i oreen froth ; iind more than once we li:td to dispute with lion-* the possession ot'a pool. *' '; My meals consisted fri-iiiiently nf a udass ol' miik in thc iiioriiiii.'. iiiin'tlier at noon, ami ii third tit ni:;ht. cither sweet, sour, or curdled ; I'm1 the Niimit'pias had nat the alt ol' preparing it in the lnaittier ol'tlie I'ecliuaiias, v. hich will afterwards be described. I had , fri.jiicutiy pn-tly loni? fos'.s, aud have had recourse to , the ' fasting Liirdle." as it is cai It \ : on more than one i occasion after the iiior;:iii'j; service. I hiive shouldered ; my Lim, and om:" to tlie plain or thc mountain ] brow in search of something to eat. and, when unsuc- j eessful, httve returned, laid down my piece, taken ! the Word of Life, iind addressed my congregation." The wild beast.:, to be sure, are lively, entertaining creatures, and we occasionally meet with a pleasant anecdote respecting their adventures, 'lake tlie following for example :? 1 "On our route homeward we halted iit a s-pot where il novel scene once occurred, and which was described by iin individual who witnessed it when a boy. Near . ii very small fountain, which was shown to nie, stood 1 a camel thorn-tree, (.lem ia Girajfti). It was a stiti j tree, about twelve feet high, with a flat, bushy top. I Many years ago, the relater, then ii boy, was returning to his viii,me, :md having turned aside to the founI tiii11 for a drink, hiv down on the bank, and fell | asleep. living awoke by the piercing rays ofthe sun, I he saw, through the bush behind which he lay, a : gindie browsing at case on the tender shoots of thc i tree, and, to his horror, a lion, creeping like ii cat. only a do/en yards from him. preparing to pounce . on his prey. The lion eyed the gi ra tte for a few i inonu nts, his body gave ii shake, and he bounded into the air, to seize the head of the mutual, which I instantly turned his stately neck, and the lion, missI ing his gras)), fell on hisback in the centre of the mass ! of thorns, like spikes, und the giraffe bounded over tlie plain. The boy instantly followed his example, expecting, as a matter of course, that the enraged lion would soon find his way to the earth. Some time afterwards, the people of the village, who seldom visited that spot, saw the eagles hovering in the air; ;md iis it is almost always a certain sign that the lion has killed game, or some animal is lying dead, they went to the place, iind sought in vain, till, conting under the lee of the tree, their olfactory nerves ( directed them to where the lion lay dead ia his j thorny bed. I still found some of bis bones under the tree, and hair on its branches, to convince nie of what I scarcely could have credited. The lion will sometimes manage to mount the buck of ii giraffe, and, tixing his sharp claws into each shoulder, gnaw it way till lie reaches the vertebra1 of the neck, when j both lilli; iind ofttimes the lion is lamed for his trou| hie. If the girali'o happens to be very strong, he succeeds in bringing his rider to thc ground. Among those that we shot on our journey, the healed wounds I ofthe lion's dawson the shoulder, and marks of his j teeth on the back of tiie neck, gave us ocular ! demonstration that two of them had carried the ; monarch of thc fbrest on their backs, and yet como ' off triumphant." i The Hottentot nation is now reduced lo a , mere handful. Within the boundaries of the ' Cane Colony, or in a territory of 10,000 square miles, once covered with a Hottentot population, there are now not OOO survivors of tho pure aboriginal race, aud of these, hardly 200 speak tlie Hottentot language, respecting which Mr. Moffat remarks, "that it would bo no loss if it were annihilated." Beyond the colonial boundaries, the scattered Hottentot families may. perhaps, amount altogether to 3,01)0. liut why are they not collected together and removed from the parched desert to some spot favourable to the growth of industrious habits . Oh! it xviii be said, such a removal xvould cost money. Yes; hut the Missionary Societies have large revenues, and itt lit-y do not actually prefer letting thc seed I fall on stony ground, if they are not more partial to the parade of labour than to its fruit, wc cannot understand why they do not take tho course xxhieh would be ultimately most economical, as wt ll as eiiicaeioiis, and boldly place at once tho subjects of their solicitude in betti r physical circumstances. To endeavour to raise the wretched dwellers of the desert above the abject pox orly incompatible willi the due dex ciopeini nt of moral or religion> feeling, is to struggle against tile obstinacy of nature in lier sternest mood. Th.'great desert situate betxveen the countries ofthe Namaquas and Dedin.mas, ha:; been hitherto always described as impassable. Yet we lind that it has been crossed by our author, though, unfortunately, hi< account of his journey over it is little calculated to satisfy geographical inquiries. Several rivers Hoxv into that desert with a westerly or southerly course, and what becomes of them .' Do they reach the Orange Uiver.' Vi'e may infer, from our author'.-*, silence, thal they do not ; but xve should haxe been better pleased to have had his positive testimony oil that point. The folloxving description exhibits to us a total change of scene : ? " Our course lay principally on tho north side of the Orango Uiver. Though xve journeyed on tho hanks ni' a river in xvhich there xvas an abundance ol' water, and though the country xv.is xvell inhabited, xve siitfered atllielively from thirst, as well a- hunger; few villages liebig on thc north side of the river, along xvliieh xve Unveiled. We xvere sometimes coin! pelled to scramble over rocky pa-scs in the hills, only ;i lit abode for baboons, xvhich '.vere as plentiful as they were impudent. At other linus ixe bad to ei'o^s the river, to avoid the moiin'iiiiis on the opposite side, xvhich arose, in the wildest grandeur, from \ the x\liter's edi't.. Oa reaching the waterfalSs, wc were kindly received and treated by a Corunna chief, called Saul, (to xvhoni I shall have occasion ti) j refer when treating of the l.ccluiann mission), and j there xve halted one day. Ile hid visited our station, j iind felt exceedingly thankful for the- kindness I had ! shown him. I xvas glad of this renexved opportunity to preach, and he xvas glad to hear again the message I of Divine u"'aee. Tho Orange Uiver hero presents | the appearance of a plain, miles in breadth, entirely j covered with mimosa tre-cs. among xvhich the many I branches of tin? river run, and then tumble over tho precipices, nibing clouds of mist, when there is any volume of xvii'.er. Wo proceeded on our journey, and entered a valley covered xvith a species of mimosa, tho thorns of xvhich resembled lisli-hooks. * ? The xvindings ofthe river sometimes flowed through immense chasms, overhung xvith stupendous precipices: and then like a translucent hike, xvith tho beautiful towering mimosas and willows reflected from its bosom; and ii rich variety of birds, of fine plumage, though xvithout a song; xviii! geese,(Incl.a, snipes, flamingoes in perfect security, feeding on the banks, beneath the green shade, or basking in the sun's rays on the verdant islands, far from tho fowler's snare." Where, then, are those cascades and translucent lakes; those venial.t islands, and those groves peopled xvith sueh a gay variety of brilliant plumage .' Tiny are situate in the midst of a tract, the heat of which has been frequently compared to that of a heated oven. They have on one side thc great ll-'.-dimcii's desert, in xvhich it lia-' been known to happen thsit i.ot a drop of rain fell fur live years in succession, and. on the other, that boundless expanse of s-ind, lo which Mr. Campbell gave tlie name of the Southern Sabra, it looks as if some enchant", r had there, iu the secluded valley, created fr himself a litlle paradise, far removed, apparently, from the approach of mortat. When Mr. Moffat says that tlie country was well inhabited, he assuredly speaks carelessly, nnd would merely intimate tliat, in tlie early part of his route, he passed over a country which, compared with other parts of Namaqualand, was well peopled. The falls alluded to by him are evidently thc same which Mr. Thompson named "(ieorge the Fourth's Fulls," and estimated to be 100 feet in height. This intelligent traveller saw them from tho southern bank of the river, on that perilous journey through the Irishmen's desert, which had neatly cost him his life. It w;is lil that our author, with such a smiling landscape before his eyes, should feel disposed to enjoy the desert, and accordingly he here describes as follows one of the luxuries peculiar to it. " liebig ignorant of Ihe locality, and not knowing where the inhabitants (Bushmen) might be, we made no tire, lest we should he discovered, and we had nothing to roast. There were no trees, and we hiv down between ridges or hills of deep sand. The wind was cold, and we had little covering, having left the half of out horses knocked up, and with them most of oar drosses. 'J'he plan adopted by Mr. Ilaeiiscl, ;i Moravian missionary, in similar circumstances, occurred to nie, and, like him, I made a hole in the mukI, and buried myself, leaving the head out. ' I soon felt very ci.infortab'c, and, extolling the plan, > one of my companions imitated my example, and got . under the earth. I then told him tliat the missionary j whom v.e were imitating, having once submerged i himself in the sand near the sea-shore, was occasion- ; ally disturbed by huge crabs approaching him, aud these his faithful dog kept at a distance. My companion iu-ked, * Ami what are we to do if a lion collies:-' * Wc are safe,' I replied, 'for he will not vat beads when he can get whole bodies. This removed his fears ; and I do not remember to hiive piept so comfortably during the whole journey, in which we had often very sorry accommodations." j Before we quit the bush, wo must relate one more anecdote illustrative of the manners of ii* motley inhabit,.nts :? ** Reclining on a rock one day, waiting till my shirt, which I h;i(l washed, was dry, I noticed a crow risc from the earth, carrying something dangling in its talons. On dircctir-g my companions to the sight, they said, * lt is onie ii crow with a tortoise ; you will see it fill presently ;* and down it fell. Thc crow descended, .md up went the tortoise again to a still greater height, from which it dropped, and the crow instantly followed. I hastened with one of the men to the spot, and scared away the crow from the mangled tortoise, mi which it was enjoying a feast. On looking around tlic flat rock there were manywrecks nf former years ; and nit my remarking I did not think thc crow was *.> cunning, my companion replied,'The kites do the same thing ;' which I have biuce frequently observed." j The object of Mr. Mntfat's journey eastward ; Wits, to visit the (iriquns, and ascertain how tar ' it wits expedient that Africaner should emigrate i to their country. The details into which he ! enters respecting the (iriqua missions, may be j found in other publications, and we shall, therefore, pass tin in over in silence. We may as well, however, remind our readers, that the (Iriqitas are the pe< pie who wi re formerly called in colonial Dutch, " lkistaards," that is to say, mulattoes. Despised and persecuted, but bold and energetic, they gradually withdrew from the colony, and tumid tin nisi Ives into en independent coiiiMimity cn the Orange Uiver. 15- ing advised to get rid nf their opprobrious appt llatieii, tliey iis-uined that of (iiiqnas, which bad 1.dunged to ;,:i extinct ll'th ntnt tribe. 'I'he niissini'.e.i ic - have rendered them the Linst important n ivici -. and thus we have the cur io u-.. spectacle of ii l,,iiu!sia-,ie and vigorous coloured race of linn, Christians, advancing in civ i!i/;uii it, ;iinl sptiikit.g the Dutch l::re.:ii;ige, who have es*.iblishtd tie inst Ki s as ii natl, n, in the doss it, IOU miles from the nearest sea coast, hoping there to preserve the name of their Hottentot forefathers. Hut the (_i'ic]iia? have serious (lilliculties to contend with. They are seated in the midst of barrenness, and their growing community, small as it still is, lives in perpetual dread of famine. Hut where, it will be asked, can they find a more promising home beyond the colonial boundary, unless, fighting their xvay through thc interior, they dispossess other nations.'' In answering this question, xve cannot help premising the remark, that the xvork of philanthropy is, generally speaking, executed with less than a tithe of the spirit and intelligence displayed in the pursuit of gain. Of thc immense sums of money annually collected in this country for the support of foreign missions, no small amount is wasted by a niggard and creeping system, xvhich falls far short of the end in view. In Namaqualaud, and in the deserts eastxvards, near the Orange Uiver, several missions are maintained at a cost considerable in comparison with their opportunities of doing good ; and the missionaries have to participate in the hard penury xvhich chiefly countervails their humanizing influence ; they maintain, we say, a lingering existence iu deserts; while through the midst of those deserts ? flows a groat river, the xvaters of which, xxith a little Kuropean science and no great expenditure 1 of money, might be made to fertilize territory ' sufficient for the support of thousands. Wc have been at some pains to ascertain this point; and xve know, on unquestionable authority, that the Orange Uiver is bordered generally by a good soil, xvhich only requires xvater to become immediately productive. Large portions ofthe valley below the country of the (iriquas, are liable to occasional inundation, and exhibit ; alluvial tracts, from four to six miles wide, and ' many miles in length, covered with acacias, willows, and coarse herbage. Nubia, below the second cataract, supports its thousands of inhabitants, and yet it has scarcely a handful of cultivable soil ; xvhereas the banks of the Orange Uiver would almost everywhere repay the expense of irrigation. Hut the Nubians, in most respects not superior to the (iriquas, have thc art and the habit of constructing the crazy waterwheel ; and, xvhich is perhaps of more importance, the Nile rises much more nearly to the lovel of its banks than the Orange Uiver. l.ut what signifies this.' Is not the pump superior to the water-wheel.' May not the water be raised by very simple machinery to a height I never dreamt of in Nubia.' And might not a i model farm, sure not to fail (xve mean no iuvi* .lions reflection), be established xvith a moderate I outlay, in a favourable station on the Orange | ; Uiver, and large enough to supply abundance to ?' the xvhole population of (iriqua town .' A tax . s levied on the cultivators, according to the quau. I thy of water consumed by them, would more than . i repay the cost of the undertaking, besides preventing waste ; and if the assessment, with the care of the machinery, wiro left to the people themselves, it xvould teach them economical management, and the advantages of co-operation. To the (Iriquas might be added such remnants of tl.e Hottentot race, noxv scattered far and wide, as were willing to embrace an industrious and religious life. Thus we should turn to account the only means of pl.nty possessed by the region in question ; and if the banks ofthe Orange Uiver were occupied by a fixed and si d.-ut.irv population, living un the produce of their watered fields, an.l drainin.i>* the country round for the sake of those fields xv.aild tiny not prove a great blessing to the colony, by checking the restless wandering ofthe farmers' Hut we must return to Mr. Moffat, xx ho, in ls-jo, li\ed hinisilf in the country (d'the I5.itlapis, among whom he has since laboured unremittingly, and xvith ultimate success. In 1801 the Dim commissioners, Somerville and Truter, visited thc interior for the purpose of buying cattle and crossing the Orange Uiver reached.'Yor the first time, the Hallapis, respecting whom they made on their return, a very favourable report. These people, when questioned respecting the nations dwelling further in the interior, called them Hochuiina, which merely means similar, or HU ourselves. As far as their knowledge of tlie country goes, (and it reaches to a great inland sea, which appears to be on the confines of Benguela,) all the nations are Hechuaiia, and speak Sichuana, or a language xvhich is everywhere radically the same. When Mr. Campbell'visited the Hatlapis in 1 SI"?, their king Mothibi said to him, ?'Send nie missionaries, I will be a father to them." Hut xvhen the missionaries arrived and proposed, not to trade, but to teach, the kino'j countenance fell; and though tho strangers we're tolerated, they could make no impression on the people, xvho disliked their magisterial tone, and laughed at their " news." This king of the Bat, lapis died afterwards in an encounter with the king of the beasts, or in other words, Mothibi was eaton by a lion. Such was the state of the Becliur.na mission xvhen our author joined it, and such it long con. turned, till perseverance in doing good, and the complete command ofthe finely-constructed and mellifluous Sichuana language acquired bv our author, at length opened the hearts and ears cf the people, lt xvas during this period of doubtful success, that Mr. Moffat made a journey north-eastwards to the Haiiiiiigketsi, whose chief had sent an invitation to him. In tho absence of accurate geographical details, we cannot determine satisfactorily thc situation of this people; but we suppose their country to lie about -IOU miles from the Orange Uiver, and about 1000 miles, by route, from Cape Town. Passing over the incidents of the journey, xve shall come at once to our author's interview with the king, xvhich is thus related:? '?About ten o'clock a.m., Muk aba made his appearance, xvith his retinue, and sat down opposite to my wagon. The bustling crowd retired toa distance, ;uid a dead silence ensued. Ile addressed us nearly as follows: 'My friends, I am perfectly happy ; my heart is whiter than milk, because you have visited me. To-day I am a great man. Men xviii now say, Makaba is in league xvith xvbite people.' * ? In th.1 morning three oxen xvere sent for slaughter, imo, ia the course ofthe day, boiled corn, pottage, and leer, I xisited the town, xvhich is very large, but was no' able to judge of the number of inhabitants: the town itself covered a vast extent, so tint the population must have been great compared with tliat ofthe towri of South Africa generally. Each of Mahalia's wivi-j, who xvere numerous, had a separate establishment, consisting of three or four houses, a corii-hoii?o, and ii general storehouse. They bad also a number of round jars for corn, from eight to twelve feet in diameter, and nearly the same in height, xvhich are raised from the ground upon a circle of stones. Their premises and houses xvere on a plan rather diffcrn-t from what I had before seen. The houses, though not huger than those ofthe Hatlapis, xvere built with rather more regard to taste and comfort. The acc.:racy xvith xvhich circles were formed, and perpendiculars raised, though guided only by the exe, ?ms -in-prising. Their outer yards and housc-thxirs were very clean, and smooth as paper. No dairy-maid in Karand could keep her wooden bowl cleaner and whiter than theirs xvere. In this respect they formed a perfect contrast to the Hatlapis. Mnkiilm freiiueiitly referred to the barbarous manners of hi southern neighbours, and asked me, with an nir ? triumph, if Hie Hatlapis ever washed a wooden boiv'. or it ever they presented me with food which did rf. loiitiiin the mangled bodies of Hies, in a di>li*vhia h;id had no better cleaning than the tongue ufa _".? The front cattle-fold, or place where public meeting are held, xvas a circle of 170 feet diameter, forim.1 with round post _ eight feet high, and us close to each ther ns thev could stand, each post having been hewn ti land with the axe. Behind lay the proper cattle ti fo'il capable of holding many thousand oxen : there a viK also large sheep-iblds/' This energetic chief, whose subjects, it is said, numbered 70,000, was especially pleased to see the white mon come to him unarmed, lie knew tliat he had been accused of attacking and niurdfiin? Dr- Cowan and Donovan, whose expedition, ? is now known, perished at no great distance from Sofala. Ile did not, however, relish -ll die doctrines ofthe missionary. Ile shuddered at the idea of being " pushed from his stool" bv those whom he had slaughtered. Ile ilioiiffht'that, in fairness, " when the brains are out the niiin should die." Thc following passives illustrate the nature of his scruples :? ?'Silting down beside this great man, illustrious for nar nnd conquest, and amidst nobles and counsellors, iicliidiiii* rain-makers and others of the same order, IsiaH-d to him that my object was to tell him my j ., i.e?'s. * * I" the course nf my remarks, the ear of ( tho monarch caught the startling sound of a roar- I ] M'ti'in. ' What!' he exclaimed with astonishment, I ] ?idiiit are these words about? the dead, the dead ! ] firisel' 'Yes,* was my reply, 'all the dead shall ; t ffoi 'Will my father arise ?' * Yes,' I answered, ', j ?ii.iir father will arise.' ' Will all the slain in battle : , arise?' ' Vis.' 'And will all that hiive been killed , .-nd devoured by lions, tigers, hya-nas, and crocodiles. . (Uiiin revive!-' ' Yes; and come to judgment.' y ? Aiivl will those whose bodies hiive bi en left to waste j a:'.J to wither on the desert plains, and scattered to <. th'.- ninds, again arise.' he asked, with a kind of ) ; i'.iiiijili, iis if he hiid now lixed me. "Yes," I re- , rhi\!,' imt one will be left behind." This 1 repeated t iihih. i:iere;eed emphasis. After looking at me for a : . ?-.-iv moments he turned to his people, to whom he j . si'oke with ;i stentorian voice :?' Hiirk. ve wise men, ; j K'hin.'U'r is among you, thu wisest of past generations, j , ihJ ever your cars hear such strange and milliard ot" J , r..-vs.' * * kakaba then turning and addressing I , i.ia.self to me, and laying his hand nu my biutst. j , t.tiJ,'Father, I love jon much. Your \i-it iindyuur i fri-ii.ee have made my heart white as milk. The i: r's i,f your mouth are sweet ns honey, but the | v '.'i's of ;i risiirrcctinii are too great to he heard. I J , er..ol wjsh to hear again about the dead rising ! The : thad cannot arise! The dead must not aiise!'| 'Why,' I inquired,' can so great a man refuse know- \ l.dge.iind tura away from wisdom? Tell nie, my ' !::it,i!,why I must not " add to words" and speak nf a resurrection J-' Raising and uncovering his arm, '.Inch Imd been strong in battle, iind shaking his hand I r.iil'i|iiivcriiig a spear, he replied, 'I have slain my ; thousands, and shall they arise ?' " ! Makaba dismissed his white friend, willi flic ; Jt-ctieiiate prayer that, for the future, no grass ?iiif-lit grow (that is, that the path might be well trodden) between his town and the missionary station. A few years afterwards he was defeated '; and driven from his country, hy another con- j qucror, who has himself since experienced in j turn the vicissitudes of glorious war. We allude i fi the renowned Moselekatse, who, like the lion ! m the fable, has been depicted as a monster by i lu natural enemies, the liners, and by those ; travellers who derived their information from ! tk latter. Even Mr. Moffat says harsh things I cf him, tlie effect of whieh is not s-uflieieiitly j countervailed hy supplemental explanations. | Tliis warrior and savage, as he has been deemed, j sent two chief men south-westwards, into the ; country of the Iiatlapis, to learn respecting the j missionaries, who and what sort of men they ? Were, and to report " their news." As these nun had fears of being ill-treated on their return, uv tlie tribes through whose country they passed, Mr. Moffat undertook to conduct them safely to their own frontiers, about .'}()() miles K.N.K. from tlie Kurumnn station ; but when arrived fuere, the earnest entreaties of the two chiefs, and the invitations of Moselekatse himself, induced him to go on to the residence of " tlie African Napoleon." In this journey the conn- try assumed a new character. " It xvas mountainous, and wooded to the summits. Evergreens adorned the valleys, through xvhich streams of excellent xvater flowed in mariya winding course towards the Indian Ocean" (Delagoa Hay). One of the most singular objects iu the landscape is thus described :? " Having travelled one hundred miles, five days after leaving Mosega we came to the tirst cattle outposts of the Matabcle, when xve halted by a fine rivulet. My attention xvas arrested by a beautiful and gigantic tree, standing in a defile loading into an extensive and woody rax inc, between a high range of mountain.. Sci ing sonte individuals employed on the ground under its shade, and tlie conical points of what looked like houses in miniature, protruding through iis evergreen foliage', I proceeded thither, and found that the tree xvas inhabited by several families of J.akones, the aborigines of the country. I ascended by the notched trunk, and found, to my ania/enient, no less than seventeen of these aerial abodes, and three others unfinished. On reaching the topmost hut, about thirty feet from the ground, I entered, and sat down. Its only furniture was the hay which covered the tloor, a spear, a spoon, and ii bowl full of locusts. Nut bax ing eaten aux thing that day, and from tlie novelty of my situation, not wishing to return immediately to tho wagons, I asked a woman xvho sat at the door with a halie at her breast, permission to eat. This she granted xvith pleasure, and soon brought me more in a powdered state. Several more females came from the neighbouring roosts, stepping from branch to branch, to seo the stranger, who was to them as great a curiosity as the tree was to him. I then xisited the dilferent abodes, which were on several priiuipal branches. Thc structure of these houses was very simple. An oblong sciti'old, ab.mt seven feet xiiile. is form, d of straight sticks. On one end of this platform a sinai! cone is formed, also of straight sticks, and thatched xvith grass. A person cnn nearly stand upright in it; the diameter of tlie fleer is aleut six feet. The house stands on tie end of the oblong, so as to leave a little sijiiare space before the door. On the day previous I had passed several villages, some containing forty houses, all built onpolcs about seven or eight feet from the ground, in tlie foi in ol'a circle; the ascent .uni descent is by a knotty branch of a tree placed in front of the house. In the centre nf tho ii.de there is always ii heap of the bones of game tiny have killed. Such xvi re tlie domiciles ofthe impoverished j thousands ofthe aborigines ofthe country, wlio, hav- I ] ing been scattered and peeled by Moselekatse, bad j n.'ither herd nor stall, but subsisted on locusts, root-', j and the chase. They adopted this mode of archi- I tecture to escape the lions xvhich abounded iu the ! country. Daring the day the families descended to | the shade beneath to dress their daily food. When j the inhabitants increased, they sup| ortcd the aug- ? mented weight mi the branches, hy uptight slicks, i but when lightened of their load, they removed these for fire-wood." j On his route eastwards, our author saw in the s rich valleys at the base of the hills, " the ruins | of innumerable towns, some of which xvere of j amazing extent." Ile adds, that j "Tiie ruins of many towns showed signs of im. meuse labour and perseverance ; stone fences, nvcrag\ ing from four to seven feet high, nosed apparently i without inoitar, hammer, or line. Everything was I circular, from the inner walls which sum.undid each I dwelling or family resilience, to those whieh encircle;! a town. In traversing these ruins. I found the re: mains of some houses which had escaped the Hames s ofthe marauders. These were' large, and displayed I a far superior style to aux thing J had witnessed among s the other aboriginal tribes of Southern Africa. Tile circular xvalls '.vero gem-rally composed of li; rd clay, xvith a small mixture of cow-dung, so wi.ll * lustered and polished, a refined portion of the former mixed with a kind of ore, that the interior ofthe In use had . j the appearance of being varnished. The walls .and 'j S door-ways were al-o neatly ornamented with a kind of architraves and cornices. The pillars supporting !> j the roof in the form of pilasters, projecting from the l" ! walls, and adorned xvith flutings and other designs, 0 i showed much taste i:i thc architeetrcs-cs. '1 his taste, I- I how_ur. was exercised on fragile material:.*, for there w;is nothing in the building like stone, except tho foundation!-. The house?, like all others in tho interior, were round, with conical roofs, extending beyond the Willis, so as to afford considerable shade, or what might be called a verandah. The raising of the stone fences must have been a work of immense labour, for the materials had all to be brought on tho shoulders of men, and the quarries where these materials were probably obtained, were at a considerable distance. The neighbouring hills also gave ample demonstration of human perseverance, with inbtmments ofthe most paltry description." The inhabitants of these ruined towns were doubtless the people described to Mr. Campbell at Kurriehane, as exceedingly rich, and as being gods (lords). We may perhaps increase the wonder excited hy these stone ruins, by mentioning a fact which has escaped the observation of travellers in South Africa, though Mr. Burchell, the best of those travellers, very nearly stumbled on it, namely, that similar ruins of great extent lie within the limits of the Cape Colony, in the worst part of the Bushman's desert, lint how could the population ofa large town have ever subsisted in such a situation/ According to Mr. Moffat, the whole of that region luis been much more fertile than it is at present. He thinks that the climate has grown dry owing to the reckless destruction of the trees. (hiv limits, however, will not allow us to enter into the discussion of tliis curious question. Neither can we particularize the feastings and dancings which accompanied our author's introduction to the chief of the Matabelo. Moselekatse's heart was " white as milk ; milk, indeed, was no longer white, but his heart was white." Mr. Moffat, in concluding his account of thc African Napoleon, observes,? "On my journey to and from this polite, and, I miejit truly add, grateful barbarian, 1 received great attention, and was exposed to no annoyance. Having to pass through a country full of lions, a number of warriors constantly attend.d the wagons, whom I supplied v.ith food out of the numberless presents of mill;, grain, and slaughter oxen which I had reeei.cd from their munilieent master. On more than ono occasion as riianv its fifiy di-bi"? Were brought from u village iind placed before me." I A few year-liter this powerful chief was routed ! by the combined attacks of the Zoolu? under j Diiigiin, and thc eniigrii.it Boers :? j ** Overwhelmed liy such superior and unexpected I forces, be lied to the north ; and it merits notice, j that before bis departure he allowed all thc captive Bahurutsi, Bakhatla, and other neighbouring tribes, | to return to their own land. This was a measure | which astonished the natives, who havei*ince coitgre! gated on the ancient domains of their forefathers; and if no foreign power attain drive them from their native ylens, they will ere long become the interesting objects of missionary labour." I laving (hus followed our author through his various journeys, or as he would probably cati them, his itinerations, we would gladly exhibit, in a distinct summary of details, the success of the liechuaiia Missions; but unfortunately our author supplies us with nothing of that kind. His work, evidently written in haste, and under the pressure of other avocations, is at once prolix and incomplete: it often omits what is important, while it repeats what is trivial. Yet the indefatigable and cheerful spirit, the lively humour, the keen observation and natural eloquence, albeit not of the most correct or classic kind, which breathe in every page, together with tho obvious goodness of heart and manly feeling of the author, render the volume as agreeable as it is instructive. We mu^t qualify this high praise of Mr. Moffitt's work, however, with the wish, that it had contained less of the jargon which characterizes the vulgarest kind of pious wt icing. Wc would gladly have dispensed also with the pretence to the gift of miracles, disguised though it be, under the spccioiH name of effectual prayer. " Prayer was soon answered, and the heavens, xvhich had been as brass, were covered with clouds, thc thunders rolled, and rain fell like a torrent. The display of divine condescension," eVe. Condescension is the great virtue of little people : it springs out ofthe contest between pride and meanness. It is of mortal origin?one of the offspring of expediency, and cannot, without great presumption, be called an attribute ofthe divine source of eternal and unchangeable truth. Apropos of this miracle, xve must not omit a smart repartee of a Heehuana rain-maker,?and the Hechuanas are allowed on all bauds tobe vigilant observers and shrewd reasoners. "In ri ply," says our author, '"to nonie of my remarks, he said, ' It is only wiso men J that o in bo rain-makers, for it requires very great j wisdom to deceive so many,' adding, i tjait and, I Lu,rn- I hut.' " There aro noxv several missions established anion.:' the lie elm nias, from xxhieh people, cullxvi te! and iineoiu e itt il, tho Missionaries gonerally meet with friendship and respect, Ofthe ri.-ing gem ration ol' native.-, many road tho Sciipturos in th-.ir own language, and .-onie haxe ' adopted European clothing.

If the dromedary were introduced into South Atiea, xvhich might be oa.-ily and advantageously dune, the resources of travellers on those dry plains would be greatly increased. How far the Sichuana language, as spoken by the Hatlapis, may extend northwards, j or be understood, we cannot venture to assort, j though we heliexe it to reach a long way; but. we have no doubt that ono th.noughly aeipiainted with it would have little difficulty in making himself understood hythe nations speaking kin- : drcd languages lom) miles to the north, near the I confines of Angola on the west, or on the shores ofthe groat lake called Nya.ssi towards the east, i This xve say with confidence, founded on tho I careful comparison of-ix grammars and about fifteen vocabularies of dilferent languages of llie family in ipiestion. To the race speaking those languages belong probably two-thirds of the shu es exported from Africa, or nearly all taken by tho lVruiguosi- and by the Arabs of Muskat. When this..' circumstances are ail duly xveighed, it can hardly be denied, that tlie Heehuana country is the (piarler whence xve have the best chance of exploring Africa, vf cix ilizing Africa, and, by attacking the enemy in tho re ir, of rescuing that devoted continent tioui the oppression with v. hiiii it luis been solong afflicted. If our views on this subject bo correct, then it xviii bo hard to rate too highly the importance of the Heehuana Missions.

MUSIC AND DRAMA. EXETER hIALL. iNo vocal artist in the memory of the l)resent generation attained such rapid and extraorlinary Ipopularity as Jenny Lind. When we chilly islan(lers read of the enthusiasm with wvhich she was received oln the Continent, such as rending sheets and counterpanes into infinitesimal parts, so that each worshipper miglht have a relic, however small , duels for thre posscssiun of one of her cast-off slipperrs or (discarded ribbons, we could only wonder at the difference between foreigners and ourselves, and never supposed for a moment that we could be guilty of such idolatry; but no sooner did Jenny Lind ap)ear on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, than an intuitive and enthusiastic appreciation of her genius seemed to possess everybody, and it wvas nmanv minutes erc she uttered a note, in consequence of thle hoisterous and continuous welcQ1mCe with vlich llsue Nvas greeted. Perhaps our enthusiasm was not so fanciful or theatrical as that of our Continental brethren, but certainly it ivas quite as intense. Such a foregone conclusion as this rcception argued, would hivtv been too weighty for a second-rate artist, and then revulsion of feeling would hlave been sudden and unmerciful ; but fronm first to last during her appearances in England the public. never doubted its idol, and when in Is.-)(; it vas suppnosed that she had retired into l)rivate life, the regret w~as all but universal. 'Many reasons are assigned for her re-appearance in public, but wve fancy the truth is that. havinl l)been appreciated so fully and so universally, the nadmiration alike of palace anl cot, she findts private life Moimnewhas l of a p)rislon, a golden cage fronm which she would gladly escape.

The tirst chorns, " Help, Lord!" went steadily, and with great volume atnd tone, giving good assuralce also in that quarter. Fortunately, Mr. Sims Reeves was never in better voice, and the Recitative " Ye people, rend your I liearts," and the following, Aria, -If with all Your hearvs w vere given wvith a delicacy and feeling that I it wvould be ditlicult to surpass. We need not, iowever, enter into de!tails. As Madame Goldschmidt wvas tre great attraction (f the evening, it is with I her performance that Aw have chiefly to deal. The "Andante agitato" whijil introduces her first solo, caused inuch excitemeit, and1 her first sentence, " What have I to do with thwe, 0 man of God ?" was declaimied with a clearness of aiticulation and freshness of voice, that proved her possession of all the excellence for which she is so renowned. In the quality and quantity of tone, she is unchanged; she possesses the samne energy. gives the samne exquisite colouring and contravt of faeling. the same irreproachable style. Many great art its have e-ayed thje part of the 1l iobo' with success in this or thai: portion. of tho music, hut we (1o not reienmber ',ne who goes through the oratorio with such uniform nexcellence. Even in the trio *' Lift thine eyes," which has been so generally successful, Mine.

Fromn leginning to end, the perdornlancc \vas a great success, and reflected no small credit on the conductor, M~r. Goldschmidt. lie has many qualities requisite for a couductor, hut in some respects wants experience. At a pause, where the instruments and voices are to inelt, as it were, into silence, and an indication has to lbe given after a time that all shall cease, his movement for silence was invariably a violent jerk, which had the effect of a sfi:orzndo on the attentive observer. In the Recitative he gave no sign of the conuunencement of bars, and only beat when the chord had to he given. These are minor faults, but faults they are. His mechanism of the b:iton in level beating is unembarrassed and intelligible. It had. been his intention to make serious changes in the time tat which some movements are generally taken. This was a mistake. For a new conductor to upset the traditions of our orchestra is a dangerous experiment. Those who have learnt ` Elijah" under Mendelssohn and Costa, arc not inclined for change, and if they were, habit would be a great barrier. At the rehearsal many changes were resolved ulpon, but at the performance they nearlv all vanished, and the conductor was fairly caried away by the stream. Nevertheless. if NMr. Goldschmidt is inclined to conduct, and is willing to learn for a time instead of to teach, he is likely to attain a high position as conductor. The Hail was filled in every part, even the back of the orchestra being lined with listeners. In accordance with the spirit of charity which has marked Jenny Lind's career, the whole of the receipts rie given to aid, the funds for the coml)letion of a church, and the enlar-emient of industrial institutions, "over the Border." ROYAL ENGLISH Oi'ERA. COVENT GARDEN. I TIoaril ;lover's long-expjecu 'd opera, ' IRuy ilas," wa;Is pJroduced onl Thursday, with a strength of cuit alnd colI)letelle;s of detail at least e(qulal to anlthing p)reviously producedl. 1There has been con:'idi'rable specuilation as to tht vapacitv of M\r. lNver to sustahi the mitusical initvr'4 of a; serious oi'ra, his antecedents offering little on which to fer:ni a judgment. l'is cantata, *Tani (o' Shanter." a- .!red somne that success was certain ; but others. 1 *. tresting. e' usidered thatt a composer inigilt suc.. ini a comparative fragment. yet utterly fail in it (comlletc work. All speculation is now set at iv.!. and to Mr. Howard (;lover must be assigned a niale amlongst our best operatic composers. The .rsi,,n of the story is tearln idcntical with that ol)ularized at the Princess's Theatre by Mr.Fechter. i\e hiave the neglected Q ie '4 *l j in (Miss Louisa Pvne), the cruel and intriguing l)o .Se alhist de IJ'tioau (Mr. Santley), the chivalrous but erring ],'a l/,is (M1r. Harrison). wuclicss d'.lterpie jae (Miss Susan Pyne), whose passion for court-etiquette reminds of Bcatri'c in the "Rose of Castillc" our old friend Don ('utscr ef' Bazan (Mr. St. Albyu), (.asilda, Maid-of-Honour to the Queen, Oscar, Page to the Queen (Miss Jessie M'ILean, a transatlantic imiiportation), and a long list of other charace.r: vith which we are inre or lcs ac'juniuLtedL. As wniiht be anticipated 1Rug Bl/s tinds au excellent repre- fi sentative in Mr. Harrison, whose histrionic ability t is quite equal to his vocal : ar dl Mr. Santley, in Dhu s, Slust, far surpasses any previous effort that he has d made on the stage. His scena in the first scene, n "My heart with rage is sweling," is a masterpiece of vocal declamation, whether in the hl/at) move- a ment with which it commences, or in the allyr'o, ( where his mortification and passion find full vent. k The scena is in itself highly dramatic. and the in- v strunental colouring is rich in the extreme. We a know of no artist who has attained iuch a rapid I knowledge of the stage as 'Mr. Santley, and as a Ih barytone he li.s -ery few rivals. 'he opera is h studded with gems that will delight publishers and tl public singers. Mr. Harrison has a scuna, ' Abahi- t tion's earlvgolden dreams had flown," which is sure iv to tin(l a majority of sympathizers : and shortly t, after, a ballatd, Beside her lattice every night.- Y which is sure to become popular. Miss l'yne. also. a is well supplied with charuning melodies. Aria aml. s ballau succeed each other perhaps too rapidly; but t if so, tbe fault can he easily remedied. The aria, I "In the stillness of night;" bailadL- A trusty a heart ;" ballad, -Home of iny youth;" a sparkling s rondo, the title of which we forget; and several s other songs, all candidates for popularity. But it r is not alone the solo pieces that constitute Mr. t Glover's success. The concerted music, the finales I in particular, challenge the attention and criticism I of the learned andl intelligent musician. That he s has founded a new style, or produced a work of as- i tounding origiaiit, we are not prelpared to say; I but that he has produced an excellent opera, a credit to himself and to English art, we can assert without fear of contradiction. We have not space i to enumerate the various members in the opera, or to speak of the individual displays of the numerous i characters; but to sum it up, the performance re- ( flected great credit on nearly all concerned. Miss i Thirlwall, Miss Susan Pyne, Miss M'Lean, and Mr. i St. Albvn, deserve more attention than we can be- I stowv at present. Only in one thing were we dis- I appointed: the scene-painter was abroad, or, if not, 4 gave very faint signs of being at home. This is a I great mistake. If English opera is to hold its own, the armour must be all complete: it must not take the field like a palmer, with staff and scallop-shell for spear and shield. The band and chiors were, as usual, first-rate; and it is scarcelv necessary to add that Mr. Mellon's couducting left nothing. to criticize. LY(CUM. In pursuance of an agreement made before Mr. 1. Falconer became lessee of this house, the opera of ` 11 Trovatore " was given on Saturday by an Italian company, headed by Mille. Tietjens and Signor Giuglini. The house w\as filled in every part, including the stalls, to which four rows hadl been added, and the iundience seemed delighted from beginning to end. No opera seems more relished bv all classes than ' II Trusatoe. In addition to the general interest of the story, that gradually developes and intensifies up to the vers end, every chiracter is made the most of hv librettist antd composer. This is refreshing, at a timine when nearly all drainatic pieces, operatic or otherwise, are written to display the capacity of one or two artists onlv. all other characters being toned down tto a level metdiocritv, through which no light can struggle. In 11 Trovatore" it would loe ditlicult to say which is the best character, Leomnw or AvIerevt, JanwioW) or uniti di Linea; and even the follower of the Cwta, 'e~rrn-do. has a most important scene to himself. Such an arrangement is much better for author, artist, manager, and publie. It was not to be expected that this home for Comedy could he metamnorphosed into a complete opera-house for one performance. but, on the whole. it was very respectable. The band was competent, the chorus motleratelv so, the scenery andt dresies not new, nor particularly applicable; but the principal artists mnade up by their excellence for the shortcomings, ,t minor accessories. The hibtoni vat in the experieneed hands of Signor Arditi. 'rhe ol onor of Miue. rietjens requires little comment, faxnilig.r as it is to the British public; andi on thic o'easion the ,leanties and faults of the imrersons tion were as prominent as usual. As regards titting voice and figure for the part, we have seen no superior, but tl the 'inging anti acting are unequal. In the first It scenat, the " Allegro giusto" loses character and |t dignity by the rapid rate at which she takes the ra movement ; whereas, in the last act, she delivers vt "D'Arnor sull' ali rosee" with a feeling, dignity, tf and richness of voice that has seldom been equalled. t. Giuglini's impersonation of Jlanriro is equally well III known. The heroic portion of the character is still ei wanting, but it would be difficult to surpass his li affection and tenderness for Azurewr or Lmeonoro. t' His flrst ronanza, "Peserto sulla terra," we should w have thought perfection, hadl he not chosen to ein- ei hellish Verdi's music *in two places, particularly in t} the last bar but one. No neludies uar Riorh sensi- w tive thila those of Verdi, in this respect. 'To alter li is to destroy. No dotubt it is very enticing for any t} tenior, who has the power, to give out an upper C 13 flat, and secure extra apl)lause for that operatioti 1, alone; but Signor Giugliniii stinging of the exqui- n site romanza in questiou requires no such surrepti. ti tious aid. Signor Ferri 5bis first appearance in a: England) was the cosunt (d Luwi. This artist has c! a 'ine voice, and a fine personal appearauce for the bt stage, and evidently possesses much talent; but his N style is highly exaggerated, and although in man - tl ner tending to violence, his delivery is slow, and at ui the best points he is anticipated by the ear of the d1 listener. Ile mnay do much, and he has much to do. s' The l rrambd' of Signor Bossi was more than re- I spectable. Ile is at home on the stage, has a telling ( voice, and we trust to see him in a more prominent a position. The Azureci of Madame Caradori could t scarcely he called at success, although she was much o applauded. The voice, execution, and action were a all equal to singing the music, and personifying the a character; but it seems impossible for her tall com- ii mandting figure to give an idea of the wretched t careworn gipsv. That she can sing the music well, t nobody can deny ; but she looks more like a LJo- c nora in disguise, than A :ucena. The singers were 1 frequently called before the curtain in the course of s the performance to receive the applause of the au- 1 dience, anti the opera altogether gave general satis- i faction. I PRINCESS'S. Utnpalatable as it may be, antl little flattering to national prejudices, to confess that the best and most scholarly conceptions of some of the greatest characters in the plays of Shakespere that the present generation has witnessetl havo been presented us by a foreigner, candour and sincerity claim the avowal. It had been less startling to learn that in Gernmany, where our great bard is so profoundly studied, and whence we have had so much noble anti appreciative criticism upon his works, some keen exponent of his dramatic creations had arisen; liut it is in France. on the contrary, where the most hitter invective against his genius is only equalled in absurdity by the simulated and unmeaning adiniration wlhirh has succeeded it, thut we have found Lour best aiid most, pregnant conceptions of Othello and lmth,1t. Partisani enthusiasm may sneer at what has been called the parrot-crv of the press ts to the merits of Mr. Feclter's acting; anlt blind kadherents of stage traditions may stand aghast at the entire absence of all they haove been taught to atldmire, or dwell wvith disproportionate epllhllasis upolln thei jarrinfg effect of a foreign accent in Nvortls . and sylialales so thoroughly andi profoundly E:nglish. ilt fw wh ho listened with unprejudiceti ears to Mr. .Ie'htei's "thlV on Weduesday last could rise with r the impression that it is other than a work of true o geniuls. Mr. Fechiter's fllt11le't hald Shown ILus of r wvhat he was capable, but success in rendering the tphilosophic mioralizinigs of Jlntm/ i ui no wise ine plied a necessarily elqual suc-ess in the part altoe gether different of O)t/,,l. The contrast benveen the two characters is niarketl in the last degree. In the one, the disposition, naturally meditative antI phlegnxmatic, of the man, is roused and goaded into e action, against wllich every instinct revolts in the ir other, the fierce and hot-blooded temper of the soutth Is swells beneath a bosom tortured to agony by the is suggestions of his fiendish enemy, and the generous .e confiding soul of the Moor broodls over a vengeance t- which is as true to hiq instnicts as it is overpowering to his reason or his love. The one has the "scholar's Ld tongue " and a " noble and most sovereign reason the other is "rude in speech and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace." It would he an easy thing to multiply these instances of opposing, chlaracteristics. In b)t/iel/o, however, we think that the version of Mr. Fechter is in every respect. equal to that of Il/atk, and in almost every respect superior to those of either churacter which the stage has witnessed during many lustres past: that which preeminently distinguishes it from those to which we have been accustomed, is that it constantly flies III the face of and absolutely reverses all our mUst unworthily venerated stage traditions, and in almost every instance with our extorted approval. It is in the highest degree the Shakespere of the closet that we see, and not that of the stage. Who that has listened to the lachrymose whinings of Macready in the great scene of Otlddllo's justification, before the Council of Venice. of his mnarriage with Ih)sdo uImw, but has felt howv utterly contratr they were to the nlally spirit of conscientious rectitude which distinguishes that noble though "unvarnished tale?" and who has not at hundred times wished he could close his ears to the ; "sound and fury " which has bhei deimecd necessary to the entire character? With Mr. Feclhter this was entirely cast aside; and in the first two acts his temperate action received, we think, its highest compliment from the audience, in the fact that it was Iuqo who was summoned before the curtain, and not ()tl/ello. It is not tiU the third act that the character of Oth(i//o becomes the prominent one upon the stage, and the audience, which. is fully instructed as to the character and plans of Ian/{*, can see in Othe/lo only a noble nature, rich in its own contentment, and ignorant of the plot which is being hatched against it. That no applause greeted Othll o, then, in his performance of the first two acts, is but to say that the character was kept in proper subservience to the action of the drama. WVe have spoken so far of the conception of the character in its broad outline ; as regards the filling up, and those master strokes with which this glorious work of the divine bard is replete, we see much in Mr. Fecliter to a(lmire and much to'regret. In some respects, ats regards both outline and detail, his zeal for purification has carried him too far, and we feel an absence of the rich, sensuous glow of colouring which Shakespere has thrown over this masterly creation. OtIhello's agony in the last two acts we have always thought might be likened to that of a man in the hideous grasp of a serpent, as in the centre figure of the Laocoon. Closer and closer are the foul folds clinging to him, nearer and. nearer the venomed head is drawing to his. It is one long drawn-out death-agony of the soul, which was only in part represented by Mr. Fechter. At first, the manner in which he listened to the suggestions of Iargo, assenting to them without perceiving their drift, and the difficulty with which the idea of anV possible b)lot marring the perfect spotlessness of heIr he loved, was in the highest degree admirable ; then, vhen Iqif/ suggests, i She did deceive her father, marryinlgl you," you see in the sudden start of ti//llo that his mind reverts at once to the significant wvords of similar portent which had been her father's farewell, Look to her, Mtoor, if henimt hit eyve to gee lie hoas deceiveu Utir fatlihr, anild maly) the" 1" Then, and then only, the first pang of doubt throws its shadow upon that till then happy and noble life ; but that doubt once admitted, its progress to certainty is not long. (Otello's is a Inature of feeling, and not of reason, and the spark of jealousy finds but too much of intlaumfmmable on which to feed. The gradations of this progress are fully marked, and the calmnness but partially assumed with which he uttered the well-known discluinmer of his being moved, " Not a jot, lnot a jot," produced an overpowering sensation in lthe house. When, however, douht had resolved I itself into certainty, and his jealousy had overcome o every other feeling, then we think that Mr. e Feehter scarcely came up to our ideal. Ire II was occasionally abrupt and spasmodic, whereas e ! lt/l( Io's is a burning rage, a concentrated passion, is which steadily pursues his revenge, but, until the e onviction that his w ife is dead " gives him pause," is never fitful. The occasional bursts of tenderness which Othello manifests throughout the play, and which even in its later scenes occasionally over- ponver him, are renderedl with much force and truth a and the ilelivery of tlhe nlolol(lgue precedin`g the murder, ' It is thi calV ,e, it isi tile (ailse, i1i 1 ii, was harrowing. Another most effectivc point was the rendering of the few wvords in answer t( Jos You would be satisfied ?-- Woull(l ? na and I vill!" In speaking of Mr. Fechter's conception iif Othello, wo have to include as testifying its valnc a very great portion of the approbation that we have to bestow upon the other characters in the piece. The entire version, presentedl on Wednesday evening, is due to him. It is. as he owns, the result of twentv years' loving study, and is the boldest attempt at theatrical reform which the stage has witnessed. Scenery, action, grouping, accent, all are changed: und almost all for thle hetter: and even when our prejudices are most shocked, and our reason nmost perplexed, we are olbliged tu concede that there are sonile groundils for tle innovationi. The greatest gain consists in themiorenatural flow of the action, and the greater ease of the situation ; this gain is frequently very important; the disadvantages are that in sonic respects we think the intentions of Shakespere are not carried out. In the latter respect we protest strongly against the alteration that has been made, as regards the Willow song. In the original, the recurrence of Dcsdemomii to it is as pathetic as anything cal well be conceived, it is all instance of that strange sort of presentiment of approaching death which men love to conceive, and wbich Shakespere has so well known howv to employ, and it complements also admirably the preceding scene of most unutterablo pathos, where besdeiaiwaa so passionately protests her innocence, in terms that no heart could have resisted but that of the author of her wrongs, into whose cars she was pouring a tale, whose truth he well knew. In this instance, however, with erTing judgment this song is deferred to the fifth act. In this the bed-room of Dcsdotiona opens into a species of corridor overhanging the sea ; and while Ot/helo is musing uponl his intended action, the song is sung beneath as a species of lharcarole Again, at the c(lose of the last act, in the famous sp0 ccl, " Soft you, a word or two before you go," loq)o listens with a cvnical smile but at the wgords "I took him by the throat," Ot/cillo seizes upon him, and seems as about to plunge the dagger hito his breast, but, otl the contrary, stabs himself, while layo's countenance assumes an expression of horror. This is a daring innovation both as regards Of/ 1/, and leqo, but, we think, in both instances wrong,, and, as far as logo is concerned, false to nature; for not even the blood of his victim, which might without nuch stretch of imagination be supposed spurting over him, could for one moment quench the hate which had, till then, so relentlessly renioved every obstacle in his path. Further in this analvsis we cannot go. Mlr. Fechter has now publisilel all actinl' copy ('f " Othello," contain'iig time lmost elaborately minute details of the manner ini which, in his opinion, the play should be acted. To this book it is possible we may again recur; meanwhile, our liniits forbid us dwelling more at length upon this singular but interesting performance. We will only say of it that the deficiencies of Air. Fechter's pronunciation of English constituted a material drawback; that our coiscientious approval could not be given to all his alterations ; but that the gain to the audience, as regards the ease aimd probability of the action and situations, was almost as great as that we anticipate from the fearless and praiseworthy destruction of the old systenm of rant which Mr. Fechter has inaugurated. The sceie with Biweow and the hlanaerchief has been very properly restored. Mr. Ryder's lozgo was a far finer piece of acting than we supposed to be within that gentleman's reach. Miss Carlotta Leclerq's De sdemonu was beautifully tender; and Mr. Jordan's C'ssio, ir. Shore's lKderiyo, and Mliss Elsworthy's Enaelia, were all very finely played. We might allude to individual poiuts capable of improvement, but it would swell the limits of our notice to a disproportionate extent. Our readers must remember, too, that much of what is best in the acting of these subordinate characters is ats much duo to Mr. Fechter as anything in his own more prominent part. 'I'he scenery andtl drcsses were very beautiful; a:d of the applause, liberallvy bestowed upon all concerned, that accorded to MIr. Harris for the manner in which thle piece is put upon the stage is not the least deserved. On alternate nights with ` Othello," a new burlesque piece of nonsense, entitled " Po-ca-hontas." from the pen of 'Mr. Johli Broughamn, and in wvhichl ho assumes a prominent part, is being performned. It affords scope for parodies upon well. known operatic music and for characteristc dances, and will provide the spectator an hour's real amusement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roger Drake, Captain of Industry. By Henry Kitchell Webster. (New York, the Macmillan Company.) This is a much better story than its name led us to expect; a story out of the common, that one reads and thinks over afterwards. The hero, Roger Drake, is a successful miner, a controller of water power, of coal supply, of railway traffic, and makes an enormous fortune, which is his title to be "a captain of industry." His beginnings are comic. He is a young American gentleman who goes West to look for gold, and does not find it. When he is reduced to a silver-fitted toilet set he starts business as a barber, having never yet shaved any one but himself. The first attempts were rough on the customers ; but each victim brought in another:? ' They kept my shop full of people all day, for it was the best practical joke the town had had in six months, and by night I had learned how to shave and had about ten dollars in my pocket." After this he picks up a partner, one George Stanley, with some money, and a little later they find a very rich copper-mine. But the inevitable woman comes in?it is not a love story; but, having first engaged herself to Drake, she throws him over and engages herself to Stanley, whom she marries. The result is bitter enmity, which the woman aggravates as much as possible. It is this quarrel and the methods of it which make up the interest of the book. Each determines to get the other out of Red City; each determines that he himself will stay; and the struggle for the control of the railway and of the neighbourhood, of all the wealth and trade, is exceedingly well told and in a manner that seems realistic. If it is not ?and we cannot boast a personal familiarity with the analogues of Red City?it looks as if it might be: the men act and talk as men, and not as dressed-up dummies. In the end Drake comes out top, and he has vowed he will trample Stanley under foot; but meantime he has married a sweet little woman?the foil to the heartless jilt?who will not allow the enemy to be utterly crushed. So he disappears, and Drake is left, increasing in family and in wealth, and mayor of the contested city.

Historical Sketches and Personal Recollections of Man- chester. Intended to illustrate the progress of Public Opinion from 1792 to 1832. By Archibald Prentice Second Edition. Gilpin. The Life of Edward Baines, late M.P. for the Borough of Leeds. By his Son, Edward Baines. Longman & Co, The history of England in the present century will never be studied thoroughly by those who shall live after us unless we leave them local histories of the movements which have taken place in our chief provincial towns. For Manchester and Leeds, during a period in each case of about forty years, this is now done in the two volumes before us. They both contain the experience of men who were liberal in politics, and who, as newspaper editors, were sensitive to every influence exerted by the great world upon the little world of town immediately surrounding them. As materials for history, these two books have therefore a distinct value. As literary works they are both faulty. Mr Baines seems to know too little of book-writing, and *Mr Prentice possibly too much. We find Mr Prentice now and then taking more than necessary trouble to write well, and make his book effective. Mr Baines, on the other hand, seems to have troubled himself very hula about the selection of materials, and too much to have mixed the useless with the useful. His book is full ol valuable matter, but there is a want of tact and taste in itt arrangement. The religious experiences of his father,jot example, and the date of his spiritual conversion, cannot w considered due to the public; nor was it necessary i close the book with a series of testimonials to his wner worth, as though he had been a mere chiropodist, from ? Bawson of Leamington. Mr Hadfield of Manchester, w. We make this objection, however, purely upon mew; grounds.

C.JP1UUT.?Employed this day in bringing up arrears of correspondence, ?n taking exercise, and in reading and pondering over the copious Parliamentary bill of fare for the next week." The father-in-law of the late Mr Baines seems to have ^n " a character." We copy the sketch of him as given by bis grandson. Truly the old gentleman must have had a large capital invested in the bank of patience. Mr Talbot was a man of scrupulous conscientiousness, great learnjn, ant] unbounded perseverance. By trade he was a currier, but he retired from the business in consequence of the imposition of a new tu wh?cn he regarded as unjust. He was afterwards secretary of the kdi General Infirmary, which office he filled with rigid punctuality pd care for thirty-three years, till his death ; and it is characteristic of him that he died at the Infirmary, having persi.-ted in going there when dangerously ill to attend to his duties, and the effort bringing on almost immediate death. There was in his character and tastes a renerable simplicity. The Bible was his daily study. He was well verted in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages, and he himself formed more than one translation of the entire Scriptures from the oriana! tongues. He made and published an " Analysis of the Holy Bible, containing the whole of the Old and New Testaments, collected md arranged systematically, whereby the dispersed rays of truth are concentrated, and every scriptural subject defined and fully exhibited." This was a work of prodigious labour, and displayed much judgment. It illustrated a remark that once fell from him?'* I can honour any draft drawn upon the bank of patience." He was a great admirer of Paradise Lost; and it was one of his herculean, self-imposed tasks, to commit the whole of that magnificent epic to memory. He also wrote a translation of the Scriptures in English verse, and illustrated it, ingeniously but quaintly, by devices of his own. The Pilgrim's Progress was one of his favourite books. He was a devoted admirer of Nature, and would walk many miles to witness from some hill-top the rising of the sun. He wrote respectable blank verse. His temper ra not sociable, but he was very fond of children, and would unbend to join in their sports, and even to devise games for them. His spirit vat as independent as his perseverance was indomitable. He was indifferent to money, beyond the means of humble comfort. His religious tiews were evangelical; and so resolutely did he follow tlie dictates of his conscience, that had he lived in the days of the Reformers or early Puritans, he would in all probability have become a martyr. When Mr Baines was the accepted suitor of Miss Talbot, the match ns nearly broken off; for Mr Talbot had heard an evil report of the " Reasoning Society," and felt some doubts lest his intended son-inlaw might be apprehended under the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act! The fear may seem absurd, for assuredly there has seldom been a man less seditiously disposed, or more fully engaged with his own honourable pursuits. But the fact is mentioned as an illustration of those days of terror. Mr Talbot actually withdrew his consent from the marriage when it was just about to take place, and on no other ground than this. But the young people, having previously had his approval, did not feel themselves bound to sacrifice their happiness in consequence of an alarm which they knew to have no just foundation. They married on the 2nd of July, 1798, and Mr Talbot toon approved of the step, and took his son-in-law into favour. From Mr Prentice's volume we give some passages extracted from his account of a teted-ttle dinner with Jeremy Bentham: Half-past seven o'clock next evening found me sitting at a neatly*t-out and reclierchi dinner in Bentham's library, the single French tap shedding its broad light on the table, but leaving the books which lined the walls in a darkness visible. We sat on a platform ?ised about three feet from the floor, and extending to within about three feet of the wall on each side. The space between the floor and di* platform I found was intended as a well to contain hot air?a wssian mode of heating apartments, recommended by Bentham's brother, Sir Samuel. The conversation of my host was light and pl*jful, but full of vigour, beautifully combining the wisdom of the <?ge and the simplicity and gaiety of the child. I expressed the pleasure I felt in observing that advanced years had not impaired bis jwfulness. ?* Sir," said he, *? I cultivate cheerfulness as a habit. ?wde?, I have the consciousness of having for sixty years endeavoured te promote the happiness of my fellow-men, and why should I be ****** than cheerful ?
