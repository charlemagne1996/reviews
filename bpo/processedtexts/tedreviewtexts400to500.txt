James Gordon's Wife. NOVELS OP THE WEEK. 3 vols. (Hurst <fc I Blackett.) Hero Trevelyan. By G. M. Craik. 2 vols. (Low & Co.) The author of 'James Gordon's Wife' has succeeded by sheer cleverness of writing in making readable, and occasionally really interesting, a story which in less able hands would probably have been insufferably dull; for, disguised as it is, these volumes are, and are meant to be, a sermon, the sin of intellectual pride being the text. Parts of the book, particularly the reflections of the hero on arriving at a true knowledge of himself, would read remarkably well in a discourse from the pulpit. There is nothing like cant in them, for cant is essentially insincere; and there is a straightforward sincerity about this writer which commands one's respect, even if its expression sometimes moves one's laughter. James (Jordon is a genius, who goes through Eton and Cambridge with great eclat, finishing his academical career as Senior Wrangler and First Smith's Prizeman. In short, he is an intellectual giant, and, being far from unconscious of his stature, he is not elated by the adulation of the pigmies among whom he moves. He sincerely believes himself to be born for great things, and deliberately sets himself to accomplish his mission. In the eyes of his elder sister, Olivia, hs is a demi-god, and worshipped accordingly; in those of his younger sister, Cicely, he is a prig; and we think most people would be inclined to agree with the latter. Despising love as a foe to intellectual advancement, he falls deeply in love with his cousin, Gabrielle Wynn, whom the death of her father has consigned to his guardianship, struggles desperately against the passion which he fancies is degrading him, but is, of course, worsted in the end, and she becomes his wife. The rest of the story is soon told. After a year of unalloyed happiness, Mr. Gordon, finding that his wife has become almost a necessity of his life, resolves to liberate himself from her thraldom, and, if possible, recover the selfsufficiency which he imagined to be his before he married her. The cold-blooded manner in which he addresses himself to this task, regardless, in his all-absorbing egoism, of the possible consequences to the woman whose absolutely unselfish devotion he thus repays, is cleverly and forcibly described. The unequal struggle, however, does not last long, and an attack of malignant scarlet fever, which leaves him physi- *jally blind, at the same time removes the scales which had darkened his spiritual eyesight. Intellectual pride is crushed and love is triumphant; the stoic has thrown his philosophy to the winds, and sits at the feet of his wife in the school of love. Here the book ends, too abruptly for those readers who are interested in Mr. Charles Godfrey and Cicely Gordon, both well-drawn characters?the latter perhaps a little over-drawn. Apart from one or two vulgarisms, which lady-writers seem unable to resist putting into the mouths of athletic young gentlemen from the Universities (such as " awfully down in the mouth," &c), the style of the whole book is far above the level of the average novelist, but it sins on the side of extravagance. Miss Craik's novel is remarkable, first, on account of its title, the quaint and certainly rather pretty name she has allotted to her heroine; and, secondly, for the adoption of the gossiping or confidential style, a proceeding which, on social grounds, we are inclined to resent. Whatever convenience or virtue may be latent in " I think " and " You know," the confidential method of telling a story seems generally a poor substitute for making the characters tell their own tale, and We prefer to base our estimate of them, in novels as in real life, upon their own words and actions, rather than to accept assertions about their character from a candid friend. Neither is an author presumably upon such terms of acquaintance with the public as to expect a ready response to her friendly overtures of intimacy. With this exception, and the grand defect of wasting her heroine coram populo with the unromantic malady of hipdisease, the story, such as it is, is fairly told. We learn how a fashionable young lady, much addicted to coquetry, and somewhat brusque in her style of repartee, is reduced by bodily infirmities to so gracious an attitude of mind as to accept thankfully the addresses of an admirer who plays Benedick to her Beatrice, and to whom she at first disdains to accord her heart. The gentleman, who is as rough a lover as the lady is a petulant mistress, begins with a strong aversion and contempt for the frivolity and coquetry of Miss Trevelyan. But when she is laid upon a sick bed and a long convalescence gives him an opportunity of observing her character, " swelling pity " does for him what it did for Duncan Gray, and the mutual antipathy between these results in a cordial attachment. There are some lay-figures of no interest who fill the subordinate parts, and this excessively domestic story is brought, within the modest space of two volumes, to an end where most writers would probably have thought of beginning. We may remark as another peculiarity which might be worth the notice of intending authors, tending to save much labour on both sides, that the reader whose imaginative powers have never been pandered to by any uncertainty as to the events recorded, is requested to supply that source of interest by " finishing the story as he likes." This suggestion might be indefinitely improved upon; a blank volume to be filled up as one chose would possibly be preferable to works of so slender a calibre.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A SUMMER IN SKYE* HAzirr once wrote an essay on " The Prose Style of Poets." We have forgotten the conclusion to which he came; but any on* accustomed to a critical examination of literature must be awwo that men who are born poets-not simply poets by adoption or caprice- men who have expressed themselves poetically in the first instance, and in prose oily secondarily,-acquire a certain stle which is almost peculiar to themselves. The habit of their minds is characterized by a degree of florescence not often observable in the mere prose-writer; their language has always rhythm and cadence suggestive of the measured harmonies of verse. We do not say that this is never to be found in authors who have not made themselves famous as poets: the examples of De Quincy and Ruskin might be quoted against us if we made such an assertion. But, on the one hand, instances such as those two writers-poets without the external form of poetry-are rare; and, on the other hand, we do not know of an instance in which a real poet, when writilig prose, did not carry into the tamer form of composition something of the glow and splendour of the more Wcred fire. The prose of Shakespeare, as we get it by fits and sarts in his plays, mantles with imagery; that of Milton is as stately, as rich, and as sonorous as a procession; while Spenser, even in treating of the most depressing and squalid of subjects, in his " View of the State of Ireland," cannot help quickening every here and there into touches of colour and picturesqueness, as a miserable alley will sometimes burn into warm hues of red-brown brick and scarlet tile beneath the alchemy of a summer noon. A awe of beauty, in some shape or other, belongs of right to the poet; and he contrives to extract it even from unlikely objects. Wut, then, may he not be expected to do when the subject which engages his thoughts, and forms the matter of his prose-disquisition, in in itself naturally susceptible of imaginative treatment ? At such moments he runs riot in his wealth. You feel that he can hardly refrain from singing; you perceive that the altar-flame is burning, though he is not in the temple, but in the outer world. This is peculiarly the case with Mr. Alexander Smith. He is a poet at all times. He can never free himself from the nervous excitability, the ultra-sensitiveness, the wayward moods of enjoyment and depression, the proneness to metaphor, and the love of rhythmical utterance, which are the inheritance of the born singer. His sentences almost fall into "lines," his paragraphs into stanzas. He over-lays his prose inch-thick with fringe and broidery of poetic gold. He abounds in illustration; he is always darting off into bye-paths of allusion and collateral thought; his commonest figures have a background that is uncommon and remote. It may be said that there is too much of this, and we do not deny that sometimes there i. After awhile, we are fatigued by the perpetual demand an our attention-by the endless succession of pictures. It is like being in a large gallery of paintings, or driving for miles through a rapidly-changiDg landscape. But this plethora is a genuine fule of thought and feeling-not the puf ness or white-swelling of a feeble degeneracy. The excess of imagery grows with a natural, though sometimes a rank, luxuriance out of the central idea; there A, Suamer in Bkye. By Alexander Smith, Author of "A Life Drams," &o. Two vols. London: ;Strhan. is no flashy addition of superficial ornament, stuck on for the sake of effect. The same thing was apparent in Mr. Alexander Smith's book of essays published about two years ago, and it is even mere obvious in the two volumes with which he now favours hii readers. Those volumes may seem extravagant to the purely prosaic mind; to all with poetical susceptibilities and understanding, they will appear a charming addition to the literature of home traveL Skye, and the other western islands of Scotland, are peculiarly adapted to call forth all the enthusiasm of a poet. Even Dr. Johnson, who was not a poet, and who thought Fleet-street worth any combination of mountain, lake, and moor, occasionally kindled into picturesqueness when describing his tour in the Hebrides, as Lamb, with his similar proclivities, did in writing to his friends about the gigantic crags and precipices keeping their stony watch and ward round Wordsworth's northern home. The utter loneliness of those scattered islets, " placed far amidst the melancholy main "-the division of their inhabitants from the rest of the world -the threatening waste of waters by which they are cut off-their sterility or reluctant vegetation-their shifting atmosphere of mists and storms-the primitive manners that prevail there, and the wild old legends that people with ghosts the hill-sides and the glens-all is in the highest degree poetical, and Mr. Alexander Smith is just the man to do full justice to his materials. He has admirable powers of description, reflecting landscape and seascape and cloud-scape on his pages with a painter's sense of form and colour, and a poet's sense of that undefinable something which lies beyond both.. He knows the historical traditions and the mythical legends which give a human interest to inanimate rock and moorland, and can enter thoroughly into the spiit of them. He is penetrated with a dramatic feeling for life and action, whether ia the past or the present; can call up the figures of old days in all their individuality and transient modes, or, with a few vital touches, bring before our eyes the modem sheep-farmer, or Highland peasant, or fisherman briny of the sea. ,He has an eye, too, for the strange, pathetic mystery of brute existence; and no movement of oxen on the mountain, or sheep in the green valley, or eagle on the crag, but be observes and records it. Humour is not wanting to his portraitures where humour is necessary to complete the picture; and through all runs that strange, deep, inner sense of death, and evanescence, and the mystery of our mortal state, which we have before remarked as a characteristic at Mr. Alexander Smith's writings, melting like some univesal solvent, description and reflection, humour and pathos, the pas and the present, the natural and the supernatural, grey Hebridean peaks and restless sea, bare heaven and cloudy rack, into one tone of melancholy wonder and half-doubting faith. Something of the dim oppression. and misty weirdness of the Northern land seems to have passed into the author's style. We catch' the outer moan of the ocean that bathes the pole, and hlf believe in second sight. Previous to setting out on his summer tour in Skye, Mr. Alexander Smith gives us a singularly vivid picture of Edinbuth. In a few incisive sentences, he scores the northern metropolis on the reader's mind: "1 Living in Edinburgh there abides, above all things, a sens of its beauty. Hill, crag, cstle, rock, blue stretch of sea, the picturesqUe ridge of the old town, the squares and terraces of the new-them things seen once are not to be forgotten. The quick life of to-day sounding around the relics of antiquity, and oversabdowed by the august traditioDs of a kingdom, makes residence in Edinburgh MoMs impressive thau residence in any other Brigsh city. I havejustoome in-surely it never looked so fair before? What a poem is that Prrices-btreet! Tbe puppets of the busy, many-oolocred houl mov about on its pavement, while across the ravine Time has piled up the old town, ridge on ridge, grey as a rocky coast wshbed and worn by the foam of centuries; peaked and jagged by gable and root; windowed from basement to cope; the whole surmounted by St Giles's airy crown. The new is therb looking at the old. Two Times are brougbt face to face, and are yet separated by a thousaid years. Wonderful on winter nights, when the gully is filled with darkness, and out of it rise, apinst the sombre blue and the frmty sars, that mass and bulwark of gloom, pierced and quivering with innumrable lights. There is nothing in Europe to match hat, I thiahk. Could you but roll a river down the valley it would be Aublime. Fine tl to place one' s-tf near the Burs Monument and look toward the Castle. It i. more astonishing than an Eatem drem. A city up before you painted by fire on night. High in air a bridge at lights leaps the chasm; a few emerald lamps, like glow-worms we moviDg silently about in the railway station below; a solitary criamm oue is at rest That ridged aim chiuneyed bulk of blacknes, wi spies dour bursting out at every pore, is the wonderful oid town, wbhre Soottish history mainly transacted itself; whil, opposite, the modem Princes-street is blazing throughout its length. During the day thO Castle looks down upon the city as if out of another world; seton with all its peacefuless, fts garniture of tres, its slopes of gprm The rock is dingy enough in colour, but after a shower its loheo laugh out greenly in tbe returniDg iun, while the raiabow is brightening on the lowering sy beyond. How deep the shadow which the Castle throws at noon over the garden at its feet where tbh childrn play! How grand when giant bulk and towvery crown blacken spinst sunset ! Fair, too, the new town sloping to the sea. Fro George street, which crowns tbe ridge, tbe eye is led down sweeping street of stately architecture to the villas and woods that fill the lower ground, and fringe the shore; to the bright as belt of the Forh with its smoking stemer or its creeping sl; beycud, to the ebOreS of Fife, soft blue, aud floked with fleting shadows in the keen cler li0t of spring, aark purple in the summer heat, tarnished gpld in tM autumn baze; and farther away still, just distinguishabl oR th p.1 sky, the crest of some distant peak, carrying the imagination into the illimitable world. Resideuce in Edinburgh is an education in itself. Its beauty refiuies one like being in love. It is perenniallike play of Shakespeare's. Nothing can stale its infinite variety." The author, however, can see the squalor as well as the beauty of Edinburgh, and describes the Cowgate, with its decayed old houses and its drunlken Irish, as well as Princes-street and the Castle. And, though himself a Scotchman, he is entirely free from Scotch prejudices, and soundly takes his countrymen to task for their narrowness in some mattcrs; their provincial jealousies, their unreasonable clinging to the past, and their eternal self-gratulation on the literary glories of forty years ago. We cannot, however, enter into this portion of the present volumes, but must without delay set sail for the Western Islands. Mr. Smith gives a most amusing account of his journey thither-of the inconveniences of Highland travelling, the uncertainty and treacherous dealing of Highland boatmen, the fickle smiles and too quickly recurring tempests of Highland seas and skies. At length, however, he and his companion arrived in Skye. Here is a glimpse of the scenery about Loch Coruisk: "We passed the farm-house, which, with the exception of a red-headed damsel, who thrust her head out of a barn to stare, seemed utterly deserted, and bent our steps towards the shore of the Loch. Rough grass bordered a crescent of yellow sand, and on the rough grass a boat lay on its side, its pitchy seams blistering in the early sunshine. Of this boat we immediately took possession, dragged it down to the am margin, got in our guns and provisions, tumbled in stones for ballast, procured oarg, and pushed cif. We had to round the great hill which, fiom the other side of the valley, we had seen breaking down into the sea; and as we sailed and looked up, sheep were feeding on the green shelves, and every now and again a white smoke of seabirds brst out clangorously from the black precipices. Slowly rounding the rocky bnttress, which on stormy days the Atlantic fillips with its spray, another headland, darker still and drearier, drew slowly out to sea, and in a quarter of an hour we had passed from the main ocean into Loch Scavaig, and every pull of the oars revealed another ridge of the Cuebullins. Between these mountain ramparts we sailed, silent as a boatful of sculs being conveyed to some Norse hades. The Cuchullins were entirely visible now; and the sight midway up Loch BSavaig is more impressive even than when you stand on the ruined shore of Loch Coruisk itself-for the reason, perhaps, that sailing midway, the mountain fornms have a startling unexpectedness, while by the time you have pulled the whole way up, you have had time to master them to some extent, and familiarity has begun to dull the impression. In balf an hour or so we disembarked on a rude platform of rock, and stepped out on the very spot on which, according to Sir Walter, the Braoe landed:'Where a wild stream with headlong shock Comes brawling down a bed of rock To mingle with the main.' Picking your steps carefully over huge boulder and slippery stone, you come upon the most savage scene of desolation in Britain. Conceive a large lake filled with dark green water, girt with torn and shattered precipices; the bases of which are strewn with ruin since an earthquake passed that way, and whose summits jag the sky with grisly splinter and peak. There is no motion here save the white vapour steaming from the abyss. The utter silence weigvhq like a burden upon you; you feel an intruder in the place. The hills seem to posses some secret; to brood over some unutterable idea which you can never know. You cannot foel comfortable at Loch Coruisk, and the discomfort arises in a great degree from the feeling that you are outside of every thing-that the thunder-splitten peaks have a life with which you cannot intermeddle. The dumb monsters sadden and perplex. Standing there, you are impressed with the idea that the mountains are silent because they are listening so intently. And the mountains are listening, elae why do they echo our voices in such a wonderful way P Shout here like an Achilles in the trenches. Listen ! The hill opposite takes up your words, and repeats them one after the other, and curiously tries them over with the gravity of a raven. Immediately after, you hear a multitude of skyey voices. 'Methinks that there are spirits among the peaks.' How strangely the clear strong tones are repeated by these granite precipices! Who could conceive that horror had so sweet a voice! Fainter and more musical they grow; fainter, sweeter, and more renote, until at last they come on your ear as if from the blank of the sky itself. M1'Ian fired his gn1, and it reverberated into a whole battle of Waterloo. We kept the hills busy with shoutb and the firing of guns, and then M'Ian led us to a convenient place for lunching. As we trudge along something lifts itself off a rock-'tis an eagle. ee how grandly the noble creature soars away. What sweep of wings! What a lord of the air! And if you cast up yonr eyes you will see his brother hanging like a speck beneath the sun." A little further ODn we come aross a reminiscence of Johnson and Boswell: "At last I came to a confused pile of stones, near which grew a solitary tree whose back the burden of the blast had bent, and which, although not a breath of wind was stirring, could no more regain an upright position than can a round-shouldered labourer on a holiday. Thtt coilfuscd pile of stones was all that remained of the old house of Corachatachin. I wandered around it more reverently than if it bad been the cairn of a chief. It is haunted by no ghost. So far as my knowledge extends, no combat ever took pi"o on the spot But there Boswell, after Dr. Johnson bad retired to rest, in company with some young Highland bloode-ah, me ! their rerv grandchildren must be dead or gray by this !-browed and quaffid five gigantic bowls of punch, with what wild talk we can fancy; and the friend of the ' Majestic Teacher of Moral and Rtel 6i)uS Wisdom' went to bed at five in the morning, aud awoke with tha he1adoache of the reprobate. At noon the doctor burst in with the exclamation, 'What, drunk vet ?' 'His tone of voice was uot that of sovore upbraid. ing,' writes the penitent Bozzy, 'so I was relievted a little.' Did they fancy, these young men, as they sat that night and drank, that a hundred years after people would writr of their doings ?-that the odour of their punch-bowls would outlive themselves? " Some admirable old legends are told by Mfr. Alcxander Smitha few in verse at the close of the first volume; and the history of the islands, with its long array of Celtic and Norwegian chieftains, is picturesquely touched on. The native superstitions are also related with that poetic appreciation which is as strong in its way as absolute belief in their truth; and the book abounds in passages which tempt the reviewer to the pleasing luxury of quotation, but which nevertheless we must pass over-at any rate until next week, when we may avail ourselves of a few more of these pictures from the North. In the meanwhile, we commend the work to holiday tourists as one of the most delightful bo)ks in the pleasant department of topography with which we have made acquaintance for a long while.

NOVELS OF THE WEEK. Greifenstein. By F. Marion Crawford. 3 vols. (Macmillan & Co.) Saved as by Fire. By Eleanor Mary Marsh. 3 vols. (Hurst & Blackett.) For a King ! a Historical Romance. By T. S. Sharwood. 2 vols. (Burns & Oates.) The New Eve. By Mr. Randolph. 2 vols. (Spencer Blackett.) The Belvidere; or, the Warning Maiden. By W. Dwarris. (Digby & Long.) Mr. Marion Crawford is not unlike other rather successful novelists if he is aware that he need not any more trouble himself about art and taste. He is quite right, too, in being fearlessly dull. The first volume of 'Greifenstein' will perhaps try the patience of the most faithful reader to a dangerous extent, but the second will set things right by the liberality with which deaths and horrors are provided in it. An exacting taste likes its mental food better cooked and less strongly flavoured, but the mysterious body of readers who maintain a novelist's popularity will no doubt be well suited. It seems idle to point out exactly how * Greifenstein ' fails in the essential qualities of a good novel; to a successful novelist it is only essential that the mass of readers should be satisfied. Nor is Mr. Crawford's continued success a fact wholly to be regretted. It is one of the indications of the spread of some sort of a taste for reading, and in times when demand is brisk the quality of the supply tends to deteriorate. Relatively the rate of deterioration is slow, and Mr. Crawford supplies a not unwholesome commodity. In ? Greifenstein' he gives a great deal of information which would not be assimilated in any other form. In the working out of his plot he displays plenty of ingenuity of invention, but a plot which gives legitimate scope for this faculty should depend upon one or both of two things. Either the story should by the nature of its origin depend wholly upon circumstance, or the characters should at starting fill the reader's interest, and so support the plot. But' Greifenstein ' is didactic and mechanical. The scene is laid in Germany, and the first volume contains a good description of the Black Forest and a very elaborate account of student life, and especially duelling. At once irreproachably moral and rapturously sentimental, ' Saved as by Fire' will prove welcome reading to those who cannot bear realism. Here poetic justice is meted out with unstinted liberality. The artist lord is united to the young lady whom he addresses as " Humming-bird." The virtuous, but slightly vindictive baronet weds the daughter of the woman whom he had long pursued with relentless hate. Jack Markham's betrothed, it is true, is carried off by consumption what time the jocund birds "were carolling over their morning toilet." But Jack Markham has his reward, for the father of the consumptive lady leaves him twenty thousand pounds. And besides, Jack Markham was only a commoner. The gratuitous exuberance of the author's style may be illustrated by the following extract (Miss Marsh is describing the personal appearance of the virtuous, but slightly vindictive baronet):? " Those who profess to see most character in the nose would have been disappointed, for that prominent feature was of no distinct type. Neither Grecian, nor Roman, nor aquiline, one could only say it blent in with the rest of the face, sufficiently marked without being obtrusive." ' Saved as by Fire' is eminently feminine in conception and execution. It savours of base ingratitude to find fault with a writer who is such a firm believer in the existence of chivalry, but Miss Marsh's novel would have been the better for the introduction of a bold bad man among her dramatis persona. ' For a King!' is a creditably constructed story of the earlier days of King Charles's stormy reign. It has not, perhaps, anything particularly vital and lifelike about it, yet for young people of discreet taste it should be good reading, and this though the imaginary element is less interesting than the historical. Prince Rupert's character and chequered career, and the uncertainties, inconsistencies, and misfortunes of Digby, are well enough presented. The dialogue is careful, measured, somewhat rigid, and not at all vivid or illusive ; the love affair is mild and rather " dragging." So painstaking a writer should have known better than to change the colour of her heroine's hair so often. Ebon, brown, and auburn sound too contradictory, especially at a time when the colour of hair was more a " fixed quantity" than it is now. It is impossible to deny that there is an unpleasant kind of skill and intrepidity about certain parts of ' The New Eve,' or that, while it is often disagreeable to the point of being disgusting, it is actuated by a real, if somewhat vague idea of "doing good." What merit it possesses is, however, lessened by a want of concentration and purpose. As to its literary and artistic qualities it is rather mixed. There are occasional clevernesses in the way of description and character drawing, though they, too, are spoilt by a want of inevitableness, and a strangeness of handling; for? whatever else the story may or may not be ?it is certainly not quite on the lines of the common novel. Why it should (in some bitterness of spirit) be dedicated to the "young person " rather than to the young wife does not appear. The beginning? the summer night and the two young creatures alone in it?has some delicacy of touch and sentiment; unfortunately, as it turns out, it has " nothing to do with the case." For long one expects that the new Eve, a baleful and yet contemptible person, is to be the old love in new guise; but this idea has to be abandoned. There is, therefore, nothing to explain or excuse the woman's sudden infatuation for the hero, unless her amorous propensities?to use a mild term ?are their own excuse. The forbearance of her lover towards her becomes painful, strained, and not convincing. Most of the people in the story have a mania for addressing one another as " my dear man " or '* my dear woman," as the case may be, and t becomes tiresome. The " improved " telephone is once more awkwardly dragged in to serve the purposes of fiction as an unraveller of crime. The moral of ' The Belvidere ; or, the Warning Maiden,' tends to show young ladies the danger of making far-away midnight appointments with bold bad majors or others, lest haply burglars should arrive o' nights and find them " wanting." Miss Laura Leigh did this with a view to ridding herself of her former lover, a certain Major Dunbar, and marrying his cousin. To account for her untimely absence she pretended that she had been sleeping the sleep of the just on a garden chair all the time her unhappy parent was being bound, gagged, and robbed in their charming and rustic retreat. But a tangled web awaited Laura. A burglar, moved by "private pique,'' rose up and slew the major, and the innocent fair-haired Laura was credited with the crime. A subterranean passage to the sea and the help of a friendly burglar favoured her escape, however, and brought her in safety to London. Not to further reveal the interesting adventures of this lighthearted heroine (who, disguised in walnut juice and a dark wig, finds a ready refuge in a family of nouveaux riches), we may say that so far as she is concerned all ends well, in spite of the apparition of the family ghost, thrown in (amongst other things) for no other object apparently than to cheer and amuse the reader.

BDli'bcarmrs Keys and other Stories. By Miss Thackeray. In One Volune. Smith, Elder, and Co. Miss Thackeray's last volume is a collection of four _kories-all well-known fairy-tales, very cleverly and gracehilly rationalised. Bluebeard is metamorphosed into an Italian marchesa, and Fatima into a little penniless English girl at Rome, who thinks the marquis a "catch; " but who, on discovering his skeletons in the cupboard, changes her mind and dissolves the engagement. Jack, of the renowned Beanstalk, is a clever young English farmer with advanced Liberal opinions: the beanstalk being his life's upwvard career; the ogre. his cruel Conservative landlord: and the golden harp, which he eventually carries off, his landlord's lovely daughter. Miss' Thackeray is mistress of the art of scenic representation. No scene upon a stage could be representEo more vividly than that in " The White Cat." the last story in the volume.

Fiction. The Amateur Cracksman. By E. W. Hornung. (Methuen & Co. 6s.) The modern story of crime, its detection or its perpetration, wherein the leading factor is ingenuity of plot, probably deserves more critical attention than it has hitherto received. It may not be the highest development of fiction, but it is a form of literary art?or rather, to be cautious, there is no reason why it should not be a form of literary art. Three things are necessary, so G. H. Lewes has told us, to good literature?vision, sincerity, and (^esthetic beauty. Now no one would deny that the Sherlock Holmes series, for example, has both vision and sincerity; Dr. Conan Doyle " realises" intensely, and his best work is obviously and thoroughly sincere. That his outlook is narrow, and his characters crudely conventionalised, is beside the point, for all art is narrow when compared to life, and all art must be more or less conventional; without convention one could not have form. Where Dr. Doyle and his imitators fall short is in the quality of aesthetic beauty, of which most of them seem to have not the slightest perception. It must be said, however, for Mr. E. W. Hornung that his book does disclose a certain feeling for beauty. His search for the precise epithet is sometimes quite successful, and all his stories have a gracefulness of contour not often to be observed in this species of work. Mr. Hornung is avowedly an imitator (or shall we say a " flatterer" ?) of Dr. Doyle. Yet he has his originalities. His hero, A. J. Raffles, possesses, it is true, the Sherlock Holmes attributes; but he uses them for the commission of crimes, not for their punishment. Of course, he was not "really" a criminal?only an amateur, though an amateur who could meet and beat most professionals. He had a code of honour, and stuck to it; otherwise he would have been impossible as a hero. " We shall have our work cut out," was all I said. 44 And do you suppose I should be keen on it if we hadn't?" cried Raffles. "My dear fellow, I would rob St. Paul's Cathedral if I could, but I could no more scoop a till when the shop-walker wasn't looking than I could bag the apples out of an old woman's basket. Even that little business laat month was a sordid affair, but it was necessary, and I think its strategy redeemed it to some extent. Now there's some credit, and more sport, in going where they boast they're on their guard against you. The Bank of England, for example, is the ideal crib." And so on, till all ono's notions of right and wrong are turned topey-turvey. A. J. Raffles is successful in all his little affairs till the last one, when a grim Scottish detective, who has shadowed him throughout, brings him up all standing. The "amateur" escapes with his life from a precarious position, and probably Mr. Hornung's intention is that at a future date he shall renew his doubtful activities. The book is distinctly a good one. It is perhaps inferior to its exemplar in that wealth of corroborative detail which convinces, and that ingenuity of weaving which enthrals, but, on the other hand, it has a lightness and brightness which Dr. Doyle never attempted.

The Athenaeum  : 4230 639 - 640
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nadir Shah. By Sir Mortimer Durand. With Illustrations. (Constable & Co.) Sir Mortimer Durand has fallen between the proverbial two stools. He has written a biographical romance which is at once too romantic to be a real biography, and too biographical to be a true romance. He confesses that he adopted this form " after some doubt," because he found that " the existing accounts of Nadir Shah, whether Persian or European, are hardly the material from which exact history could now be written." No doubt " exact history" is rarely to be deduced from eighteenth-century Persian or any other chronicles; but a tolerably accurate biography of the great Turkman conqueror might have been compiled, which would at least have proved a useful contribution to history, and would have been valued by students, and even by Orientalists, to whom Sir Mortimer Durand's Persian scholarship is known. To such the present work, without a single reference to original authorities, is of little interest beyond showing the conception of Nadir Shah's character and career which an able man, formerly resident in Teheran, and acquainted with the Persian sources, has formed. Even this has too much of the obvious in it, and offers scarcely any originality. We accept unreservedly Sir Mortimer Durand's assurance that his story is not " inconsistent with known facts," and that he has done his " best throughout to treat known facts with proper respect" ; but since " this book does not pretend to be a history," there appears to be no obligation to treat it with proper respect from the historical or biographical point of view. Taken merely as a romance founded upon history, with the design of giving " more life and colour " to the story of Nadir's career, the work suffers from over-learning. Most of the romances in which the manners and modes of thought of the East and its " local colour " are sought to be imparted have been failures. There are very few who possess Mr. Marmaduke Pickthall's happy gift; and though Sir Mortimer knows Persian and has been fairly intimate with upper-class Persians, we doubt if he knows the people as, for example, Prof. Browne knew them when he lived amongst them, or if he can think in Persian as Mr. Pickthall thinks in Arabic. The result, in the present case, is that the reader, who is probably unfamiliar with Persian ways, is annoyed by frequently occurring words which he cannot understand, and requires a glossary, which is not supplied ; the romance is burdened with archaeology, and the action hampered by an attempt at historical accuracy which nevertheless leaves the reader unconvinced. Those who are already interested in Nadir Shah will read this romance of his life with appreciation, but not because it is romance. Those who know nothing about him or his time will be perpetually puzzled and irritated. It is not the business of romance to teach history, and the mistake here made is not so much the founding of the romance upon an historical basis as the choking of the romance by too elaborate an historical setting. The long accounts, for example, of Nadir's campaigns have nothing to do with romance, and are merely digressions, perfectly justifiable, and indeed necessary, in a biography, but out of place here. The subject, we admit, lends itself to treatment as a novel or as a drama. The rise of the Turkman robber chief from obscure poverty to w ide empire?wonderful though not unparalleled in the East, the land of opportunities ; the spoiling influence of success, and the growth of arrogant ruthlessness under the sun of too favouring fortune; the alienation of the affections of the people, and finally the army, by frequent acts of irresponsible injustice and barbarity, culminating in the blinding of his son; and the inevitable downward path pointed out by offended Nemesis, ending in the longforeseen assassination?here are the makings of a tragedy. Sir Mortimer Durand has realized this clearly enough, and has drawn the character of Nadir with insight ; but he is always taking our attention off the main subject?an interesting, though not very unusual psychological study?to carry us away to campaigns and marches in places with outlandish names (outlandish at least to the majority of readers), which could have been sufficiently indicated by a few allusions, without interrupting the development of the story. The real romantic interest centres not in Nadir, but in the beautiful, tender Rajput girl whom he made his bride in India when he was crushing the Mogul emperor. Here Sir Mortimer is fairly in the realm of romance, for whatever truth there may be in Nadir's marriage to an Indian wife, the story of her relations with the conqueror could never have been divulged. But the introduction of Sitara and her devotion gives the book its chief merit as a romance, and also a real charm. The Indian girl is admirably drawn?drawn with knowledge as well as sympathy. The inevitable contralto to Sitara's soprano, the Shirazi wife? a particularly hateful character?rests on surer historical foundations, for Sir Mortimer had traditions of her related to him by a Persian Minister, who had them from one who had known her second husband. Residence in Persia does not tend to exalted opinions of the people, and we do not advise Persians of either sex to apply to Sir Mortimer Durand for j a character. We cannot recommend the book to novel-readers pur sang. They will find it tedious, in spite of some charming?and some rather realistic?harem scenes. The landscape and the historic durbars and the military surroundings are well done; yet all the time we feel ourselves, not in Persia of the eighteenth century, but rather in the Persia of Nasir-ud-din Shah, and that is not the feeling the author designed.

The Story of a Kiss. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. 3 vols. (Bentley & Son.) The Government Official. 3 vols. (Same publishers.) Garrison Gossip gathered in Blankhampton. By John Strange Winter. 2 vols. (White & Co.) Beyond the Seas: being the Surprising Adventures and Ingenious Opinions of Ralph, Lord St. Key ne, told and set forth by his Cousin, Humphrey St. Keyne. By Oswald Crawfurd. (Chapman & Hall.) Too Curious. By Edward J. Goodman. (Bentley & Son.) In his Grasp. By Esmo Stuart. (Allen & Co.) The author of 'A Horrid Girl' has taken up her parable again to tell of a pretty, and delicate, and pure-minded young woman, Genevra Farquhar by name, whose life romance begins early in her teens, and begins, contrary to all precedent, with a kiss from a perfect Sir Galahad. Needless to say that this inversion of the ordinary course of things is only brought about by accident?at any rate by an accident. The heroine is pitched out of a carriage upon the roadside, and Sir Galahad forgets himself so far as to kiss her on the lips. She is aroused by the action, and, being a fiery young woman in her way, burns with indignation at the affront till nearly the end of the third volume. Nothing, of course, could have been more effectual, and her lover steadily does his best to prove that he is not so bad as Genevra's fancy painted him. Mean time this' Story of a Kiss'?or, more strictly speaking, of kisses?proceeds daintily enough, for it pursues the fortunes of other estimable people, old and young, whose characters are drawn with a careful hand. Novel-readers who love the company of subtle or violent malefactors must seek them elsewhere. They never so much as show their faces in the placid domain which is peopled by Jenny Farquhar and her friends. The author of ?The Government Official' is, or was, a surveyor of taxes. If his picture of the inside of a tax office is not greatly exaggerated, reforms are much needed. The book appears opportunely. Though Mr. Goschen's Bill has failed to get sympathy, it must have called attention to the methods of collection and assessment of the income tax, and possibly may have prepared some readers for details which otherwise would have been skipped. The author has quite enough skill as a novelist to enable him to touch such details. He has peopled the Liverpool office with a set of officials who neglect their duty in a most lifelike manner, and he has contrived to mix the public and private affairs of the principal characters so as to produce a story which, though it has not much incident, is yet so well related that it can be read with interest in spite of the unpromising scene of action presented by a tax office. Bankers, stockbrokers, accountants, and other prosaic personages have often found their romancer, but the author of' The Government Official' is perhaps alone as the novelist of the Queen's taxes. The lady who writes under the name of John Strange Winter has produced with marvellous rapidity a series of novels supposed to illustrate the social life of British cavalry officers. Apparently the other branches of the service are beneath her notice; at all events, cavalry is her5 only topic. The theme is not a bad one if properly handled by an author even superficially versed in the subject. But the writer of 'Garrison Gossip,' we unhesitatingly assert, is not thus qualified for her selfimposed task. She has about as much knowledge of what British cavalry officers say and do as might be possessed by a merman's daughter. The whole tone of the book is vulgar, and the male actors are simply a set bf lay figures. As to the women. they are, if possible, more silly and vulgar than the men. The whole book is, like its predecessors, a libel on British cavalry officers, and is out of place anywhere but in the pages of a penny dreadful. ' Beyond the Seas' is a tale of adventure of the seventeenth century. What with Cavaliers and Roundheads, soldiers of fortune in the Low Countries, Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean, the Spanish dominion in Sicily, the wiles of the Inquisition, and a dash of mysticism and magic, Mr. Oswald Crawfurd contrives to weave a tale which will fairly pass muster even in these days, when narrative is again beginning to hold its own against analysis. It would be unfair to Mr. Crawf urd to accuse him of conscious imitation; but it is safe to say that ' Beyond the Seas' would hardly have been exactly what it is if it had not been preceded by ' Treasure Island' and ' John Inglesant.' It has not the masterly and masculine English of the former work, nor the dreamy other-worldliness of the latter. Mr. Crawf urd hampers himself sadly with an archaic style, and the sententiousness of the worthy Humphrey St. Keyne is at times somewhat tedious. But the narrative of adventure is stirring, and the sea fights on the coast of Sicily are full of life and action. It is a pity, however, that the principal conflict of this maritime warfare should have been made to turn on an impossible physical occurrence. " It was the time," we are told, " of full or nearly full moon, but as she would rise an hour or so after midnight there was no help that way." This is not quite so bad as Mr. Rider Haggard's total eclipse of the sun which lasted for an impossible time, nor as Scott's sunset in the sea on the east coast of Scotland; but we live in an age of science, and even novelists, who, according to Mr. Besant, are the preachers and teachers of the age, might be expected to know that the moon at the full rises at or soon after sunset. On the whole we can recommend ' Beyond the Seas' to those who can read stirring adventure told in an archaic and not particularly attractive style ; but we may warn any such readers that they may safely skip Master Humphrey St. Keyne's account of his cousin's metaphysical speculations. Mr. Goodman's story points the moral of a couplet of Dryden's, which warns mankind against the folly of seeking to know future events. The narrator dreams, or supposes, that he has the power of reading the future, by going through the mere formality of asking himself a question; and the exercise of his gift procures for him a most interesting career. In fact, the moral aforesaid is not pointed by any means in the spirit of the tag on the title-page, for the hero does not seem to scruple about besting an honest bookmaker by using his supernatural knowledge on the turf; and he only divests himself of the "fatal gift" when it has made him a prosperous man, and secured for him a happy future. That, however, is neither here nor there. The author did not promise in so many words to show that the gift of foreknowledge would be a curse instead of a blessing, and his readers will not have much reason to complain if his figments have the opposite tendency. The story is sufficiently entertaining, and is not ill written. Mr. Goodman is not yet an adept at construction, but his incidents follow each other briskly, and the narrative does not drag. Esme Stuart's new volume is a circumstantial account, rather (lonyo intervaUo) in the manner of the ' Diary of a Late Physician,' of a terrible case of mesmeric influence. The chatty style of the story assists the illusion, and we feel seriously agitated in sympathy with the efforts of Dr. Winterton to deliver bis wife from the mysterious power which makes her at any distance subservient to the commands of an unscrupulous mesmerist. No resume of the story will convey this sympathy, and as the whole has the merit of being very short those who are interested in such subjects should form their own opinion.

The Bookman 16 : 91 21 - 21
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
BETTY MUSGRAVE. By Mary Findlater. 6s. (Methuen.) " Betty Musgrave " is a more ambitious and a stronger piece of work than Miss Mary Findlater's first novel, "s Over the Hills." It is a carefl and convincizg study of a difficult problem, depressing at times, but lightened by many bright touches. Mrs. Musgrave is a dipsomaniac. Betty Musgrave is her daughter, an unselfish, heroic Ewe. It is not difficult to fill in the tragedy. Miss Findlater has succeeded in making Mrs. Musgrave a really sympathetic character-a hard task. Her picture of the woman-cringing, cunning, debased, yet never wholly vile - is relentless but not harsh, and the history of her final tragedy inevitable but not cruel. Betty Musgrave herself hardly holds our affection. She is a trifle too immaculate, too automatically good, and she commits an unpardonable sin in marrying Oliver Lacy. We admit she acted just as we expected. She was not deep-souled enough to understand the love that a great man offered her. It is in the minor characters that Miss Findlater displays her talent to best advantage. Charlotte Wentworth is a charming personage, Mr. Smyihe is villainy typified, Mr. Drake strength itself, but by far the most successful figure in the book is Mrs. Trevose, the most outrageously vulgar and yet the most delightfully humorous landlady we have met in the pages of fiction for a long time. It is remarkable that of a book the plot of which is From Ph?o. Iy] MLSS MARY FINDLATER. [Bade sadness itself, one should remember longest the frankly amusing interludes. Miss Findlater has real humorous gifts well worth cultivating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Bookman's Table THE LONELY PLOUGH. Bv Constance Holme. World's Classics. 2S. (Oxford University Press.) " The Lonely Plough," as probably most discriminating novel-readers knew long ago, is " the story of a landed estate, and of a big flood on a northern marsh, bringing out the loyalty of the north-country character, not only to the lining Iout to the (lead. It endeavours to show the value of the threecornere(d relationship i) e t Ad e e n landlord, agent and tenant." In l)rief, the story is of the old order of things. In her preface to the present edition the author remarks that the summary of the b)ook, just quoted, which appeared on the cover of the first edition, " was written at almost the last moment of the old order of things, and it is perhaps of some slight interest to note how far it applies to-dav." The additional interest to a new reader of the author's later books The Filberd Nut -ri, i .aes 'fromn Gerard's Herhal.; by .larc,,s W oodi.awd i Gerald Hlio . 'ill be to discover in what way the changes of the past seventeen vears have modified her appreciation for " the old order of things." They will not, one supposes, have sapped her belief in the permanence of the best things which, it was the aim of ' The Lonely Plough " to show, the old order produced. Some of the changes are recalled in this preface: the breaking-up of many estates, the wave of building which is engulfing the land, the advent of electricity and the motorbus in the country-side, the restlessness of farmers' sons and their migration to the towns. " Yet much remains" and in the necessity for the qualities which the land demands and produces, the author finds sufficient reason for their survival. " The need for loyalty remains, for honesty and straight dealing, and confidence in our fellows." The strength of the book is the portrayal of these fundamental qualities in action, and its appeal is to the sense of continuitv which, in spite of racial and economic change, cannot be altogether lost in human affairs. Unhappy those to-day who, in their affection for the past, can see nothing but destruction and betrayal in the changes brought by the rapidly moving present; and happy, or at least undistracted, are those who can welcome change with no misgivings, no backward-glancing sighs, angry or sentimental; but most fortunate those who, while caught like the majority of us between a desire for continuity and order, and an eagerness for experiment, are clear-sighted enough to descry the permanent beneath the flux. To the reader of to-day the sentimentality of one thread of the story, the part taken by WViggie, and also some part of the love storv of Lancelot and Dandy, will jar. It belongs to another fashion and does not stand the test of these seventeen years. But in the handling of the relationship between agent and tenants, in the picture of lives rooted so firmly, it seemed, in the tradition and experience common to humanity so long as there is land, there is nothing superfluous, nothing extraneous or ornate in matter or style.

MANY a time, a;, rubbing our handls, wve havc pa-sel briskly to our stnug s-at at once bw the lIre and the breakfast.table-many a tine hIis the navvie's figure, setn in that pasiri, glance thronglih the winiodvw wve crossed, s:nitten us with misgivings; for, whwn we rdhitetel that there he had been, on the side of that mountain, lahtoiri-,g aw;a solidly and stolidly, picking out the earth, stroke after stroke, beneath his feet, and makin, a sutlicient shelf thereon slowly, patiently, stirely-thcbe three good hours that we had been but steaming and stewing ourselves in bed, we could hardly bring ourselves to belie" that we deserved our breakfast: and many a time we have resolved, Rle Emerson, " that the workmen on the railway should no longer shame ua." We have observed our friend for hours on that strange perch which di. tance reduced to a nonentity, drilling, picking, shovelling, and blasting; and we have wondered all the time how on earth it was he did not fall. We hae been as attentive as himself, too, to the warning of " Fire! " and have winked both eyes and ears (to talk Irish) more, probably, than himself, while watching the smoke of the fusee, and waiting for the shock of the explosion. And then, on the assurance of " All right," we have run (in thought) with as much interest as he to inspect the expected havoc of the blast. We know, the bigger the piece of rock that fell, the greater was his delight, and the greater was ours. There is no time allowed the narvie for the gratification of curiosity, however: there he is again picking away in the same "I unhasting, yet unresting," business-like fashion, while the earth and stones clatter down the slope, incessant as rain and continuous as rain, till suddenly, as " Yo-bo! " rings out from end to end of "the cutting," the whole swarm of them falls instantly into new arrangements. It is dinner-time, in fact; the waggon stands still; the hand-barrow, laid down on its side, seems sprawling for help; the pick, the shovel, the jumper are idle on the ground. Some of the navvies, with their upper clothes thrown loosely over their shoulders, you see running to their not distant lodgings; while others stroll forward to some eligible spot where their wives or sweethearts await them with their dinners. Dinner with them consists of bacon, and tea or cocoa; but many, in lieu of the bacon, have only cheese. The pic nickers fall often into groups from which the laughter and the talk are hearty enough and loud enough, but hardly Attic. There is a numerous third class, however, who seem to have neither wives nor sweethearts, and who go not home to their lodgings. Members of this class we have seen picturesquely dotted along the middle of a cutting, at due intervals from each other, discussing their dinners on their feet-perhaps, too, in a steam of rain. The meal with them consisted simply of bread and cheese: and we assure the reader that only actual vision can convey the delightful manner in which the clasp-knife dealt now with the caseous cube antd now with the cereal; and carried the sections of either unerringly to the grinlers. It is amazing t ) every overlooker that the navvie is not momently in receipt of a broken head; so p)eriloius is his place bath below and above. From long experience, however, he has learned dexterity; and you would be delighted to see him, when a break takes place, press himself closely against the side antl escape, or throw himielf boldly hea4long with it, thereby, though half-buried, saving himself from the shock of " the muck;" and falling from great heights softer many a time than could have been thought ps~ille. l'o,)r fellow! he is not always so lucky, however; but may, not iifre(Itiently, he seen, pale, bloody, imanglel, carried home by means of a p)lank on the shoulders of four of his comrades. Even in such circumstances, holvever, lie is " hard " and " plucky;" and pleases himself to shout for his pipe or " a drop of summut." In such seasons "his mat" ustllalv sticks -ery close by him ; cooking his victuals, administering his medicines, and smoothiing the pillowv for his aching limbs. He does not desert him, as we know, even when he lies blackening in cholera, but wets his lips arid replaces the bedclothes on his restless limbs, till both are slipertluous. By and bye comes the final " Yo-ho" that sends them worn and weary to their scanty suppers, their nercr-failing pipes, and their early beds. Morning sees them on the mountain-side again, pursuing the same routine. Wet days, Saturdays, Sundays. and paydays, with accidents, and " the tramp" are the only periods of change to them. Wet days do not seem pleasant to the navvie; his pipe fails to give employment enough; he seems as restless and unsatisfiable as the fowls. Not seldom, however, you hear and see him cheerfully cobbling his boots; or, it may be, delightfully dealing a welithumbed lpack of cards. Of a fine Sunday, perched on a gate with his pipe in his mouth, or roaming about the country in bands, he appears happy enough ; still we are inclined to believe that even Sunday is not a very happy day with him. "'I'lic pay" may, though we doubt it much, be a happy time to him; but it is a beastly time to all spectators. Till every farthing of his money has vaniished, night and day he is drunk. There they are, he and his mae, for days and days after the pay, staggering about the public-house in the msnt di-sgusting fashion; or, like warriors on the battle-field, lying strewn along the borders of the highway, asleep in the most brutal drunkenness, and in broad daylight too, perlhaps not noon. The painful coarseness of these cenes is beyond words. We cannot say, however, that the navvie is a creature of any delicacy, lie is nice in nothing. Many a time we have come upon him rising and shaking himself from-a couch that quite satisfied him-the corner of a haystack. We have assisted more than once, too, to recover him from the asphyxia indnued by the carbonic acid gas of the lime-kiln, by the side of awhich he had stretched himself for the night. Neither is he avrse to barns or other outhouses; but vexes the farmer by his pertinacious attachment to them. We have even seen him located in a cold, stone cavern, and, ogre-like (would you believe it ?) munching pleasedly a raw leg of mutton or cube of beef. For, if his lodgings are not nice, neither are his victual. Bread and cheese is the staple of them, though he may have bacon, when he can afford it, and fresh meat once a week. He cooks for himself not unfre quently, when cookery is required; but, on the occasion we allude to, it soms the needful apparatus had been a-missing, and he had e'en set his canines to work without it. If such be his habits in regard to lodging, eating, and drinking, he is not one whit nicer in the article of clothing. His wardrobe is very limited. Often have we seen his only shirt-as we have come upon him in some secluded spot by brook, river, or canal-take on, beneath his own stitl fingers, a peculiar saffron hue at length, which to him was at once the token of cleanness and the signal to stop; and many a time have we seen him stand dreamy by the hedge that held to the sun this same satfion-hued habiliment. Among other things, it must be confessed that the navvie is seldom a favourite in any neighbourhood which he may happen to favotur with his temporary residence. This we suspect to arise less from the mode of his entrance than from that of his departure. The fact is the navvie has no principle; he lives to slope, and to slope means to slink off without paying one's debts No genuine navvie believes this wrong; it is his one clever- I ness, his solitary talent, his single bright point; and it is, perhaps, hardly to be wondered at that, in his pride of the same, the more lie call practise it the greater is his glory. It is almost universally the case with him that, when he has been time enough anywhere to get comfortably in arrears with landladies and other natives, he gets quietly up through the night, makes up his bundle-not always omitting to include in it any stray knicknack that may come by accident to hand-and slopes. We ae afraid, after all, that we have not succeeded in making the navvie agreeable to the reader. This brute, possessed of not one rational idea, that eonsents to such a beastly existence only for the delight of drunkenness and the triumph of slopiAg, you will har(lly smile on. You know the work he does; you know his firmness in accidents; his steadfastness to his master; still he will not go down with you. And, when vou meet him on his "tramp," by some roadside, with his brown cheeks and brown throat, his broad shoulders, hands of horn, and sturdy limbs, with his cap or hillycock on his head, his loose neckerchief, his folded dawn collar, his blue striped slop, with the heart worked on the front of it, and his moleskin trousers turned up above his sufficient lace-up boots, voit desire to get out of his way. You like neither him nor his mate. You think the things he has sloped with are in that sack on his back, and that bundle in his hand. You will not give him charity.

I The Patrician. Vol. I, No. i. (I, York Street, Covent Garden, W.C. 6d. net.) WE congratulate the editors of the Patrician, which makes its first appearance this week, on something strikingly new in the way of cover-design, and a format which is simply irreproachable. The articles and other contributions are of a distinguished order, and should have a very wide appeal. Mr. Bernard Capes begins a story entitled "A Queen of Guile," illustrated by H. M. Brock; Mr. Gordon Craig has a capital article on "Patricians and the Pit "; Miss Kate Carew is vivacious on the theme of " Players and Playgoers "-her own sketches, illustrating her remarks, are extremely attractive; and there is a fine appreciation of the new U.S.A. Ambassador, with a portrait. Mr. Wilfrid L. Randell contributes a rhyming "Foreword " and a page on " Things to be Noted "; Mr. W. G. Menzies gives a " Chat on Antiques "; and there are short stories and travel articles of the best. In fact, the Patrician fully justifies its sub-title as "A Monthly Magazine of Travel, Art, Fashion, Sport, and Social Life throughout the World," and we wish it success.

The Bookman 69 : 410 122 - 123
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE GREAT PANDOLFO.* To a limited extent Mr. W. J. Locke's new book, " The Great Pandolfo," recalls the most famous of Mr. H. G. Wells's novels, " Tono-Bungay." Both stories describe the floating of a huge business scheme which soars like a rocket and comes down with a crash, both contain portraits of a self-hypnotised adventurer who dominates the world of finance for a time, only to be reduced to bankruptcy. But there . the resemblance ends. The article of commerce boosted by Mr. Wells's hero was a * " The Great Pandolfo." By William T. Locke. 7s. 6d. (Bodley Head.) quack medicine, and in Ponderevo, notwithstanding his flair for advertising, there was a large admixture of the charlatan. The " Paulinium" of Mr. Locke's fancy is a new metal, the financing of which only fails because the mysterious substance that affords it its strength suddenly gives out in the mine and cannot be found elsewhere; moreover Pandolfo who exploits it is pictured as a born inventor, flamboyant no doubt in manner and sublimely aware of his own bigness, but yet a Titan in resource whose fall is due to ill luck and not to any imposture. As we leave him recovering from a double stroke of disaster-the collapse of his grand project and the suicide of a wife hardly better than a courtesan-we feel sure he is meant to rise again to power, the more so as he has captured at last the love of the aristocratic Paula Field, who had long kept him at arm's length. But are our inventors who storm Olympus like this Pandolfo ?our Edisons, our Marconis, our Fords, our Leverhulmes, for instance-or is he just a literary man's idealisation of the man of action ? Are their monologues so full as his of a breezy but disarming egoism ?-have they his capacity for magnificent generosities ? It would take a Marconi to say. Meantime, there is rich colour and body and humour in this study of inventive genius. We have not to take Pandolfo's size merely at his author's valuation; he is really made to convey in his talk and conduct the idea of being big as well as of having his childish side-and that is no small achievement. Mr. Locke's other characters were far easier game. Such folk as Spencer Babington, the Curzonian diplomatist, Lady Demeter, the hostess whose week-end parties are a menagerie of lions, or the raffish Lady Pandolfo are well within his reach, and though we would like perhaps to hear a little less about the ancestry of his heroine, still this fastidious and hesitating widow has her charm. But the book must stand or fall by its titular character, and Pandolfo's popularity with Mr. Locke's thousands of readers, English and American, should be assured. F. G. B.

At Home and Abroad; or, Things and Thoughts in America and Europe. By Margaret Fuller Ossoli. Edited by her brother, Arthur B. Fuller. (Boston, Crosby & Co.; London, Low & Co.)?In Nos. 1267 and 1268 of the Athenceum some attempt was made to honour that which was honourable in one of the most distinguished women whom America has produced; though her biographers, by their conceit and folly, and their wilful confusion of what was small with what was great in her composition, might (apparently) have been bent on provoking ridicule, in place of exciting admiration for their heroine. The Life of Margaret Fuller, if well written by some person able to allow for sex, position, and nationality, would be as valuable a contribution to the history of the " womenkind " (as Jonathan Oldbuck called them) as man or woman could offer. But our appreciation of Margaret Fuller's genius, acquirements and energy, and the deep sympathy which a recurrence to the close of her strange, stormy, feverish life awakens, cannot stand between us and the fact, that the book before us amounts to a superfluous exhibition of the ephemeral manufactures of one, who, though by circumstance a literary trader, according to " the spirit of her dream," aspired to be a literary artist. Her' Summer on the Lakes,' a record of American travel, hardly merited republication. The Letters from England and France, which were contributed by her to the New York Tribune, have been already ransacked, we imagine, of all their best passages: ?it being observable, moreover, that many of Margaret Fuller's most vivid impressions were " laid by," as she thought, for some future day, when she hoped to do them justice in description, or to set forth their inner meaning. In England and France she seems never to have shaken off the conviction that the "oldfolks at home" were waiting for her views and systems on all that had been, is, and will be. In her Italian life this overweening intellectual complacency was neutralized by her becoming a wife and a mother; and though she was unable during the Roman Revolution to divest herself of the idea that she bad a public part to play, there are still in all this section of her letters a natural earnestness and a reality of description, which make this portion of the volume interesting :?though it does not equal the corresponding pages in the biography.?Were there any fear of Margaret Fuller being forgotten, this publication would not avert the catastrophe. The vintage, of which no one talks after the wine bas been drunk out, will hardly come to be spoken of should the lees be brought to market.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONE WOMAN'S STORY. By Mary Britnieva. Ss. 6d. (Barker.) Madame Britnieva, born in Russia of English parents, and the widow of a Russian surgeon, here tells her own story. It is one of the countless personal tragedies that war and revolution inevitably bring, and the writer makes no attempt to relate her own experiences to the vast upheavals in which they were set. The ruthless machines which crushed her happiness are seen always in the background, but we are unaware of any function, useful or otherwise, that they may be serving. It all seems hideously unnecessary, for neither war nor revolution takes any thought for the individual. In the first few chapters, in which Mrs. Britnieva describes her work as a hospital nurse to the Russian army during the War, the reader will probably find himself wondering whether experience alone is sufficient justification for the writing of a book. For the writer has no literary style and, with so great a flQod of competent books coming daily from the press, one is inclined to be severe on the amateur. But in the remainder of the book, which takes us from i9i8 to I930, Mme. Britnieva's story becomes so poignant, and the courage of herself and her husband so evident, that cliches are forgiven and even unnoticed. She was married a year after the Tsar's abdication, and she and her husband and her children had all the successive and violent phases of the transition to communism to face. Her husband did not survive them. He was executed in the 1930 round-up of the last remnants of the old intelligentsia. He was a brilliant surgeon, beloved of all his patients and far too busy with his proper job to waste his time wvith counter-revolutionary activities. But the revolutionary machine demanded his destruction. Bloomsbury, take note ! A particularly interesting section of this book introduces us to the philosopher Koni, who died in I927 at a great age. He had been the personal friend of Tolstoy, Dostoievsky and Turgenev. An earlier chapter contains two eyewitness accounts of the murder of Captain Cromie in the raid on the British Consulate in i9i8.

A Young Man in a Hurry. By Robert W. Chambers. (Con- stable, bs.) The title of this book so completely suggests the Americans, that we are not surprised to find that it is written by a native of that country. America is always young, and it hides its old age out of sight, as a rule.. This book of short stories is as clever and as full of life as the nation who fathered the author. There is some delightful comedy in the first story, and after that Mr. Chambers goes deeper and shows us the primal emotions, which are the same in the American as in the Englishman, save that the woman queens it more in America than she does in our own land. In the "Fire Warden" we are shown that America has very much the same difficulties as we have in preserving game, only with a great deal more depending upon the unfortunate purchaser of the supposed rights to the game in question. The office of fire warden is new to England, but it has an attractive sound. The love interest runs through the story, and we learn how charming can be the daughter of the important man, and that in emergencies she can represent her father as deputy fire warden. There are other quaint names in the book?the path master, the game warden, the market hunter?and the stories that belong to them are very different from anything English. Most of the tales are full of the life of the forests and of wide untrodden spaces, of a new country and her children. There are one or two which treat of cities and civilisation, in the ordinary sense, and these are as delicately told as many American short stories are. They have a freshness, a vigour, and a refinement which should commend them to all readers who appreciate good, original work, which seldom takes them over the old ground either of plot or treatment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ready-Money Mortiboy. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. 3 vols. (Tinsley Brothers.) The Rose of Avondale. By Elizabeth Mary Parker. (Bush.) The Fatal Sacrifice: a Novel. (Tinsley Brothers.) The "matter-of-fact story" reprinted from the pages of Once a Week is not a book which we should recommend young ladies, or, for the matter of that, young people of either sex, to read; and yet it is a clever book, not without grave faults both of style and of tone, it is true, but one which no grown man who has any experience of life can read without being the better for it. The person whose sobriquet of Ready-Money gives its title to the book is not by many degrees the most interesting character we meet within tbesepages. Our author's greatest pains have been expended on old Ready-Money's son Dick, the most original character we have come across for some time in modem fiction. Allowing for the partiality of a friend, and almost a worshipper, we cannot help feeling that Richard Mortiboy, as he is herc depicted, has had his counterpart in real life. Indeed, if the story Fas one fault more strongly marked than another, it is that it is throughout too realistic, or, as the author would say, matter of-fact. It is refreshing, after the twaddle which our novelists, and (we are afraid we must also say) our female novelists in particular, put into the mouths of all their dramatis personce alike, rich and poor, peer and peasant, country bumpkin and London gamin, to meet with an author who shrinks from nothing that comes in his way as the painter of men and women as they are, and who lets them say in his pages just what they say every day in real life. We are not going to spoil the pleasure of those readers who can stand strong meat by giving an outline of the plot, which, after all, is not a very complicated affair. The fragmentary and somewhat jerky style of the book is partly due, no doubt, to the form in which it originally appeared. We are taken from town to country, from Bohemia to Belgravia, from Market Basing (a provincial town on the London and North-Western line, about an hour-and-a-half's ride from Euston) to the West Indies, in a manner which almost takes our breath away. The main idea of the book may be given in a few words. The father, a sordid, grasping wretch, whose soul never rises above the ambition of making money, dies a miserable paralytic, unloved, unwept, and almost unburied. The son, who is theantipodes of his sire in everything but his obstinacy, begins life badly, thanks to his evil rearing, but after a while he breaks away frombad habits, and gives free play to a naturally good and generous disposition. The wealth hoarded by his father he employs in making all around him, and, above all, those whom his father has wronged, feel the benefit of. The consequence is, that when he dies, murdered by the man whom he has saved from the gallows once and from starvation many a time there is not a dry eye among the mourners at his funeral; and even the scandalized rector is constrained to murmur, in apology for hi& own emotion, that " charity covereth a multitude of sins." Amidst all that daily comes to our ears of the mutual complaints of servants and employers, of the want of consideration shown by the latter, and of the absence of principle, the idleness, and love of dress displayed by the former, it is cheering to meet with a book like * The Rose of Avondale,' from thepen of a young woman in domestic service. Considering the position of the authoress of the novel before us, and the difficulties she must have had to contend with, it is needless to say that we commenced reading her tale with more than a usual desire to be lenient, and to make allowances. We have, however, great satisfaction in confessing that our charitable feelings were quite thrown away, and that the work before us is able to rest on its own intrinsic merits. We do not wish to exaggerate, or to give undue encouragement to the authoress, and are therefore bound to affirm that ' The Rose of Avondale' bears no marks of genius, nnd will not, in our opinion, take the world by storm. It is utterly devoid of humour, there is but slight interest in the plot, and the flow of the story is somewhat hindered by the intrusion of numerous quotations from the poets. These quotations are apt and pretty enough, but they are too frequent, too long, and are not required. The authoress has, moreover, been guilty of two trifling acts of carelessness, which would have been avoided, had the MS., previously to publication, been submitted to a competent critic. For instance, the hero's father is, we are told, an English nobleman, yet he is always spoken of as plain Mr. Fairlie, as is, after the father's death, the hero himself. Then it is somewhat unusual for a young gentleman to call a young lady by her christian name only three or four days after making her acquaintance ; and the error is made more palpable by the fact that when Harold knows Miss Ham- mond better he does not call her Milley, but Miss Hammond. These, however, are but slight defects in a domestic novel, which is remarkable for its unaffectedness, its simplicity, its tender feeling, and its grace aud refinement. The latter qualities are indeed most conspicuous. Not only is there an absence of anything approaching to a vulgar or even a slang expression, but not a single vulgar thought flows from the authoress's pen. The authoress may be a servant, but she evidently possesses a mind as refined as that of the most thoroughbred, highly-educated lady. Few can describe love-passages without being coarse, high-flown, formal, or mawkish. The writer is none of these, and the courtships she depicts are simple, yet tender and true. She has also an eye for the beauties of nature, and can bring a pretty English rural scene before us in a manner which, while it enables us to realize it, does not fatigue the mind by crowded details and elaborate descriptions. We shall not, by giving an abstract of the story, deprive it of any of its freshness, but content ourselves with offering our congratulations to the authoress on her success, and expressing a hope that soon? not too soon?we may have the satisfaction of reviewing a younger sister of 'The Rose of Avondale.' The whole plot of ? The Fatal Sacrifice' turns ?on a most deliberate breach of the seventh commandment ; and the book is apparently written with the sole view of showing how charming people may be who are guilty of conjugal infidelity. So little regard is paid to the exigencies of morality, that the attractive, refined, ^nd noble-minded sinners are made to enjoy their guilty love for an almost unclouded two years or so, and then to die peacefully within a few days of each other, and in the most romantic manner possible. Apparently, the ?author thinks remorse is a foolish bugbear, and that love's sad satiety does not necessarily follow an elopement, the result of a mere impulse. Perhaps we are a little too severe, for the male ?offender does at length begin to feel that open and deliberate contempt for morality is not altogether unattended with inconvenience, ?especially as regards the fruit of the liaison ; the lady, however, though her elopement has killed her father, is fortunate enough to possess ?a perfectly torpid conscience, and is gay and happy to the last. We cannot analyze a tale like this very ?closely, for in such a case our object is to warn our readers, not to excite morbid ?curiosity. The father of Ethel, the heroine, is a clergyman, who, after leading a very impure life before marriage, kills his wife with a blow of his fist, and then takes orders. He relates his experiences in the plainest possible language to his daughter, aged only seventeen, and tells her of his "wild revels with women I scorned to look at in the daytime." The only effect on his innocent listener is a fit of musing, followed by a sound afternoon nap. Ethel pays a visit to her aunt, who, for reasons and by means unnecessary to specify, induces the girl to engage herself to John Chatterton, a vulgar man of low origin, whose only recommendation is the fact that he possesses 10,000/. a year. Major Fitzpatrick, represented as a thorough gentleman, and very kind-hearted, sees that Ethel is unhappy, and tries to dissuade her from the step she is about to take. To his remonstrances she returns the following lady-like answer, " No, Major, I am miserable, and shall always be so. I hate Chatterton; he is an ugly little beast." Her counsellor winds up by saying, that if she marries John Chatterton, "your name will figure in a divorce court, and you will find in lust the comfort you have lost by a mercenary marriage." Nice language truly to use to a young girl only seventeen years old. Nor are her reflections more creditable. " I suppose I must make the best of it, and my aunt says he is delicate. Wish he would pop off before the wedding; I should not go into mourning." The end of it is she does marry him, and they lead, as might be expected, a cat and dog life. He is not only brutal, but also unfaithful to her. She, when on a visit by herself to a country house, accidentally discovers his infidelity, and while excited by the thought of her wrongs, and full of love for a married man separated from his wife, meets the object of her utterly gratuitous infatuation in a corridor at night. She looks unhappy; he comforts her with a kiss. The sound of a door opening is heard, and, fearing discovery, she drags him into her bedroom, and an elopement ensues a few hours later. We have given a mere outline of this episode. The author is far more detailed. The end of the guilty couple is, as we have already mentioned, peace. Not only is the plot of this tale worthy of censure, and many of the scenes prurient, but all the dramatis persona?, with scarcely an exception, are repulsive, although, we are happy to be able to add, unnatural. What can be more untrue to nature than that the wife of a Solicitor-General should, by letter, set Mr. Chatterton on the track of his runaway wife, and then recommend her own husband's legal services in case of proceedings being undertaken in the divorce court ? The style, too, is not that of educated persons, being often ungrammatical and involved. In short, the book is stupid, unnatural, badly written, immoral in its tendency, and only not quite indecent. The author has done well not to give his name; we are sorry that the publisher did not adopt the same course, for the book is certainly more in harmony with Holywell than with Catherine Street.

THE HISTORY OF BUTTON HILL, by Gordon Stowell. GoUancz. 1o/b. THE publisher is perhaps wise to label this book definitely on the jacket, " a novel ". Its tide does not sound like a novel, nor does it look like one-it is a large book. Yet it is both a readable and lifelike novel, and a piece of social history. Button Hill, a select suburb on the outskirts of Fleece (probably Leeds) is a microcosm of the England of the time from x894 to the present day-a period during which we see its rise, decline and fall, and watch the fortunes of some of its inhabitants. Even allowing for a youthful touch of scorn and satire, no English community has ever been more faithfully shown in print. There are no exaggerations: equally, there are no excuses for its follies, or for the cant and claptrap, for the hum. bug and hypocrisy which were as common to Button Hill as to the rest of England. The central character is Eric Ellersby, son of a father who was a conscients objector, a pro-Boer, a pacifist and a vegetarianl When Eric was born, Button Hill was a new and pleasant suburb. When he came back to it after the war, it was in decay, declined to shabby gentility and tenements, destroyed largely by those very trams which in the 'nineties had seemed the last word in progress. The history of Button Hill, in this aspect, is that of many a suburb. And the people, especially Eric and his companions, are as truly drawn as their setting: rather advanced young people, some of them, finding in the works of Mr. H. G. Wells, a new writer, incitement to ready rebellion against Victorian ideas and shibboleths. One must be contemporary with or only a little older than Eric and the others to appreciate how true to life are the portraits of these youngsters, with their ambitions and ideals, their ideas about religion, sex and Socialism. Button Hill suffered dreadfully in the war years: not only in the changes in its own nature due to war conditions, but by the loss of half its young men in one of those delusive theoretical victories which were really defeats. At the last, Button Hill, fast falling into shabbiness and decay, a mere appenage of Fleece, makes a fittingly grey background for Eric's tragic memory of the day when the girl who had waited for him al through the war-and a likeable, decent, clear thinking sort of girl she is shown to be-was killed at his side. For Eric, a for Button Hill, there is no happy ending. But one does not expect any of the usual conventions of the novel in a book whiCh lives so closely up to its title as a piece of social history.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIFE OF MAHOMET.t THE Mahometans have a reverence for the name of their prophet almost as profound as the Jews have for the name of the Most High. Many books have been written upon the sacred name of Mahomet. It has been divided, like the word " God," into ninety-nine several parts or attributes; and a noted enthusiast once went the length of putting forth " A Gospel of the name of Mahomet" the nature of which may be gathered from the title-page, " The Good News that the glorious God gives to the faithful, in announcing to them that he who shall bear the name Ahmed or Mohammed shall be exempt from the pains of hell." The Mahometami affection for their prophet's name is but a faint shadow of that which has ever attached them to his memory. Two centuries after his death an Arabian writer gathered up more than 7,000 anecdotes of his wonderful sayings and doings which were then current amont, his followers, and these were mostiy in addition to the collection already comprised in the Book of Sonna, which was made up within a year or two after his decease, and recorded the fond recollections of his wives, his friends, and his domestics. Out of these Recollections and Traditions, with the addition of the historical or autobiographical statements and allusions in the Koran, Abulfeda principally compiled his History, in the 14th century. There everythingwhich Mussulmen are bound to believerespecting their great founder is carefully chronicled. Some things were deemed too marvellous and some too minute, but an easy faith and a sharp curiosity guided the pen of the royal historian, and produced, in combination, a work which, although never yet published entire, is the foundation of the greater part of our knowledge of that extraordinary man, who chan ged the destinies of a vast portion of the human race. Dobelius, Inveges, Muratori, Gagnier, Albert Schultens,R1eiske, Sylvestre de Sacy, and Fleischer, have all published parts of Abulfeda, with translations into Latin, but his entire work has never yet been edited or translated. (Bioti. Dict. of Soc. Difius. Knowl. art. Abuafeda.) Early Christian writers, some out of actual fear and others out of pious horror of the arch-impostor, and early travellers, out of a love of the marvellous, added many fables to the history of Mahomet. Some of them are even still current in our popular belief. The idea that a dove visited him in his moments of inspiration, sitting upon his shoulder, and whispering in his ear, was a mere application of an ancient symbol, common in representations of saints, and of which an example may be seen in an early picture in our National Gallery. An imaginative writer, taking the fable for granted, added by way of explanation that Mahomnet kept grains of corn in his ear, which the bird was trained to come and find. So, also, the long accredited assertion that his coffin hung suspended at Medina, between heaven and earth, a position analogous to the punishment of hanging, and therefore discreditable, is nowinown to be a mere traveller's tale. These, and many others, were the figments of enemies, invented to depreciate or defame; other writers, of more recent date, and animated by the soi-disant philosophical or anti-Christian bias, ave been equally zealous to exalt the pseudo-prophet into a position of favourable contrast to teachers whom Christians esteem sacred. By these last authorities his faults have been glossed over. The sublimity of some of his doctrines has been dwelt upon t Lives of Mahomet and bis Successors. Lond. 8vo. vol. i. and exalted, without any acknowledgment of the source from whence all that is sublime in them was derived, whilst his false pretensions have been attributed to excitement, or to enthusiasm, or to a heated imagination, or to anything, in short,rather than tothat which they look like-downright and deliberate untruth. These writers also have overlooked the fact, that, although the Syrian teacher unquestionably destroyed idolatry, and n that respect achieved great good, he imposed upon his followers a multitude of idle and superstitious observances, many of them, like the worship of the Caaba, partaking of an idolatrous character, and that the purity which they boast of his having inculcated was not a purity of the heart, nor a purity of self-denial, but a purity (if it may be so called) consistent with the practice of war and with many sensual indulgences and sensual expectations, a purity strikingly in accordance with the personal qualities of the teacher himself, and very unlikely to conduce to moral elevation. But, pretender as he was, it would be the grossest injustice to deny that he possessed many high and noble qualities. The traditions respecting him, and the anecdotes perpetuated in the Book of Sonna, are probably not much to be depended upon. If they were, it might be said that there are few great men of whom more admirable traits of character were ever related. The facts of his public life are pretty well known, and Mr. Washinaton Irving does not pretend to adl anything to them, but some of the traditional stories which he has obtained from Abulfeda, through Gagnier, are worth repeating. We all remember the anecdote of Luther, when entreated not to go to the diet of Worms. The following will bear comparison with it. When Mahomet's uncle was informed of a conspiracy against the life of the prophet, who was at that time only at the commencement of his career, he besought him to (uit a way of life which was beset with so many dangers. " The enthusiastic spirit of Mahomet kindled at the words. ' Oh, my uncle I' exclaimed he, ' though they should array the sun against me on my right hand, and the moon on my left, yet, until God should command me, or should take me hence, would I not depart from my pur. pose.' Admirable expression of a determination founded upon the only true principle of confidence, trust in an unseen presence and support! Again, when Abu Beker set forth with the prophet on the memorable Hegira, "They left Mecca while it was yet dark, making their way on foot by the light of the stars, and the day dawned as they found themselves at the foot of Mount Thor. Scarce were they within the cave when they heard the sound of pursuit. Abu Beker, though a brave man, quaked with fear. 'Our pursuers' said he, 'are many, and we are but two.' ' Nay,' replied Mahomet, ' there is a third; God is with us! ' ' On the fourth day of their flight, " They were overtaken by a troop of horse headed by Soraka Ibn Malec. Abu Beker was again dismayed by the number of their pursuers; but Mahomet repeated the assurance, ' Be not troubled; Allah is with us.' Soraka was a grim warrior, with shagged iron-grey locks and naked sinewy arms rough with hair. As he overtook Mahomet his horse reared and fell with him. His superstitious mind was struck with it as an evil sign. Mahomet perceived the state of his feelings, and by an eloquent appeal wrought upon him to such a degree that Soraka, filled with awe, entreated his forgiveness; and, turning back with his troop, suffered him to proceed on his way unmolested." His quickness in reply, and the readiness both of eye and mind with which he took advantage of favouring incidents-qualities which were so conspicuous in this instance - distinguished him throughout life. " He was one day sleeping alone at the foot of a tree, at a distance from his camp, when he was awakened by a noise, and beheld Durthur, a hostile warrior, stand. ing over him with a drawn sword. ' Oh Mahomet,' cried he, ' who is there now to save thee ? ' ' God! ' replied the prophet. Struck with conviction, Durthur let fall his sword, which was instantly seized upon by Mahomet. Brandishing the weapon he exclaimed in turn ' who is there now to save thee, oh Durthur?' Alas, no one! ' replied the soldier. Then learn from me to be merciful.' So saying, he returned the sword. The heart of the warrior was overcome, he acknowledged Mahomet as the prophet of God, and embraced the faith." No good suggestion was ever thrown away upon him. When he had erected his first mosque of mud, with datepalm trees as pillars to support a roof framed of their branches and thatched with their leaves, " He was for some time at a loss in what manner his followers should be summoned to their devotions; whether with the sound of trumpets, as among the Jews, or by lighting fires on high places, or by the striking of timbrels. While in this perplexity, a form of words to be cried aloud, was suggested by Abdallah, the son of Zeid, who declared that it was revealed to him in a vision. It was instantly adopted by Mahomet, and such is given as the origin of the following summons, which is to this day heard from the lofty minarets throughout the East, calling the Moslems to the place of worship; ' God is great! God is great! There is Do God but God. Mahomet is the apostle of God. Come to prayers I Come to prayers ! God is great I God is great ! There is no God but God.' To which at dawn of day is added the exhortation, ' Prayer is better than sleep ! Prayer is better than sleep! "I The leading of casual circumstances influenced his doctrines as well as his life. When he first began to preach, standing on the -round with his back against one of taIe date-trees which were the pillars of his lowly temple, and afterwards when he first ascended a pulpit in which he either stood or sat leaning upon a staff, his precepts were all peaceful and benignant. He seems to have emulated the benevolence of our Saviour:" He who is not affectionate to God's creatures, and to his own children," he would say, " God will not be affectionate to him. Every Moslem who clothes the naked of his faith will be clothed by Allah in the green robes of paradise." In one of his traditional sermons, transmitted by his (lisciples, is the following apologue on the subject of charity:" When God created the earth it shook and trembled, until he put mountains upon it, to make it firm. Then the angels asked, ' Oh God, is there anything of thy creation stronger than these mountains ?' And God replied, ' Iron is stronger than the mountains; for it breaks them.' ' And is there anything of thy creation stronger than iron ?' ' Yes; fire is stronger than iron, for it melts it.' ' Js there anything of thy creation stronger than fire?' 'Yes ; water, for it quenches fire.' 'Oh Lord, is there anything of thy creation stronger than water?' 'Yes, wind; for it overcomes water and puts it in motion.' ' Oh, our Sustainer I is there anything of thy creation stronger than wind?' 'Yes, a good man giving alms; if he give with his right hand and conceal it from his left, he overcomes all things."' " His definition of charity embraced the wide circle of kindness. Every good act, he would say, is charity. Your smiling in your brother's face is charity; an exhortation of your fellow man to virtuous deeds is equal to alms-giving; your putting a wanderer in the right road is charity; your assisting the blind is charity; your removing stones and thorns and other obstructions from the road is charity; your giving water to the thirsty is charity." It was not until he found himself at the head of a band of resolute followers, as full of faith as of courage, that his tone began to alter. Then he discovered that " Different prophets have been sent by God to illustrate his different attributes: Moses his clemency and providence; Solomon his wisdom, majesty, and glory; Jesus Christ his righteousness, omni. science, and power;-his righteousness by purity of conduct; his omniscience by the knowledge he displayed of the secrets of all hearts; his power by the miracles he wrought. None of these attributes, however, have been sufficient to enforce conviction, and even the miracles of Moses and Jesus have been treated with unbelief. I, therefore, the last of the prophets, am sent with the sword I Let those who promulgate my faith enter into no argument nor discussion; but slay all who refuse obedience to the law. Whoever fights for the true faith, whether he fall or conquer, will assuredly receive a glorious reward." To this doctrine he remained constant to the last, but he saw its consequences, and endeavoured to mitigate their horrors. Before the battle, and during its shock, no one was fiercer. He threw dust in the air against his enemies. He imprecated confusion upon them. He animated his followers by assurances that "the gates of Paradise are under the shadow of swords," and that he would " find instant admission who fell fighting for the faith." But after a conquest no one was more placable. In a moment of rage he fulminated his decree that a person who had at- tacked Zeinab, one of Mahomet's daughters, should be burnt alive; but, when the paroxysm had subsided, " He modified his command, ' It is for God alone,' he said, ' to punish men with fire. If taken, let Habbar be put to death with the sword; '" and when his friends and followers fell upon the field no one lamented them more bitterly than their prophet-chief. When the valiant Jaafar, the bearer of the sacred banner, was slain, after terrible mutilation, still clinging to the standard of his faith, no one mourned for him like Mahomet. He took the orphan child of his lost follower in his arms, and bathed it in his tears. When the daughter of another friend who had fallen at that same time approached him, the prophet fell speechless on her neck, and wept aloud. A bystander expressed surprise that such grief should be occasioned by deaths which were passports to paradise. "Alas," replied the prophet, " these are the tears of friendship for the loss of a friend!" Clemency in the hour of victory was one of his most conspicuous virtues, and was often most sorely tried. The following is one instance amiong many:" Another of the proscribed was Abdallah lbn Saad, a young Koreishite, distinguished for wit and humor, as well as for warlike accomplishments. As he held the pen of a ready writer, Mahomet had employed him to reduce the revelations of the Koran to writing. In so doing, he had often altered and amended the text; nay, it was discovered that, through carelessness or design, he had occasionally falsified it, and rendered it absurd. He had even made his alterations and amendments matter of scoff and jest among his companions, observing that if the Koran proved Mahomet to be a prophet, he himself must be half a prophet. His interpolations being detected, he had fled from the wrath of the prophet, and returned to Mecca, where he relapsed into idolatry. On the capture of the city his foster-brother concealed him in his house until the tumult had subsided, when he led him into the presence of the prophet, and supplicated for his pardon. This was the severest trial of the lenity of Mahomet. The offender had betrayed his confidence; held him up to ridicule; questioned his apostolic mission, and struck at the very foundation of his faith. For some time he maintained a stern silence; hoping, as he afterwards declared, some zealous dis- ciple might btrike off the offender's head. No one, however, stirred; so, yielding to the entreaties of Othman, he granted a pardon. Abdallah instantly renewed his profession of faith; and continued a good Mussulman. His name will be found in the wars of the Caliphs." The people about Alahomet became at length so well acquainted with the kindness of his heart that they ceased to construe literally harsh sentences that fell from him in moments of irritation. "Take that man hence, and silence his tongue!" he exclaimed on hearing the complaints of an unreasonable poet dissatisfied with his share in some spoil. Omar, ever severe, drew his scimitar, but Abbas, better instructed in the prophet's meaning, led the trembling culprit into the public square, and bade him select from the captured cattle as many as he pleased. " What! " exclaimed the poet, relieved from the fear of death or mutilation, "is this the way the prophet would silence my tongue? By Allah I I will take nothing.' Mahomet forced him to accept sixty camels, and the poet was never weary of chanting the liberality of the prophet. Mahomet was of middle stature, square-built and sinewy, and as he grew in years was inclined to corpulency. His head was capacious and " well set on a neck which rose like a pillar from his ample chest." His forehead was high, broad at the temples, and crossed by veins which swelled whenever he was angry or excited. "I He had an oval face ... an aquiline nose, black eyes, arched eye-brows which nearly met, a mouth large and flexible, indicative of eloquence; very white teeth somewhat parted and irregular; black hair which waved withoutacurl on his shoulders, and a long and very full beard." His temper was singularly sweet and equable, his conversation pleasing, his voice musical. He was sober and abstemious, disregarded all gaiety in apparel, and wore a turban because, when he took his journey to heaven, he saw that the angels there wore head-dresses of that character. "There are two things in this world," he would say, " which delight me-women and perfumes." From the use of the latter his person was conspicuous for an odour which his followers considered to be that of sanctity. " His passion for the sex had an influence over all his affairs [and very great influence over his religious doctrines]. It is said that when in the presence of a beautiful femalehe was continually smoothing his brow and adjusting his hair as if anxious to appear to advantage." He allowed his followers four wives. He took himself as the prophet's share somewherebetween fifteen and twentyfive, and much trouble he had with them. Mahomet's history is not uncommon in kind, although unexampled in its results. His natural character was amiable and unselfish, but, having once allowed himself to be over-mastered by a great delusion, his whole subsequent life was that of a slave to his own fraud. The bubble would have burst if every thing he did and said had not been made conformable to his assumed mission. Mr. Washington Irving has written a pleasant book, well suited for general circulation.

THE BELL-RINGER OF ANGELS. By Bret Harle. 3s. 6d. (Cliatto.) The title-story is in the writer's most familiar vein, a vein which never seems to get exhausted. He has always fresh and powerful instances of the generous virtues shining clearly in the rough, dark camp life. " Chu-Chu," the story of a horse, and "' Johnnyboy,7' an unconventional study of childlife, are also within the field where Mr. Bret Harte is master. Two others, " Young Robin Gray," and especially " A Rose of Glenlogie," seem to us to lie outside it. Mild domestic romance and fashionable intrigue do not call out his powers. Presented as reminiscences of his Scotch consulship, the dialect he attempts and the burlesque names he invents for the personages, give an air of unintentional absurdity to them. But the seven make up a very readable volume.

FICTION I Old Harbor. By WIiLIAx JoEN HOPKINS. (Cons~tab1e and Co. 6s. net.) THERE is a peaceful charm as well as a characteristic quaintness to be found-in this tale of ordinary humanity. The reader becomes mentally lost to the larger world, wnere the great whirlpools of bAter strife- seethe beneath the crowning vortex of human greed and unholy passion. Life in Old Harbor is a simple and smooth routine-so simple and smooth that even its- commercial element is a reflex* form of its spirit of quiet- domesticity. Yet life ia Old Harbor is by no means dull, because there is character about it, and where one can find character one can always find interest. When you enter the homely domicile of Harriet Joyce you are at once surrounded with an atmosphere of romance. You may chance to meet old Mrs. Loughery on her way to the Catherwoods with her basket of "yarbs," or you may knock.against Clanky, her degenerate offspring; but, in each case, your interest will. be aroused. You may get annoyed with the unwarrantable inquisition of MacLean, the druggist, but the imperturbable good humour of the asthmatical Dr. Olcott will have a contrary. effect. You may, like many of the inhabitants of Old Harbor, consider Nancy Hedge an objectionable creature, but you will ultimately be. convinced by those quaint. old maids, the Misses Tilton, as also by Jack Catherwood, of a very grave mistake. You may wonder whether Williams Ransome is courting Harriet Joyce or Abbie Mervin, but if you- possess but a moiety of William's patience you will at last discover that the secret is bound up with the mysterious career of Eben Joyce. On the whole, you will find Old Harbor quite a fascinating place-not because of any natural beauties on its part, but rather because certaini. of its inhabitants are objects of characteristic interest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
FORWARD FROM BABYLON. By Louis Golding. 8s. 6d. net. (Christopher.) The Jew in fiction has been the theme of many an interesting disquisition, and the general verdict seems to lie in favour of books where the Hebrew interest is centred, as in " Ivanhoe," upon a champion of his race contending with alien rule and some degree of persecution. Where, as in ' Daniel Deronda," the scene is laid in a Jewish interior, the interest hardly succeeds in holding the average reader, and in spite of much brilliant work, " Deronda " is usually voted one of George Eliot's failures. There is the same high intention in Mr. Golding's novel, and he makes his colour vivider, if his task is the harder, by surrounding his hero with the squalor of a north-country town. Philip's father is a schoolmaster intent on preserving the strictest racialism and ritual, and when he discovers Milton's " Ode on Christ's Nativity" among the lad's favourite reading, therc is an explosion which leaves a fierce conflict through the rest of the story. Philip takes to himself a group of associates and kindred spirits whose progressive notions lack his own exalted idealism, and vision perishes among sordid conditions without enlisting much of the reader's sympathy. In all this Mr. Golding displays real artistry and a faculty of power, but the fight for liberation, while it has all the logic on its side, and strikes a shrewd balance between filial duty and the advance towards enlightenment, needs elements of attraction to broaden the appeal, and some of these are conspicuously wanting. The book therefore must stand as a bold and creditable exercise in the rendering of a difficult environment, and prompts us to expect something from the same pen which shall be none the less powerful by making a better bid for popularity. There is a great romance yet to be written inside this world of Yiddish and " Gollus " (the dispersion into exile), but it must avoid all bitterness.

I The Swiss Faminly Robinson. With Illustrations in Colour and in Black and White. By CHARLES FOLKARD. A (Dent. 5s. net.) A Middy of the Slave Squadron: A West African Story. By HARRY COLLINGWOOD. Illustrated by W. Rainey, R.I. (Blackie. 5s.) The Great Aeroplane: A Thrilling Tale of A4dventure. By CAPTAIN F. S. BRERETON. Illustrated by Edward S. Hodgson. (Blackie. 6s.) THERE is a certain class of literature, known generally as boys' books, which draws its circle of readers from among people far removed from boyhood, even if they have ever passed through that stage. It is curious how great an attraction these books, as a rule, have over the sisters of those for whom the volumes are primarily intended. The books written for girls are for the most part, or have been until quite recently, of so namby-pamby a description that one can forgive any normal, healthy-minded girl for throwing them aside and appropriating the literature of her brother as a substitute. Thus, boys' books cater for the young of both sexes. But it is not to the young only that these books, when they tell a good, exciting story of adventure, appeal. There is many a grown-up boy who finds as much delight as does his sons in the books that are supposed to be suitable only for children. This attraction of adults to books written for boys is quite excusable; in fact, needs no excuse. The closer a man keeps to his boyhood the better it will be for his happiness and his mental and physical health. "THE Swiss FAMILY ROBINSON." Of all the books ever written for boys " The Swiss Family Robinson " is one of the most interesting, and if any doubt may be raised by this assertion the fact of its survival through innumerable editions until to-day should dispel it. There is such a charm about this unfinished anonymous book that keeps it ever fresh, and it is seldom that the boy or adult, who is first introduced to the entrancing adventures of this shipwrecked family, does not turn again to the pages, after he has read the book once, and reperuse it. In fact, boys are known to have read and reread it four or five times, and there is on record one who read it no less than eleven times, and then probably hungered for a twelfth. The latest edition of this perennially fresh story is that published by Messrs. J. M. Dent and Co. In this edition the print is clear, the paper of stout texture, and above all the illustrations, of which there are about two score, a dozen of them in colours, well suited both to the text and the reader. In choosing a present for a boy or girl, much worse can be done than the purchase of this handsome volume. "A MIDDY OF THE SLAVE SQUADRON." "A Middy of the Slave Squadron" is, as its name denotes, a story of the suppression of the slave trade. The scene is the West African seas, and the period the first quarter of last century. The hero Dick Fortescue's adventures are not confined to the sea. Falling into the hands of the villain, the slave trader, he is put ashore among the savages, and a considerable portion of the book is devoted to a recital of his adventures among the West African natives, and to his escape from them. Boys who know Mr. Collingwood's former stories will welcome this, the latest of his output. "THE GREAT AEROPLANE." In "The Great Aeroplane," the basis, as it were, of the story is one which, outside of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells, would have been inconceivable less than a decade ago. The Great Aeroplane is a far more perfect machine than any which exists as yet, but this story deals with the future rather than the present, and it is permissible to foresee the possibility of very great developments in the newly-discovered science of flying. As is to be expected in a book intended for boys, the hero is of the proper stuff, and so are his adventures, which are numerous and exciting. Boys with a scientific bent in particular will enjoy this book and feel grateful to its author, Captain Brereton.

The Captain1* Toll - Gate. By Frank R. Stockton. (Cassell & Co.) In a 'Memorial Sketch1 written by Mn. Marian E. Stockton we read: " ' The Captain's Toil-Gate' is the last of the works of Frank R. Stockton that will be given to the public." And this fact, rather than any intrinsic feature of the simple holiday tale the book unfolds, must be regarded as its principal claim to consideration. We get a pleasant view of the anthor:? " Mr. Stockton was the most lovable of men. He shed happiness all around him, not from 9 conscious effort, but oat of his own bountiful and loving nature.He hated mourning and gloom.He won the love of everyone who knew him.His stories are, in great part, a reflex of himself. The bright outlook on life ; the courageous spirit; the helpfulness; the sense of the comic rather than the tragic; the love of domestic life; the sweetness of pure affection, live in his books as they lived in himself. He had not the heart to make his stories end unhappily." ' The Captain's Toll-Gate' is the story of a beautiful girl with many lovers; it is essentially American, and written in a pleasant domestic vein, mildly humorous, suggesting the atmosphere of summer holidays in the country.

Among the Stars; or, Wonderful Things in the Sky. By Agnes Giberne. (Seeley & Co.)?Miss Giberne is well known for her writings on popular science, and the success in particular of her little book on ' Sun, Moon, and Stars' has been, as it deserved to be, great. In the preface to the work before us she states that the want of a little volume for children on the subject of astronomy, treated much more simply than in her former book, has repeatedly been suggested to her. Experience only can show whether this be really a desideratum which will be appreciated by the juvenile readers for whose benefit it is intended ; but certainly if it be, no one can supply it better than Miss Giberne. She will allow us to point out that the most recent determinations of the mean distance of the sun make it about two millions of miles greater than that given by her in this treatise ; also that even modern astronomy cannot pretend to assign the amounts of motion in space of the sun and Arcturus with the accuracy there stated.

In her road thither, sIe received a very sevre sdrilling into the etinuette of the court. so) thsat on entering the chateau. the poor girl was so flutared thast she scarcely knew what she was aubouat. The naguast fanmily received her however with astonishing cordiality for such high anti mighty people; and when the little Princess t)OHOTI A affectionately threw her arms around the neck of her new friend, causing thereby much trepidation in the heart of the Baron DE FREUNDSTEIN, the Duke, her father, was pleased urbanely to remark-" This is not Versailles, Baron, and I have not the least objection that your daughter should embrace mine." From this time forward the Baroness seems to have been in constant association with the Mont. beliard family, and it was in their company, and principally through their introduction, that she mixed with all the great people of whom she talks so graphically in her memoirs. About this time, the Dauphiness, MAulE ANrosNarrE, passed through Strasburg, on her arrival into France. The anecdotes and ceremonials of this reception have been so often and so fully given elsewhere, especially in the Autohipgraphy (;f Gokrthe, who was in Strasburg at the time, that it would be quite needless to recapitulate thet here. Suffice it to say that the Baroness enjoyed the honour of being presented to the l)auphtiness, a distinction which, as may be imagined, she appreciated keenly. In speaking of this union between the crowns of France and Austria, the Baroness mentions a circumstance which proves that the etiquette respecting royal marriages is not always so tedious as might be imagined. On the 16th of April, 1770, M. DearonrR negotiated the marriage on behalfof the Dauphin. On the 17th, the future Dauphiness solemnly renounced all claims, paternal as well as maternal. On the 19th, the ceremony was performed in the Augustinian convent, the Archduke FERDINAND representing the Dauphin; and on the 21st, MARm ANomaNYrrs left Vienna on her road to join her husband. In the same year (1776) another marriage was negotiated, which touched the Baroness more nearly-her own. M. d'OnEaKIRci appears to have satistled all her requirements on the score of lineage, for his family dated back to the Crusadles. As to his person, she says that it SwAs handsme, though not remarkably so. 1e was talked of in Strasburg as a model of perfect elegance, and it may be said that lie led the tishioin there, though he was forty years of age." With such a husband, the Baroness could not ftil to be happy. le appears to have allowed her very muc h her own way: and as Mne. d'Onax:aKincu behaved towards him as a good and faithful wife ought to behave, was only moderately expt'nisive, went through the ceremony of asking his permission whenever she required any liberty, and was not at all given to the French school of gadlantry, they appear to have made a most exeniphary couple. Thlis same year appears to have been quite the year tr marriages. In the month of August, the I aroness's dearly ieloved princess, DoioTitEA, was imarried to the future Czar of all the Russias. liethre, however, the ceremony could be completed, it was necessary that the bride should embrace the religion of the Greek church, the established church of Riussia; and upon this the Ilaroness makes the following very naive comment: State reasons are often very severe, and one needs a great deal of courage to submit to them with a good grace. The princess Dorothea, on inrrying the GrandDuke, was obliged to embrace the Greek religion, and was re baptiwted as Marie Foederowna, as every one knows. She must have felt this very deeply; she who was so attached to our holy religion, and so sincerely devoted to her duty. I hewailed this circumstance in the depth of my soul; but it was of unavoidable necessity, and God will, I hope, call her to the truth before the close of her life, spite of her left-handed sign of the cross, and her worship of images. During the year 1778, the Emperor JosEr of Austria travelled over the continent, under the assumed name of the Count FALKNSTrIN. When it was known that he intended passing through Stuttgard, the Duke of WURTEMBUItW wrote to the Emperor, offering him the use of his palace, which, however, his Majesty declined, saying that he would prefer going to an hotel. Lpon this, the Duke of WURTEXaRaO had recourse to the following stratagem: - He ordered all the hotel-keepers of the city to renew their signs, and plced over the door of his palace an enormous board, emblazoned with the Austrian arms, and having these words beneath-" Tax Eursiaon's Ikrrst." Joseph yielded to the touching ingenuity of Duke Charles, and entering into the spirit of the jest, alighted at the palace as if it we:e an hotel. The D~uke received him dressed as an hotel-keeper, and played his part extremely well. Everybody at the court, no matter of what rank, supported some character or other suitable to the occasion. The Emperor was delighted. The following day they all laid aside their masquerading dresses, and the festivities commenced in reality. The Emperor JoSEPiI appears to have been a man of very simple, but sensible, character. His dress was so plain, that, when in Paris, a fisherwoman presenting him with a bouquet, said-" the people who have to pay for the lace on your coat ought to be very happy, M. Count." When a nobleman remarked to him one day that he mixed too much with people in the pubhi streets-" If I would only mix with my equals," said he, "I should shut myself up with my ancestors in the Capuchin Convent, where their ashes repose." In spite, however, of this philosophic turn of mind, he refused to visit VOLTAIRE, who had made great preparations at Ferney to receive him. The Emperor evidently smelt this academic sceance, and passed on, although his carriage almost touched the terrace of the chateau. In vain did the postilions, who had been bribed by the old philosopher, repeat at every crack of their whips,-" that is the chateau of Ferney-there is M. VOLTAIRE." The Emperor would not hear, and looked steadfastly in the opposite direction. Poor VOLTAIRE was inconsolable for this, and invented a thousand stories to avert the laugh naturally raised against him. At the palace of the Cardinal DE ROHAIN, at Strasburg, the Baroness had an opportunity of observing the famous charlatan CAGLIOSTRO, who was at that time laying the foundation of that baleful influence which he succeeded in establishing over the mind of that unfortunate, but weak-minded prelate. Prince LoUIs DE ROIHAN, afterwards Grand Almoner of France, succeeded to the estate and dignities of his uncle, the Cardinal CONSTANTINE, in 1779. Ilis estates were enormous, and lie was, doubtless, the wealthiest prelate in Europe. CAcUIosTino was at that time at the zenith of his fame. lie was travelling about Europe, pretending to cure all sorts of maladies, for which he constantly refused to receive any fee: on the contrary, he was in the habit of distributing immense sums of money among the poor. At the period of his meeting with Mme. it'OBERKIRCu, he was making use of the most extraordinary artifices to attract public notice; among others, it may be cited that he never slept in a bed, and ate nothing but cheese. The impression produced upon Mme. d'OBERKIRCH by this person is very creditable to her good sense and power of penetrating deception. Ie was not, strictly speaking, handsome, but never have I seen a more remark able countenance. His glance was so penetrating, that one would be almost tempted to call it supernatural. I could not describe the expression of his eyes, it was, so to say, a mixture of flame and ice. He attracted and repulsed, and whilst lie terri6ed, inspired an insurmountable curiosity. lIe wore, attached to his watch-chain, and upon his fingers, diamonds which, if they were what they appeared, would be worth a king's ransom. He pretended that they were his own manufacture. All this frippery revealed unmistakeably the charlatan. Directly CAoLIosTno found himself in the company of the baroness, lie began to stare at her, and said abruptly:-" Madame, your mother no longer lives; you have scarcely known her, and you have one daughter. You are the only daughter of your family, and you will have no more children." So far as the past was concerned all this was so; and, after some hesitation, Mme. d'OnERKIRCH confessed it. "And I am as little mistaken in what concerns the fhture," replied CAGLIosTRO. The charlatan apparently made very strenuous endeavours to enrol Mme. d'ODERKitmen among the list of his admirers; but she very speedily saw through his object in doing this, which was to attain, through her means, some access to the Grand-Duchess of Russia, with whom lie knew that she was intimate. Owing, therefore, to her penetration, the plan utterly failed; she seems never to have been deceived for an instant as to the true character of this, the most astute of modern impostors; and the Cardinal de RojIA would have done well, had he listened in time toher warningvoice, instead of suhffiring CAGLIOSTRO to lead him from depth to depth until he became finally involved in that shameful intrigue now known as the 'diamond necklace afTair. Spaking of the manner In which she saw through Is arts, she says, modestly yet philosophically: The plan was not badly conceived, but it failed before the strength of my will-I do not say of my reason, that would have been insufficient; nor do I say my conviction, for I felt it shaken. It is certain that had I yielded to my admiration for the marvellous, I, too, might have become the dupe of this sharper. There are so many charms in the mysterious, there is so much Mlat attached to astrological studies, and to the occult scences. Many who, in these days, are wont to run gaping after mysterious novelties, will do well to ponder deeply over these wise but feminine words of the Baroness d'OBERKIRCH. A passing disquisition upon the noble Chapter of Remirement, is full of interest, insomuch as it throws a light upon those strange associations, half secular and half religious, into which the highborn ladies of France and the German Empire used then to band themselves. The Chapter of St. Pierre de Remirement was situated in the diocese of St. Di, and was supposed to have been founded by St. RomARC in A.D., 620. The canonesses did not make vows, they might return to the world, and even marry. Each had the right of choosing a successor, who, during her term of minority, was called a lady-niece. It was necessary, however, for every candidate to prove a noble descent, both by father and mother, of nine generations, or two hundred and twentyfive years. The ladies lived in great pomp, and had great authority. Amongst the prerogatives of the Abbess, the most valuable was that of setting free, on certain days, all the prisoners in the Conciergerie. Respecting the liberties enjoyed by these ladies, Mme. d'OBERKIRCIH discreetly says: Ladies of the highest rank, both French and foreigners, ambitioned the honour of being admitted into this house, which offers so many attractions; its inhabitants enjoying the liberty of married women without the incum. brance of a husband, who may torment and contradict them. I will not become the echo of the reports and accusations which have been so often made against the chapters. Perfection cannot be expected in human dnstitutions; all have their share of good and evil. (To be continued.)

SHAME THE DEVIL, bv Liam O'Flaherty. Grayson. lOs. 6d. MR. O'FTLALERTY'S particular devil takes the shape of " those who by their flattery would shackle me with the traits of their mediocrity." He has set out to " tear the veil of sanctity from my face," and in order to do so he retailsfor the reader the physical and spiritual adventures of three months during which he fled from himself and the world to face the truth about himself. During it he passes through every variety of despair and exaltation about himself, each one recalling occasions on which he has been possessed with similar emotions. He also holds various conversations and enjoys one or two adventures in the company of odd and picturesque ruffians and others. He writes a short story, which is reproduced. He concludes with the declaration " I have said good-bye to my despair, since it cannot stay the swooping of the carrion crows." His writing about himself is, as I have hinted by means of the above quotations, childishly grandiloquent, and it would be possible without great difficulty to belittle the whole book as a piece of naive selfglorification. And the accusation would have a good deal of truth in it, for the weaknesses to which the author confesses are those which it is fashionable today to admire. Violence, carelessness about money, an apparent treachery justified by inner necessity, uncontrolled passions, are envied if they are accompanied, as Mr. O'Flaherty is careful to point out that they are accompanied in his case, by physical recklessness and the (unanalysed) vision of an artist. To treat the book altogether in this manner would not, however, be quite fair. As an attempt to tell the truth it is hardly worth consideration. As a confession it is a transparent fake. As an exhibition of the emotions of a brilliant writer who feels his imaginative purpose endangered by the indiscipline of his passions, it is an absorbing human document. ALAN M. WELLS.

WORLD WITHOUT END. By HELEN THOMAS. Heinemann. O6. MRS. THOMAS, in this continuation of that story of her life with Edward Thomas which she began hi her earlier volume, "As It Was," has written a very beautiful book. One finds it difficult to put a fingr upon the exact quality which mae tis sipkale sor of what, when all is said, was a simple life and relationship so t Perhaps it is the deep shneity and the fankna of the record of her love for her husband. One can also point to the tr ous appreo of nature which they shared, and for which thIr restless moving from house to house in the Weald cotmtry of southern England gave such opportunities. There are some lovely passages along this line of nature love, so that the book becomes a lyric of English country life, as well as a love song in prose.-- The final chapter, recording her farewell to her husband when he left for France in 1917 is one of the most poignant of writing we remember. Altogether " World Without End " is a volume to possess and to treasure. Not the least charm of it is that it sends us back to Edward Thomas's own fine poetry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memoirs of Monsieur d'Artaqnan. Now for the First Time translated into English by Ralph Nevill. ? Part II. The Lieutenant. (H. S. Nichols.) ? Intrinsically the interest in the second part of the 'Memoirs of d'Artagnan' of Courtilz de Sandras is not inferior to that in the opening volume. The Three Musketeers have practically, however, vanished from the book, taking with them a portion of its charm. Scarcely a sign of indebtedness on the part of Dumas or Maquet is in this instalment to be traced. Once, indeed, Athos consents, at the instance of D'Artagnan, to disguise himself and act as spy upon a certain so-called Chevalier de la Carliere, with whom D'Artagnan has a difficulty. No mention whatever is made of Miladi, Aramis, or Porthos. Besmaux, however, in whom some of the more grotesque traits of Porthos are preserved, is frequently in evidence, as is M. de Treville, now to some extent under a cloud. It is possible that D'Artagnan's unfortunate suit to the fair widow of a Conseiller de Paris, which resulted in her imprisonment in Pierre-Encise and death in captivity, supplied some ideas for the fate of Madame de Bonacieux. On the whole, there is very little that awakens thoughts or recollections of the 'Trois Mousquetaires.' The book is princi- pally occupied with the picture of Mazarin? whose avarice and greed are painted in strong colours?the wars of the Fronde, and other similar matters. It details a series of love adventures, if by such names D'Artagnan's intrigues can be dignified. In the case of the before-mentioned widow of a conseiller he displayed some loyalty, and in that in which a woman of dishonest occupation ottered him a large fortune on the condition of his marrying her he indulged in scruples which, however natural they may appear to-day, might have been, and were, judged excessive at the middle of the seventeenth century. For the widow, who was older than himself, he confesses that he had no affection, coveting only her crowns. It is difficult, however, to see what he could do more than he did with a view to saving her from her enemies. In the later scenes of the action D'Artagnan visits England, whore ho entangles himself in an adventure of gallantry, the results of which prove sufficiently uncomfortable, since he is gagged, manacled, and smuggled into France, carried into Paris, and immured in the Bastille, whence he escapes with some difficulty. For a man who was in fact a secret agent of Mazarin to lind himself compelled to remain six weeks a prisoner in the Bastille was sufficiently odd. In the present instalment some omissions are made. These do not, as the translator is at pains to make his readers comprehend, at all interfere with the more vivacious details of the story. They are none the less to be regretted when, as in the case of Bussy-Rabutin, they detract somewhat from the portrait of the man. The translation is, as in the previous volume, sprightly, though the frequent use of phrases such as "none too rich," " none too badly," Ac, degenerates into a mannerism. Mr. Nevill's notes are few and to the point. It is, however, too much to assert that the writings of Jean Francois Sarrasin (or Sarasin), with whom D'Artagnan was thrown into considerable intimacy, "are now completely forgotten." They have been more than once reprinted in tho present century.

Mliss Fairbank writes with knowledge, and gives a lively, intimate and convincing picture of political life.

Ile has propitiated ii all classes without any sairilice of dignity orin- ' ti di-pciitlciict.?hilt simply by the ext rcisc of good I r temper iind sagacity. In this point of view, we g look upon his example tis invaluable. Ile luis j arrogated to himself none ol' the privileges which s I certain men of talent have in all ages been in a the habit of pleading as an excuse for violating \ ! the decencies of lite ; he has been a living con- I fut itit>tt of tlie puling and pernicious scntiuien- I j talisin that would ascribe to the poetical tem- t perament au unfitness for the discharge ol' those t duties which the various relations t,f society ; \ i impose; he htis shown that their t-ew^/.v does not j account for the ill luck, as it is termed, that t sometimes follows literary men?hut that, on the t I contrary, genius, if united to industry and good - ! sense, will serve to increase those chances of i i success in life, which so commonly wait on these ! ; ; latter qualities even when disunited from their I ', glittering adjunct. ] 1 The lirst of these volumes, to which our obsi-r- ' ' , vatioiiswiil be cotifuied,consists ol'Introihictions . ' , to his various Poem.-, ol' licmarks t-n popular ' poetry, and on Imitations of thc Ancient Ballad, ' together with au Appendix, in which are to he found two or three letters from his early friend Monk Lewis. In the Introductions, Sir Walter favours the world with the history ol'the circumstances under which his poetry was coin- I posed; ami iii the ess.iy on the Ancient Btdlad, ? , we .are made acquainted with the circumstances '? which tirst directed his attention to poetry tts a - profession. In short, wc have in this volume the history of his mind up to the term of middle : age. and as ti necessary consequence, the history ' of public taste ! > the same period. We may here , trace thc gradual rise of ti reputation unmatched ; in uioi'e-rn times--of a reputation and of talent. ; j that, like tin- tree figured by the prophetical 1 writer of the Old Testament,haw-shot forth their 1 brunches in every direction, until till living things ? I court their refreshing inlliieuce. | Sir Walter's lather is w-.ll known; he was ! j a writer to the signet in I'.dinburgh, and a niau ' I of good family. lt bas been stud. Sir Walter ' j tells us, that his situation in life bas been matei ri.-dly altered by his literary successes. This, lie , I takes occasion to deny?not in the belief, that j to have elevated tiiiuscltin the settle of society I ; i hythe force of his own talents would derogate ' ; , in .any way ir-au hts merits, hut simply because i ? j the statement is not true. His education was a i j good one hut a tit licate state of health during ! f ! the period of boyhood, prevented him from pro- j i ; titing by it to tlie full extent. His father's cir- j ' I cumstano s were atlluent?and thc private fcr\ I tune to which he was entitled, and to which he k. ', ul'.iniat-.-ly suceecdetl. raised him above the neI I cessity of writing for hrciiil. His destin.-ition was ,. ' the Si otch bar. and to that he was accordingly n j cidled, agreeably to the forms observed in the I Scottis'n courts. ' At that period, now somewhere about forty years - j ago, poetry was ;it a very low ebb in thiscouutry. I Cowper was dead; ami the lame of Burns was confined to Scotland. The poetical genius of (iei'many had not yet lent the impulse which she was soon destined to impart to the spirit ot' Coleridge .ind the compeers with whom he bas through life bet n associated: indeed, the names ol' Klopsteck. Schiller, and (ioeihe, were scarcely known in l'.ngland. A French translation ol' some of the more remarkable productions of the (ieiiuan school at length lound its way to Scotland , ami Sir Wain r forthwith devoted himself to the study of dcrmaii. In a very short period we lind him adventuring' cn translations, und even commuting these to the press, though the experiment seems to have been attended with results by no means flattering to an author's vanity. About this time, accident made him acipiaiiited with Lewis, fresh from Germany, and inoculated with the virus of its poetry. This intimacy, strengthened, of course, young Scott's tendencies; iiutl lcd to the formation of a literary partnership between them. Lewis was engaged in preparing " Tides of Wonder" for the press; and his young Scotch friend agreed to supply him with a few contributions. The work appeared, and from various causes failed completely. Still, however, Sir Walter's heart failed him not; timi very soon afterwards, we find him engaged iu compiling the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. The success of ibis undertaking was but indifferent; while the notoriety which it iind his previous poetical attempts had procured for him, was of a kind not at all calculated to smooth tlie path of his profession. At this period (iso;') in tact, the solicitors in the Supreme Court of Scotland, with whom it rests in ii great measure to elevate or depress a youn-j* adv neate, began to look upon him with au unfavourable eye. Ballad-making was not much to their taste: and the young mau that gave himself up to it, was, iu their opinion, lost to better things. Sir Walter was, by this time too, married, and the lather nf a family. There were, consctpientiy, fresh demands upon bis industry; ;ind iit length it appeared to him necessary to give up his profession, or to give up poetry. This latter alternative he was most unwilling to adopt. Ile shrank from the dry pursuits of law? ; he loved licld-sports?he was engaged heart and soul in the drilling of a body of yeomanry caj valry?iind bis father, whose feelings would ; have been deeply wounded by any hesitation on bi- son's part to sacrifice every other pursuit to . law, wa. dead. Sir Walter, too, with his chai rai lt-ri-tic prudence, had contrived to secure the \ shtiili'ship of thc county of Selkirk?a judicial i appointment, which yielded him about dill)/, a year; and, with the firm determination to render himself still further independent of his poetical labours, liv s. curing, if possible, one of thc easy and hu ratho appointments of which there aro ! several in the Court of Session, be at length dci tciiniuetl to swear allegiance to the Muses. I The " Lay of the Last Minstrel " was the first of that series nf poems on which his fame rested ' so long; iind wc have in the present volume a ; very interesting sketih of the doubts and dithj cubics which beset him, while engaged with the \ subject iinil design ol' that work. To devise il : measure appropriate to the changing theme, cost ; him a great deal of trouble ; and the novelty of ' his manner served, it seems, to perplex two ! judicious friends to whom he submitted a very j small portion of his labours. Their perplexity j leil him to distrust the value ol' his conceptions. I Ile accordingly abandoned the work, and only ? recommenced it, on being questioned by one of i his critics as to thc progress he had made, lt I appears that, tilter leaving Sir Walter, they held j ;i conference on the subject, and agreed that the j expciiiiu ut proposed by their young friend was j well worth making; but they had not seen bim i from the period when their opinions were solij cited, nor had held any communication with bini j on the subject. Thus emboldened, and having tinnily resolved upon his plan, Sir Walter finished the poem at the rate of a canto a week, lt appeared in iSbo. and raised the author's reputation above that of all contemporary poets. Among it* open admirers were Fox and Pitt. Thirty thousand copies were suki; the author's remuneration amounted to tint)/. "Marinion" followed next in order. Before its appearance, Sir Walter had been appointed, by the inilueuce of Mr. Pitt, one of thc principal ciciks nf tlie Court of Session?an otiice that vii ids, we believe, 121)0/. a year: though he did not immcdiatclv -succeed to its emoluments, lt had been his intention to bestow more care upon I the productions that might succeed the Lay; but I the embarrassments of a dear friend forced him j to tempt the press once more, without atl'ording ; him leisure to bestowon "Marmion" the polish i which be would under other circumstances have I imparted to it. Its success, however, was even j more flattering than that of its predecessor. It ? did not, indeed, escape criticism of a bitter kind. Lord Byron's animadversions, to he sure, were \ merely personal; turning, tis they did, upon the j circiimstanceoftlieauthorhavingreieived 1000/. j for the work,?a matter with which neither he ; nor the public had anything to do ;?hut there j appeared about the same time, strictures on the plot and management of the poem, to which Sir i Walter frankly confesses, he could have oll'ered , no reply, and therefore he attempted none.? j knowing, that " an author is never so decidedly | condemned as on his own confession, and may long timi apologists anti partizans until he gives up bis own cause." The " Lady of the Lake," which he undertook rashly, as it appeared to a warm and discriminating friend, constituted the climax ol' his poetical successes. Shortly afterwards, the school of which he was tho founder began to lose its influence, in consequence ol' the facilities which it presented to imitators and parodists; and about the same time, the star ol' Byron began to culminate in the literary horizon. Still, however, Sir Walter Wits unwilling to yield bis honours without a struggle, even to this formidable competitor. " Rokeby." and the " Lord of the Isles" were the fruits of a resolution that had something heroic about it. The success of both was, in the eyes of booksellers, respectable: hut proved iusullieient to satisfy the ambition of the author. Luckily for the world, he looked upon tlit'si-comparative failures as a hint to try his fortune in a dillerent walk of literature,?and forthwith "Waverley" appeared. Sir Walter from that time bade adieu to poetry, and hastened to assume a still prouder empire over the feelings ami aliictions of men, than any which the poetry of later ages has supplied. Of the criticism which is to be met with in this volume, we may observe that it is distinguished by its sound, healthy, rnmmmi-si inc tone. There is nothing very profound in the results at which the author arrives?nor much relinement in the analytic processes of which he avails himself, lt is altogether free from the vile slang hy which modern criticism is disgraced ; anti to those, wini, like ourselves, may be sick of its perpetual straining and affectation, the criticisms iii this volume are calculated to alford very considerable pleasure.

We heartily commend this finely felt and finely expressed collection of studies. There is-real art in it-and real heart.

440   9417486   A Selection from the Correspondence of the late Thomas Chalmers, D.D., LL.D.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Selection from the Correspondence of the late Thomas Chalmers, D.D., LLD. Edited by his Son-in-Law, the Kev. >V ilhani Hanna, LL.D. Edinburgh, Constable Sc Co.; London, Hamilton, Adams & Co. Tins volume consists of 410 letters,?some of them addressed to Dr. Chalmers by various correspondents, but the greater humber written by him, between the years 1811 and 1847. Although the letters do not throw any decidedly new light upon Dr. Chalmers's life, opinions, and character, already to amply illustrated in Dr. Hanna's Biography (in which Biography many of the more important letters of Dr. Chalmers have already been published),?yet, to the many who venerate the memory of this, in some respects, ultimus Scotorum, and especially to the religious world in Dr. Chalmers's native country, the volume will be precious as an additional relic of a man of whom they can never leam too much. The large heart of the writer, his manliness of character, his shrewd sense and practical wisdom, as well as the depth and seriousness of his religious feelings, are fully exhibited in these letters. By tar the majority of them, however, are letters written in a strain of religious advice to private friends and correspondents; while ofthe remainder not a few are portions of Dr. Chalmers's extensive correspondence on the topics of ecclesiastical controversy in which he was engaged towards the close of his life. This part of the correspondence includes several important letters to the Marquis of Lorne, now Duke of Argyle, on the Non-Intrusion controversy. Of matter of more specific literary interest there is not much in the volume; though now and then in the course of the letters we have capital specimens of the writer's sagacious Scottish humour, and of his well-known genius for broad generalization and splendid expression. From among the very few letters in the series which it would be appropriate to quote entire in our columns, we select the following, on account of its subject. It is addressed to a correspondent whose name is not given.? " Edinburgh, 17th September, 1846. " Sir,?I received both your letters. The first I laid aside, because of my great aversion to any direct application for my autograph; tuid in virtue of which it is my general practice to leave all such requests unanswered. Your second letter of May 6th, I placed among the letters to which I might reply; because I felt a wish at the time to let you know the grounds of my antipathy to a practice which I think is not in accordance with good taste. I find, however, that I have not time for the full statement of these grounds; and shall only say in the general, that I feel as if, on the-one side, the making of such a request implies a certain degree of indelicacy; and, on the other side, that in the granting of it there must be a certain sense of awkwardness, as the very act involves at least the semblance of vanity. And yet the desire of having autographs is legitimate and natural; hut the right way to go about thu formation of a collection is to seek, and not from the person himself, but from any of his correspondents, such letters or fragments of his handwriting as can anywhere be found. I should imagine that to every man who feels as he ought, a naked request for his autograph must be extremely distasteful. In sending you this autograph, it is a relief that I should have something to write about; and all the more so, that along with the autograph you have my testimony against the method in which they are sometimes sought after both by individuals and by such public bodies as you represent.?With best wishes for the prosperity of your museum, I have the honour to be, Sir, yours truly, Thomas Chalmers." The following is a curious morsel for the mathematicians,?and illustrates the zeal with which, to the very end of his life, Dr. Chalmers kept up a kind of mathematical amateurship. It is addressed to a Professor of Mathematics in one of the Scottish Universities.? "Morningside, 7tli September, 1844. " My dear Sir,?Can you tell me of any author who treats of the properties nnd progression of prime numbers't The following is a curious order, observed for some time, in the proportion which the composite numbers bear to all others, and from which I had of hoped the absolute proportions of the composites to the primes throughout the whole infinity of numbers might have been ascertained within an indefinitely near approximation :? "The numbers in which 2 does not enter as an aliquot part are to number at large as 1 to 2, or \. " The numbers in which 2 and 3 do not enter as aliquot parts are as 1 to 3, or ?. " The numbers in which 2, 3, and 5 do not enter, as 4 to 15, or ^. " The numbers in which 2,3,5,7, do not enter, as 8 to 35, or $. "The numbers in which 2, 3, 5, 7, ll, do not enter, as 16 to 77, or 4?" See the promise then I had on entering this investigation, that, if you take the primes in order, 1,2,3,5,7,11, Sec., you would arrive at the general proposition that the composites formed of them successively would so run as to leave remainders, which bore to all numbers proportions expressed by fractions, whose numerators each double its predecessor, as 2, 4, 8, lb', &c, and whose denominators were the products of the two last prime numbers that had been taken up in the progress of the investigation, as, 2=1x2,6 = 2x3, 15 = 3 x 5, 35 = 5 X 7, and 77= ll x 1. Judge of my disappointment, then, when proceeding to the next prime number 13, and expecting the result -fa. I found it very difficult, and thus has my goodly progression been most cruelly put an end to_Yours very truly, "Thomas Chalmers." Dr. Chalmers was, to the very end of his life, singularly liable to be impressed by whatever came before him in the shape of a new social or intellectual movement. In his latest years he applied himself with all the enthusiasm of youth to new studies and speculations; and there k evidence in his Correspondence that in some points his candid inquiries led him to modifications of his former views. Thus, as a theologian, he sympathized more in his old age than formerly with the school of those who addict themselves specially to the interpretation of the Biblical prophecies. Neither by nature nor by the associations of the time of his youth and manhood, was Dr. Chalmers disposed to asceticism ; no man loved cheerful society and all the innocent helps to it more than he:?and yet, it is evident from the following letter that in his later years he viewed Teetotalism with interest and even with a guarded respect. The letter is addressed to Capt. Burnett of Monboddo.? "Edinburgh, 23rd March, 1847. " My dear Sir,?There is a most entire accordance of principle betwixt us in all that you say throughout your last most interesting letter. Drunkenness is the greatest master-evil in our land. There is a variety started lately in regard to Temperance Associations, which, I think, will take well with many who recoil somewhat from the present constitution of them. An association has been recently formed by the Rev. Mr. Reid here, an eloquent and zealous teetotaller, named a Total Abstinence Association, on religious principles, and without the pledge. It hits my view better than did the former system, and I am now endeavouring to make a conscience of conforming to the object of such a societj, and hope to do it better than, I fear, I could have done under the yoke of a written engagement.?Give my kindest regards, &c. &.&, "Thomas Chalmers." This volume of Correspondence, we repeat, will be interesting chiefly to those with whom Dr. Chalmers's is already a familiar and venerated name, and to whom all fresh minutiae respecting him will be for ever welcome. Far those who have still to become adequately acquainted with the man in all the breadth and strength of his character, the appropriate hook will be, not the present volume, but Dr. Hanna's general Biography,?to which it forms a kind of Appendix.

Bertrand of Brittany. By Warwick Deep- ing. (Harper & Brothers.) Mb. Deeping has a good story to tell, and he tells it well. Here the review might end, for we have to add that the Bertrand du Guesclin of history, much as we admire him, would hardly have acted the hero in the way the author makes him. That is the worst of fixing a time and a man for your story, since the writer finds himself in face of previous conceptions of his hero. Mr. Deeping has made a notable advance in simplicity of manner, which tells greatly for effect.

The Letters of Elisabeth Barrett Browning. Edited by F. G. Kenyon. 2 vols. (Smith, Elder & Co.) These two closely printed volumes contain 44 a selection from a large mass of letters, written at all periods in Mrs. Browning's life, which Mr. Browning, after his wife's death, reclaimed from the friends to whom they had been written, or from their representatives." A few passages had already been quoted by Mrs. Sutherland Orr in her 'Life of Browning,' otherwise they are absolutely new material, and it is not too much to say that they are the first adequate contribution which has been made to a real knowledge of Mrs. Browning. The two volumes of letters to R. H. Horne, published in 1877, have indeed a distinct value of their own, but a value, after all, only partial. Those letters were written mostly between 1839 and 1845, that is to say while the writer was still Miss Barrett. They are concerned exclusively with literary questions, and with literary questions more particularly interesting to her correspondent than to herself; and that correspondent, it must be remembered, was personally unknown to her. Within their limits they are full of interest, and they contain, here and there, passages of exquisite and subtle criticism, sometimes expressed with a sort of earnest brilliance, as, for instance, the description of Sappho, 44 who broke off a fragment of her soul to be guessed by?as creation did by its fossils." In actual literary criticism they are perhaps richer than the letters of the same period contained in the collection edited by Mr. Kenyon. But the inestimable value of this new collection is that it contains not merely interesting critical writing, but the intimate expression of a personality, from the time when, at twenty-eight, she writes on one page, 441 have been reading the Bridgewater treatise, and am now trying to understand Prout upon Chemistry. I shall be worth something at last, shall I not 1" and on the next, 44 We have had a crowded Bible meeting, and a Church Missionary and London Missionary meeting besides," to the time, twenty-seven years later, when the last letter, written in Florence, cries, 44 May God save Italy!" Here are letters written to the closest friends of every period: Mr. Boyd, the "dear Grecian" who gave her the "wine of Cyprus," Miss Mitford and Mrs. Jameson later on, Miss Browning still later, Mrs. Martin throughout, and Mr. Kenyon almost throughout, with letters to Chorley, Ruskin, and other less intimate friends, all written with the same beautiful sincerity of feeling, the same delicate frankness, the same womanly mind and heart. And what is perhaps more notable in them than any other single characteristic is their affectionateness. They are the most affectionate letters ever written: almost every correspondent is a " dearest," or " very dear," or 44 ever dear" friend; to almost every correspondent is she " ever affectionately yours." And yet no letters could be more free from that feminine quality which so often goes with this warmth of adjective: the quality of gush. She convinces you, every time that Pl wi ei tn W( T a u] rc she uses a loving word, that she means precisely what she says, and that therefore she says it, quietly, because it is meant. "I am stupid perhaps," she writes to Mr. Ruskin, " but for my life I never could help being grateful to the people who loved me, even if they happened to say, ? I can't help it, not I!' " At the end of her life, when she is tired in heart with many disappointments, she writes to a young friend, in one of her few bitter moments:? " I congratulate you on liking anybody better. That's pleasaut for you, at any rate. My changes are always the other way. I begin by seeing the beautiful in most people, and then conies the disillusion. It isn't caprice or unsteadiness ; oh no, it's merely fate. My fate, I mean. Alas, my bubbles, my bubbles !" But hers, indeed, were the eyes which can see the after-image of the bubble glittering under closed eyelids, long after that radiant life of a moment has melted into air. Such, 8 and so pathetically seen in these pages, was her unswerving belief in Napoleon III., and in the yet more illusory good faith of the " rapping" spirits. And it is this same attitude of mind which imparts their extraordinary evenness to all these letters. Full of individual sympathy as she is, she writes to every one, not only from the same brain, but from the same heart. It never occurs to her to limit or restrain whatever feeling breathes within her as she writes. Always without self-consciousness, she speaks on and on, and we listen, as if a low-voiced woman, sitting in the evening by a fireside, turned now to one friend, now to another, smiling and speaking as if one were not better or dearer to her than another. But let us look into these letters, so much " what letters ought to be?her own talk upon paper " (it is she who says it of Miss Mitford), trying to see something of the personality of whose growth they are so unconscious a witness. And these letters fall at once into two groups : the letters before her marriage and the letters after. It is difficult, yet not after all impossible, to realize that she was forty years of age at the time of her marriage. Up to then her letters are the letters of a girl, of a girl of genius, a learned lady, indeed, but always a girl. Then, suddenly, she is a woman, and she has dropped, as she crosses the Channel on that perilous, wise undertaking, all that was a weight in her learning and all that was unripe in her sentiment. The very way in which she takes suffering, so constantly her companion, is quite different; her very evasions of that fellow traveller, or guide perhaps, are new. First it was Greek, ana Greek (one realizes more clearly than ever) was but one of those occupations which are the equivalent of narcotics. ** You know," she answers a question from Mr. Boyd in 1842, ** I have gone through every line of the three tragedians long ago, in the way of regular, consecutive reading. You know also that I had at different times read different dialogues of Plato ; but when, three years ago, and a few months previous to my leaving home, 1 became possessed of a complete edition of his works, edited by Bekker, why then I began with the first volume aud went through the whole of his writings, both those I knew and those I did not know, one after another, and have at this time read, not only all that is properly attributed to Plato, but even those dialogues and epistles which pass falsely under his name?everything except two books 1 think, or three, of the treatise 4 De Legibus,' which I shall finish in a week or two." This comes between news of " a carriage, a patent carriage with a bed in it, and set upon some hundreds of springs.on its road down to me" at Torquay, and a reflection:? 44 That life is short and art long appears to us more true than usual when we lie all day long on a sofa and are as frightened of the east wind as if it were a tiger." It was under such conditions as these, then, and under the influence of a friend apparently so charming, unreasonable, and persistent as Mr. Boyd, that the Greek studies, which went to the making of the essays on Greek Christian poets, published in these columns, and the translation of the 4 Prometheus,' were carried on. That they should have alternated with the reading of innumerable novels, in the intervals of creative work, was thus much of tho nature of an accident, with which actual personal choice had but little to do. iEschylus and Gregory Nazianzen were but a substitute? the best at hand?for Browning and Italy. When Browning and Italy came, Greek went; there is scarcely a reference to it in any subsequent letter. It meant less to her, indeed, than it does to most people, for from the first, though she was not at first aware of it, in her strangely protracted girlhood, it was the emotional, and, in an emotional sense, the moral aspects of things which appealed to her. All thia while, certainly, she was writing some of her finest poetry, as well as 44 getting deeper and deeper into correspondence with Robert Browning, poet and mystic, and we are growing to be the truest of friends." And we see that as early as 1844 she had conceived the idea of some [ I day writing te: he ve tr Si tr m e\ P< oi ai Ul tc e^ P( tl f< si d V a v d fi 8 I r f t t c i i c t 1 ( 1 44 a poem comprehending the aspect and manners of modern lite, and flinching at nothing of the conventional.Now I do think that a true poetical novel?modern, and on the level of the manners of the day?might be as good a poem as any other, and much more popular besides." Sho looks around her, too, and sees in Tennyson " one of God's singers, whether he knows it or does not know it"; and at a very early date has met Wordsworth and Landor, and "felt the difference between great genius and eminent talent." Poetry is always the supreme thing to her, and seen clearly to be her life's work. But there is?now, as later?singularly little theory in rospect to it, with singularly little sense of that labour which is art. For poetry always was to her, not an art, but a mission. In one of her latest letters she defines, for the first time, and with precise accuracy, her own conception of what it should be. " I have written," she says to Mr. Chorley, 44 not to please you or any critic, but the deepest truth out of my own heart and head. I don't dream and make a poem of it. Art is not either all beauty or all use, it is essential truth which makes its way through beauty into use." This is a beautiful and, in its way, an admirable definition. But by its enthronement of "truth" above beauty she is leaving room for all that intrusion of minor, temporary, and distracting questions which has done so much to damage her own verse. It is true that she says " essential truth"; but what is "essential truth"? Surely, after all, one's own conception ot truth ; and how variable and uncertain that may be, in the heart of bo womanly a woman every reader of her poems knows. Of poetry as vision and of poetry as the art of verse she seems to have been but little aware. " Thought out coldly, then felt upon warmly," she says of her attitude towards "the facts of things." But no; every line of these letters shows how impossible it was for her to think coldly, to think without interpenetrating thought with feeling. It was more her loss that, as she says, " I don't dream." Never for a moment did she feel impersonally toward the art of poetry. And here we find at once her merit and her limitation. The letter of eleven pages (vol. i. p. 286) written to Mrs. Martin from Pisa immediately after her marriage tells, for the first time quite adequately, the whole story of that best-considered of runaway marriages. This letter, invaluable in its revelation of all that was strongest in mind, frailest in body, and most sensitive in temperament, in its writer, full of nobility, tenderness, practical wisdom, cannot be quoted from without injustice : it must be read as a whole. And now, after this narrative, bridging the gulf between the old life and the new, begins the record of the new life; and, as has been said, the learned young lady of the earlier letters disappears, leaving the woman who looks round her in the world. At once the outer world comes into the picture, and, what she has " neither seen nor imagined the like of in any way," the Duomo at Florence: "tesselated marbles (the green treading its elaborate pattern into the dim yellow, which seems the general hue of the structure), climb against the sky, self-crowned with that prodigy of marble domes." Soon she has recognized, by the thrill with which she finds it, that her real home and fatherland is Italy; and the old love of France?a literary love, dating from the time when she " used to be ministered to through the prison bars by Balzac, George Sand, and the like immortal improprieties"?becomes actual in the delight of Paris, the sympathy with. French politics, and later on the longed-for meeting with George Sand:? 44 And now, am I to tell you that I have seen George Sand twice, and am to see her again I Ah, there is no time to tell you, for I must shut up this letter. She sate, like a priestess, the other morning in a circle of eight or nine men, giving no oracles, except with her splendid eyes, and warming her feet quietly, in a general silence of the most profound deference. There was something in the calm disdain of it which pleased me, and struck me as characteristic. She was George Sand, that was enough : you wanted no proof of it." She is at home in France at once, and almost her first comment is :? 44 The clash of speculative opinion is dreadful here, practical men catch at the ideal as if it were a loaf of bread, and they literally set about cutting out their Romeos 4 into little stars,' as if that were the most natural thing in the world." She goeB to see the ' Dame aux Camelias' on its fiftieth night, and here is her acute, characteristic comment:? ?'I disagree with the common outcry about its immorality. According to my view it is moral and human. But I never will go to see it again, for it almost broke my heart and split my head. I had a headache afterwards for twenty-four hours. Even Robert, who gives himself out for blase" on dramatic matters, couldn't keep the tears from rolling down his cheeks. The exquisite acting, the too literal truth to nature everywhere, was exasperating? there was something profane in such familiar handling of life and death. Art has no business with real graveclothes when she wants tragic drapery?has she ? It was too much altogether like a bull fight." Nothing shows us more clearly, in a single glimpse, the morbid sensibility (" I cried so that I was ill for two days," she writes to another correspondent) and at the same time the clear consciousness of things as they were which underlay that sensibility, neither having the least command over the other. Emotion in her was a kind of uncontrollable physical instinct, in which she paid her tax to humanity as heavily as the weakest of her sex. Scarcely before reading these letters, in which " And this time also I shall not die, perhaps," is almost her most emphatic sense of safety, could any one have properly realized how far her over-abandonment to emotion in her poems is a mero question of physical condition, from whose influence not the bravest soul in the world could escape. She was not, she could not be, one of those deep, secret, all but silent natures (like Christina Rossetti) in whom tho heart, when it is hurt, does not cry; the tears had to come, and how often were they 4< tears of perfect moan " ! All through -these letters, unchanging as they are in that deep moral earnestness to which a flitting sense of humour gives daily currency, there is a steady growth in intellect, in clearness of mind?a growth, as she calls it, "of soul." And so it is that the finest sayings come comparatively late, and get finer and finer to the end. Of her spiritualistic fancies she says *.? 44 You know I am rather a visionary, and inclined to knock round at all the doors of the present world to try to get out, so that I listen with respect to every goblin story of the kind." Of Miss Mitford she says :? 44 She made mistakes ono couldn't help smiling at, till one grew serious to adore her for it." 44 Yes," she writes, 44 there are terrible costs in this world. We get knowledge by losing what we hoped for, and liberty by losing what we loved." And again:? 44Death is a face-to-face intimacy; age, a thickening of the mortal mask between souls." But it should not be forgotten that this correspondence throws light, not only on the personality of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, but on the more difficult personality of Robert Browning as well. Her comments on him are at times of real critical value, as when she says "it is his way to see things as passionately as other people feel them." All that we read about Balzac and Stendhal and George Sand is a real addition to our knowledge of Browning. The child's remark :? 441 shall read all Dumas's [novels], to begin with. And then I shall like to read papa's favourite book, 4 Madame Bovary ' " ; everything about Landor, and especially "Robert always said that he owed moro as a writer to Landor than to any contemporary " ; the account of Browning working at drawing and modelling because "he can't rest from serious work in light literature, as I can " ; and pp. 434-6 of the second volume, written to Miss Browning, with their minute analysis: all these, and many other illuminating touches, are not the least interesting or important passages in the book. And, more than all, the picture which every page, from the year 1846 onwards, helps unconsciously to paint, the picture of a "marriage of true minds" unique in the history of men and women of genius : that is perhaps the most delightful gift to us in these varied and fascinating volumes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONE FAIR DAUGHTER. by Owen Rutter. Gollaws. 8s. 6d. THERE are three ways of bringing up children. The first is to spoil them by kindness; the second is to spoil them by discipline; and the third is to spoil them by indifference. I find that in practice I adopt the last method, probably because, like that unpleasant person St. Paul, I am not amused by childish things. I detest the noise children make, my nerves are exasperated by their destructive curiosity, and I am bored and stifled by their nursery interests. I try conscientiously to recall the intensity of thought and feeling which animate their lives, but I find that my imagination has died in that respect, and that my memories of my own infancy are dim and reluctant. It is an absolute agony to me to have to try and write a letter to a child. I make all these confessions because I believe I represent a large section of adult humanity which today is puzzled and secretly rebellious about the modem sanctification of the child. My perverse reaction against this attitude almost makes me agree with John Wesley that a child should be put in a school where he or she begins lessons at five in the morning and goes on until nine at night, with no pause for games. I am therefore not qualified to review Mr. Rutter's book. It makes me writhe. It turns my stomach. Yet when I examine his principles and practice I find it difficult to disagree with any particular detail. He is very sensible about such things as religious instruction, choice of school, inculcation of a social sense. He appears to have almost a genius for instructive games. And he actually enjoys playing with children. Thinking it over calmly, I believe my instinctive revulsion from his book is mainly due to one unfortunate and distorting convention which he adopts. He eliminates the mother from the book. He might be a widower writing for widowers. And they are always slightly pathetic people. The only passive part played by Mr. Rutter in the life of his only child whom he calls " Twinkle " was when she was in the act of leaving the womb. The reader feels that Mr. Rutter must have resented that maternal interference. Then again he believes several things which I disbelieve. He says that men " are usually fonder of children than women are. They often make better mothers than women". I believe that they seldom make better mothers than women. Take, for instance, Mr. Midshipman Easy's mother. She drank so much gin that she died of spontaneous combustion. Yet Midship. man Easy respected her and grew up into a decent fellow, partly on the strength of that respect. I hope that " Twinkle ", mothered so exclusively by Mr. Rutter, will grow up into as decent a member of society as Midshipman Easy. Then I disagree with Mr. Rutter's statement that " grown men and women are as alike as motor-buses compared with children, who are the real individuals of the earth: before education and convention have shaped their minds". I think children are different from each other, but that it is difficult to see this difference because it has not been developed by the individualistic growth determined by the infinite variety of experience. Roughly speaking, children's interests are limited and dull. They share a vehement passion for the breast or the bottle, and very little else, at least in the early and most repulsive stages of life. Gradually they become a little less unicellular and biological, and they make noises and gestures by which an adult (other than the mother, or, in the present case, Mr. Rutter) distinguishes for the first time one child from another. Gradually signs of habit, predilection, mania, idiosyncracy appear in these fallow personalities, and the child displays that something of differenmc which makes him or her a distinguishable member of human society. Until then a child is usually conventional, conservative, greedy, prejudiced, and all the other evil things which cannot be shaken out of the system even when we are supposed to be grown up. Youth is a vice and a disease which even that wise physician Time cannot eradicate. It tries for three-score years and ten, and then it destroys us in the process. Mr. Rutter also says that " fear is made and not born ". I believe the opposite, that the child, "born in others' pain" enters the world reluctantly, howling with misery. It fears the hand of the nurse, the friendly tongue of the dog, the benevolent darkness. It fears to leave the mother's lap, it " creeps unwillingly to school ", it is terrified and shy of other children, adults loom over it like ogres. Such is the mad fantasy of the savage, the child. Knowledge, reason, courage, enterprise come later, as the personality grows and feeds upon experience. But Mr. Rutter would eliminate fear. He wants to edit the moments of the infant's day, to tear whole pages and stories out of the fairy-tale canon. But he should begin earlier. He should begin when the child is in the womb, a victim of the bio-chemical conflicts of the mother's blood as she reacts to her environment of love, hope, greed, terror. He should censor the news travelling through the umbilical cord, so that when the child appears into this world, it will be a white, immaculate little corpse, safe for his experiment, unstained by contact with its mother, that factor which he has so jealously excluded from any part in this book. "Swift always put things a trifle crudely ", says Mr. Rutter, " but although he was never a father .... I wish, in both respects, that Mr. Rutter were like Swift. RICHARD CHURCH.

THE ACTOR-MANAGER. By Lionard Merrck. iu (Grant Richards.) The English stage-world of to-day has never teen treatcd in more detail than in Mr. Merrick's able story. The minor actors are presen'ed to you as well as the Iltars" You sce the dramatist struggling for a hearing, and then watch his triumphant success. The temptations of a manager with ideals above the demands of the public; the temptations of an actordramatist u ith ideals above the sordid ambitions of his wife, are suggested in a way to draw forth much sympathetic interest from the reader. Perhaps the stage-wcrld is no more romantic than other Milieus, but, described in this realistic and upto-date manner, it has the advantage of novelty for most of us. Those to whom all the theatrical circumstance is commonplace, will still find a charm in "The Actor-Manager." This charm proceeds from Mr. Merrick's loyal and simj le-minded attitude to men and things.

NOVELS. I Poet and burr. By Hamilton Aide. 3 Vols. Hurst and Blackett. When a catastrophe is inevitable, it is a little comfort that, the climax reached, we are able to say " Thank heaven it is no worse ! " and with this pious ejaculation we rise from the perusal of " Poet and Peer." The hero, a youth of Byronic tastes, develops into an advanced free thinkers a social reformer, and democrat, with communistic views, and is endowed with the unenviable power of doing good to none and much harm to many. In the brief space of a few years he is unintentionally the means of sending his father to the grave. He drives his wife to attempt suicide, a fate averted to allow her to die of a broken heart. He causes the permanent misery of many deserv- ing people, while in no instance does he appear as a useful factor in humanitarian economy, if we except the occasion of his saving the life of an Italian beggar-a work of preservation which serves as an ironical commentary on the doctrine of the Survival of the Fittest. Wilfred Athelstone, his father, Lord Athelstone's only child, was an Etonian, " unusually open to impressions of beauty." In the village of Ripple, at the age of sixteen, he saw a little girl of eleven driving home a cow and calf from the hillside pastures. The boy was already something of a poet, and it came into his head, as he watched this child, her cow, and the surroundings, "that it was as perfect an idyll as Theocritus ever sung." He asks Nellie Dawson for some warm milk, which he declares a draught fit for the gods, and promises to call at her cottage and bring her some books of poetry. The child, the only daughter of her widowed mother, a tenant of Lord Athelstone, is taken up by her uncle, a rich ironmaster, and educated for four years at a first-class Midland school; while Wilfred goes to Oxford, and wins "the Newdigate " by writing the prize-poem for the year. Nellie Dawson returns to her mother's cottage, is appointed village schoolmistress, and in church Wilfred sees the dairymaid "pshot up into a tall, graceful girl, infinitely more beautiful than he remembered her," when "all the boy's passionate admiration for the child revived with double force." "' His muse at this time was draped in a somewhat pre-Raphaelite garb of the Italian cut that delights in concetti," and, as was inevitable, he at once began writing poetry in her praise, but fortunately never got beyond the first stanza-a copy of which is extant, and throws serious doubts on the critical capacity of the Newdigate examiner for his year. Wilfred Athelstone's love-making with Nellie is rudely checked by her cousin -the ironmaster's son-who has come to propose for her hand, and is refused. Seeing how matters stand, he confronts his aristocratic rival and says, " You don't mean to marry her, I suppose. . .. And I tell you, if you seduce that girl, I1'1 /haveyolr blood, I will, if I swing for it." Lord Athelstone dies, and Wilfred's motlher sees the necessity of separating her son and Nellie before mischief ensues. The latter, through her influence, obtains a governess's situation with a Mrs. Goldwin, where she meets Hubert St. John, Mrs. Goldwin's cousin, an old Eton chum of Wilfred's. He falls in love with Nellie, and would propose, but Mrs. Goldwin sees that, although she never told her love, Miss Dawson is secretly pining for Lord Athelstone. Hubert waits patiently for his lordship to marry some one else, trusting to make Nellie Dawson his own, when she sees the hopelessness of her passion. The actors in the drama meet in Rome. Lord Athelstone has proposed for Sylvia Brabazon, a lady of great beauty and of high art attainments. She refuses him on the sole score that he does not know his own mind, and out of pique lhe offers his hand to ill-fated Nellie and marries her, thus blasting the future life of his old friend St. John, who loves with a Platonic attachment to the last. Socially speaking, there is a great gulf fixed between a peer of the realm and a dairy-maid, and society perhaps will feel revenged at the attempt to bridge it over by the termination of the story already indicated. Many of the characters are cleverly drawn. The dialogue is never rapid, but often sparkling and brilliant, and while we admit it is not without considerable fascination, our regret is that its very grim and gruesome end spoils the pleasure of an otherwise agreeable story. The poet and peer is the incarnation of selfishness, while Hubert St. John appears the embodiment of true nobilityNature's noblest work-a gentleman. Art society in Rome is sketched in brilliant and vivid colours, while Mrs. Tullia Whiteside, a lady of distinguished philanthropy, and what is termed "4 an enlarged mind, recalls Mrs. Jellaby of Borrioboolagha fame, with the difference that whereas the latter was a harmless negative in the regeneration of the world, the former was a positive agent of evil-the representative of a class that we trust may be soon extinct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE EMPTY SACK. By Basil King. 7s. 6d. (Hodder & btougitton.) One of the best novels of the season, dignified and persuasive in style, subtle in character-drawing, strong in incident. Mr. King sketches the story of the Folletts, whose father is dismissed for age from the great Collingham Bank. Very pitiful is the state of the Follett family when there is no work for the head. Teddy, the young son, is also in the Bank, and to help the desperate situation at home, pilfers money. Jennie, the pretty daughter, marries young Bob Collingham in secret, but does not love him, and Bob goes abroad, saying nothing. Teddy is caught, but not before he has shot dead the pursuing detective. Then comes the end of Teddy in the electric chair, but throughout there is a spiritual quality about the book, Teddy goes out bravely; and very bravely and quietly the young couple, now reconciled, face the future. The study of Junia Collingham, ambitious, scheming, skilful American mother, is remarkable. Her effrontery is boundless, her quickness in grasping the main chance almost uncanny, her wordly wisdom overpowering, and her resignation to things as they are, and have got to be, is a courtly resignation.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOON. INTRODUCTION TO THE MYSTERIOUS IN LITERATURE. BY R. ELLIS ROBERTS. IN that lovely play in which Mr. Granville Barker colloborated rather surprisingly and extremely successfully with Mr. Laurence Housman, Prunella makes sudden and wistful poetry out of a line from a lesson-book-No one has ever seen the other side of the moon. The task of the authors who deal in ghosts, in mystery, in t h e occult is always to do that-to find for themselves, a n d t o show to us the other side of the moon-the other side indeed of everything, to reveal th e unexpected, to hint at the unknown, to show behind the apparent walls of comfort and content the spirit of the uneasy. In this task there are as m a n y methods as there are men, and success may be on the comparatively low plane of the dragging armour of Mrs. Radcliffe, or in that superbly uncanny kingdom which James Hogg opened in his " Confessions of a Justified Sinner," or Henry James in " The Two Magics," or the more beautiful country, in spite of its real terror, that Mrs. Oliphant explores in " The Beleaguered City." Whatever the method, however high *or low the aim, there is always the same initial difficulty. When Hotspur and Owen Glendower are planning for the prosecution of the wars, Glendower makes much of his supernatural powers, his deep sympathy with those material forces that were used by heavenly agents: The Nightmare with her whole NinefoldL From "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.' By Washington Irlng. Illustrated by Arthur Rackbam (Harrap). " At my nativity The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, Of burning cressets; and at my birth, The frame and huge foundation of the earth Shak'd like a coward." Hotspur is not impressed; and Glendower piles wonder on wonder, and still leaves the other man unconvinced and indeed provokes in h i m a greater incredulity. Then Glendower in a final burst cries: I can call spints from the vasty deep "Why," retorts Hotspur, " Why, so can I and so can any man; But will thev come when you do call for them ? That line of Shakespeare's remains one of the earliest criticisms I know of the ghostseer's claims, and is still the best test of the ghost story's success. How many men call and call, ask us to listen to their incantations, m a k e their spectres groan terribly for us, and f a i 1 completely to make us believe that t h e r e is anything there but the old apparatus of the village yokel, the turnip, the bed-sheet, and a few drunken howls ? I do not suppose any man would be bold enough to-day to attempt to write a story of the supernatural that would depend on the old machinery of Mrs. Radcliffe and Monk Lewis and C. R. Maturin-those old stories of theirs belong to a simpler age when, as a later wit said, nothing succeeded like excess, and a hall full of armour suggested not an irreverent farce, but the gloom of mediaeval dungeons, the pathos of medieval loveaffairs, the wistfulness of the days when, the eighteenth century miss fondlv believed, to be married was to be unhappy and misunderstood and very probably murdered. We know too much about the Middle Ages to be thrilled any longer at the vision of a ghostly friar, frequently garbed in a lamentably inadequate stole, too much to be moved by the figure of a mailed and visored knight pointing with a shaking finger and an angrv frown (for this he must raise his visor) at an unlwash-d bloodstain. Tlhat s o r t o f mys terv hi a s 1 o s t i t s potency altogether a n d it received its deat Ii -)1 o w d a i n t I I v enough in thie little farcical storv bv Oscar Wilde TlTh C a n t erv lle Ghost."'' We need horrors that will survi v e central heating, and m o d e r n plumbing and the brilliance of the electric light. One modern dealer in mysteries has dreamt, so I heard, for long years of writing a tale of terror that shall concern itself entirely with the little lost things incidental to modern comfort-there was to be a ghost story at a dentist's, in which the horror was to be provided by the spectres, bloody and pitiful, of thousands of extracted teeth, and another in a modern mansion where strange life and terrible powers of evil were to be granted to the worn-out electric-light bulbs; and vet another in which the air-locks of neglected pipes started a chittering and dismaying assault on the men who had dared to insult with modern comfort the antique splendour of a Gothic castle. Whether these tales will ever be written no one knows; but I can imagine either Mr. Arthur Machen or Dr. Montague James making something really hair-raising out of them. The first thing necessary for a successful ghost story is not that the author should believe he can raise the ghosts, but that he should believe there are ghosts, strange influences, uncomprehended powers to be raised. If he merely believe in his power to summon the spirits, he may fail because in his heart he thinks his call creates as well as summons the spirits. This is what really ruins the plausibility of all the professional writers of " horrid" stories, all those novelists who made young ladies' blood curdle so deliciously in the days when Tam O'Shanter. 1' And scarcely had he Maggie rallied When out the hellish legion sallied." Burns. Miss Austen wrote " Northanger Abbey." Monk Lewis never believed in his spectres or his horrors ; he only believed in his power to make them, there is only fancy not faith at the back of his tale. The thing is a convention, and like all conventions becomes meaningless when we have left the period which deliberately adopted it. The only story of that time which one can still read with any kind of thrill is Beckford's " Vathek." Beckford still moves one, because he began his Arabian tale in a mixed mood of intense, if rather artificial, emotion and slyly sceptical humour. As he wrote, piling up the horrors of sorcery an d witchcraft, one can descry in h i m the f a i n t -tb e - ginnings of a suspicion that the devotion to evil of Vathek a n d h i s horrible mother might m e a n something rather terrible, that there might be, after all, in the shadow of Eblis rather more of truth than a Voltairean sceptic had sus- pected. So before the tale of the fatal Caliph has come to its end, its author and we are moved, beyond his original intent, to see further than our expectation. Beckford, setting out only to explore magnificently the visible moon, has displayed to him and gives to us a glimpse of that which lurks satanically on the other side. Not dissimilarly but with far more purpose, and with far greater success, Mr. Arthur Machen in our own day took a fashion recently popular and turned its ingenuity into something sinister and full of shameful fear. No one can fail to miss the resemblance between his early stories and those gay, artificial tales for which Stevenson and Mrs. Stevenson claimed the name Arabian: but " The Three Impostors " and " The Great God Pan " are lit with quite another glow than that which gleams in the cigar-store of Florizel. For Mr. Machen has no trouble in making the spirits answer his summons. He believes intensely in them; and they crowd in upon him and his characters with an insistence that will not be denied. In his later work, which is I am afraid less popular, he seems to me to have gone as near as a man can to stating the imaginative in terms of the fantastic, to making the macabre a vehicle of spiritual beauty as well as of fanciful horror. No one can make brick and mortar glow with such infernal flame, no man before or since From a drawing by TREFUSIS. L ZHU &*boo& has e v e r shown how, at the end of a drab suburban street, or in the glum respectability of some residential square, can be found suddenly the mouth of a pit that drops sheer to the fires of hell, or the foot of a ladder that, leaning on a wall in Wandsworth, is set a veritable scala Coeli. The comparative neglect of Mr. 'Machen's work by serious critics is one of the o d d e s t phenomena in modern letters: he is, I suppose, too robust, too Christian and too serious for a generation that prefers its hauntings to be thin-blooded and polite. II. A. phrase will sometimes do more than a wilderness of magic. I can be moved, though not immediately, by the wecird sisters in " Macbeth they remain one of the most successful efforts to convey the supernatural in actual form, to show fate and its poisoned prisoners in human guise: but not all their speeches, not all the mysterv of their actions conves quite so magical a sense of the other side as those few words of the porter in the same lplay I 1ii thought to let in some of all professions, that go the primrose path to the everlasting bonfire," or Lads Macbeth's dreadful sentence of haunted re- colie c t i o, NN-hen s h e is walking in her sleep Y et w ho wv o u I ( have thought t h e old man to have hi a (1 s o much bhl(od in him Here N-ou have t he t re al )roblem that confronts all authors w h o wish to u s e supernat u ral machinery for heightening an imaginat iv e effect. We are ready to suspect that they are taking too easy a wav to attain an end which can The Weird Sisters in " Iacbth." (After Fuseli). Photo by Stage Photo Co. The Policeman-Priac., the WIas and the Queen, at the WI1. Scene from " A Kiss for Cinderela,'" by J. M. Barrie. only legitimately be reached by methods that are devoid of trickerv. It is for this reason that no man can write successfully a story of the supernatural w h o h a s not either a traditional or personal belief in the world, whose invasion of physical o r d e r is the subject of his story, and who genuinely t h i n k that such invasion is not only imaginatively possible but msthetically appropriate. We h a v e moved a very iong way from the comparatively simple and almost solid ghosts that satished our ancestors. Oddly enough, the movement specifically known as spiritualist still deals in these very three-dimensional spirits, who can only make themselves and their powers known by very sensuous attacks on our attention. This will no longer do for the modern writer of the supernatural storv No modern reader can get quite the same thrill from even the masters of the old ghost story, for example Sheridan Le Fanu, or from so able an exponent of the same methods as Mr. Algernon Blackwood, as he can from Mr. de la Mare's tales of the unusual. Mr. de la Mare's method is almost exactly the opposite of the older practitioners. They-a good example is Mr. Blackwood-show how ordinarv life is broken into by the extraordinary they display the fact that behind our everyday life lies a world of curious and suggestive creatures. For Mr. de la Mare the supernatural world is the real, and this actual life is its interruption, its often distort i ng, s o m e t i m eg excluding, and occas i o n a 1 1 v r e v e a 1 i n g mirror. He does not bring the supernatural i n t o h is stories; It is t h e natural which creeps in, looking rather lost and etiolated beside the glowing reality of the other world. I can think of only one other author who has this power, an author for whom the world which most of us dismiss as fanciful is the real and abiding thing and has its unchallengeable validity-and that is Miss Stella Benson. Her spiritual world is less clearly imagined than Mr. de la Mare's; it is more evanescent, less palpable, but its beauty and challenge are as sure as those in his strange universe. " Living Alone " is a great spiritual romance, a tale of the supernatural made by someone whose faith is scarcely more than a sigh of discontent at those things in which the world would ask her to believe. Many modern novelists have dealt intheuncanny. Mr. Kipling, Mr. Beresford, Miss Sinclair, "Q," Miss Violet Hunt, Mr. E. F. Benson, Sir James Barrie, Mr. H. G. Wells, Mr. W. W. Jacobs have all adventured into that world where shadows flicker and glow, and flicker and gain firmness until they blot out the u s u a 1, accustomed daylight. Even Mr. Arnold Bennett has dealt very sensibly and characteristically with a ghost. One classic author may, in his very different way, be claimed to belong to that small school-which has some young followers -that treats the supernatural as the normal thing, on which our life of fact and habit impudently intrudes. That is Hans Christian Andersen. It is true that his stories sometimes fall into sentimentality; but when he avoids that pitfall he succeeds admirably in convincing one of the reality and importance of his imaginative world. " The Tin-Soldier " might have been written by a Defoe whose eyes were purged with some magic herb; and " Little Claus " has that same mixture of extravagance and sense. He has had few followers in England-the best is Mr. Laurence Housman whose fairy-stories have a little of the master's unquestioning faith. Andersen too is of importance as being one of the few sojourners in the land of the unusual who remembers that there may be laughter there. There should be more fun with the fairies than our authors generally give us. It would be stretching the definition of supernatural too far perhaps to include Lewis Carroll's two masterpieces; and yet the life of Alice, though explained away as a dream (how I hated that explanation when I was a child), does pass in an odd precise spiritual world--it is the supernatural of a scholastic. At the other end, misted by his own Scotch doubtfulness of outline, is the spirit world of Sir James Barrie. Its supremest example-to my mind-is " Shall We Join the Ladies ? " a play that Mr. de la Mare might have written, so utterly matter-of-fact is its supreme oddness. Its implicit supernaturalism, however, escaped most of its critics, though I remember a fine statement of it by Mr. H. W. Massingham; but Barrie's ghostworld and fairy-world breaks into other plays of his. There is not only the fancy of " Peter Pan " and " A Kiss for Cinderella," not only the rather nondescript and unsatisfactory apparitions or hallucinations in " Barbara's The Black Dwarf. From " The Black Dwarf." by Sir Walter Scott (Oxford Press). Wedding"; there is the strange frustration and confidence of " Dear Brutus " and the lovely lost wonders of "Mary Rose." With that play and Mr. Sutton Vane's " Outward Bound," the supernatural paid a long visit to the London stage. The plays have had no successors, and I doubt if they will for a very long time. " Mary Rose " was a success in spite of its supernatural note; and " Outward Bound " succeeded by Mr. Vane's astonishing skill in presenting his theme under a guise of realistic tragi-comedy. The story could be followed, and I hear actually was by some people, without undue attention to the underlying fable. III. Not only have authors throughout the ages written of the other world. Some have claimed to be inspired by its denizens. This is not the place in which to discuss the character and degree of inspiration claimed by and for the authors of the Old Testament; but a p a r t from inspiration, many of the prophets claimed to base some of their messages on the command of a direct divine vision. So also the English mystic, Julian of Norwich, wrote what had been told her by our Lord; and Blake was not merely laughing at Hayley and his tiresome friends when he insisted that he spoke with Isaiah and Ezekiel, that he saw a faery's funeral, and that the disc of the sun was, to his eyes, packed with the singing seraphim. Swedenborg said that he had spoken " with almost all of the dead whom he had known in the life of the body "; and John Wesley, if he never saw visions, heard the manifestations of creatures whom he believed not to be human. Nor will one dismiss such evidence lightly, corroborated as it often is by men of science equal in reputation to the sceptics who attack them. It was the great mathematician de Morgan who wrote: " I am perfectly convinced, in a manner which should make unbelief impossible, that I have seen things called spiritual which cannot be taken by a rational being to be capable of explanation by imposture, coincidence or mistake." It is worth noticing that those who claim to have received visions from " the other side of the moon " have rarely ventured into the region of the supernatural story. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's efforts in this direction will not bear comparison with the work he wrote before his spiritualist experiences; and Laurence Oliphant, a man of great natural genius, had his power almost completely quenched by his religious excursions with Thomas Lake Harris. The ghost seen, the voice heard seem indeed to be less satisfying as a spur to artistic creation than the ghost believed in and imagined. No spiritualist has equalled the horror of Henry James's " The Turn of the Screw," nor the charm of Mr. Chesterton's " Magic "; and the greatest artist of all those who saw continuously beyond this world of the senses, William Blake, tells us best of his secrets in lyrics that have a loveliness for the uninitiated: I. , ' m - I o I P, Op'll: ' iv II01' I HI) ( I'1 K G.

Jan 1, 1853  ENGLISH LITERATURE - History and Criticism - 19th Century
The Critic 12 : 282 9 - 10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
BIOGRAPHY. Memoirs, Journal, and Correspondence of Thomas Moore. Edited by the Right IHon. Lord JouN RUSSELL, M.P. Vols. I.-II. 1852. IT is satisfactory to know that the landable purpose of securing a provision for his widow, which induced the poet Moore formally to bequeath his letters and papers to the editorship of Lord JoaN RUSSELL, cannot be thwarted by any c:iticism, however hostile, which may be passed on their biographical interest or their literary value. The publishers, it is understood, have adopted, in the case of Mrs. Moore, an arra igement somewhat similar to that concluded by them in relation to Mr. Macaulay and his History of England, so that, whatever may be the success or unsuccess of the poet's autobiographical legacy, the beloved partner of his joys and sorrows will not be allowed to suffer by the literary negligence of publisher, or the literary deficiencies of editor. Certainly, if we may judge from the volumes before us, Lord John Russell is not the man to take away the reproach under which that most important and interesting department, our Literary Biography, has long been suffering. Indeed, these Memoirs of Moore are justly entitled to rank as the very worst specimen in that department which has been inflicted, for many a year, by Paternoster-row on a muchsuffering public. The papers bequeathed by Moore to the editorial care of Lord John Russell were of three kinds-autobiographical fragments, private letters, and diaries ; and of all these kinds, as of Lord John's editorial skill in connection with them, there are specimens in the present instalment of the work. A graceful, unaffected, and pleasing memoir, from the poet's own pen, conducts us satisfactorily to his twentieth year: but then, unhappily, just as the battle of life is beginning for him, it stops, and we are handed over for further information to some four hundred letters, or rather notes, most of them of extreme triviality, and from which it is very difficult to gather any notion at all of Moore's biography during its most brilliant and productive period - the first eighteen years of the present century. With 1818 begins a diary which lie continued to keep until the year 1846; and of this the portion for the years 1818-19 is given in the second volume. With a basis like this, a skilful and industrious editor (such as Mr. Lockhart proved himself in his Life of Scott, or even as Moore himself, in a less degree, was in the similar case of Lord Byron) might have produced a very amusing and instructive book,-a picture of the aristocratico-literary element in which, for nearly half a century, Moore lived and moved and had his being. Lord John Russell has contented hiniself with printing the MSS. almost as he found them. There is no connecting narrative, and the annotations of the noble editor may be counted on the fingers of a single hand. All the vicissitudes of Moore's life during its most shining period, changes of residence and of circumstance, literary plans and publications, must be constructed by the reader for himself out of incidental and obscure allusions in his hasty letters; and it is much if Lord John Russell condescend to inform us of the date of the poet's marriage. It may be alleged that it is beneath the dignity of an ex-Prenier to drudge editorially to elucidate the biography of the son of a Dublin vintner; but what is worth doing at all is worth doing well, and Lord John had better have refused the commission than have executed it in this inexpressibly careless way. Should these memoirs ever reach a second edition, it is to be hoped that the publishers will put them into the hands of some industrious hack; for in their present state they are a disgrace to all of the poet's survivors who are directly concerned in their appearance. It is true that the noble editor has prefixed an introduction which is by way of being critical and biographical; but it is only with the help of extensive quotation that it is made to occupy some fifty pages, and the reflections and information which it contains are of the most trite and jejune kind. Critically, we are treated to such remarks as the following, with regard to Lalla Rookh:-"It is a poem rich with the most brilliant creations; a work such as Pope always wished to write, such as Tasso might have written"-intelligence which will be new to the students of Pope. Of Byron, we are told that " the strength of passion, the command of nervous expression, the power of searching the heart, the philosophy of life which his poems display, are wonderful;" but, singular to relate! " in the last of these attribitas only Wordsworth has equalled or surpassed him." Biographically, the noble lord's delineation seldom rises above such a strain as this, speaking of Moore's Bermuda sinecure:-" It was of little avail to him, was the cause of the greatest enbarrassment he ever suffered, and obliged him to pass in a foreign country more than a year <f his I life: " how tragical! Lord John Russell lived in friendly and frequent intercourse with Moore, and at least one passage, conveying his personal impressions of the poet, might have been expected. But, no ! this, too, is probably beneath the dignity of an ex-premier; and, instead, we are treated to sonic of the London reminiscences of the veracious Willis. quoted at second-hand fron the Irish Quarterly Review. To make amends, however, the noble editor presents us with a parallel between Tasso and Milton, in which, it must be satisfactory to know, Lord John Russell expresses an opinion that Milton's Satan is a grander creation than poor Tasso's Pluto! Moore was born on the 28th of May, 1779. in Aungier-street, Dublin, of Irish Roman Catholic parents, who were both of humbly-respectable extraction, and who kept a moderately thriving wine-store when the future translator of Anacreon first saw the light. Of his father Moore says little in the pleasant autobiographical fragment which we abridge; but of his mother lie is full; and in this, as in other respects, seldom has a poet been subjected, from the earliest moments, to influences so well calculated to stimulate his nature into development. "From my natural quickness," says the poet, "and the fond pride with which I was regarded at home, it was my lot, unluckily, perhaps, though from such a source I can consider nothing unlucky, to be made. at a very early age, a sort of show' child; and a talent for reciting was one of the first which IV mother's own tastes led her to encourage and cultivate in me." Mrs. Moore seems to have been a warm-hearted and enthusiastic woman, with strong political and religious feelings-the former liberal, and the latter Romanist; and her influence in these respects is sufficiently visible in the poet's career. All mothers think their children born to achieve greatness; but this worthy ladv was determined to leave as little as possible to Provideuce, carefully superintended her Totumv's daily lessons, lavished kindness on his teachers, anI diligently collected a hoard to be male applicable to his future advancement. His natural turn for recitation and company-display, fostered by such a mother, was further quickened by one of his earliest teachers, a Mr. Whyte, a distinguished professor of elocution, hand-in-glove with the chief histrionists of the day, and active in tl'e private theatricals which were then a favourite amusement of the Irish aristocracy. Here is a little incident among many, which shows significantly the element in which the victim grew into boyhooI. In ahlition to hi private pmupil in tho di tt-wt; line of theatricils, MIr.

Occasionally too the young gentleman made a public appearance; and the bill of sonic amateur theatricals has been preserved in which the epilogue is announced to be delivered by " Master Moore," then ten years olil. At the early age of twelve, the young prodigy began to scribble verses in magazines, and to be termed "our valued contributor." The parents, without being wealthy or fashionable, were hospitable and social, the mother especially being of a gay and joyous temperament; so that Toni could long afterwards look back to these early years as perfectly sunny and happy.

L. G. that Was set in his oxther, ill vlhich Jack saw, dark as it lV'as, the spots of all tile othel fellow's cards, as lhe tholuglht, so that lie was ceick sure of bating him. B1ut thiev were u pair ot ilowiiriglit knaves, ally how ; tor Jack, by plaN'ing to the cards that lhe saw in the lookingglass, instead of to theem the other held in his llhln, lost tlle gaime andl the money. In short, lie saw that lie was blarnied and clhated. by thein lboth ; and(1 when the gamne was up he plainly tomldd them as nmich. I What, you scomidrel!' says the black fellow, starting up and catchinig him lyv the cellar, ' dare vout go for to im. pache iny hoiiour ' ' Leather him if he says a word,' says the dog, rutimmitig over on lis lthin~d legs, and iaving, his shut paw upon Jack's nose, ' say an other word, you raseal,' says lie, itil I'll dortv vont ;' with this the ould. fellow gives him anotl;hr shake. I I don't blanie you so nutch,' says Jack to him ; ' it was the look. itig-glass tflat desaved nme.' ' What lookingglass, you knave you ?' says dark-face, giving Wim a fresh haul. ' Why the oine I saw under the dog's oxther,' replied Jack. ' Umider my oxther ! yon swindling r:ascal,' replieS the dlog, giving him a litill bv the other side of the (*ollar; ' dlid ever any hlonest pair of jintlemen hear the like?-lint, lie *nlvy wants to break through thte agreement * so let us turn him at once into an ass, and. then he'll brake no more bargains, lior strive to take iil honest men and win their nioney." So salving, the dark fellow drew his two hands (ver jack's jaws, an' in a twiliklin' there was a plair of ass's ears growing lip out of hiis head. When Jack found. this, lie knew that he was'nt in gisd hands ; so lie thoutght it ]lest to get himself as vell out of tlh scrape as lio.isilde. '.Jintlemen, be aisy,' says he, 'an let us un; derstand one another: I'm very willing to sarve you for a vear and a day, bit I've one requist to ax, amd it's this: I've a helpless oitld mother at home, and if I go with you noW, she'll brake her heart with grief first, and starve afterwvards. Now, if your honour will give mie a year to work hmard, amid lay ill r'lvision to sililiort her while l'mm away, I'll sllve( voti witi all the veins ofi my hearttfor a bargain's a biargaimi.' With this the dog gave his *oinmplalioi a phluck lby the skirt, amid, aifter siime (liait tipgther, tluat Jack lilid't hear, thev came baik anid sail they wltild conmlly with his wishes that ftar; ' Fo, On to mrrow twselve-imnntih, Jack,' savs the darrk fellow, 'the ibig here will come ti Aou;r mother's, and ifyoou ftlhii loiiii, he'll iring xolt safe to nIv castle.' ' rerv well, your limnour,' says Jack ' Itit as dops 'esenille one another so niticlh, how will I know himuu whiline comnes ' 'F IluWh,' ainswers lhe oither, ' Ihe'll have a green riliand aliout his neck, haild a1 pair of Wellington liotts onl his hfind legs.' 'That's enough, sir,' says Jack, I Icvan't inistaki hiiii iin that dress, so I'll Ie ready.' D)nring that year .1ack wvroughit night and d;Iv, that lie miglht be able to lave as maclt wrovisio; with his poor mother as would support her ii his absence ; and when. the morning came that he was to hid her farewell, lie went lown onl his twi kniees alnd got her blessing. llc then leift her with tears in his eyes, anid. promiseid to ciimnc back the very minimit his tie' would lie ill. 'I lother,' says he, 'be kind to your little faniily here, and] feed. thensl well, aI thev' re all yo11 'll have to keep vou compiany till voln see meagaill.' Ili mothuer thell stilffed Ihis lpockets witl b readl, till they stuick out lie. huiiil hini, and gave him a crooked :Aixpence for l1,'; ; aftei whicic, lie got his staff, amid was juist ready to tramp, vheimi, stime enotigh, hu spies his `oil(l friend the d(og, with the green I riband about his neck, and the Wellimigton boots tipon his hind legs. lHe didnit go in, but waited oil the outside till Jack came ouit. Thev the'i set off, Ihlit l) o)1l1 knlos }%V how tfr the'Y travelled, till theyv reacheitd the dIirk jiiitlelaiis vastle, who iaippeared terN gladl to see Jack, iial gave him a hearty welro umr." His adventures 'lere are most marvellous and amusing ; hut we eall onily extract a few traits oif his Irish gallantrv, which is his tinal SidvaI. tion from the troubl)es that encompass lkini. The next (lay, it conseqjueniue ot his lung Journey, lie was ax'dI to) Id niiothiing; hut in the cixurse oif the evening the dark chap brought hiii into a long friglhtful rooim, where there were tiree hiuilredl awl sixt,.fi'e hooks sticking out ot thle Wall, alul oIll every hook htlina el( it maia's hieadl. Whelln *Jack saw this agreealhle sight, liS diliner Iuegall tL) quake within him hIut lie felt hiselt' still nvorse, wliteu his master pointed to) the empty hook, saying, I Now, .Jack, your ltisilless to.morrow is to dlaine out a stable that wasn't clauied for tile last seveu years: and if oun dIhn't have it finishled belfore tiusk,do yoil see that hook l ' ' Ve_ ves, repliedl .lack, hlardlv ahle to spAku.

' Very wl-11, your lhionur,' rei liedl Jack, scarcely knowvini- whiait lie said, or lihe voulldn't hase said , Very wvell ' to) slt-I a lulooy n-iindeul initention, any how _- Very well,' says lie, I'll l, n)y h)est, ani. all ti; world kniows that the llest cein lieo more.' 'Iilt this discoorse wva passilnig ettine thlem, .I.a.k happened ti) look to the ululuer end of t lie rimmi, anil there lie saw one of the lI)eautifulltst laces that ever was seen o0l a wo'0ma1ni, lou kiig at him through a little panel that was ill the wall.

What the oither trials were, we leave to the iniagtitatiolt of otiur readers, vwhich wve tialev will hardly let them reit till thev get hold of these stories, and gratify their ialudable curioWty. They will not be disappointd either of drollery or curious traits of national miannlters anid feelin"s. In justice to the Writer, and to Sliewv that his releitive miiilnd is ats comlpetenit to take original oTld enlarged views as to dei. meride localities, we slhall conclude with a brief extract from the opening iif the second volume, which strikes 113 as hbeing p.articuilarly happy. " It lhas heen long laid down as a iuniversal principle, that self-preservation is the first law of ntature. Aln Irishllina, however, has inothing to do with such a law ; lie disposes (o' that al ie does ot the re st, tiitd wusltes his lhands of it altogetltev.

BITTER HONEY. By Adrian Heard. 7s. 6d. (Ward, LrOCK.) A woman obsessed by a tragedy that occurred when she was sixteen, and which she allowed to utterly warp her nature, is the brooding spirit of this posthumous novel of Mrs. Adrian Heard. The tragedy under whose shadow Monica Everest grew up until she lost all sense of proportion, was the death by accident of her boy sweetheart, and it is with the entry into her life, years later, of the man who caused the accident that the story commences. Utterly refusing to allow Gaythorne Steppe's blamelessness to carry any weight, she forces him into a betrothal with the idea of reparation. Mrs. Heard has drawn in Monica a very powerful figure, one in which all potentialities for good were completely swamped in the desire for revenge with which she was consumed. But she has not allowed too much emphasis on that chord, and introduces some very charming people, chief among them Monica's sister, Jolly, who plays no small part in Steppe's ultimate salvation. It is a grim struggle, convincingly drawn, but infused with a rare and delicate charm.

A BOOK OF STRANGE SINS. Crown 8vo. cloth, 3s. 6d. The CHRISTI AN WORLD says:-" We know of nothing so morbidly realistic since the famous Essay of Charles Lamb or the ' Confessions of an Opium Eater.' 'A Suicide' might have been written by Edgar Allan Poe, so actual are its reproductions of the thoughts and sensatioos of a drowning man. ' The Apples of Sin' haunts one by its horrible illustration of the truth that the wages of sin is death. A book of intense but painful interest." Thc SKETCH says:?" I do not know any piece of prose which opens up so many great questions in a few lines as the story entitled 'A Lost Soul,'nor one which is more forcibly realistic and impressive than 'The Apples of Sin.' The daring freshness of his thought, his great ability in expressing it, his contempt for common tradition, and the sincerity which exudes from every page of his work, captivate the reader. Painting various horrors with considerable force, and many drafts on the imagination."

The Story of My Life. By thc late Colonel ' Meadows Taylor, Author of ''Confessions of a Thug," " Tara," Ac. Edited by his Daughter, with Preface by Henry Reeve. In Two Volumes. (Edinburgh: W. Blackwood & Sons, 1877.) The few English who were left in Mentone in the May of last year, when Colonel Meadows Taylor died, knew that he had written some admirable Indian novels, and that he had rendered valuable service in the East of some kind or other; but their knowledge went no further; and this, we fancy, is very much the state of information of the English reading public in regard to Colonel Taylor. Tho Confessions of a Thug and Tara are two works which made a great im- mediate impression, and which the world will not soon let die. It was as if the blinding sun-light and the golden haze which obscure an Indian landscape had been suddenly changed into a clear air in which every mountain-range, great river, and stretch of jungle became distinctly visible, as also the human life which belonged to them. The graphic sketches of Mrs. Postans had afforded some glimpses of the same kind before, and John Lang had given us some racy out too superficial delineations of Anglo-Indian life, especially on its flirtation side, as practised on the spurs of the Himalaya, but Meadows Taylor really introduced us to the life of the people of India. In saying so I do not mean to assert that the experiences of a Thug are altogether typical of oven the strange existence of secret castes, wandering merchants, and jungle tribes in India; or that in Tara there may not have been introduced elements of thought and feeling which belong to Europe; but those two books were essentially true, as well as minutely so in their delineations of Indian life, while at the same time they were exceedingly readable and interesting. Any objection which can be taken to thom would apply equally to the romances of Sir Walter Scott and to all the stories of the great novelists which arc not directly realistic. It appears from this Autobiography that Colonel Taylor devoted special attention to the practices of the Thugs before Colonel Sleeman tracked these clearly out; and so, from his own personal knowledge as well as from the investigations of others, he was enabled to present a wonderful and true picture of a special phase of Indian life. But this phase, extraordinary as it appears, is not sensational in the sense of being entirely exceptional. Something not essentially different from it might be found even at this day in the great pilgrimages of India, in the life of the Bawas and other devotees, and even in the inner life of the great cities of India. In Tara the character of the Mahrattas and tho wonderful scenery of tho Konkan, tho Deccan, and of tho Konkan-Ghaut-Mahta, aro reproduced with remarkable fidelity and power. As in every great painting, there are details to which exception may bo taken by those minutely acquainted with tho subject; j but these arc unimportant, and are almost I unavoidable if a great, true picture is to be j presented at all. One good result of these j books by Colonel Taylor is that ho has almost I formed a school of Indian novelists, and the j latest production of that school?the City of j Sunshine, by Mr. Allardyce?is really a valuable addition to English literature. I know not whether to admire most the easy command which a short residence in India has given its author of Indian life, or his happy power of understanding and reproducing Eastern diameter. Thc chief but not thc sole interest of Colonel Taylor's Autobiography lies in his account of himself, and of the steady course of fearless, high-minded activity which carried him through difficulties before which many men of higher intellectual qualities than himself might have succumbed. Though of good family and connected with several persons of eminence in England, he had not the advantage of a collegiate or even a good school education, and did not enter India either as a civilian or an English officer. In fact he landed in Bombay, at the age of fifteen, in a position which was no better than that of a shop-boy, but he had the advantage of finding there a distant relative, who was chief secretary to the Local Government. This relative procured him a subaltern's commission in the army of the Nizam, and gave him valuable advice and a few useful presents from time to time; but, from the point of receiving his unimportant commission, Meadows Taylor may be said to have worked his own way through military services into revenue and other civilian duties, under the British Government, until he retired with the honorary rank and full pension of an English colonel, and able to look back upon a long career of usefulness and honour. This he accomplished by arduous devotion to the duties which lay immediately before him, however difficult or uncongenial to himself they might be; by using his spare time in preparing himself for duties which were only in anticipation; by familiarising himself with native languages and customs; and by treating the people of India in a gentlemanly and genial manner, which soon gave him an immense influence over them. The story of his career is told by Colonel Taylor without vanity, and without any unnecessary egotism. The attentive reader will perceive how much of its success was due to his personal relations with the people of India. We find nothing of that overbearing and brutal treatment of them which reached its maximum shortly before thc Mutiny, though it was combined with the most injudicious pampering of thc Pardeshi Sepoys, and just as little of that glossing over their vices, flattering their prejudices, and pushing forward the educated native, which are the faults of a later school. Colonel Taylor never disguised from himself or from his countrymen, or from the natives of India themselves, his clear perception of their great defects and vices, and he no more hesitated in acting on that perception than he would upon his knowledge of the peculiarities of a vicious horse; but at the same time ho always treated them as human beings, and as sensitive human beings, whose many fine qualities were not to be ignored and insulted simply because of their undeniable faults. I know of a young Indian who was lately brought to book by a not unfriendly interrogator on account of his meaningless complaints against the British Raj, and evident feeling of hatred towards it. On being pushed he freely admitted that it had done immense good to India, and that he could not substantiate tho special complaints to which he had alluded; "but," he added, "there is one point in which it exasperates us all." He had some difficulty in explaining what this point was, but at last, and almost in desperation, uttered emphatically the one word "treatment." It is a class assumption of a superiority which in the individual case often does not exist that exasperates the Indians more than anything else. One of the most interesting and important lessons conveyed by this Autobigraphy is the possibility and advantage of having both official and private intercourse with them proceeding on a full knowledge of, and practical regard to, their defects, yet at the same time without wounding their amour propre. This Autobiography may also be very useful both to Indians and Englishmen in the incidental illustrations which it affords of the great benefits which have been worked by English rule in India. To understand that subject properly we must understand what was the state of matters with which we had to deal, and how limited were our means of dealing with it. The generations which witnessed these changes have now passed away, and their experience is apt to be forgotten by their children and grandchildren. The volumes before us afford some very valuable glimpses into a transition period, and even on that account alone it is well that they have been given to the world. Colonel Taylor has hardly so much to tell us about the origin of the Indian Mutiny as we had hoped from his intimate acquaintance with the people of the country; but it appears that shortly before any open outbreak he had learned " that very disagreeable rumours had been flying about; that disaffection prevailed in the British territory; and that it was reported that an attempt would soon he made to turn the British out of India altogether."' In February, 1857, an anonymous letter was forwarded to him from the Bombay Government, containing a kindly meant but somewhat rude warning; and about the same time he himself received several anonymous letters, advising him to take furlough to England. It would thus appear that the Government of Bombay at least had some warning as to what was coming; and it would be interesting to learn what steps were taken in consequence by Lord Elphinstone, the then Governor of Bombay. In Hyderabad, Ahmednugger, Berar, and other localities, reports of a coming rising were rife ; and Colonel Taylor adds :? '?'Out of all the letters which reached me and Temple, lhere was scarcely one which did not make some reference to the* subject. ... If common precaution had been taken at every station as early as February or March, before the evil wind began to blow, many and many a valuable life would have been spared. . . * Warnings had not been wanting-. Friendly natives had endeavoured hy macy means to put Englishmen on their guard ; but no hints were taken, no precautions used, and the blow fell at last." This testimony is of great value as regards the origin of the Mutiny; and so also is the opinion of Colonel Taylor, that Lord Dalhousie's policy of annexation was not to blame; that Viceroy was wrong only " in not covering his annexations with sufficient European troops, and this the Russian war prevented his doing." According to this view, which I entirely support, we may regard that fatal war as one of the causes of the Indian Mutiny, not to speak of the effect of that war, to which Dr. W. H. Russell has borne testimony, on the mind of the Nana Sahib's secretary and confidant. These are two subjects on which Colonel Taylor's papers ought to be searched for further matter. It seems to me we are now committing similar errors in India, though with reference to other portions of the popu- lation. Andrew Wilson.

The Deceased Wife's Sister; and My Beautiful Neighbour. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. 3 vols. (Bentley & Son.) Turns of the Wheel. By L. and B. Raban. (Charing Cross Publishing Company.) We do not quite understand why the author of (The Deceased Wife's Sister' should hare allowed her second story, which takes up as much of the three volumes as does the first, to have been ignored on the outside of those volumes: possibly it was meant as a trap for critics, who, as all the world knows, seldom read more than the first half of VoL I., and evolve the rest from their own consciousness sufficiently to pass judgment on it. If so, however, the artifice has failed in our case, and we were rewarded for a conscientious reading through the inanities of ' The Deceased Wife's Sister' by the pleasure of suddenly discovering that it came to an end in the middle of VoL II. Certainly we might have guessed that not much would be gained by the change to another story by the same author, but hope springs eternal, and ' My Beautiful Neighbour' was a title that at least promised a less repulsive subject than a breach of the marriagelaws. As a matter of fact, it concealed bigamy, insanity, murder, and twaddle, but we did not find out any of these, except the last, till we got two-thirds through it. So we rejoiced, as we have said, when we finished ' The Deceased Wife's Sister.' This remarkable story (if the publishers were Messrs. Morgan & Hebron they would inevitably quote these three words by themselves in their next advertisement) opens in these words :? " I cannot tell what it was that had plunged me into so long a fit of abstraction. My mind had probably taken its complexion from the paling October afternoon. The air was moist and sweet, but there was a smell of decay in it. It made a trouble to me, like a presentiment. I have known such a trouble in breathing the air of old churchyards. I was sitting at my bedroom window. The setting sun threw its levelling light slantwise," &c. Barring the two expressions we have italicized, there is not much harm in this, so far. We all know the somewhat anaemic heroine who writes in these staccato sentences, and is highly sensitive to the changes of the weather; and, in some authoresses' hands, she tells her experiences not ungracefully. The style seems an easy one to imitate. It might be thought that everyone with any powers of observation could describe the more ordinary appearances of external nature, and fit them in with the varying moods of the persons of tho story; but even here comes in that everlasting " non cuivis." For instance, our present authoress knows so little of her own stock-in-trade, that in two places, where it is evidently intended to make a point, she describes, once, " a half moon glowing with a pure and steady effulgence" at midnight (surely this must be the same moon that Mr. Swinburne saw at its full in the east at the same hour)? and once a garden wherein were at one and the same time " lilacs and violets " and " the hues of ripening fruit." When a writer of fiction is so ignorant of the very grammar of her art as this kind of thing proves her to be, it is hardly worth while cavilling at such phrases as " the pale yellow cast sicklied o 'er it by the breath of the dying year," " the articulated lovelight of her husband's eyes," at the affectation of "take this parable," "this is not a novel," (it is quite true though, it is not), at the absurd periphrasis of " Fate seldom offers a human soul a bitter draught without constantly replenishing the cup by drops," for the simpler "Misfortunes never come single," or at the vulgarity of " supper, a meal I am partial to, and, which it was my custom to discuss an hour earlier." Still less is it worth while to enter into the general merits of the stories. Suffice it to say, that the first is intended to show the misfortunes resulting from a breach of the law as it stands at present, though we do not quite know whether the author is one of those who wish for a change. As, however, she makes her heroine, as a reward, marry her first cousin at the end of the story, we are inclined to think she has not studied the questions of " kindred and affinity" very deeply. The second story is even more unpleasant A gentleman takes a house in the country; marries his next-door neighbour, a pretty widow ; finds that she is mad, and that her first husband is alive, and has been living for some time in his house. Then there is a murder, and so the story comes to an end, unregretted. This kind of thing is not made readable by poor attempts at epigram and quotations (occasionally repeated) from Swift and Rochefoucauld, the latter of whom, by the way, did not, we think, ever talk of "des sentiments perpetuelles." ' Turns of the Wheel' can hardly be called a very distinctive name for any novel, for all that we know profess to depict human affairs, and depend for their interest on the changes and chances of this mortal life; and, in the present case, the title is less appropriate than it might have been in some others, for, as far as we can make out, the only turn of the wheel that looks of any importance in the story affects the fortunes of the various persons singularly Little. This is the somewhat stale incident of a second will, which is kept dark by the lawyer who drew it, and the person who would have suffered by it; but when this is discovered by the lawyer's son, the son of the defrauded heir is dead, and his daughter refuses to profit by it, and marries the lawyer's son instead, which we presume she might have done equally if the discovery had never been made. The book is not a very bad one, nevertheless. The authors (we use the masculine form for shortness, not because we think that " L. and B. Raban " are other than ladies? the feminine hand is pretty obvious) have, at all events, learnt to write decent English, have made some acquaintance with English literature, quote poetry correctly (but why do they write '" Holmes "' and ' " Shelley "' as if they were nicknames1?), and seem to take an intelligent interest in various questions of modern times. There is only one perfectly irrelevant episode introduced to mark the unpractised hand, and, with this exception, they manage to make their events work themselves out in a sufficiently natural sequence. We are glad to see, too, that they have, at least in one point, gone beyond some of their fellows. We all know how in novels which turn upon an undiscovered crime the criminal almost invariably keeps by him that which is sure to lead to his detection, and which (except for the purposes of the story) it would have been so much simpler for him to have destroyed. Usually this is treated as a matter of course, the sic volo of the story-teller being quite enough excuse for any improbability of the kind; in the present case, however, the writers have at least recognized the want of vraisemblance, and have tried to account for it in a manner not wholly inconsistent with human nature. Of this they have a sufficient knowledge to make them capable, if they will in future avoid crimes, of writing a novel of the quiet domestic order. Considering hov many persons one meets in ordinary life who have not rendered themselves amenable to the criminal law, this cannot be considered a vert severe restriction.

PICTURE TALES FROM THE RUSSIAN. By Valery Carrick. Translated by Nevill Forbes. 6s. (Blackwell.) This volume originally appeared in 1926. It is not surprising that a new edition has been called for. The Russian temperament is particularly sensitive in its understanding of childhood, and these short fairy and folk tales, in which animals (especially bears, of course) figure prominently, reflect the Russian genius in this respect at its best. The pen-and-ink sketches, of which there are two on each of the i83 pages, are thoroughly in keeping with a volume that is in every way distinctive, and which offers donors to children a safe and pleasant alternative to the more conventional annuals.

Ftox DAY TO DAY. By FERDYNAND GOETEL. EUdn Mathew & Maroot. 79. 6d.y	5 Tins book has rightly been praised, and by no less a person than Mr. John Galsworthy. It is a remarkable piece of techque in novel writing. The protagonist, who is an author, keeps a diary recording the events of his present life at the time he is writing a novel dealing with certain events in his past, which are continually influencing his present. The novel is printed in italics intesped between the pages of the diary. The interest of technique becomes apparent, for one is able to see the interaction between past and present focussed in the one mind. There is a danger that one will not be so emotionally moved by the actual story told, as intellectually by the method of telling. " From Day To Day," however, is a book which should certainly be read by anybody interested in literary aftsmanship; and as it brings Mr. Goetel, perhaps the most eminent of living Polish writers, for the first time to an English public, we have the more reason for welcoming its appearance.

Gilbert Gurney is quite worthy of his pen and reputation?whether we laugh at its ludicrous passages, or melt where natural feeling and tenderness are waked by the saddening events ol' life pathetically described. We refrain from meddling willi the story : how nell .Mr. Hook paints the common scenes of every day. may be gathered from the following, though only a bit of droll autobiography: j " During a portion of the time, however, I visited Heighton, which was then just becoming popular as a winter watering-place ; there I fell into agreeable society, rendered more agreeable still by the fact, that in those days I there were no houses huge enough to accom' modate large parties at dinner. The consequence was, that our meetings were small and sociable, snug and select. The old Steyne was then the very heart of the place; ii few scattered houses were to be seen beyond the battery 'mi the west cliff; and the crescent, which subsequently lound itself one day in the middle of 'the town, was an isolated colony in the east, equal in rurality and seclusion to Potlende.in jit-elf. It was during this period that, in the j month of February, I fell in with one ol' those ; illustrious citizens, into whose society I hail been unworthily admitted during my civic evo| lotions, and whom I found established on what i nits then considered ii somewhat exposed part ! of the cliff, near the end of Ship Street. Ile i did nie the honour, not only to recognise me as j bining been one of his visitors at the mansion - ! house, but rather to hunt me out, or, 1 might ' say, hunt inc down, until itt last he made up his mimi to the resolution of inviting me to dine with him and his family. k .Mr. (iiiruey,* sahl he, - I have the pleasure to remember you in my mayoralty last year, having been presented to me by my worthy friend, Alderman Uiicklesbury, and I am sure, .Mrs. Firkins luis .a strong feeling of your great kindness to us, in coming in u friendly way to us when we were at the .Mansion House; perhaps you will do us ilic- favour to eal. your mutton al number nine to-morrow?we dine at five?it gets dark about five now, and I see no use in wasting one's time and appetite for a late hour.'

The commonest tact in the world puts a mun au fail under such circumstances: he was actually boiling with indignation at something that had occurred, and I felt quite assured. being the only stranger present, that my bosom was destined to bu thu depository of his calamity the moment the departure of the ladies permitted the exudation of his wretchedness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TWO LILIES. Two Lilies. By Julia Kavanagh, Author of ' Nathalie,'' Adele,' * John Dorrien,' &e In Three Volumes. London : Hurst and Blackett. 1877. Miss Julia Kavanagh is so well-known an authoress that criticism on her works is almost superfluous. We know, before opening a novel by her, almost exactly what we are to get. We can always safely look forward to a pleasant wholesome story, some pretty bits of Frencli description, together with a judicious arrangement of well-assorted characters. There is thus a certain similarity between most of Miss Kavanagh's books. Perhaps the one to which * Two Lilies ' has most resemblance is ' John Dorrien.' In both there is the praiseworthy young hero with his hobby?in the one case architecture, in the other poetry?with thc more plausible rival William Cowper or Oliver Blackmore, both suitors for an Antoinette or a Lily. But the later work is decidedly the better story of the two. It contains many more interesting characters, and these the author thoroughly sustains throughout the book. Thc hero of ' Two Lilies ' is a young architect of an ambitious nature aud a susceptible heart. " He was tall, more strongly built than are most men of twentyfive, and not handsome, but from some Roman ancestor or other of his, ho had certainly derived the aquiline cast of his features, the ease and dignity of his carriage, and that impressive gravity of aspect which made even those who passed him in the street feel that he was a remarkable-looking man " (p. 0). He has a kindly old aunt?one of Miss Kavanagh's judicious foils, and perhaps thc best character in thc book?whose great desire is to see her nephew married to one of the "twTo Lilies." These two girls aro neighbours in St. Aubin, the inevitable little French town in which she delights. Lily Scot, thc elder of the two, " looked what she was, a young lady, both modest and self-possessed: and though she was very simply dressed, everything about her, from her little black hat to her neat kid gloves, was perfect in its kind and in its way " (p. 55). Lily Bertram, who is almost in thc position of a younger sister to her, is only a child when we are first introduced to her. " She was tall and slender, and had all the awkwardness of figure of carly youth. She was in mourning, and by no means well or becomingly dressed. Her sleeves were too short, and her skirt might have been longer," &c. (p. 67). From the admiration ofthe former and aversion to the latter which the hero conceives in the first volume, one of course foresees the state of affairs in the third?that the noisy little hoyden, whose chattering so annoys the romantic young architect, will develop into a dazzling beauty, who will entirely eclipse her somewhat soulless rival. Miss Kavanagh rather gets herself into difficulties in the third volume, by killing two useful and important characters, and one is disappointed at the hackneyed expedient by which she condescends to extricate herself, namely, by cutting the Gordian knot, and reviving thom. This is thc only serious fault in tho story. The plot is made up of Edward Graham's sentiments towards the two heroines, together with some interweaved technicalities and monetary details connected with his profession. Thc unfolding of it is materially assisted by the introduction of the cleverly-conceived character of William Cowper ?the " Mother Carey's chicken " of the book. He is a young man of disarming exterior, but of unelevated principles, who all through Graham's life has been his successful rival in every matter. His appearance always bodes ill. He and Graham had been in the same class together as lads, and Cowper had got him expelled by " showing him up," to use the school phrase, to the head-master, for having drawn a caricature of that worthy, and had by this means obtained a prize, which would otherwise have been given to his rival. The moral which Edward Graham keeps before him throughout his career is contained in the old sculptured sign outside the ancient inn, the " Cite de Jerusalem," at which he stayed in St. Aubin. It was a representation of the Jewish town, with a traveller approaching it on either side:? One of these journeyers was warm and weary; his feet were bare, poor fellow, he had taken off his slouched hat and carried it in one hand, the other supported a staff resting on his shoulder, and from which his cloak was hanging. The other traveller was struggling against tho wind ; he had kept his hat on, but his cloak was nearly blown away from his shoulders, one hand firmly grasped his long staff, the other rested on his gourd, his very step was firm? he had buskins on, to be sure?and spoke confidence and bravery. "Yes, that is life," thought Edward Graham, turning away, " an end in view, and a hard battle for it. That first warm and tired fellow will never reach Jerusalem, never ; and that other one will get in even if he should storm the city. Be it so." (P. 50.) All through the book Edwrard Graham is consistently conscientious and high-minded; but his excitable temperament?due, no doubt, to his Southern extraction? makes him often act foolishly; we should say, also, that he had no very keen sense pf the ludicrous. If there had been a fourth volume describing the architect married and settled, we fear we should have found Mrs. George having rather a dull time ; we should imagine that olive face, '' not handsome," but with " an impressive gravity of aspect," and without a spark of humour in it, must have palled terribly upon the lively Lily after a time. But heaviness is an attribute with which Miss Kavanagh endows most of her heroes, and we are afraid wo must add that heaviness is also rather the failing of her style. We do not mean to imply that she leaves out the light element altogether. She is far too experienced a novelist not to know how necessary it is to alternate drama with vaudeville. It is for this that she introduces Captain Jekyll and Mrs. Petherick (the Petherick Gazette as she was called) in the u character" parts of the two English resident gossips of St. Aubin. Still, when one has finished the third volume, one has a feeling of having made a somewhat substantial meal. The only other imperfection which we would wish to see corrected is the exuberance of epithet in which our authoress indulges. Happy in themselves as these epithets generally are, their redundancy seems to us rather to mar the pleasantness of her style. She will never allude to a feature even casually without dabbing on a tint or a qualification. It is invariably " the olive cheek," " the pale face," " the dark eyes," " the lively tongue," &c. However these little Homeric touches may contribute to make the tale graphic, they are so frequent as to be at times aggravating. It must be very difficult for a writer like Miss Julia Kavanagh, who must doubtless be conscious of the extent of her descriptive powders, not to fall occasionally into the error of giving them rather too much play. But, for all this, her painting talent is from time to time extremely effective. In her description of the old town of St. Aubin, for instance, and especially where Graham suddenly finds his way into an old monastic courtyard from a rustic street full of ducks, and pigs, and children. " A glimpse of a cool green place, silent and lonely, suddenly greeted Mr. Graham's eyes. ... Ile stood on the threshold of a wide court, planted with rows of old clipped trees, and enclosed by the abbey buildings, tall, dark, and decaying. The place thus divided from the gay, warm, world without was chill and full of a green gloom," &c. (p. 104). The peevish discomfort of the Scot family, after they have met with reverses, is also cleverly depicted towards the end ofthe third volume. So many novels of about the same standard of excellence have now emanated from Miss Kavanagh's pen that one wishes she would try to surpass the boundary and write something to entitle her to a still higher rank among authoresses. We should feel glad if she would now seek " fresh' woods and pastures new." We are aware that this would involve a certain amount of heartache, for an author has always his pet creations to which he clings all through his career. Trollope cannot resign his Bishop and Mrs. Proud ie ; Balzac fondles his original brood throughout all his books; even Thackeray treats us to his favourite Pendennis in more works than one. But still we would suggest to Miss Kavanagh that we now know all about her vacillating grave young hero, and her grimy little French town ; why should she not try what a little change of air would do for her characters. She might at least take them over the frontier?say to Belgium?not to risk too sudden a transition ; or, after all, for variety, she might keep them in England. Our authoress, fortunately, does not possess that fault, so common with lady novelists, of an incessant intrusion of pseudo-philosophic aphorisms. It is a relief, in these days, to find an authoress of distinction whose work is not disfigured with these little plague-spots. It is also a rarity to find a modern novel in which the ladies are free from the attributes of that mythical incarnation of vulgarity, the " girl of the period," and in which the gentlemen are not all types of the proverbial bagman. The personages in the present work are all such as one might meet from time to time in civilised society. Miss Julia Kavanagh is an essentially refined and cultivated writer; almost all her books have been good, and we may say in conclusion that ' Two Lilies' is above her average.

The Bookman 87 : 518 133 - 133
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE OUST SHORTSTORIE-1I: Inkh hamdAmavkam Edited by Edward J. O'Brien. 7s. 6d. WJonathan Cape.) Mr. O'Brien's tactics are not unlike those of an armament manufacturer's agent at work. For years he has been producing his annual volumes of Best English and Best American short stories and circulating them upon both sides of the Atlantic, showing each country what the other one is up to, and (as it were) perpetually saying: " Look here, this fellow's got a good line. Nothing like this on your side. Well, what d'you propose to do about it ? Let him get away with it ? Of course you don't ! All right, then, let us see what you can do to mend matters in the xeut twelve months." And so on, first on this side and then on the other, bullying and encouraging and fertilising. Five years ago England was well in the lead, and he was exhorting America. Now it is our turn, and he is asking us to " pay a little more attention to American achievement." Our " traditional sense of form" has very nearly used up our substance, we are so preoccupied with economy of effect that we begin to " live parsimonisly "-we become " sterile and inbred." Regard, on the other hand, the American short story-its surfaces rough, perhaps, but how much more vital. It is, he suggests, not professional but amateur, not sophisticated but " innocent, . . preoccupied with the homeliness of life." It is awake to " the salt and bitter reality of life and to its salt and vulgar humour." He does not only tell us to regard it; he ensures that we shall, despite the insularity which in the past has tended to make us read the English volume and let the American go, by printing the two as one-forty-four stories (twentytwo English, twenty American) in five hundred and twelve pages at the old price of one. (From any point of view, quantity or quality, a bargain bookful.) We should, I think, and without full acceptance of his view of the English stort story, need no further urging. Read all these American stories, and especially Benjamin Appel's " Winter Meeting " (as lovely as snow on spruce trees), Whit Burnett's whimsical and tender " The Cats Which Cried," Alan Marshall's obstetrical " Death and Transfiguration," Louis Mamet's brusque " The Pension," and Dorothy McCleary's contrapuntal " Winter." (There are also stories by William Faulkner, William March, Erskine Caldwell, Langston Hughes and others, but these are in the main less striking.) Turn then to the English stories by the known writers, the best by H. E. Bates, A. CalderMarshall, Janko Lavrin, L. A. Pavey, James Ster and Romer Wilson (though John Hampson, James Hanley, Orgill Mackenzie Stephen Spender and L. A. Strong are represented). Turn, too, to the newer writers, J. P. Hogan, Ashley Smith, Guy Dent and the (unhappily) late Ronald Tansley. And then, gentlemen, consider your verdict. It may be, like mine, for the English writers. but it will not deny Mr O'Brien's main point, that the Americans have much to teach us that is good, indeed essential Gmgnw Won

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MURDER IN FULL FLIGHT. Bv Marcus Magill. -S. 6d. (Hutchinson.) It is perhaps unnecessary to say that the author ot "Murder in Full Flight " is a competent craftsman, for his other books have definitely placed him above the average of detective writers. In his new book he has brought to bear his subtle and original mind upon a new theme; a theme that will appeal alike to the credulous and incredulous, because of the ingenuity of its treatment and flashes of humour. The book will appeal greatly to those who are in any way " air-minded " because most of the action takes place in, or is associated with, aeroplanes. The climax is as surprising as the plot is original.

And without that rich dialect these adventures would be deprived of much of their gusto. John's Ant adventures would make a diverting and laghter-moving little after-piece ; graced moreover by the wamth of heart, and generous feeling in which those amusing absurdities are usually deficient. When Sir Thomas has fairly started his game, the ardour of the chase sometimes leads him too far. fie is not content with runing it down; he must out-run it, or run it over. This holds of John's marvellous escapes, and Morag's more wonderful adventures. In Morag's case, too, he is fairly chargeable with the worse fault of caljale cide, aggravated by breaking the heart of honest John, through the death of his sweetheart.

THE STORY OF MlY LIFE.* TIE disposal of unmarried women has always been a social difficulty in Protestant and civilized communities. Among Oriental nations they (10 not exisyt as a class. In Roman Catholic countries they are, for the most part, (quietly absorbed by different religious vocations. The Greek ('hurch, we believe, hits also sonme species of institution adapted to their peculiar wants. Butt in Germany a1nd England, Norway and Sweden, it is not so, and of late years miuch has been written and said, especially by ladies who are theniselves unmarried, on the sufferings, the trials, and the duties of their celibate state. The book before us is interesting, partly as slhowing that thouglits and feelings of a nature very similar to those which have lately been at work in England on the subject of single womIen1, are also prevalent in Gerany and partly because the authoress of it is a more noticeable person than the majority of those ladies who trade on their self-indulgence and discontent. Fanny Lewald is of Jewish extraction, and was horn at Konigsberg in 1811. She was baptised at the age of seventeen, .and about three years afterwards took a long journey with her father at a tinie when travelling was a rarer atid -less accessible pleasure tian it is now. At this point, the " Years; of Suffering,," as the somewhat affected second title of tlie book calls them, scent to have be(run, and to have continued with little intermission till about 1841, when she first begaan to write for the public. The description. of this first journey is written in a clear, lively stle, whiclt bears the same relation to ordIinary Gerian writing that " Evelina beams to the Illvwbulr. Ilt 18:32, the year in which she and her father left Klonigsberg, it was thougiht wonderfilly q1uick triavelli ing to s1)eno Ii nly seventy-two hlours in going front that p)lace to Berlin. But then, in the (lays of her grandfather, it h;ad taken a fortnight to go fromt Kiriigsberg to Leipzig. People loved to relate how the uncomfortabe l)eost-chiais(es stuck favst in the ruts and holes with which the road was; covered ; how frequently they were overturned and the wretched passengers lay, afraidl to stir, aniong their trunks and packages ; and how the prudent pe're dc fauiI dth . made hi;s will and set his hiouse in order hefore un(lertakirig so long and periloUs a journey. Even in 1 S32 the way was long and tiresomele. To be seventy-tw') hours1 without reutilar sleep was a considerable tax ont the streiigth ; and the possibuilitY of having Polish Jews, wrapped in heavy (dirty fulrs, for conplminions, diil not ad(l to the pleasures of the route. But Mad(ame Lewald felt nothing of all this. We, who are steeped in excitement froin our childhood, can scarcely Understand the delight with which a girl, already past twenty, found herself for the first time in a great capital, and1 the luxury to which we are accustomed in England makes us smilei as she confesses that part of the charim of Berlin was owing to her having a roont to herself, with red silk blinds and a carpet all over it. She seents, however, to have b)een little pleased with the Berlin acquaintances to whom she was introdticed. The women were superficial and half-educated, the inen stiff amid f;rii;al. One of these latter, a certain Geheinirath, made so unpleasamit an imrIleression uipon her that she begged her father to deliver no itiore letters; of introdiuetion, and consequtently missed the opportunity of becominimg ac(1IIairIted with Varnhagen von Ense and his wife, a circurlstatnce she greatly regretted. Fron Berlin they went to Leipsic, and thence to W'eitia.r, where they staved( only to see the house of Goethle, then a few weeks ilead. TIhey then travelled by Frankfort, Darmstadt, and( other less remarkable places, to Badlen-Baden, where they made somJe stay. There they met Ludwig, Robert, the brother of Rahel Varnhagen and hian is heitifild wife. Bo'rne lived near theni, and they were in the hlabit of me'.1tin bulin. The ladfies of her uncle's family were intimitately acquainted with Meverlwter's wife and mother. A new and brighter life than any that hbome had afforded sCeemi(dl txo open before her. HIer father, after a few weeks, left her here with her uncle and alint, who were to take her with themi to Breslau, where they resided. Their journey thither was long and te(Iimis ; an old gKreat-aunt, who was with them, refusied to halt in any twn which the cholera hail visited, and as the cholera then lha been in alijiost evely town ill Germany, the delays and changes of route in trying to avoid it, were endles. In Breslau she was tbrown amiong a u hole clan of autints and uncles and 8 pjyi t fh' Story of 1y ~ire. By Fanny Leweld. Berlin: 18. cousins.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tom Marchmont. 3 vols. (Hotten.) A book obviously written by a novice. It maybe summed up thus. There is a freedom from affectation, an absence of glaring faults, a deficiency of excitement or of anything approaching to interest in the story, and a want of power generally. It is certainly no discredit to haye written it, but we are compelled in justice to say that it reflects no particular glory on the author; though if a gentleman chooses to employ his time in composing this style of novel, the public cannot possibly have any objection to his doing so. The tale is so very simple, not to say commonplace, that we need not detail it. There may perhaps be some who will enjoy reading it more than we did, but, we fear, not many.

Critic, 1844-1847 5 : 108 63 - 64
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
rZCTZON. Azeth, the Egyptian. A Novel. In 3 vols. post 8vo. | - London, 1847. Newby. A THREEFOLD purpose is manifested in this novel, although the author informs us that his design was twofold only; first, the construction of an interesting tale; second, to convey a vivid picture of ancient Egypt; third, to promulgate a certain philosophy which he entertains'respecting the past, present, and future, of the soul Such a plan is sufficiently ambitious; the question for the reviewer is, whether it has been satisfactorily accomplished. It is a bold experiment upon the nerves of circulating-library readers to meet them at the threshold with the announcement that the volumes they have borrowed in anticipation of the indolent excitement so delicious as one lolls upon a sofa before a clear fire on a frosty night, have " an exoteric and esoteric design. The one is to portray the ancient Egyptian in his daily life, and the other to trace the gradual progress of a thinking and earnest soul from its first doubt of a false, to its final belief in a true, faith." And then, as if this were not alarming enough to those who are looking for mere amusement wvithout labour of thought, it is further prefaced that the entire story has " a metaphysical design :" that " Amasis and Azeth are embodiments of spiritual temptations on the one side, and of spiritual weakness, joined to an intense longing for the true and good, on the other. Lysinoe, in her relation wvith Azeth, stands as a type of passive virtue, and the holy influence of a spiritualized love; while in Amenophis, the religious truth and purity which are the latest revelations to the soul, are attempted to be expressed." Now we frankly confess to an aversion to all allegorical tales. If the story be in itself a good one, the allegory is forgotten as we read, and if recalled afterwards, appears like an impertinent interference with a pleasant memory; if very obvious in the perusal, it breaks the charm of the story. Both are defects; but the former is by far the most readily forgiven, and that is the character of the allegory in Azeth. The romance will be read, and even may become popular; but in despite, and not as a consequence, of its "metaphysical design." Fortunately for author and publisher, or for both, the tale is so well imagined, so cleverly wrought, and the descriptions are so vivid and eloquent, that the great majority of readers will go through it for the sake of the romance, charmed by the splendid series of pictures and the exciting scenes presented to them, without permitting their pleasure to be disturbed by the recollection that there is an exoteric meaning in them, and that the personages whose adventures they have been so eagerly pursuing not only never did exist, but were never intended by the author to be looked upon as embodiments of existence, only as mere types-metaphysical abstractions-shadows of a shade. The author has used some diligence in the collection of his materials. He has well read up for his work. Ancients and moderns have been laid under contribution to supply the best intelligence relating to the men and manners of ancient Egypt. But although probably very correct in the forms of things, the spirit is not there which gave them reality and life. It is, in truth, the soul of the nineteenth century animating the frames and moving among the scenes of the year 7{o0 before Christ. The personages think and speak according to the modes of thought and speech of our own day; the springs of action are ours, and belong not to the times in which they are pictured as arising. Nor is this the peculiar fault of the author of Azeth. 3He shares it with every novelist who has attempted to lay the scene of a romance in the ages that preceded Christianity. LOCKHART, MOORE, BULWER, are signal examples of this failure. Is it indeed impossible for a Christian to comprehend the spirit of the heathen> It is strange that not all past times thus baffle the imagination of the novelists. The middle ages, with their forms and faith, equally are of the past, and yet are they reproduced with a truthfulness which is at once recognised. But into the classic times, though the records are equally explicit, and the material to draw from no less e abundant, the novelist cannot so throw himself as to make e their spirit his own, and restore them to us'as they were, not in shape alone, but in soul. Let our metaphysical author amuse himself with an endeavour to trace the cause of this, and we will gladly submit his lucubrations to the readers of THE CRITIC for their edification. The author's style leans too much to the exaggerated He is ever in superlatives; nothing is itself alone, but! the expletives of our language are exhausted to make it I great or splendid. He has contracted the vice of " the intense" school, and, if he be young, the sooner he emancipates himself from its influence the better for his future prospects: for he has undoubted abilities, and there is much in this novel that will well reward perusal. The story is attractive; the descriptions are not only correct to history, but they are singularly graphic, and many passages of reflection are scattered throughout, which cannot fail to please, and which mark the author as a man of no ordinary compass of thought. Thus, taking it for all in all, spite of its metaphysical design, it is a novel that may be added to the circulating library, and borrowed without fear of time and money wasted. A few extracts will shew its manner. Of description, take THE SHOPS OF MEMPHIS. From the jeweller's Taia proceeded to the weavers of linen; scarce deigning to turn her pretty head as she passed the meaner shops of the rope-maker, and net-weaver, and the manufacturer of papyrus. Yet she balted before the unshuttered windows of the leather-cutter, whose embroidered sandals, which had been steeped in the white juice of the wreathing periploca, and dyed in the seeds of the dear acacia, seemed almost fit for the use of her sweet mistress. But Taia never vouchsafed to clothe the glancing feet of Nitocris in any but the sandals of Anthylla, which was as celebrated for this manufacture, as for its luscious wines. All its revenues being appropriated to the private expenditure of the Royal Lady, part were paid in this article of embroidered sandals. And though many other towns could produce slippers equal to, if not surpassing, those of Anthylla in beauty; yet fashion then, as ever, held supreme sway, and gave to all stamped by her sanction, n highest yet factitious value. The cleansers of stained or foul linen were also unheeded by the tire-maid. Nitocris might not employ the followers of such a trade as this ! For where use bad soiled too much for further wear, the fuller must not renew. The luxury of the kingly palace might not be disgraced by the presence of mean economy; and the sacred person of the Princess Palacide was not to be polluted by aught that was not best and newest. As much attention was paid to her as to the very statue of Isis; and with this, no article upon which the slightest stain rested, could be brought in contact. At the glass-blower's furnace she would also stop-the restless Taia !-and bargain for his gilded bottles, or painted cups, or long strings of engraven and coloured beads, with which the Princess often employed her leisure hours, by stringing them in loose, fanciful devices, or fastening them on bags of linen, cloth, and silk. This was a favourite employment of the ladies of Egypt, when wearied with weaving and embroidering. The smith, or armourmaker had power to arrest the hand-maid's wandering eyes, for there the flashing of the sun on a large metal mirror, the flattering surface of which reflected back a picture of such grace and loveliness as was that bright lip and dimpled brow, soon attracted her attention. And thisTHE STREETS OF MEMPHIS. The streets of Memphis presented an animated and diversified appearance. In the open shops were seated their several owners, employed in their particular trades, while attending, at the same time, to such customers as might arrive. In one street, the carpenter exposed to view the evidences of his handicraft, and proofs of his skill. Boxes of every size, destined either for conveying goods by land or canal travelling, or as idle ornaments for the luxurious apartments of the Egyptian nobles, stood on long, wide slabs. Behind these sat the owner, beneath the shadow of the roof and the awning which hung below the eaves. Small, elaborate articles, of fanciful shapes, were found here in great abundance. Fishes, which the thieving fox had alheady seized, ducks, geese, crocodiles, Typhonian figures, beautful female forms, birds, and many others of the like nature, were mixed amongst those whose beauty consisted in the engravings, and inlaid precious metals, or foreign woods, with which they were overspread. Luxurious chairs and couches, and multiform stools and carved tables, were piled up in the interior, or exposed in the front of the shop, where the workman sat. This was one of the favourite shops of the Egyptian ladies, whose taste for the beautiful in works of art was a prominent feature in their character. And many a long white veil might be seen lingering round the carpenter's wares, in admiration of their grace of design: and many a fair purchaser suddenly reflected, that a lotus-stand inlaid with ivory, or ajewel-case of the perfumed wood of Arabia where the very soil breathed of sweets, or a box of quaint shape and costly materials, was necessary for some indispensable business of the toilet. As a specimen of the metaphysics, read this explication of THE AUTHOR'S PHILOSOPHY. Earth calls loudly to me through sense. The visible beauty of nature-tbe warm loveliness of sentient life-seem to me at times the only realities; the things to which I should do well to cling, turning from all else as from dreams, and shadows, and vapour-woven visions. But again in stillness-in the silent night-Heaven whispers to me, and its angels seem to hover round; and I hear their songs saying to me, that this our present life is the UNREAL; and that its pleasures and pursuits are all too coarse and rough for the pure soul's delicate love: that even in physical creation the true life and the true beauty are not the mere outward features of the form, but the spitit that lies shrouded within. Oh ! it is a fierce warfare I Would to Heaven it were ended, though even in the cold tomb I " Thou art undergoing that which all men undergo in the first stage of their Thinking Life," replied the Priest. " There is in the breasts of all an unending conflict between these Two Natures. And by our constitution it must be so. Our num. ber is Two; our souls are dually governed; and the world's question will ever be: which shall I serve; to which shall I consecrate myself-to the Body or the Spirit? to privation called virtue, or to the indulgence of natural instincts and propensities, which religion mysteriously names vice? In youth's hour of glowing passion, to the latter: in the calmness of age, to the former. And both obey the Laws of Nature in thus devoting themselves ! Is this thine only doubt? thine only warfare? Foolish boy! Thou hast disturbed a sandhill, and shriekest out that the universe is shaken. In afteryears, when Thought shall have become to thee, what it is to many-a fierce monster that goads to madness, unless thou art strong, and canst subdue it under thee; when Passibn shall have died, and left thee without an excuse for thy sorrow; then wilt thou look back to these puny troubles, and sigh for the serenity which such could disturb ! Obey thy natural impulses. Live in thy young life; and waste it not in paleeyed musings, and cold thought. Use thy passions-obey thy impulses-drink deep of the cup of joy-thou wert formed for this by nature. Leave to age the chilliness of self-control; but heap up round thy bed of youth the lilies of delight. And for thy religion-venerate the priests as the visible, incarnate gods. This is all that the iEdes demands. In acting thus thou wilt be acting more wisely than in striving to unite the wisdom of maturity-with the passionateness of green boyhood. Follow Nature, and obey her commands, and surely thou must do right and well."

Charlie Thornhill; or, the Dunce of the Family-. a Novel. By Charles Clarke. 3 vols. (Chapman & Hall.)?For readers who want to hear about horses, races, steeplechases, BeWs Life, mis en seine et en action, the conversation and observations of real owners of thorough-breds, betting books mada up, wagers lost, jockeys and gentlemen riders described as they are among themselves, may here have their curiosity gratified. Society at BadenBaden and at Homburg, the Kursaals, the gambling at home and abroad, French steeple-chases, <&c, are displayed in these pages by one who has the appearance of knowing what he talks about. The story plays a very secondary part; it is vague and disjointed, standing still for a while, and then going on with a start. There is a murder, and a villain who holds the strings by which he works other villains,?there are mysterious gipsies and blacklegs, and an estate which seems to belong to two owners,?lost documents, and police officers, and there is a hero who would be an excellent man if he did not gamble, and who would be a rich man if he did not lose his money on every occasion; indeed, his purse seems to bleed at every pore, and how he does not become a beggar is a miracle,? and there is a good younger brother who enters his uncle's banking-house; he is the dunce and sensible man of the 6tory, and a very good fellow. The framework of the story is weak, but as readers will take up the book for the sake of the scenes of real life, it is of not so much consequence. Where the author has worked on his own knowledge and experience, the book is good; the school scenes are especially pleasant, and the general tone of the book is fresh. It will be more acceptable to men than women, because men do not care so much for a story as for detached scenes, and those iu ' Charlie Thornhill' are very spirited and well written.

Rachel Gray: a Tale Founded on Fact. By Julia Kavanagh. Author of 44 Nathalie," 44 Madeleine," 44 Woman in France," &c.,'&c. London : Hurst and Blackett. 1856. 44 Rachel Gray," by Miss Kavanagh, is a very dull tale of the weakly amiable school. The heroine, to use our Laureate's words, is? 44 One dabbling in the fount of futive tears, And nursed by mealy-mouthed philanthropies." The tale is founded, so we are told in the preface, on facts which have occurred under tbe authoress's own observation. The scene is laid in humble life, and the actors are poor and lowly. We object to this latter circumstance being put forward by Miss Kavanagh as a merit. In itself it is neither a beauty nor a blemish ; and a writer is not justified in stigmatizing his readers as worldly, selfish, or unfeeling, because they may not admire a novel which deals largely in feeble sentiment and weak humanity. If the mass of readers refuse to applaud such a book, the writer thereof may be well assured that their indifference arises, not from want of sympathy with truth and nature wherever they are to be found, but from the artistic inability of the narrator to interest us in his story. The whole world acknowledges Sir Walter Scott to have been the prince of novelists. And who has dwelt with so much tenderness on the sorrows and struggles of the poor. Did society refuse to weep for Jeannie Deans, and to welcome her as one of the truest heroines ever drawn, although she was a cottar's daughter. Was not tbe picture of the stem grief of old Mucklehackit in the Antiquary recognized and admired for its truth, though the stricken old man was only a fisherman? Did we refuse our sympathy to Alton Locke, who, though a poet, was also a tailor ? No, Miss Kavanagh must understand that if we refuse to be moved by a tale of humble life, it is not because the story is lowly, but because we cannot recognize it as true. The first chapter introduces us to Rachel Gray, a young dressmaker, weeping and maundering over a pot of crocuses, which she persists in addressing as 44 creatures," much to the disgust of her step-mother, whose common sense revolts at her daughter's sickly affectations. It is but fair to say, that though this is the view which we take of their respective characters, Rachel Gray is meant to be a most charming heroine, and her step-mother to be a coarse old woman. As a specimen of Miss Gray's humbleness and piety, we will quote a few lines from the same chapter. She is coming away from a grand house in Belgravia, whose mistress has snubbed her and where a tall footman has laughed at her. It was night when she stood once more in the street. Above the pale outline of the houses spread a sky of dark azure. A star shone in it, a little star; but it burned with as brilliant a light as any great planet. Rachel gazed at it earnestly, and the shadow passed away. " What matter !" she thought, " even though a man in livery made a jest of me?even though a lady in silk was scornful. What matter! God made that star for me as well as for ber! Besides," she added, checking a thought which might, she feared, be too proud, " besides, who, and what am I, that I should repine ?" Wo cannot allow ourselves to ridicule even the misapplication and perversion of scriptural texts which frequently occur in this volume. The piety of Rachel Gray which we are intended to admire and imitate is of a very pharisaical cast, and mainly consists in conceited ejaculations of gratitude for her own superior goodness. The words of holy writ are quoted with a familiarity closely bordering on irreverence, and are generally paraphrased according to Miss Kavanaghs taste, who considers 4l he raised his voice and wept," a more beautiful and forcible expression than " he lifted up his voice and wept." In spite of many such affectations, and of tbe unattractiveness of the story, which has no plot, no hero, no incident; we gladly admit that there are in 44 Rachel Gray" many touching passages. It would be difficult for any woman to tell us a tale of sorrow which should not move us. In the devoted love of a lonely neglected daughter for a stern and indifferent parent, in the early death of a spoilt and wayward girl who returns her father's idolatrous love with placid coldness, in the agony of a broken hearted old man's grief, and in the heroic self-sacrifices of a neglected woman, there must always be something which appeals irresistibly to our sympathies and interest/ No matter how clumsily tbe tale be told, such sorrows are human, we know them, and understand them, and feel for them. The degree of interest must depend on the powers of tbe author; skilful treatment, of course, will heighten it; the constant introduction of feeble sentiment and unreal wordy religion only tend to weaken it. The following description of Rachel's visit to ber stern father's after his wife's death is more true to nature, and less weakened by parenthetical twaddle, than any other passage in the book. She went to her father's house. She found bim sturdy and stern, planing with the vigour of a man in the prime of life. His brow became clouded, as he saw and recognized his daughter's pale face and shrinking figure. Still he bade her come in, for she stood on the threshold timidly waiting for a welcome; and his ungraciousness was limited to the cold question of what had brought her. 441 am come to see you, father," was her mild reply. And as to this Thomas Gray said nothing, Rachael added : 44 My mother is dead " 441 know it, and have known it these three months," he drily answered. 44 She died very happy," resumed Rachel,44 and before she died, she desired me to come and tell you that she sincerely forgave you all past unkindness." A frown knit the rugged brow of Thomas Gray. His late wife had had a sharp temper of her own; aud perhaps he thought himself as much sinned against as sinning. But he made no comment. 44 Father," said Rachel, speaking from her very heart, and looking earnestly in his face, " may I come and live with you ?" Thomas Gray looked steadily at his daughter, and did not reply. But Rachel resolved not to be easily disheartened, persisted none the less. 44 Father," she resumed, and her voice faltered with the depth of her emotion,44 pray let nie. I know you do not care much for me. I dare say you are right, that I am not worth much; but still I might be useful to you. A burden I certainly should not he; and in sickness, in age, 1 think, I hope, father, you would like to have your daughter near you. 441 am now your only child," she added, after a moment's pause; 44 the only living thing of your blood, not one relative have I in this wide world; and you, father, you too are alone. Let me come to live with vou. Pray let me ! If my presence is irksome to you," added Rachel, gazing wistfully in his face, as both hope and courage began to fail her,441 shall keep out of the way. Indeed, indeed," she added with tears in her eves, " I shall." He had heard her out very quietly, and very quietly he replied: " Rachel, what did I go to America for?" Rachel, rather bewildered with the question, faltered that she did not know. " And what did I come to live here for ?" lie continued. Rachel did not answer; but there was a sad foreboding in her heart. " To be alone," he resumed ; and he spoke with some ste nness, ,4to be alone." And he went back to his planing.

CHRISTMAS BOOKS. MIEssRs. G. BELL & SONS8' publication The Tyne and its Tributaries contains a descriptive text and woodcut illustrations by Mr. W. J. Palmer. The literary part of this useful and readable volume has been prepared with care by laying histories, romances, and ballads under contribution, and dipping deeply into antiquarian publications of the present time. The cuts are all good; some are charming in execution andin feeling, and their subjects were well chosen. Liviniy Painters of France and England (Remington & Co.) is a handsomely printed and tastefully bound volume, containing fifteen etchings by English and French engravers from pictures by painters of both countries. The etchings are accompanied by brief descriptive and critical notes. Some of the etchings have just merit enough to make them attractive, but others are really valuable. Among the latter is a bright and spirited but rather slight version of Mr. Millais's ' Yeoman of the Guard,' by M. C. Waltner; the face is good, the action is excellent, but the whole lacks richness of colour. ' Une Lecture chez Diderot'is a perfectly drawn and solid rendering, by Mf. MIongin, of M. MIeissonier's masterpiece at the Exhibition in Paris, 1867. Here againi we miss the colour, and with it, of course, the chiaroscuro of the picture. The figures look like beautifully carved marble statues. M. Ranius's reproduction of Mr. F. Holl's 'Leaving Home' is good, solid, and effective. 'Le Matin' is a fine etching from the sunry landscape of M. C. Bernier; the plate is due to M. Yon's skilful hands. ' La Madeleine' was painted by DI. Henner in 1878, and is represented here by a thoroughly fine version of the nearly naked figure, in a restricted light which lent itself fully to the sympathetic skill of M. Didier, than whom no one could have rendered the picture better. M. Casanova's ' Une Mlauvaise Plaisanterie' has been rendered Nvith a sparkling etect, but somewhat slightly, by Ml. Lalauze. Mr. Boughton's ' Bearers of the Burden ' is very carefully reproduced by M. L. Gaucherel. The distance is a little too prominent, and the figures seem toosmall. The masculine picture which we saw lately at the Salon, called by Al. U. Butin ' Le Wpart,' is here given admirably by Ml. Chainpollion. The emasculated pathos of Gustave V1oreau's 'Orplihe' must not prevent us from admiring the fine workmanship of 31. Gaujean's etching. The sparkle of the satin skirts of the lady in 31. Jacquet's ' La Premiere Arrivde' having attracted our attention in Paris in 1879, we can testify to the fidelity of Al. L. Flameng's rendering of a showy picture, and wish the engraver worthier subjects for his skill. From'y Eye to Hea rt (Chapman & Hall) comprises small photographs from cabinet genre pictures such as M. de Jonghe affects. Verses by various poets face them. The title-page says that Mr. S. S. Rothwell has supplied "elucidations" to the " art " or the " poetry " of this volume, we are not told which. The photographs are pretty enough for a scrap-book. Vol. XIII. of The Vanity Fair Album ('Vanity Fair' Office) is neither better nor worse than most of its forerunners. The acrid writings of "Jehu " are but a trifle more acrid than of yore, and he makes antithetical points with a force and zest which, if not agreeable, are at least piquant. For instance, there is plenty of clever epigram in the notice of the Marquis Conyngham being Equerry to the Queen, who was promoted "after six years of an impetuous career after the royal carriages." "Spy's" portrait of Sir It. Temple is capital, and by no means ill-natured. " Ape's " portrait of the first Bishop of Liverpool should be true and, if a caricature, fair. We do not think the artist of the superb satiric statuette of Lord Sherbrooke, the finest of modern personal satires, has done justice to himself in delineating the bishop. The half-affectionate tribute of " Jehu " to the Marquis of Exeter is not equal to " Ape's" capital portrait. On the other hand, " T.'s" portrait of H.H. Ismail Pacha is worthy of the saying of " Jehu " that the Khedive " passed a gigantic Irish Land Bill in his own favour, and seized a million of acres of the best land of Egypt." Anmong the capital portraits here are "T.'s" 'Alderman Fowler,' which is first rate, and "Spy's" 'Lord Harris.' "T." has finished the likenesses of Earl Fortescue and Lord Rendlesham until they are worthy of Edridge, and too true to be satirical. " Spy's " insight into character is seen at its best in his ' Duke of Norfolk.' The Lord Mayor "lent himself" most happily to the laughter-moving pencil of the same draughtsman, whose 'Hon. WV. Lowther' has touches of Frans Hals. Some of these portraits will astonish the future, because they contradict all possible first ideas of the men, e.g., Capt. Boycott is placed in an honourable niche, but his picture by " Spy " is neither fair nor fortunate; the same may be said of " Ape's" picture of the leader of the " Ever-Victorious [Chinese] Army," who, says Vanity Fair, ' is the grandest Englishman alive, and a lieutenantcolonel of Engineers waiting his promotion." Secured by a most ingenious and rather elegant lock, and sumptuously bound in a welldesigned cover of dark sage green, impressed with blind-tooling and gold in appropriate patterns, the new 4lbum for cartes-de-visite that we have received from Messrs. Marion & Co. is deserving of much praise. The leaves which are indented to receive portraits have the novel and very great merit of being in colours and dark enough to set off the photographs, that is, instead of being white, as is usually the case with mounts for cartes-de-visite and other photographs, they are fawn, olive, grey, or green, and dark enough in tone not to overwhelm the lights of the portraits. Accordingly, the mounts assist instead of damaging the effect. A drawback to this novelty is the super-abundant richness of the patterns in dead gold which overlie the soberly tonedand tinted mounts.-Apart from thelpainited blossom on the cover which gives its name to the volume, Ihle WV/dite Filower Albume (T. J. Smith & Co.) is an excellent and acceptable specimen of its class. Some of its floral illustrations within are pretty and neatly delineated. The sides of the cover are padded. Of this novelty we do not see the advantage.

A Ruthless Avenger. By Mrs. Conney. 3 vols. (Hutchinson & Co.) Mrs. Conney has put together a capital sensational romance on somewhat oldfashioned lines. ' A Ruthless Avenger' is a story of virtue and villainy, of crime and the tracking of crime, of jewels and elopements, of a coronet usurped, recovered, and thrown away; but the author has not been satisfied with mere sensations and improbabilities. She has done her best to make things follow each other in natural sequence and on adequate motives, and for the most part she has heen successful. More than once or twice, when the reader recognizes trite incidents and well-worn machinery, a fresh turn is given to the development of the story which relieves it from banality. Here and there, no doubt, Mrs. Conney is commonplace and melodramatic, and she does not make the best of all her situations. Still her novel is quite above the average of its kind, and is thoroughly entertaining.

At the Door of the Gate. By Forrest Reid. I (Arnolid, us.) MR. REID'S title covers a story of considerable interest both to those who like to soar above the commonplace by means of occult fiction and those who can enjoy satire at the expense of self-conceit, slatternliness, and gullibility. His main theme is the attainment of spiritual certainty through direct acquaintance with God on the part of a remarkably conscientious young man, condemned to feel an almost fratricidal hatred for his brother. The scenes of the story are laid in Ireland, but England would have served just as well, as the author's principal characters are essentially not of the soil, but of the average British town. It must not be supposed, however, that there is lack of decision in the character-drawing, or any failure to visualize the places of the story. On the contrary, Mr. Reid excels in the httle lively touches which stimulate a reader's receptiveness. His description of a Swedenborgian clerk's household, for instance, is of satisfying completeness and comicality. If one wished to argue that coarseness can rise to beauty by sheer comic art, a better illustration of such an achievement could hardly be found than the incident in a Belfast teawarehouse on p. 65 of this novel. No little skill is shown in the presentation of women, and the tragedy in the process which makes the hero ready for the " vision " that guides his unrecorded life is adroitly devised. I I

The Contrast, and Other Stories. BY ELINOR GLYN. (LDuckworth and Co. 6s.) IT is not difficult to trace the same brain at work in the fashioning of the figures which go to make up the stories in this book. In "The Point of View "-the longest one-we have contrasted a slow, narrowminded and conceited English lover, with a masterful, handsome, and fascinating Russian. To accentuate the inferiority of the former, Miss Glyn has allowed her pen so much freedom that a very poor specimen of our countrymen is the result. The Russian, on the other hand, might have stepped straight out of any fairy story, so magical are the results he achieves in the short time of three days. We think the title of the first sketch ought to have been given to this one; it is much more appropriate. In two of the stories the author comes very near to getting the short, crisp finish which adds so much to writing of this kind. Imagination is shown in ".Her Advice " and "The Irtonwood Ghost," and, judging from the present collection, there is a danger that this quality, if not held in restraint, may develop too much and give a farcical aspect to ordinary occurrences.

VOYAGES AND TRAVELS. W'wlerinqs in Corsica: its Ilisfory and its Jhos. Translated from the German of Ferdinmand Gregorovius. By ALEXANIEIR McIR. 2 vOls. Edinburgh: Constable and Co. TnIE visit to CorAca described in these vo!unies took place in the year 1852, the author having been tempted by the attractions of the island which has so wondrously influenced the destinies j of the world, to spend a summer there, noting its aspects and collecting its traditions. lie was not a mnere tourist, but an inl(lustrious explorer. lie was not content with detailing routes, describing views and buildings. and picking up doubtful intelligence by tfic wayside: lie dived into the history of the isl:,nd and gleaned from the poetry of the people. Hence a work whiCh haa nmore worth tlana most books written by travellers. It lias sonic chain to a pernianeut place upon tile bookshelf, and was undouIbtedly entitled to the lionours of translation which have been so well bcstowed upon it by M1r. Muir. 31. Gregorovilus opens with the history of the island-; and then procee(ls to narrate hid wanderings in it. lie found the people generally kiiial, I frank, hospitable, of particular simplicity in i many of their custonis, and seemingly happy and prosperous-with a natural pride in tile relationship of the '.apoleon family, and of devoted atta(chment to the dynasty. lie describes thio aspect of the country as very picturesque, and some portions of it extremely productive. Here is a pleasant picture ofcOnIICAN LIFE. The evening landscape is very beautiful, from the Red Islands. To the right, the sea and the whole peninsula of Cape Corso veiled in haze; to the left, running out into the gulf, a red tongue of land; in the foreground the little city, fishing-skiffs, and one or two sailing-vessels in the harbour. In the background three glorious hills-NMonte di Santa Angiola, Santa Susanna, and the rugged Monte Feliceto; on their slopes olive-groves and numerous black villages. Here and there glow the fires of the goat-herds. Nowhere can people lead a more patriarchal and pacelable life than do the inhabitants of Isola Rosa. The land yields its produce, and the sea too. They have enough. In the evening they sit and gossip Oil the mole, or they angle in the still' water, or wander in the olive-groves and orange-gardens. Through the day the fisherman prepares his nets, and the handicraftsman sits plying his work under the inulberry-tree before his door. here should be no lack of song and guitar. I had made myself at home in a little coffee-house. The young hostess could sing beautifully; at my wish a little company assembled in the evening, and I had twanging of guitars and charming Corsican songs to my heart's content. The children who followed me sang me songs too, the Earseillaise, the Girondist's March, and Bertram's Parting, the last with new words in honour of the President of France, the refrain always closing with Vive Louis Nqpohton! Little Camillo could sing the Marseillaise best. We looked for shells on the beach. There are as many of them as you can desire opposite the little nunnery which stands in the garden by the sea, and in which the Sisters of the Madonna alle Grazie live. The Madonna-Sisters have an enchanting view of sea and hill from their villa; and perhaps some of them have dreams of their lost romance of life and love, when the golden sickle of the moon is shining so beautifully above Mlonte Reparata as it is now. The strand is, as far as vou can see, snow-white, broidered with coral-dust and the most exquisite shells. Little Camillo was indefatigable in picking up what he thought would please me. lie was fondest, however, of the little living lopere-mussels which suck themselves fast to stones. These he brought out of the water, anid forthwith consumed with great gusto, wondering that I would not share his feast. In the evening we bathed together, and swam through the phosphorescent waves amid a million sparks. The most curious of the national ceremonies ae those which prevail in OORSICAN FUNERALS. When a death has occurredl, the relatives standing round the bed repeat the prayers of the rosary; they then raise a loud wail (yrido). I[he corpse is now laid upon a table standing by the wall, called the tola. The head, on which a cap is placed, rests on a pillow. To preserve the natural appearance of the features, the head is bound with a cloth or fillet, supporting the chin, and fastened beneath the cap. If it is a soung girl, he lies in a white shroud, and on her headis a wreth of flowers; if it is a grown-np female, she usually wears a coloured dress; that of ged women is black. A male corpse lies in a shroud and Phrygian cap, resembling thus tile Etrus-an dead. as they may be seen, surrounled with mourners, in representations contained in the Etrurian Museum of the Vatican. Tile friends watch and wail beside the tola often throughout the whole night; and tire is always kept burning. But the principal lament occurs early on the morning of the funeral, when the body is laid in the coffin, and before the Brothers of Death come to lift the bier. The friends and relatives come from the neighbouring villages to the funeral. . . . The silence of the grave now reigns irv the chamber. Nothing is beard but the deep breath;;,g of those weird women cowering on the floor, wrapped in theirmantles, thehead sunk upon the breast, expressing the deepest grief in the manner customary among the ancient Greeks, whose artists represeut those overwhelmed with sorrow as covering tile head and conoealing the face. Nature herself has given the human being only two ways of indicating extreme sufferingthe irpressible outburst of feeling in the loud crv in which the whole vital energy seems to concentrate itself, and the profound silence in which the vital energies sink into stupor. Suddenly one of the women springs out of the cowering circle, and, like an inspired seeres, begins the song ulpon the dead. She chalits it ts recintatto, strophe after strophe, ending each with awo! wo! wo! whicimthechortsofwailers repeat, as in the Greek tragedy. The woman who thus sings and leads the chorus has also composed the dirge, or has i;nprovised it asshesang. In Sardinia, it is usually the youngest girl who leads . Let the reader imagine, then, the corpse upon the tola, the women crouching round it on the groundl; a young girl rises, and, her countenance hanminig with enthusiasm, improvises, like a Miriam or it Sappho, verses of the most surpassing grace, and full of the boldest images; exhaustlessly her raptt soul pours forth the rhythmic stream of dithvranit!,, which express melodiously all that is deep;est and hiighet in human sorrow. Tlhe chorns wails at the close (of each stroplIe, Deh! deh! deh!' I know not whether any- where in the world a picture could be found, which combines the repulsive with the beautiful in a manner so profoundly poetical and significant as such a scene, where a naiden sings before a bier what her pure young soul has that inonhent been inspired with, while a chorus of Furies howl the accompaniment. When the Brothers of Death have arrived before I the house to take awav the bier, a loud wail is again raised, and the funeral procession now accompanies the deceased with laments to the church, where he receives consecration, and from the church again wivth wail and song to the churchyard. The obsequies are closed with a meal called the conrito or Icorforto; a repast called the reylia has previously been given those who watched by the corpse, and each Brother of Death receives a cake. The conforto is given to the relations and friends of the deceased, either in his own house or in that of a kinsman, and it is customary to invite the guests with a pressing vehemency. It honours the departed if the repast be on as munificent a scale as possible; and if he has been respected during his life, it is observable in the number of the guests. Great expense is frequently lavished on this funeral banquet (banchetlo), and bread and meats are distributed through the houses of the village. Black is the Corsican mourning colour; frequently the beard is allowed to remain for a long time uncut. When the anniversary of the jfuneral comes round, the banquet is sometimes repeated. The reader will have noticed the similarity between these funeral rites and the Irish wake. There lingers yet among ourselves a remnant of the feast. Trhe funeral cake is still a standing dish in countrv towns. We conclude with a primitive sketch of A NIGIHT AT A (IOATFRRID'S. We had a bread-soup, cheese and milk, and, in honour of the guest, roasted goat's flesh. For this classic goatherd took the flesh from the palo, and, after the fashion of ancient times, stuck it on a spit, and, kneeling, held it over the glowing fire. Carefully, from time to time, a piece of bread was pressed upon the dripping fat, that the precious juice of the sweet loin-pieces might not be lost. lie cooked the trouts in a broth of goat's flesh; and when they were Iready, lie set them before me, and ladled me forth from the mighty ladle as much as heart could desire. I saw it in the children's eyes, that this was no ordinary meal; and it would have refreshed me still more admirably, had they been allowed to share it. It was night in the cabin. I was puzzled to imagine how our sleeping was to be arranged within the I narrow limits. But that was soon managed. Mv blanket was spread for me on the ground, and I stretched mvself on it, beside the innermost wall; I was at a loss, however, for something on which to rest mv head. I looked at Angelo. "Divine and Iwise Angelo," I said, "give ear. I have never, I swear to you, been a Sybarite, yet am I'accustomed to pillows. Could not your lhospitalitv provide me with some such convenience ?" Angelo pondered; then he handed me his zaino or shepherd's bag of goatskin, and spoke the winged words-" Now sleep, and felicisama notte ." Graduallv the others laid themselves down, wife and children, on the naked earth, leaning their heads on the wall. Angelo lay nearest the threshold; beside hiin the youngest child Maria; then Santa his wife, Lilyfloer, Paolo Maria, and myself. So we all lay peaceably together, our feet turned towards the fire. It was not long till thev !were all asleep, and I lay contemplating With satisIfaction this happily slumbering family of Gymnososphists, and mused on the words of the wise Sancho, ,when lie praisl the inventor of sleep, "the mantle that covers all human care, the food that appeases hunger, the water that extinguishes thirst, the fire that warms the cold, the cold that alleviates the iheat-in short, the universal money for which all things may be bought, the beam and scale that equalises king and shepherd." The fire shed a red Iglow over the singular group. I lamented that I was not a painter. But the intolerable beat and 1smoke of the pitch-pine would not let me sleep. I Irose from time to time and stepped over the sleepers i Iinto the free air. MNf. Gregorovius has too great a tendency to (disquisition, which has not always novelty to recommend it. The translator would have done lwisely to omit mere talk.

Hostages to Fortune. SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1873. LITERATURE NOVELS OF THE WEEK. By the Author of ' Lady Audley's Secret.' 3 vols. (Maxwell.) Leah. By Annie Edwardes. 3 vols. (Bentley & Son.) Claude Hambro. By J. C. Westwood. 3 vols. (Samuel Tinsley.) The Queen of Connaught. 3 vols. (Bentley & Son.) The special applicability of Miss Braddon's title is hard to see. No doubt her hero marries and has a son born to him, both circumstances under which the phrase which she has selected for that purpose is not uncommonly used; but in what respect his marriage and paternity placed him in the position suggested, more than the heroes of other novels, in whose career such incidents are also not uncommon, is difficult to comprehend. Indeed, wey should rather have said that such a man as Herman Westray, who, at not much over thirty, is described as being in receipt of 2,000?. a year, as the result of sundry magazine articles and two or three plays, besides having invested several thousands derived from the same source, must have got the better of Fortune to so great a degree that it would be a mere paradox to speak of him as being in a position to " give hostages." The fact is, we take it, that, with a writer of Miss Braddon's school, the title of the book is no more governed by the nature of the contents than is the colour of the cover: so long as the one catches the ear and the other the eye, nothing more is required. When the book is once bought and read, it matters little enough how the buyer's or the reader's notice has been secured. ' Hostages to Fortune' is a nice, proverbial-sounding title, so on to the back of the book it goes, though it is equally appropriate to threequarters of the novels that are written. This may seem trifling, but there is, we believe, a morality in the naming of books, and the disregard which some of our modern authoresses Bhow for it is part and parcel of their whole method. The oldest and simplest way in which a work of fiction can be named is, of course, by calling it after the chief personage,? , 'Odyssey,' * Book of Job,' ? Othello,' ' Pamela,' ' Ivanhoe,' * Emma,' and so forth. Later came the fashion of giving a name allusive to some point in the character of that personage, or to some special incident in the story, as ' Heautontimorumenos,' ' Le Medecin malgre Lui,' ' The Fool of Quality,'?the reader can fill up the list for himself. A good deal later, we take it, are such titles as ' Much Ado about Nothing,' 'Pride and Prejudice,' and all that large and increasing class which consists either of some well-known quotation or proverb or of a few words to carry the reader's mind to some such; titles which are intended to sum up in brief the general drift of the story, whether it be as a lesson to be taught or merely a general rule or law to be illustrated by a certain course of events or development of character, and of this the French proverbes will supply examples enough. The use of such nomenclature is, of course, to set a reader thinking over its connexion with the story to which it is attached, nd so to help towards an appreciation of the manner in which the story is worked out, since, in all fiction, whether dramatic or narrative, it is essential to perfection that no incident, no speech, should be suffered to remain that does not in some way contribute to the general progress towards the denofiment. Thus it is, then, that the due selection of a title affords some clue to the direction in which an author wishes to lead us; and hence, when we find a book with a title in no way suggestive of the drift or purpose of the story (for we do not suppose Miss Braddon to hold that it i3 more imprudent in a literary man who is making 2,000/. a year to marry, than in a Government clerk who is earning 400/. or 500/.), we get a piece of valuable information as to the " genesis " of the said story. We strongly suspect, that is, that a fluent writer, who has long ago gained her position with the novel-reading world, sits down and flings together a little more of the kind of thing which she knows will please her public, namely, gossip about theatres and literary people, with some Welsh country life to act as a foil; brings a man from the literary and theatrical world in contact with a woman belonging to the unsophisticated country world; marries them, and then, to get the kind of interest which is now looked for by novel-readers, to whom (if one may judge of the demand by the supply) a marriage without any suspicion of unfaithfulness is a dull affair, calls in the usual wealthy roue to assail the wife, and a popular actress to compromise the husband; and so, with the aid of a parson to get matters straight at last, fills up three volumes. To one who knows how many pages can be filled with descriptions of dresses and furniture, this must be an easy task enough; and it is to be regretted that Miss Braddon should not have found time to revise her book sufficiently to get rid of such a monstrous word as " dilapitude," such vulgarisms as "of the spinster persuasion," and such hopeless names (for Welsh places) as Llandrysak and Lochwithian; in a word, to get rid of those little bits of carelessness which show that she does not aim at excellence even in the ephemeral kind of work in which she has chosen to employ her undoubted powers as a writer of fiction. Mrs. Edwardes's story, in spite of occasional shortcomings in grammar and spelling, and graver lapses from good taste, is sufficiently well written to make one regret that she has chosen so worthless a topic. The inevitable Nemesis that attends a purely mercenary marriage is the moral of her tale; but the devious and dirty paths through which her characters are dragged, produce more effect upon the reader than the ultimate triumph of virtue succeeds in counteracting. Leah is the neglected daughter of a selfish spendthrift, and at the outset of her history has succeeded in capturing a matrimonial prize in the shape of a dissipated youth, who, if he survives another twelvemonth, will be heir to a hundred thousand pounds. In the mean time she has experienced a real attachment to a half-Italian doctor of small means, and attracted an aristocratic roue, who intends to combine (after poor Jack Chamberlayne's death) pecuniary advantage with the satisfaction of such love as he is capable of feeling. Lord Stair?for our author has adopted the fashion of employing real na sh ch lu of of se dc w: at to fo ai fii m bl ol tl te t< P t( fi t! F e names, an impertinence of which nothing short of an action for libel will cure a certain class of writers?is a loathsome but not absolutely coarse portrait of a commonplace type of worthlessness. With much the same amount of success does a certain Bell Baltimore represent the female rake of fashion. There is, no doubt, some little ability in the distinctness with which several low specimens of fashionable vice are presented to the reader, though, to crowd the canvas with them speaks as little for the truthfulness as for the purpose of the author's descriptions. Of course Leah is at first unfaithful to her higher instincts. She marries Jack, and her marriage is the deathblow to her happiness. When all the bloom of life is rubbed away, when she has passed through all phases of disillusion and self-contempt, when Jack has lived just long enough to excite our pity and to serve the mechanical purposes of the plot, poetical justice is invoked to punish the false lover and the unnatural father, and re-unite Danton and Leah upon the very verge of her early grave. There is pathos in the closing scene, which leads us to end, as we began, with a regret for misdirected talent. " It was not necessary for the illustration of my moral that this tale should be written," says Mr. Westwood, in that uneasy frame of mind which prompts people to make excuses for writing books. Nobody really supposes that books are ever written for the purpose of illustrating a moral. " But," Bays he, " since I could not stand by nnd predicate of my neighbours' books, as the Chorus does of Mnesilochus, hitching on my moral vicariously, like one of those drags, seemingly common property, which lie by the roadside, reminding one of a gigantic shrimp whose legs have all been broken off and antenna? curled up into two crumpled hooks by the application of a lighted match, I have thought it better to write a tale of my own." How a vicarious moralist, or moral, should resemble a drag, or "those drags" should remind one of a shrimp, or what may be the value of the application of a lighted match to any of them, we know not; but the sentence is a fair specimen of the author's wit and style. By dint of frequent pauses for the purpose of jesting, airing quotations, and otherwise showing himself a man of parts, the author has managed so to dilute his moral tale as to fill, in a different way from that adopted by Miss Braddon, the requisite three volumes. The story is not in itself complex, though enwrapped in as much padding as a letter in a pantomime. Claude Hambro, an ingenuous lad, living in the house with a young lady slightly his elder, who, like himself, is the adopted child of a simple minded and unobservant old officer, falls into that distressing phase of passion vulgarly called "calf-love." The moral is a true one, that such immature affection is very dangerous to its victims, sometimes very intense in its quality, involves great suffering, and may lead to moral mischief. In the present case, Claude sees his lady-love married to one who is his inferior in everything but age, passes through much temptation, and dies young. He is an amiable sort of boy, and his obtuseness in not perceiving the nature of Florence's attachment?a fer more sterling one than that of Miss Viola? is very characteristic. The young ladies are fairly drawn, especially Florence. From certain indications in the style of ?The Queen of Connaught,' one would suppose it to be written by an Irishman. The handling of long words ia sometimes more bold than accurate. But the picture of Irish fife would be considered libellous if penned hy an Englishman. The Queen is one Kathleen O'Mara, a young Irish lady of high descent and romantic patriotism, who endeavours te preserve in their primitive vigour all the customs of feudal, or rather clannish, hospitality, and as far as possible to revive the glories of the native princes from whom she j* descended. As these projects require wealth, and tbe O'Maras have long been growing poor, she overcomes her prejudices so far as to marry %. rich Englishman, to whom she eventually becomes sincerely attached. Her husband, a generous and honourable man, is, on his part, devoted to her, and willingly supports her in project, which rather move his curiosity than bis admiration. The two natures, however, are on all points of feeling divided by the national characteristics of each, and misunderstanding soon arises, which is fostered, for their own purposes, by every member of Kathleen's numerous family, from the priest to the poorest " coshera" in the hall. Only at last, when her passionate heart is broken by the treachery of all around her, which culminates in an attempt to murder the open-handed stranger to whom most of them owe their bread, does she recognize the full worth of the brave man whom she has been taught to undervalue as cold and ungenerous. There is much merit in the contrast between two fine natures ef different national types, aud great varieties ?f the peasant species are fully described, whose traits, however, do not seem to be considered as repulsive as they certainly are.

482   9052545   The Mother of Goethe, &quot;Frau Aja.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Mother of Goethe, " Frau Aja." -B By Margaret Reeks. THERE is something so wholesome and attractive about "Frau Aja" that a literary portrait of her, if executed with adequate care and skill, could hardly fail to interest English readers. Unfortunately, however, M2iss Reeks's work is a little lacking in both those necessary qualities, and, though much of it is enjoyable, it cannot as a whole be regarded as really satisfactory. We feel a slight sense of irritation at inaccuracies, and discomfort at haphazard arrangement. It is significant, for example, that even in her brief Preface the author misspells the name of one of her chief authorities; a few pages later a distinguished German philologist appears oddly anglicized as " Eric Smith "; Henry Crabb Robinson is referred to as " an English gentleman, Charles Robinson "; and similar inadvertences are frequent. When German is quoted, it is often marred by orthographical errors, and when it is translated, the translation is not always to be relied upon; and there are a number of slips in matters of fact - to give a single instance, Merck is said to have died in his eightieth year. Such slips are individu ally perhaps of no great consequence, but collectively they cannot be ignored. However, it is rather in its general construction than in its detail that the book strikes us as unsatisfactory. Miss Reeks has, we think, drawn upon ' Dichtung und Wahrheit ' to an undue extent;, indeed, it appears to be the main source for much of her volume. Now it is worth noting that Goethe has told us remarkably little about his mother either there or in his other autobiographical writings. No doubt she served to some extent as a model for such characters as Olimpia in the early version of 'Erwin and Elmire,' Elisabeth in 'Gotz,' and the " gute, verstAndi"e Hausfrau" of 'Hermann und Dorothea ; but he has left no definite and detailed portraiture of her. Indeed, though there is no reason to question his strong affection for his mother it must not be forgotten that after leaving his Frankfort home he had comparativey littledirect intercourse with her: his letters to her were by no means voluminous, his visits to her were rare and brief, and during the last eleven years of her life she never saw him. But in her own admirable letters and those addressed to her by various correspondents there is sufficient material to furnish a vivid picture of her personality, and we cannot help wishing that Miss Reeks had utilized them more largely, instead of repeating so much that is already accessible to English readers in the standard biographies of Goethe or translations of his works. It is not till Goethe is got safely off to Weimar that Frau Aja is allowed to come to the front of the stage and speak for herself. The consequence is that the latter part of the book is decidedly superior to the (John Lane.) earlier. That the " Frau Rath" must have been a singularly delightful and refreshing person to meet may be gathered even from such of her utterances as are quoted here. The basis of her character was cheerfulness: she was fond of GOtz's saying, " Frohlichkeit ist Mutter aller Tugenden," and exemplified it in her life; she was absolutely genuine, and her optimism is free from any suggestion of smugness. Her philosophy was no blind and extravagant assertion that all 's right with the world. ' I am fond of my fellows," she says in a letter to Frau von Stein-we quote Miss Reeks's version" and old aid young feel it. I go through this world without pretence, and all the sons and daughters of Eve find that comfortable. I demoralise no one-seek always to spy out the good side-leave the bad to Him who made men and understands best how to rub off the sharp corners; and in this way, I am well, happy. and pleased." (Incidentally we may note that " without pretence " hardly represents the original " ohne Priitension," while " demoralise " is not a true rendering of "1 bemoralisiere.") But life was not always an easy business even for her. " Just to make the best of the present," she declares, " and not keep thinking how things might be different: that is how one gets best through the world-and to get through (all things considered) is the chief business,." Elsewhere she confesses, with a frankness that will awaken a response in many a sorrowful one:" I never could endure consolation; very few people are in a condition to realise the condition of the sorrowful. and so are poor comforters." Without being by any means welleducated in the conventional sense of the term. Frau Aja had marked literary ability. She possessed a wonderfully lively imagination. a broad sympathy, and a sound judgment to which some of the foremost German authors of the day were glad to appeal: Wieland, for instance, was on the friendliest terms with her, and wrote her a number of his agreeably elegant letters. Wit she did not possess in any marked degree, and few bons mot8 of hers have been recorded. The happiest is probably the reply made by her in her last illness to an invitation sent by some friends who were ignorant of her condition; she must beg to be excused, she said, as she was engaged in dying. Wit perhaps scarcely goes with a temperament so hearty and capable of healthy enjoyment as hers, and it is really much more characteristic of her that on her death-bed she arranged all the details for her funeral and the entertainment of the guests, giving particular injunctions that there should be no scrimping of the raisins in the cakes, "for," she remarked, "that is a thing I never could endure in all my life."

Italian Popular Tales. By Thomas Frederick Crane, Professor of the Romance Languages in Cornell University. (Macmillan.) Phof. Crane says in the modest preface to his long-expected collection of Italian folktales that his object " has been simply to present to the reader and student unacquainted with the Italian dialects a tolerably complete collection of Italian popular tales." In this he has fully succeeded, the portly volume now before us containing 109 stories, accompanied by summaries of a great number of variants and by sixty-four pages of notes supplying a large amount of useful and practical information. " AVith theories as to the origin and diffusion of popular tales in general, or of Italian popular tales in particular," Prof. Crane says that he has at present nothing to do. He leaves to others to draw such inferences as this collection seems to warrant. English comparative storiologists undoubtedly ought to be grateful to him for the trouble he hus taken to supply them with a carefully selected body of evidence on the authenticity of which they can fully roly, freed from the difficulties which unfamiliar dialects might throw in their way. The Sicilian dialect, for instance, which hus been preserved by Dr. Giuseppe I'itre in his admirable collection of Fiabe, Novelle, e Racconti. although readily mastered by anyone who will pay it a little serious attention, proves sufficiently repellent to ordinary readers of Italian to prevent them from availing themselves of tlie rich stores which it contains. From that collection alone Prof. Crane has selected fortyone of his stories, besides a great number of his variants, lt may be worth while to call attention to tho fact stated in the valuable bibliography prefixed to the present volume, that, the work by AVoldemar Ivaden, published at Leipzic in IMHO under the title of Unter den Ol'i;enl>tiu.iiien : Sud'HuiHen invite Volkxiniirr/'-n, is devoid of originality, inasmuch us, we are told, -? of the forty-four stories in this work, thirtyfour are translated from Pitre's Fiabe, six from Coiuparetti's Xor. ,>!>/>. ititi., and three1 from Imbrium's XII. Conti pimiiy, without any acknowledgment. This plagiarism was first exposed by R. Kohler in /,itt> niriselie* Centralblntt. Issi, vol. xxxii., p. 337, and afterwards bv Pitiv in the Xit"ve Werneritli Sieilinne, issi." Among the best of tho stories from Pitre's collection now made available to the English reader may be mentioned the following: No. 1, " The King of Love," is a good specimen of the tales of the " Cupid and Psyche " class, in which the indiscreet curiosity of a wife deprives her for a time of her husband, whom she discovers only after long wauderings and numerous adventures. In No. 4, " The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird," three brothers are sent by their sister, who is prompted by malicious aunts, in search of the magic objects named in the title. No. 7, ?' The Cistern," describes the adventures of the youngest son whom his elder brothers lower into some underground recess?in this case a cistern. The subject of the ** Forgotten Bride" is well illustrated by No. 1.3. "Snow-AYhite-Vire-lled." In No. 18, " Thirteenth," the usual monster, in this case an ogre, is tricked and overcome by a clever hero. One of the most perfect specimens of the ** Puss in Boots " story as yet found in Europe, possessing both the proper opening and the correct termination, is given in No. 33, " Don Joseph Pear." Among the shorter stories, also, several of the best come from Pitre's collection. It will be sufficient to mention No. 53, " The Ass," in which the length of the donkey's ears is traced to the shortness of its memory; No. 55, which describes how a carter, lowered into an abyss, found at the bottom of it a man absorbed in reading, who turned out to be Pontius Pilate, " who was condemned to stay in a cave, always reading the sentence that he had pronounced on Jesus Christ, without ever being able to take his eyes from the paper"; and No. 72, which tells how St. John's head made its appearance ia a melon which two sinful gossips took to a jail as a present to a prisoner. Gonzenbach's Sicilian tales have long been well known to English readers; but the collections made at Veuice by Bernoni and by AVidter and Wolf are less known, as also are the stories collected by Comparetti, Imbriani, and other Italian scholars, so that Prof. Crane's work contains a large amount of what, if not absolutely new, is sufficiently novel to prove of great use to comparers of popular tales. They ought to be grateful to him for saving them much trouble by placing before them in a convenient form what is really worthy of their attention in a cumbrous mass of materials. AV. ll. S. Ralston.

When the Tide Turns. By Filson Young, j (Grant Richards.) Mr. Filson Young shows his youth in many ways throughout this book. It " reads young," and there is youth to account for and excuse certain errors in treatment. Sexual questions occupy a large amount of space, and the hero has a most facile way of falling seriously in love. In the early chapters he wants to run off with a countess ; and he ends by actually running off with some one else. But his excuse also must be his youth. Mr. Young is serious about life and art, and his courage deserves respect. At present he has a good deal to learn about both. The dilemma in which his hero found himself is insufficiently justified by the circumstances. Mr. Young writes admirably, and by far the pleasantest parts of his book are the descriptions of nature, which are frequent. Yet Celia is a real woman.

Without Kith or Kin. NOVELS OF THE WEEK. By G. M. Craik. 3 vols. (Low cfc Co.) Castaway. By Edmund Yates. 3 vols. (Chapman cfc Hall.) Joined to an Idol. By G. S. M. (Mozley.) Lovers of sensation, of incident, of varieties of character and dialogue, may at once be warned that they will find little in Miss Craik's novel to entertain them. The entire story,?we ought, perhaps, to say pair of stories,?is taken up with the inner feelings and experiences of the heroine, whose outward existence, except during the early days of childhood, is singularly uneventful and colourless. Yet in spite of this peculiarity, and of certain undeniable defects,?such as extreme prolixity on the part of the author, when she speaks, which she often does, as a critic of the character she describes, and an amount of minute self-analysis on the part of the heroine, which by no possibility could have made its way into the diary of the most morbidly introspective of young ladies,?there is much in these volumes which will attract readers of the more thoughtful kind, and impress them with a high estimate of the author's powers. In the first place, it is one of the few specimens of female authorship which bears everywhere the impress of a lady's hand in the best acceptation of that expression. Pure, thoughtful, and refined, Miss Craik has never sullied her pages from first to last with a vulgar thought, or mistaken coarseness for strength, either of style or conception. Even in the somewhat delicate operation of relating the growth in her heroine's heart of a deep attachment to a man whom she has never seen, we find an unworldliness, a reticence, a disinterested selfrepression, everywhere manifest in the character, which make what might have been a hazardous experiment thoroughly successful, where failure must have been repulsive. Throughout the book, in spite of the thoroughly commonplace nature of the circumstances in which most of her life is spent,?in spite of the discharge of homely duty being the only means allotted to her for the exhibition of her character,?in spite of her unromantic name (no slight matter in certain circles of fair critics),?Elizabeth conciliates and engrosses the interest of the reader. In the first part of the tale, the wanderings of the little orphan and outcast, with her feebler and selfish companion, the ill-fated Joe, who has escaped with her from the harsh usage of an itinerant theatrical manager, are pathetically described. In the latter portion of the story, her history, first as a pupil in a somewhat stem and gloomy boarding-school, afterwards as the trusted governess and companion in a friendly household, is told. The interest of this part of the tale centres in her growing love for the unhappy David Wentworth, a love which brings out in strong relief two remarkable and excellent characters, and ends in the mature happiness which appropriately rewards the fidelity of many years. This statement will sufficiently indicate the unexciting nature of the plot, and the ability which, in spite of the slender framework, invests its placid progress with unusual interest. The co-existence in a far from heroic or superhuman character of devoted practical energy with an inner faculty of enthusiastic hero-worship, and the correction of a common misconception that there is some sort of natural inconsistency in the union of such qualities, form the sufficient and valuable moral of this novel. Mr. Yates's book presents a complete, though not altogether unfavourable, contrast to Miss Cvaik's. In his work the most vivacious lovers of a stirring plot will not find themselves disappointed. Though the dramatic element predominates, as is usual in Mr. Yates's stories, something deeper in the way of psychology than he has often attained may be traced in the character of Madge Pierrepoint, the actress, at once the ill-used wife of a coarse adventurer, Mr. Philip Vane, and the object of the ardent affection of Gerald Hardinge. Madge bears herself well in both capacities ; but in spite of her own great success as leading lady of the piece, there is a superficiality and want of likelihood about the subordinate actors which must prevent the present novel from taking a high place on any other ground than that of cleverness of dramatic conception. The plot runs briefly thus. Gerald, the almost unknown son of stn austere and martinettish father, Sir G. Heriot, K.C.B.,?a father whose life has been embittered by the supposed infidelity of Gerald's mother, and whoso susceptible temper is rendered suspicious and uneasy by the consciousness of a plebeian origin, which he desires to forget,?disgraces himself in his parent's eyes by his refusal, in the presence of his messmates of the yeomanry, to tight a duel to support his injured honour. Driven with insult from his father's presence, he betakes himself to the calling of a theatrical scene-painter, and in that capacity forms the acquaintance of the heroine, an actress on a provincial stage. Madge, who is secretly married to the aforesaid Vane, does lier best to repel his attentions, and though deserted by her ill-conditioned husband, and really attached to Gerald, resolutely sets to work to support herself in honour and retirement. It is no part of our purpose, and would be quite against our principles, to reveal the complicated fortunes she encounters in the execution of her laudable intention. The moral inculcated in the story is, we believe, a just one, and intended to redound to the credit of the stage. As virtue, however, in this world involves generally some amount of self-sacrifice, we are not surprised to find that Gerald finally consoles himself with her younger sister, and that an ecclesiastical scapegoat, the Rev. Mr. Drage, is provided as Madge's 2? aHe>'> A more sensational, though less important incident, is the tragic end which befalls the veteran Sir Geoffrey Heriot. He is killed in a mysterious nightscuffle, which might make the fortune of a transpontine manager, and suspicion vehemently indicates as the man-slayer no other than the castaway Gerald, his son, who has been really in the neighbourhood, bearing with him after years of inquiry the proofs of his mother's innocence. Aud here our author wanders from his proper path in order, we imagine, to cast a stone at our rules of evidence. Yet the testimony which, in the able hands of Mr. Moss (the flimsy noni de plume of a wellknown criminal attorney), finally shifts the burden of suspicion from the innocent Gerald to the broad shoulders of the felonious Vane, is that of the de jure Mrs. Vane, Madge Pierrepoint, whose evidence, as our au thor shows us, would never have been forthcoming, had not her husband been shielded by our rules of law from the consequences of any statements proceeding from such a source. These leading incidents by no means exhaust the varied treat which our author sets before his readers. Much knowledge of the world, from the exoteric point of view, is displayed in his treatment of Vane's financial difficulties, and the scoundrels with whom he is allied. But the best and most lifelike writing, to our taste, contained in three interesting volumes, occurs in the portions which treat of the provincial stage of Wexeter, and the kind old landlady, whose sympathy with Miss Pierrepoint, in good and evil fortune, is well described. 'Joined to an Idol' is a story of the kind that in our school-days used to be known as " Sunday books," that is to say, one in which the religious motive is made prominent, and peoples' sayings and doings are looked at exclusively from the theological point of view. It is therefore, perhaps, with all the more propriety that the scene is laid in the West Country, among a fishiug population, upon whom religion has undoubtedly a very direct influence, and to whose minds it is distinctly present as an immediate motive for action. It is hardly, however, within our province to do more than notice a book of this kind, though we may say that it is pleasantly enough written, and has another merit equally rare in books of the same class, a complete freedom from polemics. The publisher's name vouches, we think, for the soundness of the author's Church principles; and we are glad to see that she has resisted, if she ever felt it, the temptation to make all her bad people Dissenters, or to indulge in those satirical or severe remarks on theological opinions differing from her own, for which a story of this kind is too often made the vehicle.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MRS. VANDERSTEIN'S JEWELS. By Mrs. Charles Bryce. 6s. (John Lanc.) Mrs. Charles B3ryce has contrived an ably constructed and exceedingly well told detective story. The title Mrs. Vanderstein's Jewels" scarcely does it justice, for onc expects a more or less commonplace jewel robbery under such a name; whereas, although the story does indeed concern a jewel robbery, it is by no means a commonplace one. The plot is well thought out and unfolded with great skill, keeping the reader absorbed throughout. M rs. Vanderstein, a w ealthy widow, mysteriously disappears, together with her companion, Miss Barbara Turner. Both ladies have been to the Opera, Covent Garden; they are seen in their box there and are seen leaving the theatre, but no one remembers seeing them after that, and as they do not return home their friends become alarmed ; especially as 'Mrs. Vanderstein was wearing some of her famous jewels on that occasion and foul play is feared. The reader is allowed to suspect several persons as likely people to decoy fMrs. Vanderstein away, the real culprit being disclosed after an exciting and well-planned hunt. What the detective finds, at length, in the window-box of Number 1 3, Scholefield Avenue (down 'Maida Vale way) will come as a thrilling surprise to every reader of this fascinating book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Question of Honour: a Novel. By W.Cosmo Monkhouse. 3 vols. (Chapman &" Hall.) That Mr. Cosmo Monkhouse is not disposed to underrate the quality of his novel we gather from the dedicatory lines to a friend, " whose subtle spirit doth so charge the air of" the author's "most fortunate being," that whatever berry he plucks is forthwith transformed to ripe and luscious fruit. With arrogant sentimentality, the novelist continues,? Take thou this shock Of sheaves, with thine own light made sweet anti good. Grain, fruit, and metal?berries, corn, and crock? Take all; for barren h-id I boen, mid rude, But for thy gentler growths upon the rock. Grain and fruit are words that accord with our novelist's boastful metaphor; but "a shock of sheaves " is certainly not a thing in whi-h we should expect to find, as matters of course, some nuggets of metal and an eavtln-rn pot. Moreover, upon close examination of Mr. Morehouse's "shock of sheaves," we fail to discover in them a single ear or kernel of grain. Like the bundles of straw occasionally put before theatrical scenes for stage-effect, they are sham sheaves, consisting of straw out of which every seed of corn lias been thrashed. Were it not for a vague impression that we have seen the author's name on a titlepage in former times, we should not hesitate to speak of the story as a first attempt in a department of art for which the writer has not a single qualification, and just so much education that he can string together English words with a lair degree of grammatical correctness, and an appearance of facility. Out of tender heed for the sensitiveness of youth we will, however, disregard this vague impression, and, giving Mr. Monkhouse the benefit of the doubt, will deal tenderly with him, as a youngster who, after the wont of in-! experience, has mistaken the nature and direction of his capabilities. It is not only at the outset of life that men are found toiling along roads that can only lead them to disappointment and defeat. Middle age abounds with its victi ns of misdirected ambition,?the dreary ? gentlemen whose dullness would escape ridicule, if th'y were not always attempting to be witty , \ and brilliant; dancers of the splay-footed and : perspiring sort, who are incessantly trying to , waltz, when they ought to be standing with ; , backs against drawing-room walls and door' , posts; the stammerers and wind-bags who > , deem themselves richly endowed with oratorical s t faculty : the amateur engineers who would like to , reconstruct our navyand pntan end to thewaster fulness of the Admiralty ; the merchants who l gravitate towards bankruptcy, whilst they write t books on the currency and proffer counsel to r ] Chancellors of the Exchequer; the musical enthusiasts, utterly without ear and voice, who persist in singingalniost to death the polite auditors who, as they listen to the indescribable sounds, s i turn purple with suppressed laughter which i | brings them to the verge of apoplexy. When - I so many of their elders are found thus laboury j ing for ends that they may never achieve, there u is no reason why we should be especially severe e I on the boys who run prematurely to pen, and s ! proclaim themselves artists before they have fl acquired the rudiments of art. r ! Whatever else may be urged against ' A n ' Question of Honour,' no one can say that its first chapter is deficient of incident; for within eighteen of its twenty loosely-printed pages, the hero receives 100/. for his first novel, send* a case of port wine to his young and tenderlybeloved wife, meets a long-lost friend, makes the acquaintance of a lord, eats an extravagant dinner at Verrey's restaurant, enters a gamblingclub for the first time in his life, loses bis 100/., gets very drunk, denounces his longdost friend as a swindler to the fashionable members of the Cockcrow Club, drops upon the carpet of the club whist-room in the unconsciousness of intoxication, and is finally laid in that rather ignominious state on the doorstep of his residence, where he is taken up-stairs, and put into safe quarters by his miserable little wife. Here, an\how, is enough of incident for a first chapter, or, as Mr. Monkhouse would put the case, enough of " grain, fruit and metal, berries, corn and creek" for a single sheaf of a large shock. But the story, that at tho outset thus promises to bo whit the advertisers arc pleased to call a " tale of incident," soon stops, gasping for want of breath, after which it never recovers its original alarming velocity, or even manages to get along at a brisk walking-pace. What the narrative is all about, we should not like to say; for though we have perused every one of its pages and done our honest best to master their contents, wo cannot tell why it is called 'A Question of Honour,' or why it was not called 'A Question of Dishonour,' which, so far as we are able to judge of what we confess we know very little about, would have been a more appropriate title. In fact, the book is a labyrinth of sentences, out of which few readers will find their way by the path which the author wishes them ; and that it should be thus characterized by maziness, no one is likely to feel surprise after reading one of the author's theories respecting the labour of literary composition. Mr. Monkhouse maintains that if an educated man will only work himself into a fierce excitement, and during the full violence of his agitation will put words upon paper, the words will be necessarily pregnant with thought; they may fail to express the writer's meaning exactly, j but they cannot be otherwise than luminous, j magnetic, ardent. " When we are under the ? | influence of strong excitement," Mr. Cosmo 11 Monkhouse urges, " whatever we may do will ;' bear some trace of it, though it is imperceptible ? i to us at the time;"?true ; but sometimes the i' most enduring trace of past excitement is due -' to the foam which the victim of rage has un,! consciously emitted from his lips. " Senseless, - ; dull, inanimate things as words are," continues I ' the author, " mere passionate symbols, blocks ) ; of wood, images, whatever we may call them, II when lying separate, like the inchoate fragments -! of a puzzle, we can scarcely put two or three ) ? together uithout their becoming bright, vital, full 1 j of our own breath, part of ourselves and others, ) meaning more than we know, pregnant with - feeling beyond our consciousness,?such feeling ?) frequently being not part of the writer s mind, 21 and not thought of by him, but latent af the 3 | seed of an epidemic in thc air until it dcnlopes - i in thc mind of some reader." - j Really this is too bad. Mr. Monkhouse first s puts hi3 words into the incautious reader's ;, mind, and then terrifies him by asserting that i they resemble the poisonous seeds of an :i epidemic.

THE VOYAGES OF CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS. Edited and Translated by Cecil Jane. The Argonaut Press. 42s. net. Tus equivocal silences in his life, his disfimtive achievement and miserable end, have made Columbus the ideal subject for he partisan, melodramatic or picturesque bographer. On the one hand he is the hro and man of vision whose heel has been bitnm by the serpent of malice; on the ocher he is the ambitious and greedy liar, the ineffective administrator who whined like a dog when he brought upon himself his own beating at the hands of circumsunce It is therefore a pleasure to read an authoritative biographer who whittles down conjecture and expounds the permisible maximum of fact. Mr. Jane's work is not only a fine vindication of scientficfbiography in a field where it was badly needd, but is especially valuable because i; presents the first complete English translon of the original Spanish texts as finally reconstructed by the scholars, and iracludes the first translation to appear in this country of Andres Bcrnaldez' account of the second voyage. The binding and printing are in the opulent tradition of the Argonaut Press, and the publishers' claim that the complete volume is a work of historical and national importance, is beyond dispute. To possess it is a privilege. The matter of the book is pleasantly balanced. For while one may miss in Mr. Jane's closely argued introduction that sense of the final, indefinable quality which made Columbus, in spite of all, and unknown to himself, the most portentous figure of his age, this quality is immediately apparent in the mystical exaltation which fills the pages of the Journal and the Letters. To take the most casual entries: when one reads, in the Journal of the First Voyage, the entry for I5th September some days before land was sighted: " And in the night, at the beginning of it, they saw fall from the sky a marvellous branch of fire into the sea at a distance of four or five leagues from them." or this of the land: " It is a land to be desired and, when seen, never to be left." or the opening lines of the Benaldez M.S. rich with the devout wonder of the age: " In the name of God Almighty: there was a man of the land of Genoa, a hawker of printed books, who carried on his trade in this land of Andalusia, whom they called Christopher Columbus, a man of great intelligence, though with little book learning, very skilled in the art of cosmography and the mapping of the world." When one feels the epical rhythm of lines like these one knows that, whatever facts are in dispute, one is in the presence of the great entreprise of a signal figure. These are intoxicating draughts from greatness itself. To sober oneself one turns back to the cooler fascination of Mr. Jane's argument. He accepts without dismay that little is known of Columbus' origins. He sorts out the little that is known. He shrewdly holds that his reticences were those of a man ashamed of his humble origins when he was advancing to fame; and defines his prevarications as the natural device of one who must create an atmosphere of confidence to ensure the support of an unlikely candidate. Mr. Jane finds no evidence that Columbus was a practical seaman or the effective member of a crew of any ship up to the time of the discovery. (He has, for instance, no difficulty in dismissing the Lisbon corsair incident on which Las Casas-that Macaulay among Spanish historians-built so much.) He holds that, having regard to the early poverty of Columbus, one must acquit him of sordid greed; and he traces to an inherent incapacity for self-revelation, which made friendship or love impossible in his life, the loneliness which turned him to God and made him believe himself God-inspired. The most interesting pages of analysis, however, are those which examine the causes of the downfall of Columbus. The economic difficulty caused in the Indies by the arrival of the Spaniards, was among the minor irritations. The real difficulty was his failure to understand the Spanish temperament. He did not grasp the meaning of Spanish stoicism. He could not understand that the Spaniard despises the servility of the servant and resists the arrogance of the servant made master. Spanish individualism broke his heart, as it had broken hearts that were stronger. Effectively, Columbus lacked that essential quality of " hombria." And when he was breaking under the strain, his men were disgusted by a man who could not hide his grief. And the real tragedy of Columbus' career is not so much the fatal course of his failure as an administrator, but as Mr. Jane says, that this failure should have obscured from himself and the world of the time, the fact that he had gained one of the most notable triumphs of history. It is hardly possible for the modern reader to realise what a small passing impression his great discovery made. V. S. PRITCHETT.

THE YEARS THAT CROWN By Gwen Clear. 7s. 6d. (Longmans.) Curious to find that such an unexaggerated story as this, of the heart of the City, could be published in these days of the harsh mechanical glaring pattern of the average novel. Miss Clear, whose verses we have already on our shelves, is poetic in outlook. She disdains the conventions of the novelist; there is nothing symmetrical about her plot, and we cannot deny that her pages contain long, dull passages. The tale is concerned with Alice Farnham, whose brave mother keeps a successful coffee house in the Minories. This charming and imaginative maiden (it is 1893, when girls wore capes and ostrich feathers and long walking skirts) comes in contact with a dissatisfied dreamer of forty-five. His half romantic, half practical nature is ever at war with itself. He loves Alice, she loves him, but he considers himself too old for her, and goes away. Alice marries another in spite of herself, but his memory remains. Overworked and poor, she lives on certain intangible things. Some phrases that keep her going in her uncongenial days are: " Delicate strength, the strength of a racehorse, a runner." " Lace that lasts a hundred years." " The Years That Crown " is a distinguished, sombre piece of work, and for the philosophy beneath it one must delve carefully. Did Alice's years crown her ?

&inx's Baby: his Birth and other Misfortunes. Strahan and Co., I London, 1870. WHAT a London navvy, earning eighteen shillings a week, ought to find society prepared to do with his thirteenth baby, is a question easier asked than answered. The historian of the son of Ginx is rather severe upon the philosopher, the police force, the charitable agencies, the parish authorities, and the club politicians who somehow fail to make life pleasant to his hero ; yet they do more for him than for the twelve brothers and sisters who were never threatened with drowning, and are guiltless, so far as the author explains, of any sins of commission which should leave the infant, like Douglas Jerrold's St. Giles, no choice 'but to grow up in criminal habits. To begin at the beginning, a wandering Malthusian suggests that, on the whole, Ginx's baby had better not have been born; he is suppressed by public opinion with a confused sense that the domestic virtues of Ginxpadre and mere are, on the whole, beneficial to the community. A relieving officer quotes not wholly unreasonable acts of Parliament which constrain the reluctant father to maintain, not drown, his superfluous offspring. The nuns who take the infant in hand next decline on reflection to provide for his body unless they may work their will on his soul. A tedious satire on the " Protestant Detectc -al Association " is meant to show that charitable organizations have gaps, through which any number of units may slip unseen to distress. Then it is the turn of the Poor Law Guardians, who seize the first opportunity of returning Ginx's baby on the hands of Ginx, who deposits it on the threshold of a club in Pall Mall and emigrates. Here the author's case begins to break down. The club adopts Ginx's baby, it is fed and clothed and moralized about till it is fifteen, and if it is also petted and snubbed by turns, that fate is not peculiar to foundlings. That it should elope with some spoons instead of donning the livery of one of its patrons, and finally commit suicide because it hadn't been murdered in infancy, is mere matter of temperament, whilst social satire is supposed to deal with types. The author of Ginx's Baly feels strongly on some very important questions, and has a fund of righteous indignation at the disposal of those who answer them amiss, but his criticism would be fairer if hie did not try to cut up every body in a breath and especially if he would pass by the too obvious occasions for smart writing afforded by newspaper grievances.

VOTAOMS AND TRAYslmU. Narrative of a Josney roaund the World, during the Years 1841 and 1842. By Sir GEORGE SIMPSON, Governor-in-Chief of the Hudson's Bay Company's Territory in North America. In 2 viols. London, 1847. EEMNOND NOTICF.] S E waill now accompany Sir GEORGE SIMPSON Upon his other expeditions, an(l first into the Russian territory, bordering on English North America. Almost thle sole occuItation here is SEAL-H UNT! NG Some twenty or thirty years ago, there was a most wasteful destruction of the fur-seal, when young and old, male and female, were indiscriminately knocked on the head. This improvidence, as every one might have expected, proved detrimental in two ways. The race was almost extirpated; and the market was glutted to such a degree, at the rate, for some time, of two hundred thousand skins a year, that the prices did not even p iy the expenses of carriage. The Russians, however, hIae now adopted nearly the same plan which the Hudson's Bay Company pursues in recruiting any of its exhausted districts, killing only a limited number of such males as have attained their full growth-a plan peculiarly applicable to the fur-seal, inasmuch as its habits render the system of husbanding the stock as easy and certain as that of destroying it. In the month of May, with something like the regularity of an almanack, the fur-seals make their appearance at the Island of St. Paul, one of the Aleutian group. Each old male brings a herd of females under his protection, varying in number according to his size and strength; the weaker brethren are obliged to content themselves with half-a-dozen wives, while some of the sturdier and fiercer fellows preside over haremns that are two hundred strong. From the date of their arrival in May to that of their departure in October, the whole of them are principally ashore on the beach. The females go down to the sea once or twice a day, while the male, morning, noon, and night, watches his charge with the utmost jealousy, postponing even the pleasures of eating, and drinking, and sleeping, to the duty of keeping his favourites together. If any young gallant venture by stealth to approach any senior chief's bevy of beauties, he generally atones for his imprudence with his life, being torn to pieces by the old fellow; and such of the fair ones as may have given the intruder any encouragement are pretty sure to catch it in the shape of some secondary punishment. The ladies are in the straw about a fortnight after they arrive at St. Paul's; about two or three weeks afterwards, they lay the single foundation, being all that is necessary, of the next season's proceedings ; and the remainder of their sojourn they devote exclusively to the rearing of their young. At last, the whole band departs, no one knows whither. The mode of capture is this. At the proper time, the whole are driven, like a flock of sheep, to the establishment, which is about a mile distant from the sea ; and there the males of four years, with the exception of a few that are left to keep up the breed, are separated from the rest and killed. In the days of promiscuous massacre, such of the mothers as had lost their pups would ever and anon return to the establishment, absolutely harrowing up the sympathies of the wives and daughters of the hunters, accustonmed as they were to such scenes, with their doleful lamen. tations. Sir GEoRGE is of opinion that the sea between the Continent and Vancouver's Island, which, b) the Oregon treaty, belongs to us, may be made available for commercial purposes l)y the introduction of steam-packets. The surprise of the natives at the vision of one of these self-moving monsters is shewn by the followipg anecdote:-_ Independently of physical advantages, steam, as I have already mentioned, may be said to exert an almost superstitious influenee over the savages. Besides acting without intermission on their fears, it has, in a great measure, subdued their very love of robbery and violence. In a word, it has inspired the red man with a new opinion-new not in degree, but in kind-of the superiority of his white brother. After the arrival of the emigrants from the Red River, their guide, a Cree, of the name of Bras Croche, took a short trip in the Beaver. When asked what he thought of her-" Don't ask me," was his reply. 11 I cannot speak; my friends will say that i tell lies when I let them know what I have seen; Indians are fools, and know nothing; I can see that the iron machinery makes the ship to go, but I cannot see what makes the iron machinery itself to go." Bras Croche, though very intelligent, and, like all the Crees, partially eivilised, was, nevertheless, so full of doubt and wonder, that he would not leave the vessel till lhe got a certificate to the effect that he had been on board of a ship which needed neither sails nor paddlers. Though not one of his countrymen would understand a word of what was written, yet the most sceptical among them would not dare to question the truth of a story which had a document in its favour. A savage stands nearly as much in awe of paper, pen, and ink, as of steam itself; and, if lie once puts his cross to any writing, he has rarely been known to violate the engagement which such writing is supposed to embody or to sanction. To him the very look of black and white is a powerful " medicine." In Vancouver's Island prevails the following HORRIBLE CUSTOM. Before leaving Nisqually, let me still further illustrate the character of the tribes of the north-west coast by a summary sketch of the condition of their slaves. These thralls are just as much the property of their masters as so many dogs, with this difference against them, that a man of cruelty and ferocity enjoys a more exquisite pleasure in tasking, or starving, or torturing, or killing a fellow-creature, than in treating any one of the lower animals in a similar way. Even in the most inclement weather, a mat or a piece of deer-skin is the slave's only clothing, whether by day or by night, whether under cover or in the open air. To eat without permission, in the very midst of an abundance which his toil has procured, is as much as his miserable life is worth; and the only permission which is ever vouchsafed to him is to pick up the offal thrown out by his unfeeling and imperious lord. Whether in open war or in secret assassination, this cold and hungry wretch invariably occupies the post of danger. But all this is nothing, when compared with the purely wanton atrocities to which these most helpless and pitiable children of the human race are subjected. They are beaten, lacerated, and maimed-the muti. lating of fingers or toes, the splitting of noses, the scooping out of eyes, being ordinary occurrences. They are butchered -without the excuse or the excitement of a gladiatorial combat-to make holidays ; and, as if to carry persecution beyond the point at which tl;e wicked are said to ceast from troubling, their corpses arc often cast into the sea, to be washed out and in by the tide. To shew how diabolically ingenious the masters are in the work of inurder, six slaves, on the occasion of a late merrv-making at Sitka, were 1,lacCd in a row, with their throats over the sharl) riige of a rock, while a pole, loaded with a chuckling demon at either end, ground away at the backs of their necks till life was extinct. WN hat a proof of the degrading influence of oppression, that men should submit in life to treatment from which the black hondlmen of Cuba or Brazil would be glad to escape by suicide ! Of the S'andwichl Islands our travellh r has preserved some interesting recollections. H ere is an aff-cting instance of FENIALE IEIROISM. A man and his wife, both Christians, were pamsengers in a schooner, which foundered at a considerable distance from the land. All the natives on board l)romltly took refuge in the sea; and the man in question, who had just celebrated Divine Service in the ill-fated vessel, called his fellows, some of them being converts as well as himself, around him to offer up another tribute of prriie and supplication from the deep in which they were struggling, to tarry. with a combination of courage and humility perhaps unequalled in the world's history, in order deliberately to worship God in that universal temple, undsr whose restless pavement the speaker and most of his hearers were dcstinex1 to find their graves. The man and his wife had each succeeded in procuring the support of a covered bucket by way of buoy ; and away they struck with the rest for Kahoolawe, finding themselves next morning alone on the ocean, after a whole afternoon and night of privation and toil. To aggravate their misfortunes, the wife's bucket went to pieces soon after daylight, so that she had to make the best of her way without assistance or relief; and, in the course of the afternoon, the man became too weak to proceed, till his wife, to a certain extent, restored his strength by shampooing him in the water. Tlhety had now Kaboolawe in full view, after having been about four-and-twenty hours on their dreary vovage. In spite, however, of the cheering sight, the man again fell into ;uch a state of exhaustion, that the woman took his hucket for herself, giving him), at the same time, the hair of her head as a towing line ; and, when even this exertion proved to b) too much fur himi, the faithful creature, after trying in vain to rouse him to lra.er, took his arms round her neck, holding them together with one hand, and making %ith the other for the shore.

Ilk 'Majestv, K'iuikeauli, the reigning king of the Sandwich Isles, has still in his possession the Ynams or feather wvarcloak of his f;tthc!r, the celebrated Karnehanmcha. It was not completed until his reign, having occupied eight preceding ones in its fabrication. It is four feet in length, with eleven and a-half feet spread at the bottom. Its groundwork is a coarse netting, aind to this the feathers, which are very small and exceedingly delicate, are skilfully attached, overlapping each other, and forming a perfectly smooth surface. The feathers around the borders are reverted, and the whole presents a beautiful bright yellow colour, giving it the appearance of a mantle of gold. Indeed it would be difficult for despotism to manufacture a richer or more costlygarment for its proudest votary. Five feathers only such as are used wholly in its manufacture) are obtained from under the wings of a rare species of bird inhabiting Iawaii, which is caught alive with great care and toil. Longl poles, with an adhesive matter smeared upon them and well baited, are placed near their haunts. The bird alights! upon it, and, unable to disengage itself from the adhesive matter, is secured, the much-prized feathers plucked, and the l)ird set at liberty. A piece of nankeen, valued at five and I a-half dollars, was formerly the price of fine feathers of this kind. fly this estimate the value of the cloak would equal that of the purest diamonds in the several European regalia, and excluding the price of the feathers, not less than a million of dollars worth of labour was expended upon it at the present rate of computing wages. lie returned by way of Russia,-a route not before described, anti offering some interesting particulars. Here is a sketch of MANNERS IN SIBTILRIA. In one highly important particular the Yakuti may safely challenge all the rest of the world. They are the best eaters on the face of the earth. Caving heard a great deal more on this subject than I could bring myself to believe, I resolved to test the thing by the evidence of my own senses. Having procured a couple of fellows, who had a tolerable reputation in this way, from a village about twenty versts distant, I had a dinner prepared for thlem of two ponds of beef boiled, and one pood of butter melted, being thirty-six pounds avoirdu. pois of the former, and eighteen of the latter for each of the two. Of the solids the performers had their respective shares placed before them, while the liquor was in common, with a ladle for drinking it. Of the operatives, the one was old and the other young. The former, as if he had been training himself into nothing but stomach from head to heel, had his skin hungrily hanging in loose folds over his gaunt bones, while the latter, who shewed no external symptoms of extraordinary capacity, must have relied chiefly on the vigour of youth and a willingness of disposition. At starting the young fellow shot ahead, as if he meant to distance his friend, while the old man, waggishly making his wrinkles flap again upon him, said, " Ilis teeth are sharp ; but," continued he, crossing himself, " with the help of my saint I shab be up with him yet." After a good dose of the beef, they greased their throats for the second heat of the race by swallowing each about a pint or so of their heavy wet. At the end of an hour, they had got through half of their welcome toil, my senior guest having, by this time, shaken out nearly his last reef. Their eyes were starting from their heads, and stomachs projecting like a brace of kettle-drums. What were thegentlemen to do with the remaining half of their allowance ? One moiety of the question might have been easilv answered, for the butter, apparently in its purity, was making an outlet of every pore; but as the solids could not escape so glibly from the premises, the problem of stowing away eighteen pounds of beef in a vessel already full to overflowing, puzzled all my knowledge, such as it was, of practical mathematics. Feeling that, whatever might be the case with my guests, 1 had myself had quite enough of the feast, I left our Cossack and MlIntyre to see that there should be no foul play in getting rid of the nreit and drink ; and, on returning about two hours afterwards, I was assured by my deputies and others, that all was right, while the gluttons themselves tacitly confirmed the testimony by wallowing prostrate on the earth, relieving me, at the same time, from all sense of wrong in the mattter by thanking me for my liberality, and kissing the ground reverentially for my sake. After such surfeits, the victors remain for three or four days in a state of stupor, neither eating nor drinking; and meanwhile they are rolled about, somewhat after the manner of the teumee tumee of the Sandwich Islands, with a view to the promoting of digestion, an operation which the slipperiness of their surface renders peculiarly difficult. Two of these gormandizers, one for the bride and another for the bridegroom, form part of the entertainments; at every native wedding. And here is a curious account of the EXILES OF SIBERIA. The villages are very numerous, not only on the road, but as far back on either side as we could see; and the people all looked healthv, comfortable and happy. In any place where the posthouse was out of repair, our police officer used to pounce on the best house for our use; and, as the owners would neither make any demand, nor accept any remuneration, we were generally obliged to compromise the matter by forcing a small gift on the host's wife or daughter. The dwelling in which we breakfasted to.day, was that of a person who had been sent to Siberia against his will. Finding that there was only one way of mending his condition, he worked hard, and behaved well. lHe had now a comfortably furnished house and a well cultivated farm, while a stout wife and plenty of servants bustled about the premises. His son had just arrived from Petersburg to visit his exiled father, and had the pleasure of seeing him, amid all the comforts of life, reaping an abundant harvest, with one hundred and forty persons in his pay. In fact, for the reforming of the criminal, in addition to the punishment of the crime, Siberia is undoubtedly the best penitentiary in the world. When not bad enough for the mines, each exile is provided with a lot of ground, a house, a horse, two cows, and agricultural implements, and also, for the first year, with provisions. For three years he pays no taxes whatever, and for the next ten only half of the full amount. To bring fear, as well as hope, to operate in his favour, he clearly understands that his very first slip will send him from his home and his family, to toil, as an outcast, in the mines. Thus does the government bestow an almost parental care on all the less atrocious criminals. The reader will not be surprised to learn how gross is SIBERIAN IGNORANCE. Moreover, there would, in my opinion, be a good deal of difficulty in bringing the ignorant people to believe that nobody had a right to beat them, for the some middlemen, who would prevent the emperor from hearing their complaints could still I more easily prevent them from knowing the emperor'* benevo- I lence. The simplicity and credulity of the great mass of the population of Siberia, with respect to everything that does not fall within their own daily routine, are quite incredible. 'When an astronomical party, for instance, was travelling the country, astonishing the natives night after night with their telescopes and sextants, a wag of a fellow set the curiosity of the good folks quite at rest, by telling them that his majesty had missed one of his stars, and had sent out his wise men to find it. WVe conclude With the description of A IRUSSIAN BATH. While at Sitka I took a bath, which might be a very good thing to those that like it. On entering the building, I was much oppressed by the steam and heat, while an ill-looking, long-legged, stark-naked fellow was waiting to officiate as master of the ceremonies. Ilavingundressed in anantechamber, so far as decency would permit, I made my way into the bathroom, which was heated almost to suffocation. Ilaving thus got me into his power, the gaunt attendant threw some water on the iron furnace, while to avoid, as far as possible, the clouds of steam that were thus raised, I s(luatted myself down on the floor, perspiring profusely at every pore. I next seated myself on a bench, while bucket after bucket of hot water was thrown on my head; and then, making nce stretch myself out, my tormentor soaped me all over from head to foot, rubbing and lathering me with a handful of pine tops. Once more taking his bucket, the horrid operator kept drench. ing me, the successive pailfuls descending gradually from nearly a boiling heat to the temperature of fifty degrees. The whole process occupied about an hour. I then returned to the antechamber, where, after being dried with hot towels, I was very glad to put on my clothes. It was impossible, however, to make my escape immediately, for I was so relaxed as to be obliged to recline on a sofa for a quarter of an hour ; and then I withdrew, inwardly resolved never again to undergo such a castigation.

Examiner  : 3470 825 - 825
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
JUPITER'S DAUGHTEES. Jupiter's Davgnters. By Mrs Jenkin. In One Volume. Smith and Elder. The subject of this little story is French love and marriage, and its moral is simply this, that young ladies ought to be allowed to choose their own husbands without restriction or advice from their parents. The story trenches on dangerous ground, and the moral is a questionable one. Mrs Jenkin has studied French nature very closely; but had she gone more deeply into the causes of those difficulties and hardships of social life which she has observed, she would probably have discovered that the tight and tyrannous constraint which French mothers exercise over their daughters before marriage, and the perilous freedom in which these same daughters indulge after marriage, are but the natural outcome of the whole condition of society in France, and especially of its women. The bargaining of French parents is, we cannot doubt, the result of a parental instinct to make the best of a bad state of things for their children. It is only in slave countries that the dealer bargains with the master, quite irrespectively of the good of the slave. But where the dealer is the slave's own parent, one object in the bargain will always be that the thing sold shall have its share of the profits. The principle upon which a French parent acts appears to be this : "I will use my experience of life for the purpose of selecting a husband for my child. When that is done, it will depend on herself to mould her fate out of the given ingredients." It is too often the case that a French girl is utterly unable to mould out of the ingredients supplied to her anything like a happy or useful life, and drifts hopelessly away to the quicksands, or founders on a rock before her wedding-dress is old-fashioned. But the majority do scramble on somehow to the end, and have the good fortune to be overlooked by moralists and romance writers. Here and there, however, some poor wretch, gifted above her fellows with an unfair share of nerve-fibre, will make herself miserable and spoil her beauty by struggling against conditions which she cannot rectify. The nobler the nature, the more animated the struggle. Society, meantime, stands by ready to pounce on this its choice prey; and whether she eludes its fatal grip or no, such a woman makes an excellent subject for the heroine of a novel. Puuline Reudu is an only child, and will inherit a fortune. Her parents are rentiers?that is, living on their dividends?and quite retired from business. Her home is a small French country town called St Gloi. Here, amid a little group of thoroughly French people, the young girl grows up utterly unlike the rest of the world around her, endowed with a rich pure nature, innocent as a flower, and capable of loving warmly, and of suffering acutely. The old gentleman at the neighbouring chateau dies, and his young successor arrives from abroad, bringing with him a Parisian friend named M. Vilpont. Of course it is the heir with whom Pauline ought to fall in love ; and of course it his friend, the enigmatical Parisian, nephew of a marquis and litterateur, who wins her affections. But Pauline's mother, a sound-hearted wife, but a very mercenary woman, does not believe in Vilpont, and will have nothing to say to him. Nobody in St Gloi believes in him, except one charming old French woman, Pauline's godmother. This lady lives in bourgeois independence in her country house, surrounded by vine-clad hills. She manages her own estates, gathers in her vintage, and is a thorough woman of business. In her we see the bright side of French social life. She is truly a happy woman, with influence to do good, and a quick sense of how it may be done. But in this case her friendship is of no avail. Vilpont is rejected, not by the daughter who loves him, but by her mother, and that mother's acquiescent consort. In course of time the doomed girl is bestowed upon a rich Algerian merchant, and the scene is transferred to Paris. Here Pauline and her first lover meet again in new circumstances, and the sorrows of her life begin to take a definite shape. We will not spoil a good story by telling its main points. From the face of "la belle France " the veil is lifted for a brief space, and we see only pale, haggard passion?worn sorrow. That this is the real thing, and no phantom, may be judged from the peculiarly calm and honest style of the narration. It is a vivid and admirably drawn picture of modern French life, compressed into a small canvas. The background of this picture is all France, but is so deftly introduced, with a glimpse of the brilliant capital before and during the terrible siege of 1870, and of rural France, of which English people know about as much as they do of Siberia, that, while the details are rich and varied, they never appear over-packed. Nor does the background as a whole intrude itself irritatingly on our notice. The human predominates over the physical, and the chief interest centres from first to last upon the two principal characters. Both these are perfectly natural; and Vilpont never, even in his best moments, rises above the standard which the authoress had originally designed for him. He is a Frenchman of fashion to the last chapter, with occasional gleams in him of something better. Our first impression, on taking up a story about foreigners written by an Englishwoman, is one of suspicion. " Why cannot she write about her own people ? It is not possible but that she shall fall into some palpable error if she writes outside her own immediate experience!" is what we all feel inclined to assert. There can be little doubt that any writer of romance, placing his plots in a foreign land or in a bygone time, does to a great extent sacrifice his power of accuracy, and consequent chance of producing a work* of lasting value. It is very tempting. An imaginative writer becomes enamoured of a period or a people. A Scott wanders back into the age of chivalry; a Thackeray will suddenly assume the mannerism and the very mood of the eighteenth century; and George Eliot, not satisfied with English nature and English wit, with which she charmed the world, and which she understood as a child understands its native tongue, strains and exercises her genius among quaint old Italian scenes. In all these cases the materials are not in stock, but are got up, dexterously it may be, but 8till got up mechanically for the occasion. To say the least of it, it is a dangerous experiment, and the time has scarcely arrived when the most enthusiastic critic can venture to pronounce a verdict on its ultimate success. In any case, considered as elements for historical research in the future, these books will be useless. Such other novels, on the contrary, as Fielding's, Smollett's, Scott's novels of Scottish life and character, Thackeray's modern novels, and Geuigc Eliot's oarlier works, will have the same kind of value in the far future for tne kiotorian as he finds now in the old plays, in Pepys' Diary, or in Chaucer's it.Ua For in all of these he will see contemporary English life painted vividly as the writers saw it all about themselves. He will obtain from them a kind of knowledge most useful to him and to the world, and utterly inaccessible otherwise. And this is one practical good in novels which the novelist will do well not altogether to overlook. Mrs Jenkin's charming story errs less than the others to which we have alluded in its choice of subject. The authoress has not selected a foreign people to write about for any whim "of novelty or enthusiasm, but evidently because this is a subject she thoroughly understands and loves. In fact, we should be inclined to say she understands French manners and men better than she does those of our own island. But within the atmosphere of French sentiment and folly there is never wanting a current of wholesome and sincere morality which is thoroughly and unmistakably English. No French novelist could describe the gentle old cure sitting among the pretty girls whom he has christened and confirmed, and hopes some day to marry happily, as Mrs Jenkin has done. It is always her good and honest folk that really charm us, and we turn from the others, as truly and boldly described, with a sense of weariness, if not of dislike. There is no character in ' Jupiter's Daughters' equal, for subtlety and interest, to that of the exiled Italian teacher in Mrs Jenkin's former novel of 'Who Breaks, Pays ;' but, considered as a whole, this latest is a great advance upon her earlier productions, and deserves to be judged by a higher standard than nine-tenths of the novels of the day. The quality which distinguishes Mrs Jenkin most highly as a writer of fiction is a certain sympathetic glow, a warm-bloodedness, which comes like a sudden suffusion into a pale cheek?rarely, perhaps, but always at a supreme moment, E. R. M.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Life and Death of Mr. Badman. By J. Bunyan. Illustrated by G. W. Rhead and L. Rhead. (Heinemann.)?The biography of Mr. Badman is, like 4 The Pilgrim's Progress,' a religious allegory, but, unlike it, has been seldom reprinted, never before now illustrated. The brothers Rhead, among the hosts of persons who have tried to illustrate 4 The Pilgrim's Progress,' have really succeeded in doing so vigorously, sympathetically, and without that coarseness which has led to the failure of many an artist. We are glad to see that in their large cuts a very great proportion of the rough and somewhat clumsy draughtsmanship which disfigured previous works of theirs has disappeared, giving place to finish and care that were much needed, although the spirit and vigour of the cuts themselves have lost nothing by the improvement. A great deal of invention has been employed in the vitalizing of the letterpress, giving colour to it and helping the imagination of the reader. As each section of the biography enlarges upon a deadly sin, so our artists were called upon to show what Mr. Wiseman and Mr. Attentive were talking about, and it lay upon them to interest us in the dialogue. But, of course, they had to do this by certain means, and, with the restrictions imposed upon them by Bunyan himself, neither of them would have found it possible to suggest, much less to represent, in black and white, the countenance, figure, and attitudes of the scoundrel Badman, whose villainies and want of principle are the chief themes of Bunyan; the stupidity of Mr. Attentive, his companion, prompter, and toad-eater; or the effects of virtue on the features of that extensive proser Mr. Wiseman, whose function it was to lecture upon Badman to the long-suffering Attentive, whose patience was quite superhuman. Messrs. Rhead have seen the impossibilities of their task, and they have disposed of them in a simple and yet ingenious way. They have eschewed Badman, Attentive, and Wiseman altogether, a proceeding which, as they intended to illustrate Bunyan, is courageous and possibly original. At least we do not remember a similar attempt to get over the great artistic difficulties of didactic allegorizing iu prose in so masterly a manner. What they have done is easily explained as follows. Bunyan followed Badman in a career of unmitigated basenes8,andrecorded,by means of Wiseman and for the benefit of Attentive, various episodes of crime placed severally under Ignorance, Lust, Hypocrisy, Extortion, Slander, Envy, Stealing, Drinking, Lying, Pride, and Anger. Now, Messrs. Rhead saw at once that not even a Badman could contrive to be pre-eminent in all these vices. They have, therefore, illustrated the themes of Bunyan indirectly. This process admits of the appearance of what may be called by-characters, such as the devil, hideous demons, angelic beings, and frightful creatures, which, if they have neither the terrible aspects of Jerome Bossche's devilry nor the quaintness of Teniers's creations, are at least far above the plane where Bunyan's fancy clung. Such a vice as Stealing, for instance, in general, being at once sordid and trivial, does not at all lend itself to artistic and picturesque treatment in an incidental fashion ; but Mr. L. Rhead depicts a young gentleman furtively and timorously entering an apartment where the devil?a capital figure in its way?has laid a number of coins upon a table, which the intruder intends to appropriate, notwithstanding that Satan himself is plainly revealed by the light of the window he has opened in order that the cash may be seen. We have the waning moon without, and within a tall clock, the shape of which is, let us say, at least a century too late for the costume of the young gentleman. This treatment lent itself to the employment of chiaroscuro, light, and shade, and it suggested local colour and action. In another print we have Hypocrisy set forth artistically by Mr. G. H. Rhead by means of a gaunt and mean Puritan kneeling before an ill-favoured woman, while her good angel hovers behind as her protector, and his evil spirit urges him onwards, and is a very uncouth and hideous demon indeed. Of course, except indirectly, this design does not illustrate hypocrisy at all, but it sets forth the meaning of Proverbs xi. 9, "An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour," which is quoted below the plate. In a similar incidental or anecdotic way the brothers have contrived to illustrate Mr. Badman's whole career, but they have flinched from showing the conclusion of his adventures and the climax of Bunyan's allegory? that is, where he " went to."

CHRISTMAS BOOKS. Romeo foul Juliet, by W. Shakespeare (R. Tuck & Sons), is an ambitious volume. Tho designs, printed in colours and black, are by Signors L. Marchetti, L. Rossi, and O. Corrtazzo. The Juliet of tho last would cause Shakspeare many a pang, especially in tlie guiso of that exuberant and finely dressed wench who figures on p. 29. Signor Marchetti's version of the duel lacks neither energy nor spirit, and is the best illustration in the book. As a work for some drawing-room tables it may be welcome. Eminent amongst tho " books of the season " is River Dart: a New Series of Etchings, by W. Brown and E. W. Charlton (Virtue & Co.). The twelve etchings are accompanied by an introduction, which is at once sympathetic, historical, and gossipy, and a terse, if somewhat bald note to each plate. The plates are, as etchings, not of much account. With a few exceptions their interest is rather topographical than artistic, and this must be regretted as few districts in England lend themselves so happily to tho etching needle in artistic hands. Tho best of them is ' Staverton Bridge,' the next is ' Higher Street, Dartmouth.' The book is got up in a neat and simple wry.? The Cabinet Portrait Gallery (Cassell & Co.) comprises likenesses reproduced from photographs by the Messrs. Downey. Tho first series is before us, and contains a mixed company of .somebodies and a few nobodies. The Archbishop of Canterbury and Mlle. S. Bernhardt, a group of actresses and Miss Anna Williams, Sir James Linton and the much-photographed Sir F. Leighton, the Duchess of Leinster and Mrs. Lynn Linton, aro oddly grouped in ono collection. The portraits would be better if they had not been touched up ; as it is they aro sometimes acceptable in spite of their hardness and polish. The typography of the book and its getting up are mechanical in taste and character. These characteristics make it seem duller than it really is.?The Railway Book, Little Wide-a-Wakc's Primer, and Archie come to us from Messrs. G. Routledge & Sons, and aro alike enclosed in gaudy, not to say vulgar, covers. Thc texts are suitable for children whose hearts and minds need a little elevating. The cuts are of unequal quality, some being decidedly good and spirited, others poor, tame, and useless.?A Southern Cross Fairy Tale, by K. McC. Clark (Low & Co.), contains a readable, but rather goody legend, and some clever cuts of birds, flowers, and landscapes.?The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge has sent us tho Child's Pictorial, 1800, containing good stories, such as Mrs. Molesworth's ' Family Troubles ' and ' Lucky Ducks,' with some most clever coloured and uncoloured cuts suitable for intelligent little ones ; Twelve Tiny Tales, by Mrs. Molesworth, tales which are good, but not her best, and bright illustrations by Mr. W. J. Morgan; The Nursery Coach, by F. Epps and others, a collection of brief tales with tolerable cuts ; Godfrey of the Cradle, and other Stories, in which tlie cuts are better, but in the letterpress there is not much difference ; Real Artists, and other Tabs, which is not so good in any respect; while Family Troubles is a readable story, with a neatly concealed and wholesome set of "morals," by Mrs. Molesworth, and nice cuts, as before, by Mr. Morgan.

AFFINITIES. By Alarv Roberts Rinehart. Ss. od. net. (Hodder & Stoughton.) Lightness of touch and a delightful sense of humour characterise these long short stories by Mliss 'Mary Roberts Rinehart. Her plots have always an unexpected turn, her people, if a little shallow and scatterbrained, are excellent company, with a genius for subtle thrusts and witty banter. The story of Devil's Island, the first in the book, gives the reader an appetite for the four others that follow, and there is not one that fails in cleverness of idea and the deft handling we have grown to look for in this author's work. A group of bored young husbands an(l wives seek a diversion by planning an " affinity picnic of which the unwanted husbands and wives are to be kept in total ignorance. Fanny, who relates the story, goes with Ferd Jackson. but the picnic from being a huge success dwindles to a dismal failure, and she finds herself regarding her " affinity " with unalloyed hatred. Mishap follows mishap, and they escape in a borrowed motor-car pursued by another picnic party; hiding in a farm-shed, dishevelled and wretched, their only thought to preserve their reputations and avoid publicity. The climax to this vivacious comedy is, of course, a delicious surprise. Each of the tales is thoroughly enjoyable-told in a spontaneous, bubbling style that ever and anon breaks into laughter. Nobody with a copy of " Affinities*' at hand need be down in the (lumps.
