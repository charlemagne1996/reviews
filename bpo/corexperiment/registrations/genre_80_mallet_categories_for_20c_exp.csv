Goodall.       What's new now in that English never-never land of secure, truly decent (albeit with a handful of manageable exceptions) country men and women, where no one lacks help or a haven in tribulation? Well, there's a new neighbor, the incoming schoolmaster and his mysteriously perennially ill wife. Mysterious, until it's general knowledge that she has a, uh, problem. Poor Violet Lovelock, youngest of the three antique Lovelock sisters, is in a highly nervous state since eldest sister Beatrice has been discovered popping scones at the Fuchsia Bush tea shop and has moved a considerable number of articles in her bedroom. And lonely farmer Percy (you remember he was disagreeable when schoolteacher Dorothy hit--not fatally--his dog with her new car) is quietly courting, and everyone thinks he's after young Doreen Lilly, who's home with mother and Doreen's fatherless tot. The vicar, the doctor, and all the good people rally round and things seem to be set right. Oh, yes, the retired schoolteachers, Dorothy and Agnes, visit now and then, and on one visit Agnes reveals the shocking news that Dorothy may have more than kindly inclinations toward elderly Teddy in their new village. Agnes fears the worst.       More of the soothing same. Take a chapter or two before bedtime."

In this collection of essays drawn from more than three decades of prolific literary activity, Huxley goes bravely into every avenue of human enterprise. Painting, history, music, politics, psychology, morals, theology, love, sex, all are here, all surveyed by the urbane and erudite glance of Huxley the writer and embraced by the ardent caress of Huxley, the totally involved human being. At every turn problems are raised -- What is the true nature of the lover? What transpires between man and woman during coition? Which is the crucial historical moment? What is the nature of sanity? What determines an artist? What can be learned from cats, travel, and narcotics? And for every problem, Huxley presents, at least, a tentative answer, based on his curious breed of humanism, Buddhism, Lawrenconian transcendentalism, and his own liberal experience. Abashed with the shortcomings of his fellow man, Huxley is also stirred deeply by his potential ability to reach that enlightened point at which he is able unflinchingly to act in the true capacity of his being. Permeated with the wit and daring which have made Huxley's novels so popular, these essays will be read with the enjoyment with which one relishes a probing conversation with an enlightened and prodigal friend."
22,22,0.5266,"reader, page, book, word, author, read, language, narrative, point, chapter",,"Continuing his apparent mission to refract the whole of English culture and history through his personal lens, Ackroyd (Thames: The Biography, 2008, etc.) offers an all-prose rendering of Chaucer�۪s mixed-media masterpiece. While Burton Raffel�۪s modern English version of The Canterbury Tales (2008) was unabridged, Ackroyd omits both ���The Tale of Melibee�۝ and ���The Parson�۪s Tale�۝ on the undoubtedly correct assumption that these ���standard narratives of pious exposition�۝ hold little interest for contemporary readers. Dialing down the piety, the author dials up the raunch, freely tossing about the F-bomb and Anglo-Saxon words for various body parts that Chaucer prudently described in Latin. Since ���The Wife of Bath�۪s Tale�۝ and ���The Miller�۪s Tale,�۝ for example, are both decidedly earthy in Middle English, the interpolated obscenities seem unnecessary as well as jarringly anachronistic. And it�۪s anyone�۪s guess why Ackroyd feels obliged redundantly to include the original titles (���Here bigynneth the Squieres Tales,�۝ etc.) directly underneath the new ones (���The Squires Tale,�۝ etc.); these one-line blasts of antique spelling and diction remind us what we�۪re missing without adding anything in the way of comprehension. The author�۪s other peculiar choice is to occasionally interject first-person comments by the narrator where none exist in the original, such as, ���He asked me about myself then���where I had come from, where I had been���but I quickly turned the conversation to another course.�۝ There seems to be no reason for these arbitrary elaborations, which muffle the impact of those rare times in the original when Chaucer directly addresses the reader. Such quibbles would perhaps be unfair if Ackroyd were retelling some obscure gem of Old English, but they loom larger with Chaucer because there are many modern versions of The Canterbury Tales. Raffel�۪s rendering captured a lot more of the poetry, while doing as good a job as Ackroyd with the vigorous prose.  A not-very-illuminating updating of Chaucer�۪s Tales."

A star of the Harlem  Renaissance, Hughes (1902-1967) published poetry, fiction, humor, books for  young people, biographies and autobiographies, anthologies, and assorted works  of history and translation. He also wrote thousands of letters, from which  Rampersad (Humanities, Emeritus/Stanford Univ.;��Ralph Ellison,��2007,  etc.) and Roessel (Greek/Stockton Coll. of New Jersey; co-editor:��Poetry  for Young People: Langston Hughes, 2013, etc.) have made a discerning  selection���including several disarmingly candid drafts���to offer a vivid portrait  of a man sometimes cowed by self-doubt and vulnerability, sometimes given to outbursts  of bravura, always eager for adventure and always short of money. In the 1930s,  his youthful socialist sympathies transformed into passionate radicalism. He  cherished friendships, as letters to Arna Bontemps, Carl Van Vechten and  Countee Cullen attest, and he was quick to encourage other writers, including  Ralph Ellison and Alice Walker. As a young writer himself, he could be  self-deprecating: He felt timid about meeting editor and professor Alain Locke,  he told Cullen, ���because I know he�۪d find me terribly stupid.�۝ When he was 25,  Hughes was taken up by Charlotte Osgood Mason, an elderly white philanthropist  who offered him a monthly stipend to support his writing and insisted on being  called ���Godmother.�۝ Hughes loved Mrs. Mason ���as a son loves his mother,�۝  Rampersad writes. When Mason flared up angrily at what she saw as indolence,  Hughes felt desolate: ���I am humbly deeply sorry,�۝ he wrote, but he confessed,  ���I cannot write��at all on any sort of pre-arranged schedule.�۝ An intrepid  traveler, Hughes saw the world; championed by Van Vechten and his publisher  Blanche Knopf, he socialized with celebrity artists and writers. Yet all the  while, he took advice offered by Vachel Lindsay to be ���wary of lionizers.�۝   A privileged perspective  on the man and his art."

37,37,0.4573,"play, game, call, win, make, player, real, character, talk, sound",,"In translation from the German by Richard and Clara Winston, this enormously long and complex novel deals with the relations among a group of people in Vienna in the late 1920's. In a sense little happens but the whole texture and detail of a society is reconstructed, in cafes, bourgois homes, castles, workrooms, offices. And they are welded together by astonishing, lucid perceptions of the most peripheral insights and relations. As one huge group scene merges into the next, the steady evolution of a few principal characters is revealed. Some, notably a man named Schlaggenberg, pervert reality. Separated from his wife, he is half humorously obsessed with fat women (perhaps a symbol of the past; all the matrons worry about their obesity as opposed to the slimness of modern women; and indeed, the society itself is """"fat"""", is rich.) Schlaggenberg later becomes the leader of a group of youths, and he also lives as a brother with Quapp. The others more or less forge their own reality. Quapp faces the fact she is not a musician. Leonhard, a weaver, educates mind and heart by studying Latin. Stangeler, a rich boy, slides into a parallel but softer reality as a historian. Minor characters reach less positive conclusions. The climax comes during streetflighting. In  when the more definite characters (including the narrator) make their final choice of marriage, and the least real of all, a former lover of Quapp's, is killed on a barricade..... Narrower, drier, more intellectualized than Proust, though in some ways as complete a segment of a society, this pinpoint concentration on the minut of many lives is a complex and brilliant reading experience. It will command major critical notice."

Fine old wine in a new bottle. The text remains the same (less the American edition's preface), except that Black Sambo, Black Mumbo, and Black Jumbo are given what are billed as ""authentic Indian names''--Little Babaji, Mamaji, and Papaji--that are still appropriately ingenuous, but considerably less loaded. Marcellino (The Pelican Chorus, 1995, etc.) provides illustrations far more polished than the originals, ably capturing both the story's true setting and its glorious silliness. Little Babaji, looking like a glossy teak marionette, faces a succession of huge, luxuriously supple tigers whose eventual meltdown provides him, Papaji, and sari-clad Mamaji with a supper of pancakes--and ""Little Babaji ate a Hundred and Sixty-Nine, because he was so hungry.'' Offered in a square format about an inch higher than the diminutive original, this remake combines a star illustrator and a story with proven appeal: You can't beat it. (Picture book. 4-7)"

Now, however, it's announced that the trilogy has """"never before been available in America in the accurate restored editions""""--so here is Gormenghast again, with a brief introduction from Anthony Burgess at the start of Titus Groan. (He calls the trilogy """"a rich wine of fancy chilled by the intellect to just the right temperature. . . a modern classic."""") And though those in possession of the 1967 edition probably won't want to rush to replace it with this new one (a selective comparison shows few significant differences), others will welcome the return of Peake's elaborate, inventive saga--which follows Titus, heir to the House of Groan, from a long castle childhood (duels, arson, murders whirl around him) through his explorations of the world Outside the Gormenghast troll-land (where the prematurely aged Mud Dwellers dwell) to ascent and abdication. Volume I, Titus Groan, remains by far superior to its more amorphous, allegorical sequels--but enthusiasts will certainly want to wade through the whole Tolkien-esque set."

Narrow, reticent, self-contained���these words describe almost any Brookner heroine. They certainly fit Emma Roberts, who sums up her meager origins by saying, ���we were a very small, not to say non-existent, family.�۝ That family is comprised solely of Emma and her widowed mother. ���If I was not extremely vigilant,�۝ Emma notes, ���I might run the risk of living her life over again.�۝  Emma�۪s Uncle Rob is the quintessential Brooknerian Other. Rude and assertive, he detested Emma�۪s long-dead father and openly dislikes her on the basis of her paternity. Before his certitude, Emma and her mother simply ebb away to nothing. When Emma goes to France to research her thesis, she is befriended by a young library assistant named Fran̤oise. Unlike Emma, Fran̤oise is active, aggressive and highly sexed. She invites Emma home to her family�۪s country house and manipulates Emma, to her own advantage. Emma seems to take pleasure in allowing her to do so, in part so the full measure of Fran̤oise�۪s character, or lack of it, will be revealed, but also because even a vicarious life is better than nothing. Emma manifests the same lack of energy in her dealings with men. And because both of the men she knows seem as spiritless as she, these relationships have all the fire of a blaze kindled from a single match and a damp log. Although Emma deplores her purposeless solitude, she works to maintain it and thinks disdainfully that she ���prefers her gardens deserted.�۝  The beautifully ordered prose of Brookner�۪s 23rd novel (Making Things Better, 2003, etc.) is the verbal equivalent of the empty gardens Emma inhabits. At one point, Emma has a dream in which she knows ���simply and conclusively, that I was loved.�۝ Nothing in waking life affords her, or us, a comparable satisfaction.  "
3,3,0.4015,"jewish, make, story, people, american, move, finally, polish, form, bear",,"Epstein's book is so large and musical and atremble with horrible imagination that only the iron-hearted will come away unshaken. An unnamed Polish city, like all the others during World War II, creates its walled ghetto--the Baluty suburb--and, under direction of the Nazis (""""the Others"""") forms a Judenrat, a self-governing council to oversee the Jews' own decimation. Chosen council elder is Trumpelman, a quack doctor and insurance swindler but also the one Jew in the Balut whose personality is spacious and flamboyant enough to seem vaguely messianic. With Trumpelman in charge (his picture appears on the newly minted ghetto money--Trumpkies--and stamps) maybe everything may tuna out all right. Then the Judenrat is asked to start providing quotas of Jews for """"relocation,"""" for """"farm work."""" Who among them could made such a pernicious list? Only Trumpelman: to save a thousand, he'll sacrifice fifty; to keep ten thousand, five hundred; to spare fifty thousand. . . it never ends. Eventually the Jews rebel--there's a general strike--but it's over quickly, and resistance concentrates into cells of boy-partisans. Epstein's scenes of self-defensive sanity--a wedding, a jerry-built production of Macbeth--are especially moving: culture as a last, illusionary tie to life. The sumptuous, Bellovian language here may make some people uneasy: accounts of the Holocaust, real or imagined, are usually more spare and numbed, never so operatic. But Epstein's narrative drive is affecting--it apes Trumpelman's own desperate attempts to hold on to life--and the vividness makes the pity and tragedy pulse."

Its cartoon characters speaking in balloons, the story--whether flying or submerged--is much like a Classic Comix version of Jules Verne's novels of fantastic transportation. It begins in antiquity, with Theodosius about to burn the library at Alexandria. A rogue fleet sets sail bearing the cream of the library's artifacts and scrolls, including the complete works of Homer in 27 books and the coffin of Alexander (with the world conqueror himself inside). Many weeks later the ships manage to bury their treasure in a remote land, but all except one of the ships and their crews are lost when attacked by savages (actually Aztecs). The lone ship to escape later freezes in ice near Green-land, its passengers preserved perfectly. Two millenia later, Dirk Pitt discovers the the frozen vessel while looking for a lost Russian nuclear sub under the Arctic ice. Meanwhile, an Islamic terrorist group tries to kill the female Secretary of the United Nations, a beautiful Egyptian, by crashing her jet into the Arctic ice. Not only does Dirk hear the plane go down, so does a group of archaeologists on a nearby island. At the same time, in Mexico, a messianic Aztec has arisen and plans to take over the country. Later, he even invades Texas. A map Dirk finds on the frozen Byzantine ship now leads him to Roma, Texas, since it is clear that the fleeing Alexandrians have sailed up the Rio Grande and buried their loot in a Texas hillside. Does the thoughtful reader now explode with tears of appreciation for such zestful nonsense? Many will, many will!--especially when our hushed President is at last shown the golden casket of Alexander the Great: ""The President felt as if he was about to meet God."" Titantic. Just titanic."

With a confident, free touch, Miss Lavin probes for the central spirit in her characters that lies buried in their daily lives and interloping relationships. In the title story, grown children grope to accept their mother's energetic insistence upon happiness as a philosophy that demands """"effort"""" not """"flair,"""" despite successive tragedies. The study of """"The New Gardener"""" balances strict, economical narrative with gently placed intuitions of what is not told--the long, sickle-shaped scar on his little girl's arm, or the absence of a mother. The deep hatred that binds a married couple explodes in """"One Evening"""" to sever a son's indenture to his mother. """"A Pure Accident"""" occurs when an embittered failure of a priest lies in wait for the poor-box thief. And """"The Lost Child"""" very nearly becomes the lost faith in the single day that a young wife converts to her husband's Catholicism and suffers a miscarriage. Miss Lavin's traditional stories, singularly Irish in tone and character, are firmly placed in the human experience."

The hundred or so characters are firmly presented as types (e.g., ""Bartley Paxmore, at thirty-one, was the new-style Quaker""), most of them members of three representative families: the Catholic, landowning, upper-class progeny of Edmund Steed, who explored the Chesapeake with John Smith in 1608; the dumb but spirited lower-class progeny of Timothy Turlock, who came to Maryland as an indentured servant; and the steady, middle-class, shipbuilding progeny of Quaker Edmund Paxmore, who was dumped in Maryland in 1661 after extensive Massachusetts whippings. Over the years, these clans must deal with pirates, storms, incest, sexism (yes, many of the women here are unlikely feminists), bastards born of philandering, the Revolution (all three broods eventually join in, even the royalist Steeds), and--about half the book--the slavery question. The Turlocks are slimy slave traders, the Steeds are gentle slave owners, the Paxmores are fierce abolitionists, and--in a rather shameless lift from Roots--the Caters are slaves who are seen under the whip and under the covers, in Mandingo-style triangles (""You want to stay longer, honey?""). On to the Civil War (eight pages), the oyster-dredging business, and the 20th Century--which is reduced to three bizarrely selective vignettes: a Paxmore rescuing 40,000 Jews from Hitler, the desegregation struggle, and. . . Watergate, with another Paxmore committing suicide over his White House involvement. As fiction, then--shallow and sketchy throughout, with no theme (except ""It's gone.

Nor does all of Michener's digested research produce painless fact feasts: much reads like a junior-high text (""Three reasons accounted for this""); the guest appearances by such as Henry Clay and Geo.

Tales of Fstration, Anguish and Hope provide situations of misunderstandings; curious love, as in Candelora, who loved a man who could only abide her as long as he remained indifferent to her; isolation, of the aged and the young; estrangements between loved ones. One theme remains constant: that individuation necessarily entails loss -- of communion, of understanding and that this is the unalterable human condition. One simply accepts it. A wide selection of Pirandello's less well-known work has been provided here by the translator, Lily Duplaix, and the result, while uneven, is of value."

The deepest focus is on beautiful, brilliant Medina, a leading journalist who has lost her job (her work has been banned by the regime)--and has just left her weak husband Samater, newly appointed Minister of Constructions for the government. Why has Medina walked out on him? Because of his smarmy kowtowing to the """"fascist"""" General? Or because of her longtime conflict with Samater's imperious mother Idil? (She's a nomadic sort--unlike Medina's own home-bound Yemeni mother--who trumpets the virtues of traditional Somali culture. . . and has been pushing for the circumcision of Medina's eight-year-old daughter Ubax.) Meanwhile, as Medina ponders this new situation and dotes on Ubax, her young quasi-proteg�ĉۡe Sagal wrangles with her dominating mother--naively flirting with dangerous rebellion: she plans either to join the anti-government underground or to defect while competing abroad as a swimmer. And Medina's circle of friends includes other variations on rebellion/compromise: Amina, daughter of a government biggie, was revenge-raped by three of the General's victims--and insisted on bearing the resulting child (""""I want everyone to know. I want every Somali to see the political significance""""); popular actress Dulman has had her career sabotaged by the General; Atta, a black American, sees everything in terms of race (Medina lectures her on the universality of suffering, with female circumcision as the example); and Italian journalist Sandra has become a jargon-spouting flak for the General. Eventually there's a small flurry of drama here: several of the characters--including, surprisingly, Samater--are arrested for anti-regime activities, so Medina is jolted into active rebellion. (""""No, she wasn't a guest any more. She was a full and active participant in the history of her country."""") But for the most part this is a static, densely talky examination of a complex political/social/sexual subculture; and though occasionally pretentious in its metaphor-laden, allusive prose, it offers subtle, thoughtful rewards to readers with a strong interest in Third World politics, African feminism, or tribal cultures in transition."
5,5,0.3344,"great, play, music, time, make, end, world, thing, part, high",,"    Vienna, on the eve of WW I, home to Freud, Mahler, and Wittgenstein, was the apex of European civilization. It was also, as the hub of the last Habsburg Empire, the rotting, living-dead core of ancien-r��gime Europe. Tumultuous, manic, and loosed from its traditional moral and spiritual moorings, Vienna was a fertile breeding ground not only for genius but also for defensive provincialism and, ultimately, fascism. That Vienna is the setting of this most celebrated of seldomly read novels, released in a new translation by Sophie Wilkins and Burton Pike and available in its entirety for the first time in English. Begun in the early 1920s, the first volume was published in 1930 and remained unfinished when Musil died in 1942. In 1932, Musil wrote in a notebook about this never-ending project: ``What the story that makes up this novel amounts to is that the story that was supposed to be told in it is not told.'' The closest thing to a human protagonist is Ulrich, the so-called man without qualities, a skeptic who views with irony the Austro-Hungarian Empire's attempts to match the patriotism of the newer German state on its border. Meanwhile, he's obsessed with the celebrated case of a mass murderer named Moosbrugger (M, Fritz Lang's famous film, was similarly obsessed). But the real protagonist is a dying culture, represented by Vienna. This novel marks Musil, albeit unwittingly (he hated Joyce and loved the 19th- century Russian novelists), as the high priest of German modernism (see Arno Schmidt's Collected Novellas, p. 1371). The book opens with an almost God's-eye view: ``A barometric low hung over the Atlantic. It moved eastward toward a high-pressure area over Russia without as yet showing any inclination to bypass this high in a northerly direction.'' From the heavens, the book swoops down to the minutest psychological details in an effort to bring every possible aspect of human and natural existence under the domesticating control of art."

That, unfortunately, is the general effect of this artful but lifeless picaresque novel--which follows the crossing 1936 paths of a very young vagabond and a somewhat older failed-poet, both of whom love a tormented beauty and both of whom wind up under the wing of a great tycoon. Doctorow's on-and-off narrator is 18-year-old Joe Korzeniowski, who shakes off his working-class Paterson, N.J., childhood, heads for California as a hobo, but soon stops off to work as a carney roustabout, befriending Fanny the Fat Lady--a """"retarded whore freak"""" who services hordes of men in swinish orgies.

W. Bennett's Loon Lake estate in the Adirondacks--where Warren has lived ever since as """"resident poet"""" (though his original intention was to kill Bennett). And in 1936 wandering Joe arrives at Loon Lake too: he catches sight of a beautiful woman riding a private railway car, follows her, is attacked by wild dogs, and wakes up in the care of Loon Lake's green-uniformed staff. (In a rare comic moment, Joe puts his name below Leopold of Belgium's in the posh guest book: """"Joe of Paterson. Splendid dogs. Swell company."""")

And Joe himself, after complications when the spy is murdered (Joe loves-and-leaves the spy's child-bride widow), ends up back at Loon Lake, vows to rehabilitate vile exploiter Bennett (""""I'm going to put the fucker where he belongs I swear on my Clara I swear Mr. Penfield I swear by the memory of the Fat Lady""""). . . but merely becomes--as revealed in an epilogue--the totally corrupted heir to Loon Lake. A fable-like scenario, then, with capitalism's great hand corrupting or exploiting or destroying (poet Penfield flies off into oblivion with Bennett's aviatrix wife). And some of the telling is attractively fable-like too. But much of it reads like an academic exercise rife with self-indulgence: annotated poems (clever but very bad) by Penfield; sophomoric free-associations by Joe (""""Commingling with me she becomes me/ Coming she is coming is she/ Coming she is a comrade of mine""""); arbitrary disjunctions and time-warps, overwritten setpieces (the Fat Lady orgy), and dreadful, oh-wow-heavy pronouncements--""""You are thinking it is a dream.

From the introduction alone--a classically Crichton-clear discussion of the implications of biotechnological research--it's evident that the Harvard M.D. has bounced back from the science-fantasy silliness of Sphere (1987) for another taut reworking of the Frankenstein theme, as in The Andromeda Strain and The Terminal Man. Here, Dr. Frankenstein is aging billionaire John Hammond, whose monster is a manmade ecosystem based on a Costa Rican island. Designed as the world's ultimate theme park, the ecosystem boasts climate and flora of the Jurassic Age and--most spectacularly--15 varieties of dinosaurs, created by elaborate genetic engineering that Crichton explains in fascinating detail, rich with dino-lore and complete with graphics. Into the park, for a safety check before its opening, comes the novel's band of characters--who, though well drawn, double as symbolic types in this unsubtle morality play. Among them are hero Alan Grant, noble paleontologist; Hammond, venal and obsessed; amoral dino-designer Henry Wu; Hammond's two innocent grandchildren; and mathematician Ian Malcolm, who in long diatribes serves as Crichton's mouthpiece to lament the folly of science. Upon arrival, the visitors tour the park; meanwhile, an industrial spy steals some dino embryos by shutting down the island's power--and its security grid, allowing the beasts to run loose. The bulk of the remaining narrative consists of dinos--ferocious T. Rex's, voracious velociraptors, venom-spitting dilophosaurs--stalking, ripping, and eating the cast in fast, furious, and suspenseful set-pieces as the ecosystem spins apart. And can Grant prevent the dinos from escaping to the mainland to create unchecked havoc? Though intrusive, the moralizing rarely slows this tornado-paced tale, a slick package of info-thrills that's Crichton's most clever since Congo (1980)--and easily the most exciting dinosaur novel ever written.

He enjoys a marriage of """"poised tranquility"""" though severely limited communication, and is becoming aware of the """"vile, putrid smell"""" of old age; his liver problems are as severe as his wife's arthritis. Another sort of problem arises when he sees, on two public occasions, a mocking version of his own face. A hallucination? A doppelganger? An impostor? The mystery is compounded by rumors that Suguro has been seen visiting peep-shows. Something must be done, for a self-seeking journalist, Kobari, is on his trail, hoping to destroy his image. Suguro's investigations lead him to a female artist and self-proclaimed masochist (who later commits suicide) and to Madame Naruse, an eminently respectable widow working as a hospital volunteer. Her revelations to Suguro about her past marriage, which encapsulated the darkest impulses of the human heart, form the centerpiece of the novel. It is she, too, who arranges for Suguro to observe his """"double"""" drooling over the drugged body of an adolescent girl, a naif, Suguro's part-time employee. This vision of evil is succeeded by its opposite: the """"double"""" is enveloped in """"a profound light. . .filled with love and compassion.""""

Some of this is vintage Endo (the Naruse marriage, Suguro as voyeur), but the surprisingly awkward narrative execution (the Kobari business is handled quite superficially) means that this is unlikely to rank as one of the memorable treatments of duality."

Indeed, Pearson's The Case Against Congress (p. 634) provides a clef to everyone but the Marian Javits character. And many of the harangues come straight out of it, from the Senate's free travel to the depletion allowance issue. They sounded better there: the fictional medium corrodes the message, which is narrated by Hannaford's aide, a barefoot boy with tongue in check. The style ranges from the deliberately funny to the inadvertently puerile; there is also a dollop of sex, like cherry flavoring in antibiotics. The result will be palatable chiefly for readers who like political novels and Pearson. An attention-getter, at any rate."

Green, whose art has been rightly compared with the pure naturalism of the early 18th century (Fielding, etc.), and who combines with that an occasional poetry, here has produced a comedy of life below stairs in Ireland, during the war. With a deadly fidelity to type and tongue, this reproduces the hierarchical household of Mrs. Tennant; Charley Raunce, promoted to butler after the passing of Mr. Eldon; Edith, the housemaid he loves, and Kate, whom he passes off on the pantry boy; Mrs. Welch, the cook, and Miss Swift, the nanny. From their unctuousness toward the Madam to the petty thievery on the household accounts they practice under her nose, from the scandal over the discovery of Mrs. Jack in bed with a lover to the common uneasiness over the disappearance of a sapphire ring, these things occupy this drama of little lives which also reflect more widespread patterns of privilege and prestige, custom and caste...

In the late 1870's less than 1,000 survived and these were taken forcibly to played-out reservations in the Indian Territory (Oklahoma) far to the south of their native grounds. There they found neither their natural hunting nor any food at all, but much sickness. And soon they decided their only chance for survival lay in escape back to the Yellowstone country. This is the story of that last desperate forced march and the one autumn they enjoyed in familiar woods before the army overtook them, decimated their number down to a pitiful 114 and once again took all but a fortunate few, who hid in the woods, back to the old Indian Territory reservations. But by then a few white voices were raised in protest and finally the Cheyenne were allowed to have a Yellowstone reservation. A story well-written in the idiom of the Cheyenne Indian."

A month after his law clerk Laura Rizzati is killed after- hours in the Portland courthouse, Oregon Supreme Court justice Robert Griffen is blown up in a bombing that looks just like the work of Charlie Deems, whose earlier conviction on homicide and drug charges Griffen himself reversed, setting Deems free. But the DA's office is looking even closer to home for Griffen's killer: They think Griffen's estranged wife, Abigail, a star county prosecutor, arranged the bombing in order to save herself $2 million in alimony and then framed Deems, whom she'd fought to put away before her almost-ex overturned the conviction. Calling on cadaverous Matthew Reynolds, unblushingly described as ``America's most famous criminal defense attorney''--the man she's been trying cases against until the day the police take her off in cuffs--Abbie vows to fight the unholy alliance of Deems and her buddies at the DA's office. After all, it's her word against a convicted killer's, right? And for a while it looks as if the unexpectedly shifting patterns of alliances and betrayals- -Abbie's old gang accuses her of hiring a felon to kill the man she once loved, and she's defended by a former courtroom nemesis who seems to be sweet on her himself--seem to promise a ripe payoff. No sooner has Margolin set up this web of ironies, though, than Reynolds's rookie clerk Tracy Cavanaugh, a friend of Laura Rizzati's, turns up some new evidence of a motive that links the two murders (or does it?); the characters get tired of stalking each other and start shooting; and it's all over but for the canned romantic fadeout.

Prince Reyhnard is the third son of a reigning feudal tyrant, Basal of Brychmachrye. Third in line, and therefore unnecessary to the king's dynastic ambitions, Reyhnard grows into a bookish mold--a habit that serves him well when he later retires into exile to relate his story via memoir. We find out, among other things, that Reyhnard's father rose to power through the triple pillars of medieval management strategy, marriage, and murder. Into the picture arrives Beulah, a sensuous court climber who becomes the king's mistress, soon married off to Reyhnard. Through a succession of deaths, partly accidental and partly by poison, the crown falls into Reyhnard's reluctant hands. Something of a Richard II figure, Reyhnard is constitutionally unsuited for political hatchet work and, after settling accounts, absents himself from power and chooses a simple life in exile--the moral here for would-be princes. There's more of course: an incestuous affair between Reyhnard and his sister, regal summer excursions, layers of court intrigue, conspiracies, the usual line-up of cowering minions and hand-wringing schemers. In the main, though, de Haan's strength rests with a tart style and an eye for the violent details of feudal life, preventing a lapse into run-of-the-mill fantasy.

The plot is no plot at all, in the conventional sense; here is where it may fail to appeal to popular taste. But in characterization, in vigorous scenes, in the picture of the everyday life of the family and the village, in tragic scenes and in festive ones, the book cuts deep into our hearts. It is a profoundly moving story, realistic and yet poignantly lyr. There is something of the quality of Twenty Years A-Growing. There is a closeness to the soil -- and the people --that suggests Mary Webb. There is a simplicity that makes it read like a peasant saga, and yet there is occasional over-playing of the heroic. The story is told by Huw, looking back from the vantage point of old age to the days of his youth, as one of a large family, when """"green was my valley"""" -- and his language is still tinged with the almost Biblical overtones of his people.

Laura has two siblings, Steve and Caroline, and is planning, with husband Pete and their two children, to join them and their elderly parents for the annual family reunion. Just before the Bartones set off, Laura is phoned by Caroline, who asks that the three of them get together without their spouses to discuss issues that are bothering her. As a child, Laura was a bossy and sometimes cruel tease, often hurting Caroline, who was sensitive and subject to dark moods and fits of weeping. Caroline also, Laura recalls, was constantly trying to please their beautiful but emotionally cold mother. The siblings meet as planned, and Caroline announces that she�۪s depressed, is seeing a therapist, and is about to divorce husband Bill. She suspects the depression is caused by events in her childhood, and she asks Steve and Laura whether they can remember anything about their mother�۪s treatment of her as a child, particularly anything abusive. Laura and Steve are shocked, thinking that Caroline must be mistaken or overreacting. But then Laura and Steve begin remembering incidents from their own childhood, and Laura learns that Caroline was hospitalized one summer when she and Steve were away at camp, after her mother had attacked Caroline with a knife. Their mother was also abused by her mother and lost a much loved baby before Caroline was born.

What about the middle volume of the trilogy, you ask? Well, though written in 1951, Scenes from Metropolitan Life was """"suppressed by threat of libel"""". . . and wasn't published in Britain till 1982. Here, then, is a reprint of Provincial Life, plus the first US appearance of Metropolitan Life--both narrated by Cooper's laconic, wry alter ego Joe Lunn, a novelist who must work at other jobs to make a living. (""""The reviews were civil enough. The sales were unspeakable."""") In the first, far better novel, Joe is a science teacher in a small English rural school circa 1939, avoiding marriage at all costs--despite a pique-and-passion affair with a curt, wedlock-minded siren named Myrtle. In the sequel, it's 1946, Joe is still unmarried, still in need of non-literary income: he and his chum Robert--also a non-bestselling novelist--work as aviation-related civil servants in Whitehall. (""""Our function was to collect facts and numbers, and then, through a mixture of science and commonsense to produce compromises between people who wanted certain things and people who made them."""") And Joe's short chapters of narration alternate between office life and the two friends' love lives. At the office there's the arrival of a new colleague--a Machiavellian creep named Chubb (one possible source of that 1951 libel threat) whose ambitions eventually backfire, along with Air Force plans for some new secret weapon. In the love department, there's a heavy, near-wedlock entanglement for each aging bachelor: in the absence of her adoring soldier-husband, Myrtle has taken up with Joe again, who now wants marriage--but Myrtle is suspiciously slow to move towards divorce; meanwhile, Robert falls for the lovely, enigmatic Julia--but she too seems drawn to an obsessive old love (a rich, jealous Polish businessman), as well as to drink and promiscuity. And finally both men will remain single. . . though Scenes from Married Life was soon to follow. By turns ironic and analytical, Joe is an uncommonly detached observer of his own life and those of others: in Provincial Life the results are often amusing, with tender touches; in Metropolitan Life the effect is more often merely cold. The second novel, too, seems more dated, less timeless. So, though some British critics consider Provincial Life an influential classic (exemplifying anti-Bloomsbury, un-artsy fiction), this is an only modestly rewarding old-and-new package--without the bite or force of such other anti-Bloomsburyites as Pamela Hansford Johnson or Kingsley Amis."

And the reader knows that the crash was probably engineered by Peter's uncle Phillip--who, determined to prevent Peter's father Charles from inheriting the controlling share of the family publishing firm, conspired with psychotic J. J. Englehardt, an HUAC/CIA agent with an obsessive (unconvincing) hatred for Charles Carey. Peter, however, has no memory of the car-crash years, just nightmares. So, circa 1982, 29-year-old, super-handsome Peter is seeking psychiatric help from his father's old chum Dr. William Levy. Will analysis (plus hypnosis) unlock the secret of that '59 crash? That's a big worry for mercenary Uncle Phillip, especially since he's now in the process of trying to sell the family firm to a conglomerate before Peter (a more idealistic publishing type) takes over the company at age 30. But things are soon taken out of Phillip's hands: the crazed Englehardt reappears, with a homicidal, wack-o henchman, to spy on Peter, with the full surveillance treatment; Englehardt and the conglomerate head (who also has a longtime hatred for the Careys) conspire to destroy Peter's psyche; bodies start falling; Peter's photographer/girlfriend is kidnapped. And there's a long showdown/finale--with Peter remembering The Truth about the crash (few surprises for the reader) and going up against the psychos. Patterson, author of a Washington-conspiracy thriller (The Lasko Tangent) and a gnarled murder mystery (The Outside Man), is recycling an even flimsier genre this time, trying to jazz it up with sex, psychology, and publishing.

Because Manette is the daughter of an influential Minnesota poi and the estranged wife of a wealthy developer, Davenport, deputy chief of the Minneapolis PD, winds up in charge of the high-profile case. The kidnapper, a vicious but resourceful psychopath named John Mail, was once a patient of Manette's while confined in a state institution for the criminally insane.

A computer-game freak, Mail soon begins phoning Davenport (an off-duty entrepreneur who launched his own simulation software company) to taunt him with clues. The detective eventually realizes his quarry is getting inside information from someone in Manette's family circle, which includes her partner -- a nasty piece of work who has been bedding down with the septuagenarian paterfamilias. The suspense and dread build steadily as Davenport closes in on Mail, who has been beating and raping Manette in a farmhouse well beyond the Twin Cities limits. Will Davenport (who's been lured into a couple of near-fatal traps by his crafty adversary) be able to engineer an endgame before the madman kills his three captives? And what can Manette and her children do to help save themselves from mortal peril?

Never mind: his new dark fantasy, an epic tale of a magic carpet and the wondrous world within its weave, towers above his earlier work--and, despite some serious flaws, manages via its powerful and giddy torrent of invention to grasp the golden ring as the most ambitious and visionary horror novel of the decade. Barker attempts nothing less here than the resurrection of the imagination as the prime force in human destiny. To do so, he posits a race of magicians--the Seerkind--as always having cast spells of delight alongside humankind. But at the dawn of this century, modernity's onslaught forced the Seerkind to retreat within a magical fortress--a carpet. As the story begins, young Cal Mooney, an office grind with a fanciful heart, chances upon the rug and is transported into the enchanted fields and towns of """"The Fugue""""--the marvelous land woven within the rug. Cal faints from this vision; when he awakes, the rug is gone--and in its place are Immacolata (a demonic/erotic spirit) and Shadwell the Salesman (a human embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins), veteran seekers for the rug Who, believing that Cal knows its location, pursue him with all the hounds of hell. After ferocious battles with evil entities, Cal links up with Suzanna--descendant of the carpet's dead caretaker--who soon learns that Seerkind blood courses in her veins. Eventually the two track down the carpet, and, after it unweaves in northern England, visit the Oz-like land of The Fugue. But Shadwell follows them there and destroys the magic land in a ocean of blood. As homeless Seerkind wander England, their ancient enemy, """"The Scourge"""" (an incredible creature akin to a mad fallen angel), wreaks havoc on Seerkind and humanity alike--until at novel's end Cal and Suzanna harness their personal powers of wonder to defeat Shadwell and Scourge and to re-create The Fugue. Like Barker's earlier fiction, this complex work erupts with explicit sex and violence--but now the shocks punctuate a raging flood of image and situation so rich as to over-flow Barker's abilities to formalize it. Nearly every page teems with original ideas; what's missing, however, is an emotional vigor to backbone all this activity; Cal and Suzanna remain distant creations.

The patriotic Southerner isn�۪t against slavery, but he dislikes the superior attitude of the wealthy plantation owners who hire him and the dangers of extracting black fugitives from the increasingly abolitionist North. Faced with a huge gambling debt and the threatened loss of his beloved horse, however, Cain reluctantly agrees to retrieve runaway Rosetta for her master, a tobacco planter named Eberly whose extreme insistence suggests ���a more personal reason for wanting her back.�۝ Judging Cain not too reliable, Eberly saddles him with three companions: the white-trash Strofe brothers and the psychopathic Preacher, who tries to rape Rosetta almost as soon as she�۪s caught. Like most of the other heavily foreshadowed events here, the resulting confrontation between Cain and Preacher occurs primarily to provide an impetus for Cain to acknowledge the horrors of slavery and his feelings for the proud, abused Rosetta, which make it impossible for him to return her to Eberly. Despite lots of backstory about his service in the Mexican War and love for a peasant girl who was killed for sleeping with a gringo, Cain isn�۪t an interesting enough character for his moral awakening to be terribly compelling. Rosetta too is sketched in very broad strokes, and Eberly is a cartoon villain. The author has nothing new to say about slavery or the mixed motives of those who supported it, though that doesn�۪t prevent White from indulging in long passages that explain Cain�۪s shifting perspective rather than dramatizing it. It�۪s all as obvious as the protagonist�۪s surname. An epilogue that shows Cain on the eve of the battle of Antietam is almost offensive, suggesting that loving Rosetta changed nothing essential about him. Well-intentioned, but heavy-handed."

Set in Japanese-occupied Java--the pre-independence name of Indonesia--Hardo, the fugitive of the title, is hiding from the Japanese. Though an officer in the army, Hardo and his friends at first welcomed the Japanese invasion as a means of winning Indonesian independence from the Dutch, but the Japanese occupation turned out to be brutal and rapacious. A failed revolt by Hardo and a fellow officer leads to their flight into the countryside, where they hide, disguised as beggars. Hardo believes that a third member of the conspiracy--Karmin--still serving the Japanese, betrayed them. On a visit to his old home, Hardo meets his fianc�ĉۡe's father, who begs him to spend the night, but he refuses, and stays instead in an old but where his own father suddenly appears. Not revealing his identity to his father, Hardo learns of his mother's death from grief, and of his father's plight. Stripped of his local offices by the Japanese in retaliation for Hardo's role, the father--mourning both his son and wife--can find release--freedom--only in gambling. Their discussion of freedom political and personal is interrupted by a Japanese search-party. Hardo has been betrayed by his fianc�ĉۡe's father. He is eventually captured, and finally confronts Karmin, who proves to be innocent; but as the Japanese commander is about to execute him, he is saved by the news of Japan's surrender. The country will be independent at last. Pramoedya is one of those rare writers who can let a story--well-told and moving--make profound observations about politics and the meaning of life without sounding didactic or tiresomely polemical. A notable accomplishment."

For Bart, restless by nature, returns from the wars to resume what had only been a momentary relationship with Jan, and, when she is diagnosed as tubercular, knows for the first time the full meaning of his love for her. Assuming the financial responsibility for her care in a private sanitarium when no bed is otherwise available, Bart gives her also her one hope of recovery in his love for her. And in the setback she experiences, brought on by a casual infidelity with another woman, Bart feels only the bitterness of guilt rather than the resentment of her dependence which increases when she is sent home. Marrying her, so that he can take care of her, this follows the slow progression of the days while waiting for a vacancy in a state hospital, the weakening and worsening of the disease, and finally the admission to a hospital where Bart gets a job as orderly- to be near her, only to face the hopeless acknowledgment that she will die...

Kay, a rising young architect in LA in 1936, tells the story of Salvador Carriscant, a mysterious stranger who claims to be her father. Having thought that her real father died when she was an infant, Kay refuses to believe Carriscant, but nevertheless lets him talk her into trekking to Lisbon to track down a woman from his past. This woman, not Kay's mother, was the love of Carriscant's life back in the Philippines at the turn of the century, and the majority of the book is taken up with Kay's retelling of how he lost her. A prominent surgeon in Manila, Carriscant is called in to examine the bodies of two American soldiers whose deaths prompt a murder investigation. Mired in an arid marriage to Kay's mother, Carriscant falls in love with an American officer's wife and together they plan to flee the Philippines to start their lives over. She escapes, but Carriscant is implicated in the murders and ends up being separated from her for 30 years. Hence he tracks down Kay (born after his wife left him as a result of the scandal), then convinces her to go to Lisbon for one last look at the woman who got away. Since the reader knows from the beginning that Carriscant is going to lose his love, and since the narration makes a big point of Kay not believing anything Carriscant says, it is difficult to form attachments to any of the characters.       Well written, intricately detailed and researched, but uncompelling."

""Love is stronger than death"": Baby Palatine, a religious old woman, said those words to Joy Bang when Joy was just a lonely little girl hanging around the apartment complex Baby and her husband managed in Oakland, California. Neglected by their mother, Joy and her two sisters were nurtured by Baby, who dragged them to church and baked them birthday cakes and tried to make up for the lack of structure in their lives. Little Joy was always special to Baby, however--her ""God-sent"" child--and poor barren old Baby Palatine had tried to give her words to live by. But Baby never could have predicted that the girls would band into ""Bang Bang Bang,"" a rock group that soared to the top of the charts only to crash because Brenda--ugly Brenda with the gorgeous voice--confessed in the gay press to being a lesbian. Brenda even confessed that her first lesbian crush was the preacher's wife at Baby's church. ("" 'Oh dear Lord,' I prayed to myself, 'please don't let this woman tell me nothing I don't need to hear this day about Naomi Earl.'

Meanwhile, Baby kept loving her like her child, so when the news came that Joy was dead--dead from a drug overdose--Baby denied it. Soon, however, Baby has to confront a string of strange, dark secrets about Joy, secrets that only the strongest love can overcome.

Jack's trek begins on the Atlantic coast, where an old black man at a seedy ""Funworld"" tells him about the Territories, The Talisman, and the ""Twinners"" (parallel-universe doppelgangers); and these first chapters recall the murky hoo-hah of Straub's opaque Shadowland--as Jack learns that his nemesis is his dead father's evil business partner Morgan Sloat, known in the Territories as ""Morgan of Orris."" Still, Jack plunges ahead--walking west but flipping into the Territories whenever Morgan's pursuit becomes lethal. . . and vice versa.

Ancient, prestigious Beet College, north of Boston, was founded by a pig farmer. The hog motif is ubiquitous, so it�۪s fitting that the chairman of the board of trustees, Joel Bollovate, the mighty real-estate developer, is quite a pig himself. Bollovate is threatening to close the college; the $265 million endowment has been spent. He has issued an ultimatum. Unless the faculty can come up with a new curriculum that will bring in big bucks fast, it�۪s doomsday. Young Professor Peace Porterfield is chosen to chair the CCR (committee on curriculum reform). Idealistic and unworldly, Peace is a hero in the Frank Capra/Jimmy Stewart mold. He believes the heart of a university is teaching and learning, not committees, but he accepts the challenge, though his colleagues are a bunch of craven PC buffoons, and the CCR meetings go nowhere. Aside from the cartoonish villain Bollovate, Rosenblatt reserves his most withering scorn for the faculty, but he also jabs at a handful of disruptive students bent on nihilistic indolence. Their leader is a transfer student, a Southern belle desperate to conceal her past, who is being courted unsuccessfully by a faux Arab, Akim Ben Laden, actually a Jewish kid rebelling against his despotic father, a rabbi. The students�۪ antics, which include the occupation of two buildings, fill up the hole where a plot should have been, but the humor falls flat. In welcome contrast is a straightforward description of Peace teaching a poetry class; Rosenblatt celebrates beautifully the joy of the classroom before returning to more antics. Akim, in his off-campus cave, makes an amazing online discovery about Bollovate that ends the story. With a lighter touch Rosenblatt might have produced a successful wry comedy."

Disastrously, Benedick learns that he suffers from manic-depression, but his bad moods, with medication, vanish like magic���rendering most disappointing the requisite hospital ending of this neatly written emotional saga.

So, being a noble hero much like the one in Condominium, Wade turns his evidence over to a US attorney--despite the ragings of Wade's shady partner Bern Gibbs (a Loomis stooge). And when Loomis' desperate efforts at cover-up lead to the inadvertent murder of pathetic partner Bern, Wade does all he can to bring about Loomis' total downfall--with crucial help from one of Loomis' ex-girl. friends. MacDonald's ecology message is, again, rather heavily laid on. And one or two of the compressed subplots--e.g., the adolescent turmoil of Wade's teen-age son--seem extraneous. Overall, however, MacDonald fills out his essentially simple plot with just enough twists and just the right textures: the quirky pathos of the assorted, uncliched bad guys; the edgy touches that keep the supporting players (Wade's devoted wife, Bern's ambitious mistress) from becoming soap-opera types; the resonant ironies--like the fact that both mastermind Loomis and one of the sad bribe-takers are taking care of stroke-victim relatives. Slow to get started, tougher and darker and slighter than Condominium--but ultimately satisfying and quietly compelling."
7,7,0.1707,"day, year, memory, time, long, spend, life, live, summer, childhood",,"James Alan McPherson's new stories may lack the fury of Hue and Cry, his first, deservedly praised collection, but they are distinguished by a disarming gentleness and grace--a mellow, even wistful, attitude toward people in conflict, toward our gratings against each other. Admittedly, there are a few too many pat endings here. But--when an alcoholic black woman shows a sophisticated understanding of the white legal bureaucracy or when a man remembers what it meant to be in love (and powerless) in the fourth grade--curtains rise on some wonderfully ironic human comedies. And-in a man's glimpses of his beautiful and complicated ex-wife as she receives a community award, in the meeting of cousins whose lives have taken different, perhaps equally ill-fated directions--sadness and tenderness strike a balance that averts sentimentality. Nor does McPherson shy away from the bottom-line eloquence of brutality: a quiet post-office clerk's maiming of his girlfriend; an illiterate mechanic's murder of the employer who has humiliated him. Prismatic revelations of moments remembered, semishared, recounted to others and argued about, in these twelve stories, limn the distressingly tenuous nature of what we can ever really know and signal the welcome return of a gifted and versatile storyteller."
20,20,0.1687,"death, die, dead, ghost, leave, kill, haunt, brother, suicide, alive","ghost stories","Here's another alcoholic nightmare told against a thoroughly knowledgeable background of Mexico, the people and the customs. Geoffrey Firmin's crowded life the world around slowly cracks through drink; not even his marriage to Yvonne, loyal but loved by his step-brother, Hugh, can save him. She leaves to get a divorce, while Geoffrey finds sympathetic cronies and old friends to accompany him from one binge to another. Yvonne's return, just as Hugh is leaving, brings about a new high in Geoffrey's drinking, and a new low in his hangovers. In futile altercation with the local police, Geoffrey is killed. Through the three central characters, there is the Joycean outpour of consciousness, a diarrhoeatic total recall, in the search for the cause of their rejection of life, in their rationalization of their self-portraits, in their knowledge of their griefs, despairs, bewilderment. Their casual, veiled conversations, wandering soul searchings, are highlighted against the Mexican setting, and the effect, sometimes with a brilliance, is a delirium of phantoms. For sophisticates."
44,44,0.1657,"man, find, horse, follow, run, brother, ride, set, bring, train",,"Masterful detail of life on the Plains, in a third novel from Meyers.  The author�۪s The River Warren (1998) defied description, by genre or any other way, and this outing is much the same. It starts with a brilliant piece of horse-trading wit, mindful of Faulkner�۪s ���Spotted Horses�۝ in The Hamlet. Cocksure 14-year-old Carson Fielding visits rich rancher Magnus Yarborough to buy his first horse, and Magnus foresees a beautiful fleecing. The lad points to a roan, saying, ���I don�۪t know if I seen a more worthless animal since I been born.�۝ Is this true or not? The reader can�۪t tell���but it�۪s Magnus who gets fleeced. The uppity roan later kills Carson�۪s grandfather and when Carson tells Mom, she suggests calling an ambulance. ���I didn�۪t say hurt, Mom. I said dead. He�۪s dead. He�۪s laying out there dead.�۝ ���You did. Yes. You did say dead . . . But how do you know?�۝ ���I know dead, Mom. I�۪ve seen dead.�۝ ���I suppose you have.�۝ Faulknerian grim wit? Like Wild Bill, Meyers doesn�۪t let on what fun he has with Carson�۪s stony reasonableness. After graduation, Carson moves into his late grandfather�۪s old house and soon becomes a respected hand with horses, so much so that Magnus hires the unwilling Carson, now 26, to train three horses for him and teach his wife Rebecca how to ride. Carson and Rebecca, who�۪s a year or two older, grow closer and closer. She demands that they drive off onto far reaches of the ranch for their riding lessons. But then Meyers breaks the rules and what you expect to happen doesn�۪t happen.  Superb dialogue. And the same irony that emerges from the horse-trading emerges still more deeply from Carson in his climactic verbal face-off with Vaughn, as if about to fleece Vaughn of Rachel."
19,19,0.1629,"give, social, time, bring, prove, life, follow, attention, lack, leave",,"Both literary and lurid, Murr�۪s third novel (The Genius of the Sea, 2003 etc.) uses the perspective of an alienated soul to examine a Missouri community in the 1950s stewing in a broth of violence, sexuality, bigotry and secrets.  London-born, U.S.-based Murr stirs many extreme ingredients into the pot. He tells a tale of seething emotions, elegantly-phrased yet feverish, that�۪s surely destined to erupt in dramatic fashion. The opening serves as a prologue, in which Gerard Travers leaves his illegitimate Indian son Rajiv with his brother Haig in post-World War II London. Rajiv is smart, a talented mimic and a misfit who will be passed on to the third Travers brother Olly, cohabiting with Ruth, a romance writer in Pisgah, Mo.���except that by the time Raj arrives, Olly is dead. But Ruth befriends the boy anyway, as do the local children: Annie, whose Italian father runs the local store and might have murdered a mentally-challenged boy named Roh; fragile Lewis, Roh�۪s brother, who has become convinced���after two years in a mental hospital���that he killed Roh himself; Norah, who is attracted to Raj although he is more attracted to Annie; and creepy Alvin, who thinks mostly about sex, death and wounded animals. The parents and siblings of this group line up on either side of an extreme gender divide: Many of the men are brutish and vile (like Norah�۪s cruelly voyeuristic father) and the women bovine, lonely or borderline insane. Ruth asks repeatedly: ���Is there a single good man in the world��_?�۝ and the answer, when it eventually comes���after many, many episodes of depravity and tragedy, and considerably less innocence and hope���is a distinct Maybe. Murr�۪s impressive literary abilities are applied to a gargantuan gothic panoramic spotlit with emotional insight."
67,67,0.1244,"character, plot, set, reader, draw, scene, main, author, strong, situation",,"While this holds to the central theme of suspense, rooted inevitably in the interrelations of characters and situation, it is one of Ngaio Marsh's best yarns. When she involves the characters in romantic and peripheral interests, the story loses focus... The plot revolves around an actress beyond her first youth, bitterly resentful of losing center of attention, and going temperamental to a point of dementia when she considers herself betrayed by her producer, playwright, fellow actors, or management. What happens when, on her birthday, she feels all are in a plot against her and how each one seems involved in her strange and violent death makes absorbingly good reading-up to the point of diffused interest."
