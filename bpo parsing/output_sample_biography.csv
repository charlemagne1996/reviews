Knight's Weekly Volume, Nos. 4 and S.* THIS reprint of Elia's most popular book naturally finds a place in a series projected by the man who, more than any otherperson, has widened the circle of SHAKSPERE's admirers by the facilities he has afforded for an acquaintance with his works, and a just appreciation of them. Mr. KNIGHT has judiciously appended to each tale a fewv scenes, to give an additional incentive to those who read the Tales ignorant of the original, to draw from the fountain-head for themselves. We learn with pleasure also that he hopes soon to furnish a companion work, entitled Histories from Shakspere. It will, however, be impossible to excel the Tales, and difficult to equal them. They will only cease to be popular when children cease to exist.Tales from Shakspeare. By Charles Lamb. 5th edition. Ornamented with engravings, from designs by Haney. London, 1831.

If wc had leisure, we should certainly have availed ourselves of this volume, to have said a few modest words on tho genius of Charles Lamb;?as it is, we shall allow a fifth edition to serve m apology for doing no more than an- nounce the publication, and commending it as one of tho very best works that ever issued from the press for the delight and instruction of young people. Mr. Lamb, who has fortunately lived to nap the late harvest of his fume, would, perhaps, be indifferent to our good or ill word, and therefore we the less regret our compelled silence: but Mr. Harvey, whoso pencil illustrates this edition, is a younger man, and may value the opinion of ono whom circumstances call a critic, even beyond its worth; ami we owe it to \ truth to acknowledge, that wo hardly know his j equal among living artists.

India is so much in the air just now that this intimate glimpse into the thoughts and actions of the daughter of a famous leader of Indian religion will be greatly in demand by all who wish to know more of that unsettled coner of the Empire. The Princess writes with evident anxiety to make her meanings clear to English readers, taking pains to explain any obscurity, so 'that her book, as a study of Indian life, will appeal even to the most casual student of Eastern affairs. H-er accounts of the struggles against "" caste,"" of the developmentof the Brahmo-Somaj creed. of social functions, of her travels, and personal experiences at home and abroad, make extremely interesting reading. Especially curious is the docile attitude of the Indian wife to her husband; and the description of the betrothal and marriage of the Princess indicate the wide differences that divide the East from the WVest.

2,B3378,"['8868540', '6657197']","Memoirs of a Highland Lady. LITERATURE Edited by Lady Strachey. (Murray.) We were once shown a picture by Raeburn of an elderly Scotchman, an elderly Scotch gentlewoman, and a beautiful Scotch girl. They were, said the owner, an uncle who had fought under Clive, his maiden sister, and their niece?all Johnstones of Alva, if memory serves aright. That group has been recalled by this most charming book, which, like the picture, suggests a Scotch Jane Austen, much more Jane-Austenish than Susan Ferrier. Its author, Elizabeth Grant, was born in Edinburgh, May 7th, 1797, had an unhappy first love in 1815, was married in 1829 in Bombay Cathedral to Col. (afterwards General) Henry Smith of Baltiboys, lived thereafter in Ireland, and died November 16th, 1885. She was the eldest of the five children?two sons and three daughters?of Sir John Peter Grant, of Eothiemurchus (1774 - 1848), by his English wife, Jane Ironside, whose father was a long ? descended clergyman at Houghton-le- Spring. Sir John Peter, the only son of a doctor, had succeeded in 1790 to the Rothiemurchus property by the death of his uncle. He was an Edinburgh advocate and London barrister, sat as Whig member for Grimsby and Tavistock, and in 1827, having frittered away his 2,000/. a year and gone bankrupt, was appointed a judge in Bombay, and knighted; later he was Chief Justice at Calcutta. These memoirs, written by Mrs. Smith for her children during 1845-67, come down only to 1830, and record her life in London, at Thorley Hall, Hertfordshire, at the Doune in Rothiemurchus on Speyside, at University College, Oxford (of which Dr. James Griffith, one of her numberless cousins, was Master), in London again, in Edinburgh, and in India. They have already been privately printed, and now are generously given to the world, with a brief?too brief?introduction by a niece, Lady Strachey. No book of the kind has proved more delightful. "" If ever I write a novel,"" Mrs. Smith says once, and about 1826 she and a sister Mary did between them produce "" a bundle of rubbish"" for some forgotten Inspector, and received 40/. in return. That rubbish might repay recovery, but a novel by her!? yes, we could wish she had written a novel. As it is, these five hundred pages would set up a dozen present-day novelists, and might have furnished themes to the great poets of the past. Here is one that is truly Wordsworthian:? ""The young people were not of Rothiemurchus. They lived up in Glen Feshie, a great way from our march, and they had not long been married. He was either a small farmer, or the son of one, or merely shepherd to a more wealthy man, I am not sure which, but his business was to mind a large Hock that pastured on the mountains.At the beginning of a heavy snowstorm our young husband departed on his round of duty. The wife was preparing for her first baby ; she was also busy with her wheel, the first work of a newlymarried notable Highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband. She baked the bread, she trimmed her fire, and she busked her house, then took her wheel, and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney, she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winter's night. Ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door, which, poor young thing, she was never to hear again, for he never returned from those wild mountains. They sought him for days ; no trace of him could be discovered. When the snow melted, and the summer flowers burst into bloom, party after party set out in quest of his remains, all unsuccessfully. It was not till late in autumn, when our gamekeeper was on the Brae-Riach shooting grouse, that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure. It was all that was left of the missing shepherd, and his collie lay dead beside him. Deceived by the snow, he had wandered miles away from his own ground, and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot. His widow was past all knowledge of his fate ; her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth, fever ensued, and though she recovered her strength, her mind was gone. She lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband, went cheerfully about her usual work, preparing things for him, going through the same routine as on the day she lost him ; baking, sweeping, putting on fresh peats, and ending with her wheel by the side of the clean hearth in the evening. She would show her balls of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her, and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard. Sometimes in the evening, they said, she would look wearily round and sigh heavily, and wander a little in her talk, but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever. She was never in want, for every one helped her; but though she was so much pitied, she was in their sober way much blamed. The Highlanders are fatalists; what is to be, must be ; what happens must be borne patiently. We must * dree our weird,' all of us."" This needs no praise of ours, for it could not have been told more beautifully. And it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the Highlanders. There was no deep religious feeling among them in those pre-Disruption days; fairy legends, old clan tales, forebodings, and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the Bible. The minister of Duthil possessed only two English sermons, though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety. His brother of Alvie, known as Parson John, used often, for lack of matter, to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers. Once, learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours, he next Sunday, after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text, raised his hands and ejaculated, "" My brethren, it was a' lees I told you last Sabbath day."" The fusion of classes, from duke to peasant, was singular, yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general, whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day, and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited. These were Grants; and of Grants, Grants, Grants, nearly seventy figure in the excellent index, not all of them quite entitled to the surname. Thus there was Annie Grant, the ""accidental"" daughter of Mrs. Smith's great - great - uncle; a bare - footed herdlassie once, she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to Sir John Peter's family, and, marrying an Indian general, became a welcome guest at Newstead and Kensington Palace. The consumption of whisky was vast. At the Doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the side-table, and another was the allowance in the pantry; in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared "" for the first time in the drawingroom to tea?and sober."" The very poorest cottages could offer whisky, and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day. One day a woman "" with a child in her arms, and another bit thing at her knee, came up to the house ; the horn cup was duly handed to her, she took a * gey guid drap' herself, and then gave a little to each of tne babies. ' My goodness, child,' said my mother to the wee thing that was trotting by the mother's side, 4doesn't it bite you?' ' Ay, but I like the bite,' replied the creature."" The book is not purely Highland. Scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of well-known, even great people. Shelley was at University when, in 1810, Elizabeth Grant went to stay there with her cousin. She describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate, and as making, when reprimanded, extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof, so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor. At the Hampstead villa of an uncle, William Frere, she sometimes in 1823 met ""that poor mad poet Coleridge, who never held his tongue, but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing, with eyes on fire, and his silver hair streaming down to his waist."" Edward Irving, too, came there (he struck her as ""very dirty""), and Joanna Baillie, "" a nice old lady."" Scott she was never in company with, and the idea of the Highlands given by ' Waverley' seemed to Her ""utterly at variance with truth."" None the less this passage, under 1817-8, ii interesting:? "" Walter Scott went out very little, and when he did go he was not agreeable, generally sitting very silent, looking dull and listless, unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance. In his own house he was another character, especially if he liked his guests. It was odd, but Sir Walter never had the reputation in Edinburgh he had elsewhere?was not the lion, I mean. His wonderful works were looked for, read with avidity, praised on all hands, yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad. The fat, vulgar Mrs. Jobson, whose low husband had made his large fortune at Dundee by pickling herrings, on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to Sir Walter's son, said the young people were attached, otherwise her Jane might have looked higher; it was ' only a baronetcy, and quite a late creation.' "" Then there are stories of Lady Eldon and her sister-in-law Lady Stowell?one thrifty, one something more. For the first, when her husband was earning thousands a year, would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars, she herself standing at the window of her lord's fine mansion, and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement; whilst the second grudged her husband his clean daily shirt, and used herself to take a night's wear out of the cast one for a bedgown. The future Lady Byron, Burns's ""BonnieLeslie"" (""one of the cleverest women of her age""), Mrs. Thrale, Catalani, Mrs. Siddons, Sir Augustus d'Eete (the original, we believe, of Harry Richmond's father), Basil Hall, John Clerk of Eldin, Jeffrey, Canning, the Abbe Sieves, and many more emerge and disappear. In connexion with ""Prince"" Augustus anice point of etiquette comes up ? that with royalty to dinner one must not have fingerglasses, for nobody ever washes before royalty. Still, after all, we like the Highland folk best. There was old Lovat, who, when on a visit to Cluny in 1809, took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen :? 44 And so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage, and filled it with eggs and a large stone, and there he sat hatching, never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl, and having his supplies of food brought to him. They had at last to get Lady Cluny's hen-wife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their Elace, when Lovat, satisfied he had accomplished ia task, went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them."" There was Elizabeth's great-great-grandfather, Patrick Grant, surnamed Macalpine (1665-1743), who never slept at night without praying for two men, Rob Roy and the Duke of Gordon, Rob Roy having helped him at a pinch to best the Mackintosh. Macalpine, whose soft, white, womanish hands could draw blood from any other man's finger-nails, himself always went about with twenty-four gaily dressed followers ; he was judge and jury in one, and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences. He married twice?first the high-born Mary Grant, and then, in old age, a low-born Rachel Grant, who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the "" Spreckled Laird,"" her stepson:? ** Once, after the service in the kirk was over, poor Lady Rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made, and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husband's grave, crying out through her tears, ' Macalpine! Macalpine ! rise up for ae half-hour and see me richted !' "" She had borne him four sons, the third of whom Elizabeth saw often, for he lived until 1813, or a hundred and forty-eight years from the birth of his father. This was dapper little Capt. Lewis Grant, who was also twice married, and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word, though they occupied the same rooms, and every night played backgammon together. And there was in 1814 a ""very old Mrs. Macintosh of Borlam"" (? Mackintosh of Borium, a daughter-in-law of the brigadier), who lived at Kin gussie with her daughter, the widow of a Major Macpherson, and a comely widow too :? "" The Leddy Borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age, upright, active, slender, richly dressed for her station, and with a pleasant countenance. Her handsome silks caused many a sly remark. She was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom Sir Thomas Dick Lauder endeavoured to portray as * Lochandhu.' There were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country. A cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at Belleville, for he did not deal in black cattle only ; no traveller was safe when Borlam wanted. His wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in, and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime ; seemingly a true suspicion, for the Lady Borlam's silks would stand alone, and she had plenty of them. With them she wore the Highland mutch (the high, clear cap of fine muslin, trimmed in her case with Flanders lace), and calm as a princess, she moved about in her ill-gotten gear. She was a wonderful old woman, keen, merry, kindly, and as cute as an Irishwoman, never tripping in her talk, or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband."" We had marked for quotation a score of other things, as the Dutch-like interior of the inn at Seaham, the floating of the timber to the Spey, the floaters' ball, the eagles (? ospreys) that built upon Loch-an-Eilein, the bediamonded aldermanesses at Margate with their tumblers of brandy-and-water, the middle-aged beauty who ""wriggled about like an eel"" at the mention of any of, her numerous fancied admirers, and the horrible upbringing of the Grant children? icy baths through the winter, the father's whip on occasion, the dark closet, and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten. But we must leave a few lines for faultfinding?a very few will suffice. The type?that of the private issue?is cramped and repellent; a future edition should be in two volumes, with a portrait, if possible, of Mrs. Smith, and with views of the Doune, Thorley Hall, Belugas, &c. Though not without interest, the thirty pages on the tour in Holland might perhaps be omitted, and the sixty on India ; but there should certainly be a few foot-notes, explanatory and sometimes corrective. The Northern Meeting was started in 1788, not soon after 1797; the Eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend, whom to see is madness, and to meet inexorable death; the account of the Sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong, alike by their own legend and by known facts; certain books, like the 'Autobiography of Mrs. Fletcher,' might here and there be cited with advantage; ""a small hexameter"" on p. 125 must be a misprint; and "" expletives is oddly misused on p. 230. But what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 Memoirs.' We admire them greatly, but cannot feel certain we should have loved their author.Memoirs of a Highland Lady: the Autobiography of Elizabeth Grant, of Kathie- murehua, 1797 - 1830. A HIGHLAND LADY. Edited by Lady otracney. (Jolin Murray.) The Grants of Kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of Grant which, by judicious obedience to the powers that were, succeeded'in keeping their lands in the North at tunes when more hot-headed dans were disinherited. Rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods, and the stock which dwelt there has always been a vigorous one, giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history. This book is the autobiography of a lady of the house, written many years later?a sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of Highland gentle-folk in England and at home in the far-off days of the early century. The extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity. One might compare it with the gossip of Dorothy Osborne or the memoirs of another Highland lady of the same clan, Mrs. Grant of Laggan, who told the story of the Prince's arrival at Gortuleg after Culloden; but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity. Miss Grant of Rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the reader's eye. She confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness; she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess; and she is quite open with her dislikes. In its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one, for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family, tells it, too, with no omission of darker scenes, till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin. We hear of the early days in Lincoln's Inn Fields and of the holidays at watering-places; then of the long years in the Highlands, varied with seasons in Edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south; and then, at the last, of the money troubles, consequent upon an injudicious union of Highland hospitality with political ambition, of the Indian judgeship for the father, and of the marriage of the diarist, when ""Eliza Grant"" takes final leave of us. It is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter. The style is without art, but direct, vivid, and at times fired with a genuine emotion. Parts might have been left put without hurting the book; but, as it was originally published for the family, there is reason for its completeness. But even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs, which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory. By far the best are the Rothiemurchus chapters; but the early days in England were not without interest. The children were brought up on a Spartan plan?up at six, cold water summer and winter, and a breakfast of porridge. But they were a set of little madcaps even in those prim'days, and were none the worse for the training. The long journeys between the Highlands and London gave food for child's fancy. What impressed the small Elizabeth in Edinburgh was the "" size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses, and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny."" Nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean, and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere. She meets Lord Lovat, is much impressed, and little wonder, for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen, and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage. In 1810, she went with her sister to Orford to stay with the Master of University, and a dreary place she found it. "" Two facts struck me, young as I was, during our residence in Oxford,"" she writes, "" the ultra - Tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society."" She carried on a child's flirtation with a young gentleman who played the French horn; and she was much shocked by young Mr. Shelley: '?' The ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was Mr. Shelley, afterwards so celebrated, though I should think to the end half-crazy. He was very insubordinate at University, always infringing some rule, the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked. He was slovenly in his dress, and when spoken to about these and other irregularities, he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures, expressive of his humility under reproof, as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor."" Soon after, the whole family retired to the Highlands for good, and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at Kothiemurchus, where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs. On the way to the North the father read Childe Harold (then newly out) to the children : "" I was not given to poetry generally,"" says the chronicler; ""then, as now, it required ' thoughts that rouse aud words that burn' to affect me with aught but weariness; but, when, after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment, saying, ' Thia is poetry!' I felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure."" ? The whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done; and so, too, the account of the simple household and its retainers, among them "" old John Mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires, pumped the water, turned the mangle, lighted the oven, brewed the beer, bottled the whiskey, kept the yard tidy, and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp ?like Daavid'! "" The Grants were a remarkable clan, for the cotters' and foresters' sons had a ^ueer habit of suddenly leaving home, and generally getting somehow or other to India, whence they returned Generals and Baronets and men of fortune. Nothing, indeed, in the whole book is so extra* ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these Highland adventurers, who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize. Distinctions between classes, too, were not rigid in the North. Miss Grant has a deep scorn of the English lower and middle classes, but in Scotland all are gentlefolk?a belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest Grant to his chief. ? And, certainly, we find barefooted Highland girls making great marriages, and every social barrier turned topsy-turvy. There are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages, for Miss Grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words. Take this of the Highland kirk: ""The girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees. I do not know if it improved or hurt the hair, but it agreeably scented the kirk, which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peat-reek, for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the English sermon; they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls; spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste. The old women snuffed too, and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings, their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit; lapses from faith was their grand self-accusation, lapses from virtue were, alas! little commented on; temperance and chastity were not in the Highland code of morality. Both in the Highlands and in Edinburgh, where the family went in the season, there was no lack of great folk to be seen. Across the river at Kinrara the famous Duchess of Gordon?the friend of Burns?entertained large house parties. The writer's comments on people are forcible and plain-spoken. She objected to Lord Tweeddale because ""he had that flat Maitland face, which when it once gets into a family, never can be got out of it."" The account of the old Edinburgh society is entertaining. She classifies it into sets?the exclusive, the card-playing, the quiet country-gentleman, the fashionable, and the literary. She met all varieties?the Jeffreys; Sir David Brewster ; the crazy Lord Buchan, who collected such relics as a tooth of Queen Mary's and a bone of James the Fifth; Harry Erskine; John Clerk of Eldin (about whom she has many stories to tell); and Sir Walter himself. There is also a well-drawn portrait of Canning, whom she met in Holland. She is most fearless in confessing her opinions. She confesses that she found Waverley intolerably dull. Peter the Great she thought only a "" lunatic barbarian "" ; Coleridge, whom she met at Highgate, is ""a poor, mad poet, who never held his tongue, but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing, with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist."" The chief thing that impressed her about Edward Irving was that he was "" very dirty."" She is severe on the two Sobieski Stuarts, and is highly scornful about their pedigree; but one might say something on the other side. Her sister Jane goes to Abbotsford on a visit: ""Jane was in an ecstasy the whole time. Sir Walter Scott took to her, as who would not P They rode together on two rough ponies with the Ettrick Shepherd and all the dogs, and Sir Walter gave her all the Border legends, and she corrected his mistakes about the Highlands."" We h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of Miss Grant's stories. The book is not all comedy, for the account of the final parting from Rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader. But the prevailing tone is a cheerful one, and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales: "" A coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the 'Duke's Arms' at Dunkeld to Blair during the summer season. The announcement read as follows: 'Pleasing intelligence. The Duchess of Athol starts every morning from the "" Duke's Arms"" at eight o'clock.'"" The other is told of Lord Eldin: "" Some one having died, a man of birth and fortune in the ""West Country, celebrated in his life for drawing pretty freely with the longbow, it was remarked that the heir had buried him with much pomp, and had ordered for his remains a handsome monument; ' wi' an epitaph,' said John Clerk, in his broadest Border dialect; ' he must hae an epitaph, an appropriate epitaph, an' we'll change the exordium out o' respect. Instead o' the usual Here lies, we'll begin his epitaph wi' Here continues to lie.'"""

4,B1342,['9423732'],"Nostromo: a Tale of the Seaboard. By Joseph Conrad. (Harper & Brothers.) This is a perfectly amazing book. Opinions may vary, according to the varying degrees of comprehension brought to bear upon it, with reference to its interest, its charm, its artistic completeness, and so forth; but all will agree that it is an amazing piece of work. It is less a novel than an opera in prose?the longest ever written. Its division into chapters and books appears to be purely arbitrary, gratuitous, and unnecessary perhaps; probably an author's tribute to the fixity of the canons and standards of his art. But they have no particular meaning, these printed divisions; the sounding musio of the tale rises and falls, fades and swells, advancing ever to the ordered crash of its finale, without reference to parts and chapters, and with a force and certainty that are at once splendid and fascinating. The author's favourite knack of making his characters tell his story for him, in narrative style, one to another, is freely indulged here, and with a magnificent disregard for the dangers of digression and retrospection. Fifty pages of retrospection are as nothing to Mr. Conrad, and so fine and strong is his prose, so brilliant are the colours he uses, that only the trained reader is likely to recognize the daring nature of his method. For grim, ironic humour it would be hard to match the passage describing the handling by a brutal soldiery of the terrorsmitten Israelite, Hirsch. There are whole pages in which every word seems deeply charged with thought, though every sentence is vivid and melodious. 'Nostromo' is a romantic tale of politics, adventure, and intrigue in a maritime republic of South America; yet, before all eke, it is a novel of character. One is inclined to dispute the author's apparent conviction that the man Nostromo is the principal figure; but that may be only on account of the wealth of characterization lavished upon innumerable other figures in this fine achievement."

What we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple, and not such a weight of environment and side issues. 'The History of Sir Richard Calmady' is not the desire of one's eyes, but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough. Mrs. Harrison starts with a leisurely account of her hero's forbears, their fair domain near the Surrey hills, the family legend and the family curse. Six hooks, each with its title, are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a Meredithian turn. But the atmosphere is, alas! more clinical than Meredithian. The skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages. Elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely. 'The History of Sir Richard Calmady' cannot have been lightly undertaken, nor is it lightly executed. The leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable Fallowfield are all the more welcome. His son Ludovic has also a whimsical "" way with him,"" but we seem to have met his kind before, only better realized. Lord Fallowfield may be superficial, and, like some of the other characters, superfluous, yet he is not so superfluous, since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story. As its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel, it must be clearly stated. Briefly it is this :? The year 1842 (when the actual story begins) ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race. They are the parents of the future Sir Richard, and are well dowered not only with a high spirit, youth, and beauty, but with great worldly possessions. On Richard himself all subsequent events turn; he is the centre and pivot of the story, and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends. His is the sort of ""case,"" in fact, that might be supplied by any medical record, but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves; for Richard's horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically, but is from first to last tho dominant factor and the constant interest. Though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility, the plot is, as it were, against him from the beginning. He comes into the world with a "" superb "" head and shoulders, but shorn of the half of each of his legs, with (we are told but too explicitly) feet protruding from the "" stumps,"" and arms almost reaching the ground. Richard is, in fact, the victim of an obscure pre-natal process scientifically termed ""spontaneous mutilation."" The father's death has taken place before his son's birth, but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs, owing to an accident. The shock of his death and the manner of it?the days of chloroform had not dawned ? also, it is suggested, the sight of a Velasquez ' Dwarf' (in its frame), have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boy's mother. Surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer! The result, at any rate in the book, is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physique?a monster. This is the situation, and this the hero offered to the casual reader. We need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness. Mrs. Harrison, seemingly undismayed by her dismal task, has taken him not on the ideal lines of Miss Mulock's old story ' A Noble Life,' but more in the "" modern"" spirit and manner. In spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it, the treatment (if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view) shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother, and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness. But it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject. The mother, a woman ""nobly planned to warn, to comfort, and command,"" weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things, is a beautiful study of resignation and courage. If we cannot look on her as a really vital creature, but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized, the fault is of course our own. The tracing of the physical, moral, and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate, and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother, show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties. Of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses. One scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest, because it is in some ways more restrained. It is when Richard, disappointed in his first hopes of marriage, desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate, and with all his vital energies in full cry, confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live "" fully,"" if not worthily. Nothing is spared elsewhere, nor even here, perhaps, that could agonize a proud yet gentle woman whose son's dire misfortune is in every sense her own. The fifth book, called ' The Rake's Progress,' shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise, unless, indeed, as we begin to believe, the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all. The evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow; the writing is over-charged, lurid, yet inadequate. The author seems quite out of her depth here. The Neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus. To use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake. But the more one fastens on errors of detail (and there are many), and attempts to criticize, the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life, and out of drawing besides. The story actually closes not on the tragic note, but in England, to the sound of Sir Richard's wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin.Fiction. The History of Richard Cal mady : a Romance. By Lucas Malet. (Methuen. 6s.) When you see Richard Calmady sitting at table he is an Apollo. His splendid head, his strong, clear-cut face, which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers, his broad shoulders and noble carriage, all mark him clearly as a man among men. But see him stand upon the ground, the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor, see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk, see him even sitting?when once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidity?and the Apollo is at once forgotten, and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship. And the* very clear distinction of these two impressions, scarcely ever confused, which are produced by his physical personality, is characteristic of his effect as a literary character The reader never sees him all at once. The table may be there to conceal his legs, and one's admiration may be concentrated on the Apollo : or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view, and one can think of nothing eke. Richard is either one or the other, never a combination of the two. And the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person. The artistic justification of Richard and his deformity is, in fact, not himself, but his influence upon others, and especially upon the opposite sex. He is himself more or less of a dummy, an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum, a woman's sexual personality, may be ascertained, decomposed, and separately set forth. Many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment. There is Clara, the housemaid, who nursed the young dwarf in his youth, and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet. There is Mrs. Chifney, the trainer's wife at the stables, who also wept? simple soul?because she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel. There is little Lady Constance Quayle. She, too, wept when Richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations. But the three important patients, the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive, are Katherine Calmady, Helen de Vallorbes, and Honoria St. Quentin. In these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother, the perfect sensualist, and the perfect virgin. It is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable. In all the author shows a subtlety, a frankness, and a tact which are insufficient to conquer one's distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these women's hearts. Moreover, all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man, and which shows, even if we did not know that "" Lucas Malet"" is the pseudonym of Charles Kingsley's daughter, that the book is written by a woman. Perhaps of them all, Katherine Calmady, Richard's mother, is the finest. Pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and, that love once lost, prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present, she walks through the book almost with a majesty, at any ra'e with that calm dignity of motion which in Richard's eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room. The second of the three women, Helen de Vallorbes, Richard's evil genius, if she is certainly not a pleasant character, is scarcely less real, except in a few moments of crude melodrama, than Katherine Calmady. With the artistic temperament's capacities and limitations in emotion, but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it, she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism. She is cruel?she was the child who laughed at Richard's infirmity?calculating in her pleasures, and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires, which is the curse of ignoble passion. To her the grotesquely-dtformed Richard becomes a subtle attraction. She begins by inspiring him with love, and ends by degrading that love to lust. The character is melodramatic at times, as when she is dressed in a "" flowing, yet clinging silken garment of turquoise, shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green."" And the chief incident in her amorous relations with Richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration. Beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters. Richard does not matter ; he is a dummy or a shadow. It is, perhaps, just as well, for if one began to consider this short-legged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous. Cyrano de Bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience, but even he was only grotesque as a lover : he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior. The minor characters do not matter ; they are not drawn with originality or comedy, and they tend to become wearisome. The melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter, although that of the clergyman, Julius March, discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the Velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely Corellian in its obvious luridness. The whole idea of this explanation of Richard's deformity by legend is unworthy of Lucas Malet; it should be left to the How Hells Xnvelette. The unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter, although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words, like "" casement"" and "" greensward, and a speech by the old doctor, on page 404, reads exactly like a schoolboy's essay, and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking. Nothing matters, in fact, except that Lucas Malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different, but all interesting, women. And, if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters, we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters."

Gaston de Blndeille, or the Court of Mharu III. keeping festival in Ardxen, a Rolwe, by Mrs. RaddiffA 1826. -In the memoir of Mrs. Radcliffe prefixed to the present volumes, there is so comprehensive and, altogether, so judicious a panegyric upon her peculiar genius, that nothing remains for subsequent eulogy. ITe breathing generation of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests, and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this, her farewell effort, anticipating, as we did, a re-awakening of those ancient and hallowed feelings which waited upon St. Aubin and Emily, and Provence and Languedoc, and the Apennines, and the midnight airs of, as was insinuated;' departed spirits. Alas, alas! Gaston de Blondeville is but the sad application of dimmed and fallen faculties to a decidedly lower attempt than even her earliest powers would have stooped to. The writer of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward, as she does, a realghost, upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes, under her hands, having produced such exquisite effects, the accumulation and realization of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent, or more. But this opinion every reader of Gaston de Blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact, and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory. The effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of literature, and al80 on i the aptitude of readers for excitation in that particular department. Now, we know i that this aptitude varies in great degrees i from time to time with regard to all emo- i tions which are of a secondary or associated i nature. The primary ones, themselves- i love, hate, ambition, jealousy, avarice, have f their entrances and exits in-the breast; but - C these ruling emotions of the soul occupy so I large a space in the basis of all characters, c that they are usually and readily excitable Ad again under situations apparently the most t disadvantageous to their production; and a after even the fullest development, require li but a very brief suspension to recruit their d forces. But with the lesser and secondary t and artificial tastes, those associations which ti are no more than the re-action of some Si individual's peculiar constitution and talents t] Upon the taste of the age, when these have 1( Swayed the public mind for a while, and v run their epidemic couse, are felt no more a! for a long, a very long period, like measles Ii and small-pox, &c. _w.:-those who have once fallen under their contagion are no b longer obnoxious, certainly not in thi same hi degree, to the same influence.

Unimaginative pursuits have e ossified their nerves against fanciful horrors; -and arguments, cut and dried by dozens, ri for the use of youth, in disproof of ghosts, r would drive a new Mrs. Radcliffe from the a field with discomfiture; not so much would Ishe be repelled by the armour, offensite and I defensive, of mammas, or the frowns and I contempt of governesses, as by the broad stare of the pupils-aye, even the pupils of seventeen, who would not deign so much I as to smile at any body being fool enough to iImagine it was aught but a mouse bebtai the aras We assert that even the Mysteries of Udolpho would, in this age of enlightened nurseries, meet with a supercilious greeting; and undoubtedly could never dispense with those final eclaireisemens which, is our barbarous remembrances, were indeed looked upon as rudely breaking the pre. vious enchantment. How, then, will they suffer the present monsters? a ghost on horseback, amidst and close to myriads of beholders of all sizes, and ages, and sexes; now here, now there, eluding mortal grasp, and deluding mortal eye; nobles, knights, ladies, servants, monks, priests, sentinels, beset in all their paths by the importunate infernal, who solicits, as plain as gesture and unwearied perseverance can speak, their aid in bringing a murderer to justice. These worthy persons, however, one and all, are far more afraid of the secular than the spiritual arm, and not one of them has virtue or nerve to boldly help the demon in his persecution of a royal favourite. The old plea of- magic was urged against the genuineness of the ghost, and that plea alone was of weight sufficient to discredit the otherwise damning proofs of guilt afforded by the spectre. Here was a dilemma for the authoress, and she found no escpe-for, like the Egyptians of old, whatever ghost did was supposed imitable by man; but the end must come, sooner or later, and the accused lord's sudden death, and subsequent re-appearance and confession of the crime to his royal master, bring the long-resisting mind of the king to conviction, who believes, at last, with about as much reason as he had before disbe. lieved. It is needless to sketch the story. Every body has either read it, or, from the shakng head of some friend who has read it, no longer haa the wish. Descrptiow of ps- geantries occupy nearly the whole; no plot, no entanglement, no love. The question, is Sir Gaston (le Blondeville guilty of the murder or not?-it's an old murder-is the sole point, to which all is made subservient; and the reader's sympathy, coitrary to that custom which carries our hopes and fears along with the persecuted individual, goes in the present case with the persecuting ghost all the way, from frst to last, until be has fairly hunted downI his game. A glimpse-a casual flash of her olden power of description, comes here and there across the heavy monotony; the different aspects of Warwick Castle, by the setting sun, by moonlight, breathe of Mrs. Rad* cliffe again. Yet, on the whole, we gaze with unfeigned sadness upon this moinument of mental decline. All her own peculiar witchery is put to shame when the real sDrite ampeareth."

In this story a young man who has just inherited a great fortune comes from Trinidad to England to consult his father's friend on financial arrangements and the like. The friend dies just on his arrival, and he falls into the hands of the other partner in the firm. The latter, aided by a lady secretary, proceeds to exploit him, but he is rescued eventually from their joint designs; the ending is distinctly dramatic. The story is well told, and the different stages of sensational development are cleverly arranged. The character-drawing is quite as good as can be expected in a work of the kind."

REVIEWS By the ""*A?th'or of' Rienzi,' * The Last of the Barons,' &c. 3 vols. Bentley. \x will be a misfortune attending the criticism of this new, and in many respects able, work of Sir E. Bulwer Ly ton, that those who write on it?and indeed those who read it?can scarcely determine whether to treat it as history or as fiction. If as history, it is written with too much of the air of mere invention; if as fiction, it includes too many of the details ofthe chronicler*. This is an evil attending the choice of the subject,?and one which, though many have made the attempt, only one author of the class has been able in any great degree to overcome. To tbis rare, and almost wonderful, exception it is not necessary that we should more expressly refer; but we must add that even in that case the experiment, however generally successful, occasioned many important distortions and perversions of facts,?and we will venture to say that it has produced, especially in the present generation, much doubt, confusion and error as to characters, opinions, and events. These observations are in a manner challenged by Sir E. B. Lytton's dedicatory preface, and by the notes which he has placed at the foot of his page and appended to each of his volumes. They appear to set up a claim for his fiction, notwithstanding his denial of the pretension, to the dignity and, importance of history. We hold it impossible to reconcile the two satisfactorily. Either let us have a production of mere fancy, or let us have a book depending mainly on its facts and statements the value of which can be measured by ordinary and known standards. The author commences with informing us that he has abandoned thc usual course of historical narrative in his incidents:?he makes a merit of perverting what has hitherto been received in relation to the connexion between Harold and Edith. ""We admit at once that, for his purpose, he had 1 reason for making the change?because itrenders the story not merely more interesting, but on every account more readable. On this point Sir E. B. Lytton observes :?"" The love ?tory of Harold nnd Edith is told differently from the well-known legend, which implies a leis pure connexion. But the whole legend respecting the Edeva faira (Edith the fair) whose name meets us in the Doomsday Roll, rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance; and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal, but which, on many accounts, I hope, may be intrusted fearlessly to the young."" That is to wy, he made this important deviation because he did not wish to have his novel banished from drawing-room tables and the boudoirs of 'he ordinary readers of such productions. We should have complained less of aberrations of this kind if the writer had not been rather ostentatious of his authorities; from ""hich he clearly means it to be inferred that ?n all the main incidents of his story he has adhered to the most authentic representations. *e do not dispute that in many instances he lias done so,*?but we think that he has thereby rendered his work less attractive. His archae*>gy spoils his book as a fiction?just as his departures from the same injure it as history, he has thus put a curb on his imagination, both ??regardspersons and events,?and would have produced a better and more popular work had he subjected himself to none of these restraints. As it is, the old figure of a man dancing a hornpipe in fetters recurs to the reader. We may be surprised that he can do so well, thus loaded, ?but feel sure that he could have done much better, unencumbered. In fact, the author has most succeeded where he has most rejected the inconvenient restraints to which he elsewhere submitted; and those portions of his three volumes will be read with most pleasure where he has given way to the variety and gracefulness of his own fancy and the vigour and boldness of his own imagination. The description, for instance, of all that relates to the war of Harold against Gryffyth, in Wales, is unsurpassed in interest and power by anything from his pen. We will select our first specimen from this part of Vol. II.; premising that Gryffyth, his queen, and his starving followers have been shut up in a mountain fastness, and that Harold, by a monk and a young Norman, has sent them a message of mercy on submission.? "" As the monk ceased, the thrill of the audience was perceptible, and a deep silence waa followed by a general murmur, as if to constrain the King. Then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man. The red spot flushed the dark cheek, and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow. He made one stride towards thc monk, and said, in a voice loud, and deep, and slow, rolling far up the hill,?*Monk, thou hast said; and now hear the reply ofthe son of Llewellyn, the true heir of Roderic the Great, who from tlie heights of Eryri saw all the lands of the Cvmrian sleeping under the dragon of Uther. King was I bom, and king will I die. I will not ride by the bide of the Saxon to the feet of Edward, the son of the spoiler. I will not, to purchase base life, surrender the claim, vain before men and the hour, but solemn before God and posterity?the claim of my line nnd my people. AU Britain is ours?all the Island of Pines. And the children of Hengist tire traitors and rebels?not the heirs of Ambrosius and Uther. Say to Harold the Saxon, "" Ye have left us but the tomb of the Druid and the hills of the eagle; but freedom and royalty are ours, in life and in death?not for you to demand them, not for us to betray."" Nor fear ye, O my chiefs, few, but unmatched in glory and truth; fear not ye to perish by the hunger thus denounced as our doom, on these heights that command the fruits of our own fields! No, die we may, but not mute and revengeletw. Go back, whispering warrior; go back, false son of Cymry?and tell Harold to look well to his walla and his trenches. We will vouchsafe him grace for his grace?we will not take him by surprise, nor under cloud of the night. With the gleam of our spears ami the clash of our shields, we will come from tho hill; and, famine-worn as he deems us, hold a feast in his walls which the vultures of Snowdon illume their pinions to share !'*?' Rash man and unhappy!' cried the monk; 'what curse drawest thou down on thy head! W'ilt thou be the murtherer of thy men, in strife unavailing and vain ? Heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt causeto be shed.'?' Be dumb !?hush thy screech, lying raven!' exclaimed Gryffyth, his eyes darting tire, and his slight form dilating. ' Once, priest and monk went before us to inspire, not to daunt; and our cry, Alleluia ! was taught us by the saints ofthe Church, on the day when Saxons, fierce and many as Harold's, fell on the field of Maes-Garmon. No, the curse is on the head of the invader, not on those who defend hearth and altar. Yea, as the song to the bard, the cursk leaps through my veins, and rushes forth from my lips. By the land they have ravaged; by the gore they have spilt; on these crags, our last refuge; below the carn on yon heights, where the Dead stir to hear me,?I launch the curse of the wronged and the doomed on the children of Hengist! They in turn shall know the steel of the stranger?their crown shall be shivered as glass, and their nobles bc as slaves in the lund. And the line of Hengist and Cerdic shall be rased from the roll of empire. And the ghosts of our fathers shall glide, appeased, over the grave of their nation. But we?we, though weak in the body, in the soul shall be strong to the last! The ploughshare may pass over our cities, but the soil shall be trod by our steps, and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards. Nor, in the great Judgment Day, shall any race but the race of Cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth, to answer for the sins of the brave.' So impressive the voice, so graud the brow, and sublime the wild gesture of the King, as he thus spoke, that not only the monk himself was awed ; not only, though he understood not the words, did the Norman knight bow his head, as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct, flashes out from the cloud,?but even the sullen and wide-spreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment. But the spearmen and multitude above, excited by the tidings of safety to life, and worn out by repeated defeat, and the dread fear of famine, too remote to hear the King, were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators, creeping from rank to rank; and already they begun to sway and move, and sweep slowly down towards the King. Recovering his surprise, the Norman again neared Gryffyth, and began to re-urge his mission of peace. But the chief waived him back sternly, and said aloud, though in Saxon:?' No secrets can pass between Harold and me. Thus much alone, take thou back as answer:?I thank the Earl, for myself, my Queen, and my people. Noble have been his courtesies as foe; as foe I thank him?as King, defy. The torque he hath returned to my hand, he shall see again ere the sun set. Messengers, ye aro answered: withdraw and speed fast, that we may pass not your steps on the road.' The monk sighed, and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle; nnd a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there, that the King was alone in his fierce defiance. Then lifting again the rood, he turned away, and with him went the Norman."" The above, and nearly all that belongs to it, is invention,?and very admirably invented it is. We know nothing much more animating and inspiring than the whole that relates to the Cat-King (as GryfTyth is called by the Norman), his struggles, his defeats, and his suffering.*. We venture to think that Sir E. B. Lytton w much mistaken when he represents, not merely the clergy, but the young soldiers and courtiers of the reign of the Confessor as well acquainted with the literature of Greece and Rome. It is true that as regards abbots and monks he is, in compensation, very severe. He does justice to such ecclesiastics as Lanfranc and Aclred; but he makes an abbot who figures prominently in one or two scenes ignorant ofthe commonest rudiments of Latin,?while a younger brother in his company is lost in wonder at the learning of his superior. The following is a short part of their dialogue.? ""' The King's Norman favourites at least honoured the Church.'?' That is true,' said an abbot, 4 and, an it were not for two things, I should love the Norman better than the Saxon.'?' What are they, my father ?'?asked an aspiring young monk.?. 'Inprints,"" quoth the abbot, proud of the one Latin word he thought he knew, but that, as we see, was an error; 'they cannot speak so as to be understood, and I fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning.' Here was a sanctified groan:?'Count William himself spoke to me in Latin !' continued the abbot, raising his eyebrows.?' Did he ??Wonderful !' exclaimed several voices. 'And what did you answer, holy father?'?'Marry,'said the abbot solemnly, 'I replied, ""Inprinis.""'?'Good!' said the young monk, with a look of profound admiration."" We have introduced this extract by way of contrast with the learning attributed to other classes. Even of GryfTyth, the Cat-King of Wales, we are told that ""his mind had turned from the literature of Rome to the legends and songs and chronicles of his land;"" nnd other personages, both Saxon and Norman, refer to Greek and Latin authors with fur too much familiarity. Homeric fables and Homeric personages are mentioned and alluded to by the characters; and though we may be willing to admit that more learning existed among our Anglo-Saxon forefathers than has by many been supposed, yet we most seriously doubt whether it is consistent with the state of knowledge of the time to put quotations from Horace into the mouth of a young soldier,?still more, that he should employ such in conversation with a rude Saxon from the weald of Kent. Of course, what the author introduces on his own account and in his own person in the progress of the narrative is not liable to any such objection ; and whether it did or did not require to be translated in a.d. 1052, it is quite clear that Sir E. B. Lytton is of opinion that it requires to be translated in a.d. 1848,?for we cannot call to mind an instance in which he has employed a scrap of Latin where he has not done his readers the favour to render it into English. Whatever might be the case in England in the eleventh century, wo are sure that Greek was not studied in Italy even in thc thirteenth century,?and that Dante knew nothing of Homer unless at second-hand. In connexion with this matter, we may here not unfitly notice the great number of Saxon and Anglo-Saxon words employed by Sir E. B. Lytton without explanation, even where explanation seemed most necessary. If the absence of this explanation should have the effect of inducing the readers of * Harold' to make themselves in some degree proficients in the great and noble language of their remote ancestors, so much thc better ; but in the mean time it might not have been improper to have added an interpretation, in brackets or otherwise ? provided it were really necessary that the author should go out of his way to employ terms so little understood by the great body of persons to whom he addresses himself. Sometimes the context will enable the reader to guess what is meant; but generally, we think, he will be quite at a loss for the meaning. We copy a few?and but a few?regarding which, we are confident, even well-educated persons will be at some loss: ?weregeld, lithtmen, ceorl suhcendinen cyst, mane uses, dour, cnehts, quern : which, with many more, are of perpetual occurrence. We say nothing of such words as thegn, which might have been more intelligibly and less cacophonously written thane,?or of zemmes, which Sir E. B. Lytton himself seems sometimes to use indifferently with gems,?but we should like to know what is gained by the rejection of a word having the same meaning and in daily employment. The author seems to have *'crammed"" himself from Mr. D'Eyncourt's folios (as he admits in his prefatory epistle)?and then fancied that matters familiar to him must also be well known to others. This is an ordinary error. The great reputation which the author has justly acquired enables him easily to afford that such minor faults and blemishes should be pointed out. For this reason, we tell him that ne is not to suppose, because he sees in a plan of London of the middle of the sixteenth century two rings marked down for the baiting of bulls and bears, and because the sport may be mentioned by Fitzstephen, that these places existed on the same spot in the middle of the eleventh century. His mention of these rings forms part of a very interesting, but not a very accurate, description of London before the Conquest, in his first volume. The truth is, that we have no sufficient materials for such a description; and on this account we are willing to take Sir E. B. Lytton's fanciful representation,? which is highly picturesque. He is seldom at fault when he relies on himself and his own resources. One instance to the contrary may, however, be pointed out near the end of his second volume; where William, then Count? or Duke?of Normandy challenges Harold to bend his bow,?an exertion to which the Saxon noble is not accustomed, and which therefore he declines. The meaning of bending a bow is not, as Sir E. B. Lytton seems to imagine, the pulling of a cloth-yard arrow to the head after the bow has been strung; it is stringing a bow, ?an operation requiring both art and strength, and dangerous to the weak and the unskilful. Of the story itself we have said little; because the rude outline of nearly the whole of it is to be found in history?if history it deserve, at that early date, to be called. Tlie loves of Harold and Edith form but a small portion of the tale; ?and as that is the most imaginative portion, so iu several respects it is the best. The character of the heroine is delicately and touchingly drawn ; and her feminine sweetness and tenderness are excellently set off by, and contrasted with, the more masculine proportions and appearance of Hilda, her magical and mysterious grandmother,?who, from first to last, acts a very prominent part in all that relates to Harold's affection and to his ambition. She is a very grand personage, who adheres to the Saxon faith, rejecting the Christian creed, and resorts to all the solemn and awful incantations belonging to her ancient superstitious. It must be confessed that she now and then reminds us of Norna in Sir W. Scott's ' Pirate,' and of Meg Merrilies in his ? Guy Mannering'; but it is only for a moment,?and in such a manner as could not have been avoided by the author. What follows is a small part of a scene in which the two lovers and Hilda are introduced, in the second volume.? "" * There is no joy for me,' returned Edith plaintively; 'and I have that on my heart,"" she added, with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone, * which at last I will dare to speak. I reproach thee, Hilda, that thou hast marred all my life; that thou hast duped me with dreams, and lett me alone in despair.'?' Speak on,' said Hilda, calmly, as a nurse to a froward child.?' Hast thou not told me, from the first dawn of my wondering reason, that mv life and lot were interwoven with?with (the word, mad and daring, must out) with those of Harold the peerless ? But for that, which my fancy took from thy lips as a law, I had never been so vain and so frantic; I had never watched each play of his face, and treasured each word from his lips; I had never made my life but a part of his life?all my soul but the shadow of his sun. But for that, I had hailed the calm of the cloister?but for that, I had glided in peace to my grave. And now?now, O Hilda?' Edith paused, and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command. 'And,' she resumed quickly, 'thou knowest that these hopes were but dreams?that the law ever stood between him and me?and that it was guilt to love him.'?' I knew the law,"" answered Hilda,' but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird. Ye are sibbe to each other, some five times removed; and therefore an old man at Rome saith that ye ought not to wed. When the shavelings obey the old man at Rome, and put aside their own wives and frillas, and abstain from the wine cup and the chase and the brawl, I will stoop to hear of their laws,?with disrelish it may be, but without scorn. It is no sin to love Harold; and no monk and no law shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together, form and heart""?' Hilda! Hilda! madden me not with joy,' cried Edith, starting up in rapturous emotion, her young face dyed with blushes, and all her renovated beauty so celestial that Hilda herself was almost awed, as if by the vision of Freya, the northern Venus, charmed by a spell from the halls of Asgard.? ' But that day is distant,' renewed the Vaia_' What mattera! what matters!' cried the pure child of Nature; 'I ask but hope. Enough,?oh! enough, if we are but wedded on the borders of the grave!"" ?' Lo, then,' said Hilda,' behold, the sun^fthTS dawns again!' As she spoke, the Vaia stretchy her arm, and, through the intersticed columns of th fane, Edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward. Presently into the space of the eire! came Harold, her beloved. His face was pale jjiv grief yet recent; but, perhaps more than ever,diiaj.v was in his step and command on his brow, for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of Saxon England. And what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of man as the pare sense of power responsible in an earnest soul??Thon comest,' said Hilda, 'in the hour I predicted; atthe setting ofthe sun and the rising of the star.'?' Vak1 said Harold, gloomily, ? I will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies; for who shall judge of that powet of which he knows not the elements ? or despaetht marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture.'"" The earlier portion of the story is perhaps too much made up of obscure history to be very interesting; and the only incidents in the first volume that may be said really to belong to a novel consist of the return of Earl Godwin and his four sons from banishment, and the declaration by Harold of his love for Edith,?who, as we have seen, stood within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity to him. The incidents acquire a more rapid movement in the second volume,?and the interest is powerfully wound up in the third. They, therefore, who pause and look back when they have arrived at the end of 300 pages will feel dissatisfied; let them wait until they have finished the whole, and their dissatisfaction will then be that they have come to the end of the work. It is not unusual in productions of this clan to find that the person intended for the hero ii not the hero in fact. Such, in a degree, is the case with Harold. In various parts of tht story he is not so much its hero as William, Duke of Normandy, the victor at Hastings; and Sir E. B. Lytton has drawn the character of William with such force and fulness that when ht and Harold are together it is not to be disputed that William attracts more attention, if not interest, than his younger rival. We do not say that the affections of the reader are not with Harold; but the genius, the resources, the mental power and subtlety of William engross our admiration,?and would make us feel certain, even if we knew nothing historically of the issue, that he must triumph. We admit all along the courage and generosity of Harold; but, as the author tells us, his parts are comparatively slow,?and when in Normandy he was outwitted, and would have been more so, hut for the sagacity and penetration of his little nephew Haco. This may be true as history, bot it is not right as art?and here we have a particular example of the difficulties of the historical novel. We cannot go thoroughly and heartily along with any hero whom we expect to set duped, and who we know in the end will be conquered.I{AROLD, THE LAST OF THE SAXoN KINGS. In three volumes. London: Bentley. 1848. It is by no means our intention to enter into any lengthened investigation of the merits of this work, nor is it necessary so to do; Sir Bulwver Lytton is not a new aspirant' after literary honours, but, as we had long since been given to understand that he had' made his last appearance before the literary world, the present emanation from his pen naturally attracts a considerable share of attention; nor is it without good reason that this attention is excited. .The present woi k may worthily rank with its predecessors on the score of merit. Cast long back in our history, the plot unravels itself before our eyes as naturally as if it were a tale of yesterday; our author tells us he had long pondered upon the idea of founding an historical romance upon the Norman invasion, and accordingly having done so, he has rendered the subject completely his own, and has thus been enabled to present us with details minute and graphic concerning that period of our history. The auce was one fraught with interest, as being the last hours of the old Saxon mnonarchy. The legend of Harold and Edith is related, but differently to the received opinion concerning it, and this has been done out of consideration to the younger portions of the reading public, into whose hands such a work may naturally be 'expected to faUl. Superstition has much to do with the agency by which the events are brought"" about, but it would seem almost impossible to discover these superstitions from the' narratives of these times-they were believed in, thought to have a part in every action of life; so that, unless we consent to listen to the voice of superstition, we must not expect to obtain a correct idea of our Saxon forefathers. No terror is sought to be inepired by' these ghostly aids, they are simply used as valuable assistants in times of emergency. The author has succeeded in pourtraying a very beautiful character in Edith; she is firm, noble, and affectionate, loving wvith an unselfish love, that teaches her that the splendour of affection is manifested, not by basking in the enjoyment it affords, butt \where necessary in sacrificing it upon a high and holy shrine. Her love for Harold was too strong to wish to plunge him into danger for her sake, even though it brought her all she coveted on earth-the desire to be near him.. Harold is a very fine creation,' admirably sustained throughout; we may, on the whole, pronounce Harald to be one of the most striking of. Sir Bulwer Lylton's ever striking novels. There is something highly classical in the style, which tells at once of the bent of the atithor's mind, and the high and ennobling studies to which hie has been accustomed.Harold, the last ofthe Saxon Kinqa. vy Sir E. Bulwer Lytton. London, Bentley. 1i a somewhat affected and pedantic dedicatory epistle, Sir Edward flulwer Lytton informs us that this nvwel is meant to instruct the ignorant reader, as well ts to delight the mere seeker after amusement. He also threatens us with a series of similar stories, in which the earlier history of England is to be done into romance4, furnishing what lie considers genuine pictures of old English morals, men, and manners; and exposing to the ignorant eye of his fellow-countrymen the true motives and characters of the great personages who have hitherto been doomed to be described only by p)rofessed historians and chroniclers. A man more utterly inadequate to the task than the brilliant author of Pelhamn we can scarcelv conceive. That one who looks upon Pelham as a gentleman, upon The last Days of Pomopeii as a elaaical story, and upon Lucretia as a tale favourable to virtue, should also look upon himself as brmed tO somprobend the motie of th. dark and the medieval ages, is, perhaps, not a thing to create much surprise; but at the same time we cannot but regard it as a mere literary hallucination, to which we cordially trust that the public voice will give no encouragement whatever. If, indeed, the public find it half such hard work to get through the first volume of Harold as we have found it ourselves, we have small fear for the result. If they smile with us at the author's pedantry; at his amusing patronising kindness towards the simple reader; at the benevolence with which he translates a Latin sentence for the benefit of the unlearned; at the hodge-podge of old phraseology and the style of the Chroniclers, intermingled with the true Bulwerian sentiment and language; at the affectation with which dialogue and narrative is interlarded with scraps of Norman French, Saxon technicalities and names of common objects, and cant ejaculations; if they yawn with us over the author's tedious historical disquisitions, over the Ossianic raptures of Hilda, and his very lively and exciting fragments on verbal derivations, and the literary references which thickly strew his pages; if, besides all this, they can see into the secret bitter dislike of that devoted spirit of religion which, with whatever personal weaknesses, was the animating spirit of the Confessor-King, we have little expectation that the world will petition Sir Edward to continue his coquetting with the muse of history, or to turn the events of our annals into a Salmngundi of truth ard falsehood. From all this, our readers will not suppose that we have found the perusal of Harold, the last of the Saxon Kings, a very pleasant refreshment in the hot weather of July. In truth, we have toiled through its pages with a dogged perseverance; but with little pleasure, and no interest. Here and there, indeed, the story becomes more lively and brilliant; and the volumes are not without many passages worthy of the fame of its author. Especially towards the terniination, when Sir Edward drops more and more his assumed office of annalist, and writes like a man of common sense, his tale becomes more readable and life-like, until, all at once, with the beginning of some new chapter, the style of the modern novelist is laid aside, and a foolish, bad imitation of the antique cast of chronicle is thrust upon the reluctant attention. We need scarcely say that Sir E. B. Lytton's ideas of the religious principles of the time of his story are in the last degree superficial and incorrect. He writes as much nonsense about plriests, and monks, and relics, and Church-services, as the scribblers of the vulgarest tales about Jesuits and convents. His portraits of such mlen as King Edward, and his notions of the sentiments by which he was guided, are as laughable misconceptions of matters of fact as ever came forth from the pen of romancer or polemic. The scene of the monarch's death-bed is one of the choicest specimens of absurdity 'we ever were fated to read. It will please and edify our readers to see Sir Edward's ideas as to how a Christian King dies. "" The King lay for some moments silent, but evidently striving to re-collect his thoughts. Meanwhile the two arch. prelates bent over him: Stigand eagerly, Alred fondly. Then raising himself on one arm, while with the other he pointed to Harold at the foot of the bed, the King said, ' Your hearts, I see, are with Harold the Earl; so be it, je l'octroi.' At these words he fell back on his pillow; a loud shriek burst from his wife's lips; all crowded around; he lay as the dead. At the cry and the indescribable movement of the throng, the physician came quick from the lower part of the hall. He made his way abruptly to the bedside, and said chidingly, ' Air, give him air.' The throng parted, the leech moistened the King's pale lips with the cordial, but no breath seemed to come forth, no pulse seemed to beat; and while the two prelates knelt before the human body and by the blessed rood, the rest descended the dais, and hatened to depart. Harold only remained; but he had passed from the foot to the head of the bed. "" The crowd had gained the centre of the hall, when a sound that startled them as if it had come from the grave chained every footstep-the sound of the King's voice, loud, terribly distinct, and full as with the vigour of youth restored. All turned their eyes, appalled; all stood spell-bound. There mate the King upright on the bed, his face men above the kneeling prelates, and his eyes bright and shining down the hail. "" 'YYu,' he odd dellberately,'I ea ts shal be a nl vision or a fale Malon, pant me, Almigbty One, the power of speech to tell it.' He aused a moment, and thus resum_ t ' It was on the banks of t fm Sene, this day thirtyad. one winters ago, that two holy monks, to whom the gift of prophecy was vouchsed, told me of direl woes that hould all on England; ' Fer God,' said they,' after thy death, has de. livered England into the hand of the enemy, and fiends shall wander over the land.' Then I asked in my sorrow, ' Can nought avert the doom ? and may not my people free themselves by repentance, like the Nmnevites of old?' And the prophets answered, I Nay; nor shall the calamity cease, and the curse be completed, till a green tree be sundered in twant, and the part cut off be carried away, yet move of itself to the ancient trunk, unite to the stem, bud out with the blossom, and stretch forth its fruit.' So said the monks, and even now, ere I spoke, I saw them again, there, standing mute, and with the paleness of dead men by the side of my bed.' "" These words were said so calmly, and as it were so rationally, that their import became doubly awful from the cold precision of the tone. A shudder passed through the assembly, and each man shrunk from the King's eye, which seemed to each man to dwell on himself. Suddenly that eye altered in it cold beam; suddenly the voice changed its deliberate accent t the grey hairs seemed to bristle erect, the whole face to work with horror; the arms stretched forth, the form writhed on the couch, distorted fragments from the older Testament rushed. from the lips: ' Seyuelac ! Sa eac !-the Lake of Blood,' shrieked forth the dying King; I the Lord bath bent his bows the Lord bath bared is sword. He comes down as a warrior to war, and his wrath is in the steel and the flame. lie boweth the mountains, and comes down, and darkness is under his feet V' As if revived but for these tremendous denunciations, as the last word left his lips the frame collapsed, the eyes set, and the king fell a corpse in the arms of Harold."" In an earlier stage of the tale, a similarly exquisite picture of the pious monarch's proceedings is given with all our author's felicity and truth-telling correctness. Veneration for the relics of saints is, of course a fertile theme for ridicule throughout the story; aniA the poor king is painted as ready to sacrifice the lives and I appiness of living thousands for the sake of the bones of the deceased. The efforts of the writer to shew up the Confessor as a drivelling child of superstition are indeed sufficient proof of his inadequacy to the task he has undertaken. The following conversation between Edward and Harold is but one of a whole clas of passages: "" When the son of Leofric had left the chamber, the King rose wearily, and said, in Norman French, to which language he always yearningly returned when with those who could speak it, ' Beaufr~re and bin aimW, in what trifles must a king pass his life I And all this while matters grave and urgent demand me. Know that Eadmer, the cheapman, waits without, and bath brought me, dear and good man, the thumb of St. Jude. What thought of delight! And this unmannerly son of strife, with his jay's voice and wolf's eyes, screaming at me for earldoms I-oh, the folly of man ! Naught, naught, very naught I' '.Sir and king,' said Harold, I it ill becomes me to arraign your pious desires, but these relics are of vast qost; our coasts are ill defended, and the Dane yet lays claim to tour kingdom. Three thousand pounds of silver and more does it need to repair even the old wall of London and Southweorc.' ' Three thousand pounds !' cried the King; ' thou art mad, Harold ! I have scarce twice that s8um in the treasury; and besides the thumb of St. Jude, I daily expect the tooth of St. Remigius-the tooth of St. Remigius !' Harold sighed. ' Vex not yourself, my lord, I will see to the defences of London. For, thanks to your grace, my revenues are large, while my wants are simple. I seek you now to pray your leave to visit my earldom. My lithsmen murmur at my absence, and grievances, many and sore, have arisen in my exile.' The King stared in terror; and his look was that of a child when about to be left in the dark. ' Nay, nay; I cannot spare thee, beau frare. Thou curbest all these stiff thegns, thou leavest me time for the devout; moreover, thy father, thy father- I will not be left to thy father! I love him not.' ' My father,' sid Harold, mournfully, ' returns to his own earldom; and of all our house you will have but the mild face of your Queen by your aide.' The King's lip writhed at that hinted rebuke or implied consolation. ' dith the Queen,' he aid, after a sught pause, 'is pious and good; and she bath never gainsaid my will, and H bath et before her as a model the chate Susanmak, a I, u_ worthy man, from youth upward, have walked in the purk teps of Joseph. But,' added the King, with a touch of hu feeling in his voice, ' cant thou not conceive, Harold, theo who art a warrior, what it would be to see ever beore thea th face of thy deadliest foe; the one against whom all thy sM- glee of life and death had turned into memories of hyssop and gal ?' ' My sister !' exclaimed Harold, in indignant amaze. ' My sister thy deadliest foe I She who never once murmured at neglect, disgrace; she whose youth bath been consumed in prayers for thee and thy realm-my sister ! 0 king, I dream !' 'Thou dreamest not, carnal man,' said the king, peevishly. 'Dreams are the gifts of the saints, and are not granted to such as thou. Dost thou think that, in the prime of my manhood, I could havc youth and beauty forced on my sight, and hear man's law and man's voice say, ' They are thine, and thine only,' and not feel that war was brought to my hearth, and a snare set on my bed, and that the fiend had set watch on my soul ? Verily, I tell thee, man of battle, that thou hast known no strife as awful as mine, and achieved no victory as hard and as holy. And now, when my beard is silver, anrd the Adam of old is expelled at the precincts of death; now thinkest thou that I can be reminded of the strife and temptation of yore without bitterness and shame, when days were spent in fasting and nights in fierce grayer, and in the face of woman I saw the devices of Satan ? "" Edward coloured as he spoke, and his voice trembled with the accents of what seemed hate. Harold gazed on him mutelv, and felt that at last he had won the secret that had ever p~erplexed him; and that in seeking to be above the humanity of love, the would-be saint had indeed turned love into the hues of hate -a thought of anguish, and a memory of pain. The Kling recovered himself in a few momnents, and said, with some dignity, I But God and his saints alone should know the secrets ot the household. What I have said was wrung from me. Bury it in thy heart. Leave me, then, Harold, sith so it must be. Put thine earldoom in order, attend to the monasteries and the poor, and return soon. As for Algar, what sayest thou ?' ' I fear me,' answered the large-souled Harold, with a victorious effort of justice over resentment, ' that if you reject his stit, you will drive him into some perilous extremes. Despite his rash and proud spirit, he is brave against foes, and beloved by the ceorls, who oft like best the frank and hasty spirit. W% herefore some power and lordship it were wise to give, without dispossessing others; and not more wise than due, for llii father served you well.' ' And bath endowed more houses ot God than any earl in the kingdom. But Algar is no Leofric. 'We will consider your words, and heed them. Bless you, beae fr~re! and send in the cheapman. The thumb of St. Jud; '! What a gift to my new church of St. Peter ! The thumb of St. Jude ! -Non nobis gloria! #ancta Maria!The thumb of St. Jude!'"" In nil jlustice, however, we must give a quotation or two displuaying the mrore trutilt'ul and agreeable qualities of tle better parts of the story. Such an one is the scene 'whihi followvs, describing a Saxon dinner of olden da\s: "" A monk of the order of St. Benedict, then most in favour, ushered the noble visitor into the cell of the Abbot, who, after gazing at him a moment in wonder and delight, clasped him to his breast and kissed him heartily on brow and cheek. ' Ah, Guillaune,' he exclaimed in the Norman tongue, ' this is indeed a grace for which to sing Jubilate. Thou canst not guess how welcome is the face of a countryman in this horrible land ot ill-cooking and exile.' ' Talking of grace, my dear father, and food,' said de Graville, loosening the cincture of the tight vest which gave him the shape of a wasp-for even at that early 1)eriod small waists were in vogue with the warlike fops of the French continent-' talking of grace, the sooner thou sav'st it over some friendly refection, the more will the Latin sound unctuous and musical. I have journeyed since daybreak, and am now hungered and faint.' ' Alack, alack!' cried the Abbot, plaintively, ' thou knowest little, my son, what hardships we endure in these parts, how larded our larders, and how nefarious our fare. The flesh of swine salted-' ' The flesh of Beelzebub,' cried Mallet de Gravilte, aghast. ' But comfort thee, I have stores on my sumptermiules-poulardee and fishes, and other not despicable comestibles, and a few flasks of wine, not pressed, laud the saints ! from the vines of this country: wherefore, wilt thou see to it, and instruct thy cooks how to season the cheer?' ' No cooks have 1 to trust to,' replied the Abbot; ' of cooking know they here as much as of Latin; natheless, I will go and do my best with the stew-pans. Meanwhile, thou wilt at least have rest and the bath. For the Saxons, even in their convents, are a clean race, and learned the bath from the Dane.' ' That I have noted,' said the knight; ' for even at the smallest house at which I have lodged in my way from London, the host bath eourteonslv offered me the bath, and the hostess linen curious and fragrant; and to say truth, the poor people are hospitable and kind, despite their uncouth hate of the foreigner; nor is their meat to be despised, plentiful and succulent; but, pardex, as thou sayest, little helped by the art of dressing. Wherefore, my father, I will wile the time till the pomlardes be roasted, and the fish broiled or stewed, by the ablutions thou pfferaet me. I shall tarry with thee some hours, for I have much to learn.' "" The Abbot then led the Sire de Graville by the hand to the cell of honour and guestship; and having seen that the bath prepared was of warmth sufficient,-for both Norman and Saxon (hardy men as they seem to us from afar) so shuddered at the touch of cold water that a bath of natural temperature (as well as a hard bed) was sometimes imposed as a penance,the good father went his way, to examine the sumpter-mules and admonish the much-suffering and bewildered lay-brother who officiated as cook,-and who, speaking neither Norman nor Latin, scarce made out one word in ten of his superior's elaborate exhortations. "" Mallet's squire, with a change of raiment, and goodly coffers of soaps, unguents, and odours, took his way to the knight, for a Norman of birth was accustomed to much per. sonal attendance, and had all respect for the body; and it was nearly an hour before, in a long gown of fur, reshaven, dainty, and decked, the Sire de Graville bowed, and sighed, and prayed before the refection set out in the Abbot's cell. so The two Normans, despite the sharp appetite of the lay. man, ate with great gravity and decorum, drawing forth the morsels served to them on spits with silent examination; sel. dom more than tasting, with looks of patient dissatisfaction, each of the comestibles; sipping rather than drinking, nibbling rather than devouring, washing their fingers in rose-water with nice care at the close, and waving them afterwards gracefully in the air to allow the moisture somewhat to exhale before they wiped off the lingering dews with their napkins. Then they exchanged looks and sighed in concert, as if recalling the polished manners of Normandy, still retained in that desolate exile. And their temperate meal thus concluded, dishes, wines, and attendants vanished, and their talk commenced."" Such another is the story of a contest in feats of strength and skill between Duke William and Harold, when the latter went to Normandy to claim the restoration of his kinsmen, who had been hostages in William's hands. "" One day, as during a short truce with the defenders of the place they were besieging, the Normans were diverting their leisure with martial games, in which Taillefer shone pre-eminent; while Harold and William stood without their tent, watching the animated field, the Duke abruptly exclaimed to Mallet de Graville, ' Bring me my bow. Now, Harold, let me see if thou canst bend it.' The bow was brought, and Saxon and Norman gathered round the spot. I Fasten thy glove to yonder tree, Mallet,' said the Duke, taking that mighty bow in his hand, and carefully feeling the string. Then he drew the arc to his ear; and the tree itself seemed to shake at the shock as the shaft, piercing the glove, lodged half way in the trunk. ""I' Such are not our weapons,' said the Earl; ' and ill would it become me, unpractised, so to peril our English ho. nour as to strive against the arm that could bend that arc and wing that arrow. But, that I may shew these Norman knights that at least we have some weapon wherewith we can parry shaft and smite assailer, bring me forth, Godrith, my shield and my Danish axe.' Taking the shield and axe which the Saxon brought to him, Haiold then stationed himself before the tree. ' Now, fair Duke,' said he, smiling, I choose thou thy longest shaft-bid thy ten doughtiest archers take their bows; round this tree will I move, and let each shaft be aimed at whatever space in my mailless body I leave unguarded by my shield.' I No,' said William, hastily; ' that were murder.' I It is but the common peril of war,' said Harold, simply; and he walked to the tree. ""I The blood mounted to William's brow, and the lion's thirst of carnage parched his throat. ' An he will have it so,' said he, beckoning to his archers, ' let not Normandy be shamed. Watch well, and let every shaft go home; avoid only the head and the heart; such orgulous vaunting is best cured by bloodletting.' The archers nodded, and took their post, each at a separate quarter; and deadly indeed seemed the danger of the Earl, for as he moved, though he kept his back guarded by the tree, some parts of his form the shield left exposed, and it would have been impossible, in his quick-shifting movements, for the archers so to aim as to wound, but to spare life; yet the Earl seemed to take no peculiar care to avoid the peril; lifting his bare head fearlessly above the shield, and including in one gaze of his steadfast eye, calmly bright even at the distance, all the shafts of the archers. At one moment five of the arrows hissed through the air; and with such wonderful quickness had the shield turned to each, that three fell to the ground blunted against it, and two broke on its surface. But William, waiting for the first discharge, and seeing full mark at Harold's shoulder as the buckler turned, now sent forth his terrible shaft. The noble Taillefer, with a poet's true sympathy, cried, I Saxon beware!' but the watchful Saxon needed not the warning. As it in disdain, Harold met not the shaft with his sIld, but swinging high the mighty axe (which with most men required both arms to wield it), he advanced a step and clove the rushing arrow in twain. "" Before William's loud oath of wrath and surprise left his lips, the five shafts of the remaining archers fell as vainly as their predecessors against the nimble shield."" On the whole, we should say that Harold is an utter failure. Sir Edward Lytton is not the man for the task. He has not a breath of the spirit of the middle ages within his breast, and thus writes at haphazard when he would expound the motives and feelings of the personages of his story. He sees nothing of their characters and conduct but a few external peculiarities, unlike any thing that ever came across his own limited experience, and associated in his mind with ideas with which thev hand no real connexion whatsoever. He has also adopted a foolsb medley of styles of composition, which destroys the readableness ot his book as much as its incorrectness destroys its historical utility. The result is, that Harold is about as much a picture of Anglo-Saxon and Norman times, as Lord Eglintoun's gim-crack tournament was a revival of the genuine sports of antique days. Added to this, Sir Edward has been so worried by the critics of the press for the immoral tendencies of his previously publishied novel, Lucretia, that he has determined to make Harold a terribly moral (!) book, and bhas converted the connexion between the Saxon king and Edith into a pure, sentimental affection. Anmd this by way of historical accuracy.rZCTXOr. IIHrold, the Last of thie Saxon Kin lrs. B3y Sir E. If. Lo r'roN, Hart. In 3 vols. LJon(don. 184S. Bentley. IIAVING received from Sir E.

We notice the fact now, only because the present instance is a remarkable one, and to account to the author and to our readers for a brevity of notice compelled by the inconvenient circumstances under which this review is written. Harold differs materially from any other of Sir E. B. LYTTON'S fictions. It is in its design an epic, and in its composition a chronicle. The author has successfully endeavoured to combine the unity of the one with the individuality of the other. The period chosen is peculiarly adapted for an epic, whether in prose or in poetry. The catastrophe is a great historical event, gradually evolved out of the incidents that occupy the narrative. The interest rises with every chapter, and at the close becomes intense. But Sir E. B. LYTrTO.N has, in this romance, attempted much more than merely an attractive story; he has sought to embody history, to present an accurate as well as a vivid and life-like picture of the times ;-to realize them, as it were, to his readers' imagination and to his own. Hence Harold is something more than a sofa-book. It is a work for the study, and might worthily take its place upon the historical shelf in the library. So careful has been the author to preserve the strictest accuracy in the appointments of his romance, that he has adduced at the bottom of the page the authorities from which his information is taken. So laborious a work may not please the mere novel-reader so much as a flimsy creation of the fancy, but' it will be more valued by those whose approval is most valuable, and will secure for it a more lasting existence. As it is a book which wvill be read by every body, we will not attempt to anticipate their enjoyment by any account of the plot; suffice it to observe that Britons, Saxons, Normans, and Northmen, are introduced with their several distinctive characteristics, giving immense variety to the picture; and that Harold is sketched with a mastery of minute traits of character, gradually developed, which the author has not sur. passed, if lie has equalled, in any former fiction. We present one specimen only THE DEATH OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR. The King, who had already undergone the last holy offices of the church, was lying quite quiet, his eyes half closed, breathing low but regularly. He had been spechless the two preceding days; on this he had uttered a few words, which shewed returning consciousness. His hand, reclined on the coverlid, was clasped in his wie's, wbo was praying fervently. Something In tOn touch of her hand, or the sound of her murmur, stirre the King from the growing lethargy, and his ""*as oaeni, fixed on the kneeling lady. ""Ah !"" said he, netly, "" ever good, ever meek ! Think not I did ot love thee; hearts will be read yonder; we shall have our guer- don."" The lady looked up through her streaming tears. Edward released his hand, and laid it on her head as in benediction. Then motioning to the ! Abbot of Westminster, he drew from his finger the ring which the palmers had brought to him, and murmured scarce audibly--"" Be this kept in the House of St. Peter, in memory of me."" "" He is alive now to us-speak-"" whispered more than one thegn, one abbot, to Alred and to Stigand. And Stigand, as the harder and more worldly man of the two, moved up, and bending over the pillow, between AIred and the King, said-"" 0 royal son, about to win the crown to which that of earth is but an idiot's wreath of withered leaves, not yet may thy soul forsake us. Whom commendest thou to us as shepherd to thy bereaven flock ? Whom shall we admonish to tread in those traces thy footsteps leave below ?"" The King made a slight gesture of impatience; and the Queen, forgetful of all but her womanly sorrow, raised her eye and finger in reproof that the dying was thus disturbed. But the stake was too weighty, the suspense too keen, for that reverent delicacy in those around, and the thegns pressed on each other, and a murmur rose, which murmured the name of Harold. "" Bethink thee, my son,"" said AIred, in a tender voice, tremulous with emotion, "" the young Atheling is too much an infant yet for these anxious times."" Edward signed his head in assent. "" Then,"" said the Norman Bishop of London, who till that moment had stood in the rear, almost forgotten amongst the crowd of Saxon prelates, but who himself had been all eyes and ears. "" Then,"" said Bishop William, advancing, "" if thine own royal line so fail, who so near to thy love, who so worthy to succeed as William thy cousin, the Count of the Normans ?"" Dark was the scowl on the brow of every thegn, and a muttered "" No, no: never the Norman !"" was heard distinctly. Harold's face flushed, and his band was on the hilt of his ateghar. But no other sign gave he of his interest in the question. The King lay for some moments silent, but evidently striving to re-collect his thoughts. Meanwhile the two arch-prelates bent over him-Stigand eagerly, Aired fondly. Then, raising himself on one arm, while with the other he pointed to Harold at the foot of the bed, the King said-'"" Your hearts, I see, are with Harold the Earl; so be it, je l'dctroi."" At those words he fell back on his pillow, a loud shriek burst from his wife's lips, all crowded around-he lay as the dead. He recovered for a short time, andThere sat the King upright on the bed, his face seen above the kneeling prelates, and his eyes I bright and shining down the hall. ""Yea,"" he said deliberately, ""4yea, as this shall be a real vision or a false illusion, grant me, Almighty One, the power of speech to tell it."" He paused a moment, and thus resumed :-"" It was on the banks of the frozen Seine, this day thirty-and-one winters ago, that two holy monks, to whom the gift of pro. phecy was vouchsafed, told me of direful woes that should fall on England; ' For God,' said they, ' after thy death, has delivered England into the hand of the enemy, and fiends shall wander over the land.' Then I asked in my sorrow, 'C an nought avert the doom ? and may not my people free themselves by repentance, like the Ninevites of old ?' And the Prophets answered, I Nay, nor shall the calamity cease, and the curse be completed, till a green tree be sundered in twain, and the part cut off be carried away; yet move, of itself, to the ancient trunk, unite to the stem, bud out with the blossom, and stretch forth its fruit.' So said the monks, and even now, ere I spoke, I saw them again, there, standing mute, and with the paleness of dead men, by the side of my bed !"" These words were said so calmly, and as it were so rationally, that their import became doubly awful from the cold precision of the tone. A shudder passed through the assembly, and each man shrunk from the King's eye, which seemed to each man to dweeU on himself, Suddenly that eye altered in its cold beam; suddenly the voice changed its deliberate accent; the grey hairs seemed to bristle erect, the whole faWe to work withb horror; the g arms stretched forth, the form writhed on the couch, a distorted fragments from the older Testament rushed e from the lips: ""Sanguelac! Sanguelac !-the e Lake of Blood,"" shrieked forth the dying King, a ""The Lord bath bent his bow-the Lord bath e bared his sword. He comes down as a warrior to s war, and his wrath is in the steel and the flame. 2 He boweth the mountains, and comes down, and darkness is under his feet !"" As if revived but for l these tremendous denunciations, as the last word left his lips the frame collapsed, the eyes set, and the King fell a corpse in the arms of Harold. t"
9,B4172,['6717360'],"A Mortal Antipathy: First Opening of the JNew Portfolio. By Oliver Wendell Holmes. (Sampson Low.) Tbe result of Dr. Holmes's first opening of his ""New Portfolio"" is a work which? though a good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chat?must be ranked with his novels. Elsie Tenner, as everyone renumbers, was the tragical story of a girl who, in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake, inherited a twofold nature. The interest of the second story, The Guardian Angel, centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little Indian blood whioh flows in her veins. The new one, now before us, treats of a man who, through a shock in infancy, caused by a heedless girl-cousin, has become afflicted with gynophobia. For the benefit of ignorant readers, it is explained that gynophobia means ""fear of woman."" The unfortunate Maurice Kirkwood had a "" mortal antipathy "" to all young women? an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger. We are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of Arrowhead, where the village gossips (including, of course, a sagacious and benevolent doctor) make much more than a nine days' wonder of him. The book ends, if not in the most natural way possible, at any rate, in the most pleasing way, with the recovery, through a fortunate peril, of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer. Although Dr. Holmes is known to the world as a man of letters, in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards. Writing has only been his pastime. He did some scribbling, of which he is now ashamed, in early youth; and then for twenty-five years, excepting when a poem was called for, he put literature aside. In 1857 the Atlantic Monthly was started, and its then editor, James Russell Lowell, insisted on his friend becoming a contributor. The "" Breakfast Table Series "" was the result. The whole amount of Dr. Holmes's literary production is small, consisting as it does t>f little more than the series just named, the three novels, some verses, and some scientific writings. For the rest he has done good work in his own profession, and taken little part in public matters of any kind. His name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time. He is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing. His "" mortal antipathy"" seems to be of anything ""vulgar."" Thoreau once said of John Brown, "" He would have left a Greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man "" ; but I do not think Dr. Holmes could have quite excused such a lapse, and if Brown had been guilty of ill-using an ""H"" he would certainly not have forgiven him. The new novel, like its predecessors, is a study in morbid anatomy. Notwithstanding j his numerous verses Dr. Holmes is still a professional man and not a poet. The poet finds beauty in what is natural; our doctor discovers it in the abnormal. To the physiologist ""a beautiful case"" is not a case of perfect health, but one exhibiting well-marked disease. However interesting the cases exhibited by Dr. Holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects, in others they create a certain amount of disgust. Elsie Fenner is the most tolerable, because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters. In The Guardian Anyel, and still more in A Mortal Antipathy, the author's professional instincts predominate. Moreover, in the character of Elsie Venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either Myrtle Hazard or Maurice Kirkwood. Dr. Holmes's grand personages are, indeed, few anywhere. He concerns himself for the most part with small things: blunders, vulgarisms, or trivial forms of virtue. He can inform us that a person is heroic or great, but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us. The Introduction is, perhaps, the best part of the present book. In it our author gives free vent to his special humour, which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits. He can bc serious, of course, but never solemn. He is serious here, looking back to his early life. He has a few kindly words to say about Willis, who was then "" by far the most prominent American author."" It was a time of literary dearth when Willis and Griswold were bright particular stars No one now regards Willis as a great writer; but his work was good of its kind. What he undertook he did heartily; and some of it is not only still readable but is still read. Dr. Holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs, a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and tho subject of the work : ""The experience of thinking another man's thoughts continuously for along time ; of living oneself into another man's life for a .month or a year or more, is ii very curious one. No matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be, the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself, in it certain sense, on the level oi tho person whose life he is writing."" When he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on Emerson : "" For many months I havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie w;is hore in living form and feature.""' If the reading of biography is helpful, much more so is the conscientious writing of it: ""To share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker, to scan one's self in the white light of it pure and radiant soul?this is, indeed, the highest form of teaching and discipline."" Dr. Holmes's special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour. His verses havo enlivened many a social gathering, and he never presents a gloomy face to the world. Without the genius of Calverley in verse-making, and on another side, less broadly humourous than Mark Twain, he yet has a place of his own of no small importance. His range is narrow. Perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted, for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out. Indeed, his title to fame must rest finally on the "" Breakfast Table Series "" alone. Although, in these pages, Dr. Holmes is not at his best, the book does him no discredit. An author wins his laurels, if at all, before he is seventy-six. Enough, if at that time of life he does nothing to dishonour them. Dr. Holmes ?unlike some others?may still be trusted with a pen. Did he not lately revise his most famous work without trying to improve it 'i Waltek Lewin."
10,B4931,['6793468'],"Memoirs of the Comtesse de Boigne, 1781-181M.. INTERESTING MEMOIRS Edited from the original Manuscript by M. Charles Nicoullaud. (Heinemann, 10s. net.) These memoirs are exactly what memoirs should be?to be of value and interest. No attempt is made to write history; there is nothing pretentious about them, nothing dull. A great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady, whose salon in her day bad a European reputation: the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest; the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be. So she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience. "" If I had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory I should have given up my project, for I desired a distraction and not a laborious work. Hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book, but merely the chatter of an old woman. ... I regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work. I have successively used my pen to rest my needle, and my needle to rest my pen, and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair."" So writes the Comtesse de Boigne. There is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead lady's life, especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered, and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote. There is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production. Death plays too prominent a part. When the Comtesse de Boigne was fifty-four years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen, whom she had been bringing up for twelve years, and whom she loved as a mother. After this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which I had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind. ... I attempted to cheat my grief with this task, undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed. ... The following pages are the result of these efforts, and their object was to drive away the thoughts which I could hardly bear. Begun in this manner, as so many memoirs are begun, to turn the mind from brooding on calamity, the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth. And the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote; she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past; she lived, as it were, through the medium of her work. She lost the personal anguish of things, without losing her interest in life. In this way, as the brave among men and women are wont to do, she turned necessity to gain. There is sadness, too, in the history of the manuscript itself. The Comtesse de Boigne, nee Charlotte Louise Eleonore Adelaide d'Osmond, loved her name, as well she might. And she was childless. From the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew Osmond, who became the Marquis d'Osmond, to be her heir. He was ten years old in 1866 when she died. He came into the possessions which she left him in August 1881, in accordance with the terms of the will on his twenty-fifth birthday. With his intimate friend M. Charles Nicollaud, the present editor, he found the manuscript volumes; there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world. For twenty-five years they remained in the possession of M. Nicollaud, to whom the Marquis d'Osmond entrusted them. During that time death was busy among the family, and the Marquis d'Osmond himself at length died, "" The family name is extinct. The estate of Osmond has been sold piecemeal. The castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed."" But into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated. What is most apparent, is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them. Always it is the grande dame, the royalist, who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them. She makes no attempt to be impartial: she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters. Whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in London, or the last days of the Court at Versailles; or the bivouac of Cossacks in the Champs Elysees at the Restoration: whether she is describing the eccentricities of Sir John Legard, with whom her family stayed in Yorkshire, or summing up the character of such notables as Chateaubriand, or Talleyrand, or Madame de Stael or the Emperor Alexander ?her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness, which can pierce below the surface, and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar. The attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in- the Tuileries, where the ladies of the Empire met the ladies of the old Court after the return of Monsieur. There is a certain ease, a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be. Women of the other class are often shocked at this, consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts. The memoirs of a woman of this kind, who lived through all the upheavals of the Revolution, the Empire, and the Restoration, must be of supreme interest and value. The translation is good. And the notes which the editor, M. Nicollaud, has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness. The present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs. The second volume, bringing the narrative to the Revolution of 1830, is in preparation, and a third will continue the story down to the fall of Louis Philippe."
11,B898,['3193619'],"THE PETTICOAT COMMANDO, oDer Women in Secret aeryice. try jonanna Uranut. os. tmilS z noon.) This narrative of certain events in Pretoria during that exciting period between the British occupation in June, i9oo, and the proclamation of Peace two years later, must be approached from an impartial standpoint. It is written by one uncompromisingly convinced of the plenary righteousness of the Republican cause, and of the absolute injustice of British policy and methods. Nevertheles, when we have allowed for the view-point, the book is of considerable interest. It is largely from records such as this that the authentic history of the Great Doer W ar will one day ec written. The author hates healthily, ii the term may be permitted. That is to say, her rancour is seldom against the individual; even an enemy is apt to have justice done at her hands, and she does not spare the lamb when those on the Republican side are under criticism. The scene is laid at Harmony, an old, romantic farmstead on the outskirts of Pretoria. Harmony was surrounded by the British lines; nevertheless, it became the intelligence exchange between the Republican inhabitants of Pretoria and the commandos of General Botha which hovered in the vicinity. Hansie van Warmelo, the heroint, is a young woman of compelling individuality and considerable charm. The circumstance that she captured a kitten from the British lines and appropriately named it "" Mauser,"" perhaps expresses her character better than her more sensational achievements. Captain Naude, the Baden Powell of the Boers, is the hero of the tale. His exploits are thrilling enough; for instance, his visits to Hamnmony in the uniform of a British colonel, after strolling through the lines past the house of the Military Governor and being saluted by the sentries. Then there is "" Gentleman Jim,"" the Zulu who, although he could speak Dutch fluently, absolutely refused to make use of the "" Taal"" after the British occupation. Nevertheless, Jim remained faithful to his salt. We may close with this expression of the author's healthy optimism: "" the time will surely come when, in the intermarriage of our children and our children's children, will be formed a nation great and strong and purified."""

THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF SAMUEL SMILES. The name of Samuel Smiles is a household word. He is the literary hero ,with Bvron and Macaulav) of that great body which reads for instruction, because one should, and for very little reason else. All his long life he was possessed bv an intense zeal to persevere, to take pains, to win through and to persuade others to do likewise. His books awoke enthusiasm in numberless mid-Victorian hearts that now, perhaps. beat less wildly but in much more substantial and satisfactory caskets.

With a Preface by Bernard Shaw. (A. C. Fifield, 6s.) When, a few years since, a modest volume of poems entitled "" The Soul's Destroyer"" appeared, the lover of poetry who was fortunate enough to read it was justified in thinking that a new planet had swum within his ken. The book was received with a chorus of discriminating praise, and speculation became rife as to the strange and fascinating personality that lurked behind the name of William H. Davies. We learned just enough to whet our curiosity. We learned, for instance, that the new poet was a one-legged man, who lived in a common lodging-house somewhere in Southwark, that he enjoyed the munificent pension of 8s. a week, and that (most wonderful of all!) he had contrived to publish his verses at his own expense. This sounded promising ; but, like Oliver Twist, we wanted more. At length Mr. Davies has taken pity on our ignorance. He has told us the plain and unvarnished story of his life. And a marvellous record it is ! In these days incident, having deserted the region of fiction, is forced to fly to autobiography as to a welcome sanctuary. Certainly "" The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp ""?we like not the title, by the way, it is too slavishly Shavian !?contains enough adventure to fit out a dozen romances by (say) Mr. Rolf Boldrewood. Its author has tramped it up hill and down dale ; he is equally at home on the highroads of America or in the slums of our English cities. He has known the agonies of starvation, and, by dint of considerable practice, has acquired the difficult art of begging. His companions have been thieves, vagrants, and mendicants. Not since Borrow (it seems safe to say) have we had a presentment so vivid, forceful, and intimate of the inner lives of these delightful people. And the strange thing about it all is that Mr. Davies himself appears to be a man with essentially domestic instincts, a lover of the fireside and the companionship of men and books. He has gone through the world weaving his wonderful experiences into song, and with an eye always on the end of wandering?the happy haven that awaits the tired voyager. It is difficult?indeed, it is almost impossible?to quote from this volume, so full is every chapter of strange and exciting matter. But one incident in this Odyssey of a vagabond must not go unrecorded. The scene is America. Mr. Davies and a companion tramp had been found guilty of the crime of trespassing on a railroad. They were each fined five dollars by the Judge. Hot with indignation, Davies refused to disgorge a cent. The remainder must be told in his own words : Judge Stevens looked at us steadily for a time, and then asked this astounding question?"" Boys, how much are you prepared to pay?"" Brum, who had very little sense of justice, and being such a good beggar, set very little value on money, asked the Judge if he would accept three dollars from each of us. If I had been alone at this time I would have paid nothing, but to save Brum from going to prison, who I knew would support me through all, I satisfied myself that, if the Judge approved of this amount, I would pay it without further comment. The Judge appeared to weigh the matter seriously, and then cried, with a magnanimity that was irresistible, "" Pass over the dollars, boys ; you shall have a chance this time."" As a record of a life lived in defiance of all the conventional rules of our modern civilisation this volume is of priceless value. Its freshness of outlook and spontaneity of expression, together with its entire freedom from cant, make it in every sense of the term a truly remarkable production. Mr. Shaw contributes a characteristic Preface.THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JACK KETCH, WITH FOURTEEN ILLUS- TRATIONS FROM DESIGNS BY MEADOWS. EDWARD CHURTON. LONDON. IF the self-recorded lives of public men are of importance to society, as exemplification of difficulties surmounted on the high road to eminence, then assuredly the subject of these memoirs has a claim up on the gratitude of a high-spirited and intellectual people; and in thus publishing his interesting experience, it is certain he will not be the least in their esteem, although, with some of them, it is just possible that he may be the last. The appearance of this volume conveys more than is superficially apparent. Its sombre garb is typical of sorrow-the gaudy label on its back cannot cheat us into any other belief; it is the funereal glitter of a gilt plate upon a coffin-lid. No, the fact cannot be concealed, Jack Ketch is no longer what he was-no longer the bustling, active functionary-his place is not of the value of a rope'send-his occupations gone. The schoolmaster has filched his rod, and he is now on the list with titled sinecurists, and public pensioners. How, in this most unprosperous period, must his recollection carry him back to the good old Tory times, when a mighty slender qualification made a man eligible for ""Tyburn-tree ;"" when the maladroit conveyance of a two-pound note made him intimate with a halter! With what an artist-like eye, on a Monday morning, must he have surveyed the beam whereon some three or four of these fortyshilling freeholders were cooling their heels outside the debtors' door for an hour at a stretch! Those were days of business; Jack Ketch had no time to write books then - the utmost he could do was to favour his friends with a line. But sessions are long that have no endings -the functionary's friends are again in power, and Jack Ketch may hope for the results. The book is, however, a more pleasant speculation than the times, and here we find the career of the author faithfully narrated from his earliest infancy down to the period when he takes office, by succeeding his uncle to the important post of representative of the Sheriff of London. Our hero first saw the light in the "" darksome secresy of Rose and Crown Court,"" and, with an independence truly original, does not claim hereditary respectability, but says, "" Let me not mince the matter- for mincing it will not make the matter less-my father was a thief."" Ile was, however, professedly a waiter; but his napkin was not large enough to cloak his little peculiarities, and he met his fate at the new drop, kindly assisted by his respected relative. His mother, his "" sainted mother,"" shortly afterwards laid herself open to a suspicion of not "" accurately distinguishing the right of property,"" and was commanded to "" expatriate herself for life."" Here then, commences the career of our hero; virtually an orphan by the laws of his country, the entire code of which he declared open war with in his subsequent career; morc, we are obliged to confess, from his natural tastes than from pious revenge for the wrongs of his parents. It would deprive the work of half its interest with the reader were we to proceed with it in the elaborate way we could wish; we will, therefore, merely say that the intro(luction into life of the thief and the vagabond was through the appropriate medium of an attorlney's officgi-there he was introduced to some few of the choicest blackguards, in a small way, about town ; but, upon the natural event of his master absconding with the money of his "" only respectable client,""Jack was thrown upon his own resourses, and went through the degrees of pickpocket housebreaker, and common cheat, until he arrived at the dignified position in society which he now holds. The work is illustrated by Meadows, and we are enabled by the permission of the publisher, to give specimens which will speak for themselves, of the merits of the artist. This wood-cut represents the wife of Jack Ketch weeping over her dead b)ir(l-Catherine is a most masterly delineation of the author of the patient ediurance of a female tinder circumstances of the most heart-breaking wronlg and ildignity---she is the likeness of a being of every (lay life, the fidelity of which we cannot but recogiiize-omie whose affections no iiijury can abate, no cruelty subdue,-- who, without a murmur, clings to the husband of her choise through good and evil, even to death. But that part which displays the greatest kinowledge of the human mind, is an episodle calle(l the "" Confession of Johin Wilson."" Jack Ketch, in passinL (lown the Borough, sees his uncle getting off a stage-coach; he hadjust returned from some professional affair in the country, and had in his pocket a M1S., which the unifortunate, for whom he had officiated, had intruste(d to him, to deliver to the clergyman of E- . Jack goes home with his micle, and reads it aloud. This is the most striking tale that we have read for many years; ini fact, we have seen nothinjg like it since Caleb Williams-it is the philosophy of crime-the motives which are supposed to actuate the human heart to the commission of the most frightful atrocities are developed and laid bare, anid embodied in a tale of the most powerful interest. This wood-cut does the artist great credit, it represents the children of Wilson finding the knife with which he murdered his friend many years before. The little creatures bring it to their father, and the sight of it produces a revulsion of feeling, which at last occasions the crime for which he suffered. Jack's uncle one morning is discovered suspended to a beam by one of his own ropes-whether a victim to professional experiment, or occasioned by one of those fits of aberration to which minds, peculiarly constructed, are subject, must be left a matter of conjecture. Having an eye to respectability, or rather finding his own pursuits not the most lucrative, he applies for the vacant situation, which by family influence, and a nature aptitude for the profession, he at length obtains. Here he is passing his examination before the Rev. Mr. Kilderkin, the Ordinary-easily recognized as the more prominent figure-and AIr. Sheriff Hopkins, a dealer in Muscovados. His merits are apparent, and he is duly invested with the dignities of office. Let no one be prejudiced by those quidnunc critics who affect to be disconcerted by the title of a book, or fancy that a dark cover must conceal dulness. We venture to assert that there is more interest in this little volume than in all the novels brought out this season. In the' first eight or nine chapters there is wit lurking in every line, and we may truly say, that every period has its point; the continuation abounds with interesting situations, forcible delineations of character, an(l startling events-the conclusion is perfectly in keeping with the whole. Those who look further into a book than the title-page, will find a fund of entertainment they little dream of; and we sincerely recommend it to our readers as a work, that, in proportion as it is known, cannot fail to be estimated."
14,B7675,['3170211'],"NOVEL NOTES. TROOPER PETER HALKET OF MASHONALAND. By Olive Schreiner. 6s. (Unwin.) He revealed Himself unto babes. Separated from his company, and lost in the great veldt, Trooper Peter Halket dreams by his fire of the fortune he is going to make before he leaves South Africa. He does not know how, but others have done it before him, out of the Mashonas and Matabeles, or in some other vague way. His mother had had a hard struggle, but when riches come she shall have the best of times. A tall, dark man clad in a loose linen garment joins him, sits with him by the fire, and Peter, getting the better of his awe, questions the stranger, and not understanding who He may be, pours out his own history, and his crude views on white men and black. The visionary interview is bold, but it is reverent and earnest. The effect produced on readers by the Lord Jesus Christ discussing South African politics will certainly be various. Perhaps it is enough for us to acknowledge the serious purpose of this first part. The second, which describes Halket's application of his vision to the circumstances attendant on his service as trooper actively engaged against the blacks, is far stronger, and far more sympathetic. The last scenes of Halket, trooper and martyr, ignorant fool, and yet, under the influence of the light just shed on him, a saint, reckless of earthly fate, are described with a calm, restrained power which marks the highest point the writer's powers have reached as yet."
15,B4101,"['8648846', '8699414']","The Professor at the Breakfast-Table ; with the Story of Iris. By Oliver Wendell Holmes. (Ticknor & Fields; London, Low & Co.) Prenticeana; or, Wit and Humor in Paro graphs. By the Editor of the Louisville Journal. (New York, Derby & Jackson; London, Low & Co.) Miss Martineau characterized American con- versation as ""prosy, rich, and droll."" We I int have been reminded of her epithets by the I to ""Professor's"" welcome book. Dr. Holmes I?? holds a high place in the light literature of ? America. He is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists. There is a raciness in his writing ?a truth in his feeling which set him apart ""1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers >n who dress up their periods with what Mrs. j da Pringle, in Gait's ' Ayrshire Legatees,' called i he ""gum-flowers""; and who, when they most to pretend to spirits, are only the most feebly impertinent. With all this, 'The Story of Iris' approves Dr. Holmes to be an American writer.?The number of mysterious girls who figure in Transatlantic fiction is appalling.)':' Such a tribe of fine-hearted, poetical, only half- | ! understood damsels exists in no old country, not even in Germany; where young gentlewomen, "" sad as night,""?we hope not "" for very wantonness,""?toy with fancies of suicide, while they- are knitting their antimacassars,?where Lotte sitteth with her hand clasped in Jennys, during a whole coffee-visit or garden-party, in rapt indifference to the males who stream past in a cloud of smoke. "" Iris"" is j ei the Una of the boarding-house iu which the scene I ""' of this volume is laid,?Dr. Holmes, in an jl imaginary character, describing himself as also j ?' a dweller in one of those household societies j ' which, so far as we can read the riddle, imply !.. companionship without affinity?intimacy,with i 8, no real confidence. Besides the mystery of 18 "" Iris "" who keeps* a book tight locked, j b which contains some very pleasant verse, as | g we shall show,? his boarding-house contains t a more dismal curiosity,?a deformed man,? | b to whom this girl clings with the love of pity, ^ and whose bodily trials end in gradually * engaging for him the sympathy of all his com- j 5 Eanions in the house. Yet some of these are of | c omespun quality enough; for instance, the I , young man here to be introduced to the polite reader under the name of "" John"":? ""The young man, John, asked me to come up one day and try some 'Old Burbon,' which lc he said was Al. On asking him what was ! t the nmnber of his room, he answered, that it was 1i forty-'leven, sky parlour floor, but that I shouldn't | - find it, if he didn't go ahead to show me the way. I followed him to his habitat, being very willing ' to see in what kind of warren he burrowed, and j; thinking I might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity. Mighty close quarters they were where the young man John bestowed himself and his furniture ; this last consisting of a bed, a chair, a bureau, a trunk, and numerous pegs with coats and 'pants' and ' vests'?as he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons, or trousers, ?hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them. Several prints were pinned up unframed,?among them that grand national portrait-piece, ' Barnum presenting Ossian E. Dodge to Jenny Lind,' and a picture of a famous trot, in which 1 admired anew the cabalistic air of that imposing array of expressions, and especially the italicized word,' Dan Mace names b. h. Major Slocum,' and ' Hiram Woodruff nam es g. m. Lady Smith.'?'Best three in five. Time: 2.40, 2.46, 2.50.' * * I say, Governor,? broke in the young man John,?them hosses'll stay jest as well, if you'll only sat down. I've had 'em this year, and they haven't stirred.?He spoke, and handed the chair towards me,?seating himself, at the same time, on the end of the bed. You have lived in this house some time??I said, ?with a note of interrogation at the end of the statement. Do I look as if I'd lost much flesh ?? B?id he,?answering my question by another. No, ?aid I;?for that matter, I think you do credit to 'the bountifully furnished table of the excellent lady who provides so liberally for the company that meets around her hospitable board.' [The sentence in quotation-marks was from one of those dis- interested editorials in small type, which I suspect to have been furnished by a friend of the landlady's, and paid for as an advertisement.] * * It a'n't the feed,?said the young man John,?it's the old woman's looks when a fellah lays it in too strong. The feed's well enough. After geese have got tough, _' turkeys have got strong, V lamb's got old, 'n' veal's pretty nigh beef, 'n' sparragrass's growin' tall 'n' shm 'n scattery about the head, 'n' green peas are gettin' so big 'n' hard they'd be dangerous if you fired 'em out of a revolver, we get hold of all them delicacies of the season. But it's too much like feedin' on live folks and devourin' widdah's substance, to lay yourself out in the eatin' way, when a fellah's as hungry as the chap that said a turkey was too much tor one 'n' not enough for two. I cant help lookin' at the old woman. Corned-beef-days she's tolerable calm. Roastin'days she worries some, 'n' keeps a sharp eye on the chap that carves. But when there's anything in the poultry line, it Reems to hurt her feelins so to see the knife goin' into the breast, and joints comin' to pieces, that there's no comfort in eatin'. When I cut up an old fowl and help the boarders, I always feel as if I ought to say, Won't you have a slice of Widdah??instead of chicken. The young man John fell into a train of reflections which ended in his producing a Bologna sausage, a plate of'crackers,' as we Boston folks call certain biscuits, and the j bottle of whisky described as being A 1. Under j the influence of the crackers and sausage, he grew ! cordial and communicative. It was time, I thought, j to sound him as to those of our boarders who had I excited my curiosity. What do you think of our young Iris??I began. Fust-rate little filly;?ho , I said.?Pootiest and nicest little chap I've seen I since the schoolmarm left. Schoolma'am was a , | brown-haired one,?eyes coffee-colour. This one has i J got wine-coloured eyes,?'n' that's the reason they i : turn a fellah's head, I suppose. This is a splendid - I blonde, ? I said, ? the other was a brunette, I Which style do you like best ? Which do I like ' I best, boiled muttoh or roast mutton'??said the I young man John. Like ""em both,?it a'n't the ,. j colour of 'em makes the goodness. I've been kind j of lonely since schoolma'am went away. Used to like to look at her. I never said anything particular to her, that I remember, but-1 don't know whether it was the cracker and sausage, or that the young fellow's feet were treading on tbe hot ashes 1 I of some longing that had not had time to cool, b j but his eye glistened aa he stopped. I suppose she s I would'nt have looked at a fellah like me,?he said, t I ?but I come pretty near tryin'. If she had said, . Yes, though, I should'nt have known what to do ? with her. Can't marry a woman now-a-days till il ' you're so deaf you have to cock your head like a e I parrot to hear what she says, and so long-sighted y j you can't see what she looks like nearer than arnTsn j length. Here ia another chance for you,?I said, s ?What do you want nicer than such a young lady l, as Iris ? It's no use,?he answered.?I look at them d girls and feel aa the fellah did when he missed t- catching the trout. T'ood 'a' cost more butter to is cook him 'n' he's worth,?says the fellah.?Takes il j a whole piece o'goods to cover a girl up now-a-days. n I I'd as lief undertake to keep a span of elephants,? ?> j and take an ostrich to board, too,?as to marry one of 'em. What's the use? Clerks and counterjumpers a'n't anything. Sparragrass and green peas a'n't for them,?not while they're young and tender. Hossback-ridin' a'n't for them?except once a year,?on Fast-day. And marryin' a'n't for them. Sometimes a fellah feels lonely, and would like to have a nice young woman, to tell her how lonely he feels. And sometimes a fellah,? here the young man John looked very confidential and, perhaps, as if a little ashamed of his weakness, ?sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagon,?a kind of a little Johnny, you know;?it's odd enough, but, it seema to me, nobody can afford them little articles, except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything, and the folka that are so poor they .don't want anything. It makes nice boya of us young fellahs, no doubt! And it's pleasant to see fine young girls sittin', like shopkeepers behind their goods, waitin', waitin', and waitin', 'n' no customers,?and the men lingerin' round and lookin' at the goods, like folks that want to be customers, but hav'nt got the money!"" We return to the deformed gentleman, into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until Death opened the door,?that we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room, and the Professor's speculations on the same. These, if not wholly new, are neatly put, and give a fair idea of Dr, Holmes when he is bent on philosophizing :? "" I have never yet crossed the threshold of the Little Gentleman's chamber. How he lives when he once gets within it, I can only guess. His horns are late, as I have said ; often, on waking late in the night, I see the light through cracks in his window-shutters on the wall of the house opposite. If the times of witchcraft were not over, I should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises. Sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor, that makes me shiver to hear it,?it sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then. Occasionally I hear very sweet BtTains of music,?whether of a wind or stringed instrument, or a human voice, strange as it may seem, I have often tried to find out, but through the partition I could not be quite sure. If I have not heard a woman cry and moan, and then again laugh as though she would die laughing, I have heard sounds so like them that?I am a fool to confess it?I have covered my head with the bedclothes; for I have had a fancy in my dreams, that I could hardly shake off when I woke up, about that so-called witch that was bia great-grandmother, or whatever it was,?a sort of fancy that she visited the Little Gentleman, ? a young woman in old-fashioned dress, with a red ring round her white neck,?not a necklace, but a dull stain. Of course you don't suppose that I have any foolish superstitions about the matter,?I, the Professor, who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any man's bead! It is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies. A man not only believes, but knows he runs a risk, whenever he steps into a railroad car; but it doesn't worry him much. On the other hand, carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary country-village, and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago, and there are rumours of ugly spots on the walls,-the old man hung himself in the garret, that is certain, and ever Bincethe country-people have called it' the haunted house,'? the owners haven't been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noises,?so it has fallen into sad decay, and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof, and the clap-boards have turned black, and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear, and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shaking,-take the man who didn't mind the real risk of the cars to that old house, on some dreary November evening, and ask him to sleep there alone,?how do you think he will like it? He doesn't believe one word of ghosts,?but then he knows that, whether waking or sleeping, his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images. It is not what we believe, as I said before, that frightens us commonly, but what we conceive. A principle that reaches a good way, if I am not mistaken."" Here are some verses out of the book of "" Iris,"" which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic:? UNDER THE VIOLETS. Her hands are cold; her face is white; No more her pulses come and go; Her eyes arc shut to life and light;? Fold the white vesture, snow on snow, And lay her where the violets blow. But not beneath a graven stone, To plead for tears with alien eyes; A slender cross of wood alone Bhall say, that here a maiden lies In peace beneath the peaceful skies. And gray old trees of hugest limb Shall wheel their circling shadows round To make the scorching sunlight dim That drinks the greenness from the ground, And drop their dead leaves on her mound. When o'er their boughs the squirrels run. And through their leaves the robins call. And, ripening in the autumn sun, The acorns and the chestnuts fall, Doubt not that she will heed them all. For her the morning choir shall sing Its matins from the branches high, And every minstrel-voice of spring That trills beneath the April sky, Shall greet her with its earliest cry. When, turning round their dial-track, Eastward the lengthening shadows pass, Her little mourners, clad in black, The crickets, sliding through the grass, Shall pipe for her an evening mau. At last the rootlets of the trees Shall And the prison where she lies, And bear the buried dust they seize In leaves and blossoms to the skies. So may the soul that warmed it rise! If any, born of kindlier blood, Should ask, What maiden lies below? Say only this: A tender bud, That tried to blossom in the snow, Lie3 withered where the violets blow. A fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round tho breakfast - table of the Transatlantic Mrs. Todgers, or to reveal what untied the knot, and cleared up the mysteries of the boarding-house. The book will not be read for its narrative; but it may be taken up again and again, and its pages paused over, for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain. Mr. Prentice is a humorist of a different kind from Dr. Holmes. He is a painfully diffident American editor, one of a class distinguished for their modesty. For something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers; living thus before the public in the columns of those journals. He has collected them all?to forestall others in doing so,?not because he thinks such collections praiseworthy, at least by other men. Some of them, he says, made the Louisville Journal famous, or at any rate notorious; and were exceedingly offensive to individuals, whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature. One merit of the collection in Mr. Prentice's eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own,? original, ? representing the editor himself. Thus he embalms, as it were, some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity. American museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the Yankee Yorick, or lend it out to evening parties, as was done with that of George Frederick Cooke; but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of Prentice's head and its contents, when he was young. Of the more youthful head, with its quips and sharp sayings, PrenticeYorick is manifestly proud, albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing. The world had its Menagiana after the wit was dead, and half a hundred other Anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed. Now-a-days, the initiation has been made in the States for a man to read his own Ana, set up his own statue, chiselled by himself, burn incense to and under his own nose, and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic Figaro, "" Que les gens d'esprit sont betes I"" In all the Anas hitherto published, the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine. The flashes are those of a thunder-cloud; the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning, ? spontaneous; bright effects of natural causes,?words that burn, titterings among contending wits, where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains, and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest. Not of these are the Prentice sayings. They were composed or invented by elaborate process, ?the joke not being the consequent ot' a pre- cedent, but this latter being made for the sake of the former. Thus Mr. Prentice gives us, frequently, only bottled lightning. He maintains, nevertheless, with all the pertinacity of Dennis, that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august Louisville Olympus. "" To express a thought, or a fancy, or a conceit moro conveniently,"" says the trans-oceanic joker of jokes, ""I have put the words into the form of a dialogue, purporting sometimes to be between two politicians, sometimes a man and his wife; but such paragraphs are not less my own, nor less original, than the rest."" Mr. Prentice's own description will thus best characterize the manner of his wit. Give him his time?only let him think?and at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible, if you will only have patience ! This process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent; and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve "" his 'prentice han'"" in this respect, we cannot do better than refer him to the ""Guepes"" of M. Alphonso Karr. Bad, however, as some of these jokes are, that same ""'prentice han'"" is not altogether unskilful?though thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master. The following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work, and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith. Here are half-a-dozen of the smart things whichthe author deems worthy of handing down to posterity:? "" The editor of the-asks if he shall write our life. Exactly as he pleases. Perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura, as iu living such a one as his own."" "" The Louisville Democrat announces the melancholy fact that Gen. Cass has been slain ' by the jawbone of an ass.' Does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death?"" '' A lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses, but she shouldn't break the peace."" "" The earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman; and yet, at one season, he always harrows her bosom, and at another plucks her ears.*' "" An editor in the West boasts that his enemies will find him ' a young David.' Very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaim?Goliar."" ""Several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of Mt. Vernon. Ah, ye miscreants, the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon Washington's.'' "" We know a beautiful girl, who would prove a capital speculation for a fortune-hunter of the right sort. Her voice is of silver, her hair of gold, her teeth of pearl, her cheeks of rubies, and her eyes of diamonds."" The playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality ; for instance :? "" Yesterday the junior editor of the Democrat called upon the senior editor of the Journal to welcome him back to Kentucky. The senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chair?full grown, minus two legs?to sit in ! To sit in! To tumble out of! which he did without an effort. No bones broken, andmatters compromised.?Louisville Democrat. Well, you and the chair had four legs between you, which certainly should have been enough to stand upon. If you insist that we gave you the fall, you must at least admit, in justice to our magnanimity, that we didn't hit you after you were down."" These folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling:? "" The editor of the New Hampshire Patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives. Ah, yes; but, when he dies, will not the fat be all in the fire!"" ""The editor of the-says he almost scorns to deny our charges, 'they are so utterly ground- less.' We believe he generally scorns to deny ' groundless' charges. He prefers confining hima^f to the denial of true ones."" "" The editor of the SouUiern Democrat wants to know what makes us so smart. If we are smart,, it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid ?cant help it."" ""A democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down. No doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well."" The subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented joke,?where there is a lack of truth as well as of wit:? ""An English paper says that a superbly oma* mented whip was one of the presents made to the Princess Royal of England on her late wedding-day. We are not told whether the bridegroom, upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride, looked scared or not. The richest part of the whip was the butt?so we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either."" There are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the Republican wit for the unchivalrous Irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour. Here are some of them:? ""John Mitchel says, in his Southern Ciiizen,thsX this country ' needs a rattling war.' She certainly does not need any more rattling Irishmen."" ""John Mitchel, the Irishman, is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the Hon. John Bell in the U.S. Senate. He is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with Macbeth, 'stop that dreadful Bell.'"" We thought the quotation was from 'Othello'; but they have probably a new Shakspeare in Louisville. The sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words. Again:? "" John Mitchel, who made his escape from Botany Bay, should remember that wheu he abuse* fugitive slaves, he abuses himself."" "" John Mitchel is by this time in Europe. We are rid of him. If he could have had his way, we should Ijave been rid by him."" The ladies, of course, come in for a large share of our wit's notice :? "" The more our ladies practise walking, the more graceful they become in their movements. Those ladies acquire the best carriage who don't ride ia one."" ""A graceful correction.?'The proper study of mankind is woman'?Punch. Woman is certainly wonderfully constructed; we have always loved to study her and get her by heart. Our first lessons were delightful, but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive."" ""A Kentucky editor says that among other presents, the ladies have sometimes given us scissors. Oh, yes, some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors, accompanying the gift with the old motto?' we part to meet again.' Let those beware who, like our ugly neighbour, would come between."" "" A Miss Way advertises that she will debate woman's rights with a Kentucky lawyer in that city, after which she will make a grand balloon ascension from Congo Square.?Exchange. Does she propose to take the Kentucky lawyer up with her? Or does she mean to throw him sky high in the argument and then go up after him in her balloon?"" ""Brigham Young says, in one of his late manifestoes, that' the great resources of Utah are her women.' It is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi* resources."" The last of the half-dozen, and the concluding maxim in the book, may be profitably read on both sides of the water:? "" Oftentimes the ' fastest' young women an th* most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption."" With these specimens of the Prenticeana, our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean, and how it is appreciated by the maker of it. We will only add, that he has annexed a very great number of "" Joe's,"" committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general, ready to take all that is worth having, and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers.The Poet of the Breakfast Table. SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1872. LITERATURE By Oliver Wendell Holmes. (Routledge & Sons.) We have had the Autocrat and the Professor, and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the Poet, and again instructs the world, and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour. We cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded. It would have been as well, perhaps, to have ended by a grand display of fireworks; but the Poet, like the Autocrat and Professor, has his own way with his own means, and ends tranquilly. The Breakfast-Table Series is now complete. Its fault is its extreme length. The Poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closely-printed pages of prose and verse. If he leaves pleasant memories, they are also somewhat confused. ""Ne quid nimis"" is as useful a maxim as ""Pas trop de zele."" The Poet gives us too much of one thing; and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely, that such excess is good for nothing, he leaves, with his memories of pleasure, sensations of fatigue. There are fourteen persons at the Breakfast Table. The opposite ends are occupied by the Landlady and the Capitalist. On one side are the Poet, the Scarabee (a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined), a Man of Letters, a Master of Arts, a Young Girl (who writes stories for periodicals, and who is called Scheherazade), and ""the Lady."" On the other side are Dr. B. Franklin (no connexion with the older owner of the name), the Astronomer, the Member of the Haouse (as the Legislator calls himself), the Registrarof Deeds, the Salesman, and That Boy. The last-named is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community. He turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted; though, perhaps not so often as he is wanted, and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden pop-gun when people are getting prosy, which, whether it gives forth only a report, or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull, is entertaining and neverintrusive ?quite the contrary. In this company, the Poet speaks as he likes, and makes his companions speak after the same fashion?that is to say, after his own humour, and not according to their own natures. They are, however, not out of character ; but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself, he is, of course, not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries. The Poet, nevertheless, is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings, and with doings to match. The following are among very numerous examples :?"" It ain't just the thing to grease your ex with the ile of vitriol; the wheel of progress will soon stick fast, if you do."" Again : "" It is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle. Cotton Mather was miserable all his days, I am afraid, after that entry in his diary, ' This day, Dr. Sewele was chosen President, for his piety.1"" We may observe, by the way, that there are two prejudices which seem immortal. Americans believe that there are no hs in England, and Frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs ! However, we could match the good-looking Landlady of the Poet's boarding-house, from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out, ""with an unmistakable expression, conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood, to the effect that while there is life there is hope.'' The daughter of this lady is quaintly said ""to have married well to a member of th*3 postmedical profession, that, namely, which deals with the mortal frame, after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave."" Among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the Order of Things, and who remarks, "" I hope to do some sound thinking in Heaven,?if I ever get there !"" Fanciful, too, is the division of one-story, two-story, and three-story intellects. The first is described as a fact-collector, and nothing more; the twostory men are those who compare, generalize,? and reason; but the three-story individuals are men of imagination, and are far-sighted. They have skylights over their miuds, through which illumination reaches them from Heaven. The ground-floor men have only stores of books, and cannot be said to know how to use ?further than lending?them. We approve of the Old Master's criticism on returning from a concert, although it seems to have been borrowed. ""I don't like your chopped music, any way. That woman, ?she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societies?Florence Nightingale, ?says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks, and the music you jpow/ieZ out isn't. Not that exactly, but something like it. I have been to hear some music pounding."" After describing the concert, with much humour, he adds:?"" 'I like to hear a woman sing, and I like to hear a fiddle sing, but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvils!?don't talk to me, I know the difference between a bull-frog and a wood-thrush, and?' Pop! went a small piece of artillery. . . . That Boy was in his seat, looking demure enough!"" The Master refers to a ""line of anxious and conscientious effort, which I saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us; the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our Great Organ,?that Himalayan home of Harmony which you are to see and then die, if you don't live where you can see and hear it often."" There is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests; namely, "" I thank God that a great many people believe a great deal more than I do. I think, when it comes to serious matters, I like those who believe more than I do better than those who believe less."" There is no doubt that this is a general feeling. We endorse the sentiment, as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words : "" It is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs, if he does it so that others may make anything out of it. If he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists, he may as well let it alone."" In quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the Breakfast Table, we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water. Nevertheless, the smoothness, polish, and cleanliness of the pebble, after all, indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly, and that it may be good to taste now and then, but not altogether to drink by pailfuls, or to live upon, to the exclusion of other liquids. The character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the Young Girl, who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper, the Weekly Bucket, ""which has no bottom, and it is her business to fill it."" The poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions, passions, mysteries, plots, and graces of style, in stories always ending and always beginning, for the wages of a maid-of-all-work, and no recognition or thanks from the public :? "" Poor little body! poor little mind ! poor little soul! She ia one of that great company of delicate, intelligent, emotional young creatures who are waiting, like that sail I spoke of, for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms, ?love, the right of every woman,... and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench, a chain to fasten them to it, and a heavy oar to pull day and night."" The Poet thinks the toiling Scheherazade of the Weekly Bucket never had a lover, "" or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion "" as she does in a ""fantasia"" from a story of hers, 'The SunWorshipper's Daughter,' which she wrote for the Bucket. Here is a sample :? Kiss mine eyelids, beauteous Morn, Blushing into life newborn ; Lend me violets for my hair, And thy russet robe to wear, And thy ring of rosiest hue Set in drops of diamond dew ! Kiss my lips, thou Lord of Light, Kips my lips, a soft Good Night: Westward sinks thy golden car, . Leave me but the evening star, And my solace that shall be, Borrowing all its light from thee ! We may now rise from the Breakfast Table, leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at that well-furnished board."
16,B7698,['6848974'],"The Later Years of Catherine de Medici. REVIEWS CATHERINE DE MEDICI By Edith Sichel. (Archibald Constable and Co.) This is an eminently readable, if not a very valuable, book. Miss Sichel frankly admits in her preface that she has made no discovery of an actual fact, and has detected no error in accepted dates. She has sought to paint the portrait of Catherine de Medici as she sees her with such other persons in the drama as were interwoven with her destiny. She says : Here in Paris, near the Louvre, beneath the window whence Catherine gave her fatal signal on the eve of St. Bartholomew . . . . or near that other window which looked out upon the fast-crimsoning Seine .... it is easier to feel the full force of the old conceptions which divide us from the past. In fact Miss Sichel's book is an effort at evocation of a somewhat impressionist kind, in which the temperament of the artist and the milieu in which she works play influential parts. But surely it has now been decided for some time past by competent historical authorities, that the window of the Louvre overlooking the Seine which tradition has associated with the early phases of the St. Bartholomew massacre, considerably post-dates that tragic event. For the sake of a picture, however, the most vivid details are sure to be selected, and not those only the authenticity of which is beyond a doubt; and this makes the kind of portraiture which Miss Sichel practises of small worth to the student, and even misleading in certain cases. But. the. method has a value of its own. It supplies the general reader with broad general ideas about important phases and interesting personages of past history. It gives him more than does the historical novel, and probably informs his mind more effectively than an accurate historical study could do, to the appreciation of which, qualities of mind which are not exactly common and a certain intellectual training are indispensable. There is a danger, however, that the colouring of the picture may be overdone, that the perspective may be false. It is rare for a woman who writes around history to write without prejudice. Men historians often enough fall into the same fault, under the influence of political and religious bias. But with women it seems impossible to avoid it. Women are born into the world to love, and love always entails hate. Miss Sichel is not far from hating Catherine de Medici and the age of the Renaissance in which she lived. She writes : The Ligue was the counterpart of Catherine. We have compared it to the great French Revolution, but there is this vital difference between the two. The Revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an Idea; it was the beginning of an era.The death of Catherine closed an epoch, with her died the age of the Renaissance. And with the reign of Henry IV. there came the dawn of modern times.It was the destiny of Catherine de Medici to imbibe the poison of either influence [that of the Reformation and that of the Renaissance]. From the Reformation she derived its abuses?its degradation of religion into politics, its gross polemic materialism, the more pernicious for priestly vestments. From the Renaissance she inhaled its stagnant Paganism, its cold curiosity, its stupid blindness to aught but the senses, its foolish worship of a golden calf set up in a boundless wilderness. Such were the miasmic fumes that she absorbed, and breathed forth again to blight the world she lived in. There are deadlier poisons than those that lurk in perfumed gloves; there is a deadlier death than that which these deal to men. It is the death of the ideal, of faith in man, of faith in anything outside him. These were the real murders of the women accused of scores of others. History provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists, but sometimes, unconsciously, it reveals to us certain moral laws. It is a medium for them, not a pulpit. If any person, any age, is doomed for its sins to forfeit the meed of immortality, that age is the reign of the last Valois?that person is Catherine de Medici. Most, if not all, of this is fustian?little better indeed than sheer nonsense. In the first place, it is highly dangerous for any writer of history to talk so glibly of eras, epochs, ages, and modern times. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an era, an epoch, an age, or modern times. With every minute that goes by the Middle Ages, for instance, are getting further and further away from the middle, assuming?which is, of course, not the case? that there can possibly be a middle to that which has no known beginning or knowable end. To tell us that the Revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an Idea is to tell us nothing that has any precise meaning, and if Miss Sichel imagines that any new ideas were given birth to by the fact of the French Revolution she is assuredly mistaken. If anything deserves to be called stagnant it was the pseudo-classical conception of freedom which predominated in the minds of the leaders of that inhuman movement?a pseudo-classicism which, by the way, achieved, among other things, the complete destruction of the art of painting in France?at any rate for the present?a curious result which is worthy of more attention from historians than it has received, especially as it is highly typical. The ""gross polemic materialism of the Reformation, the more pernicious for priestly vestments,"" is unfair to a highly complex movement, one of the strongest motives of which lay in the fact that the invention of printing had weakened the raison d'etre of the older ecclesiastical symbolism. To accuse the Renaissance of ""stupid blindness to aught but the senses"" is far too sweeping a charge, and indeed a stupid one. Whatever its faults and deficiencies may have been, the Christian world owes to the Renaissance an immense debt. To say that Catherine de Medici murdered the ideal and the faith in man (which he has never been without, as far as what we know of his history enables us to judge) is to give that good lady, who had her commendable points, an importance which she never possessed, and surely neither she nor her age will be bereft "" of the meed of immortality,"" with Miss Edith Sichel on the spot precisely to ward off this tragic and quite undeserved contingency. History, she says, provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists. But she contradicts this when she writes a few lines higher up on the same page, which is her last: Yet, although for long men did not know it, they were? are?making towards a common goal and using a common watchword. That watchword, that goal, is freedom. ""Making"" f or "" moving "" is a slang expression, but is not this just the theological text which history does supply to the conscious moralist ? Of what use is the historian, any way, if he is not to be a conscious moralist, with history, or as much as he can find out about it, as his text, which is a theological text into the bargain ? For the moral to which it constantly points is the divine triumph in the long run of Good over Evil; and in that conclusion we are entirely, we think, in accord with Miss Edith Sichel."
17,B6624,['6849770'],"SHORTER .REVIEWS Vagabondage: Being the Intimate Autobiography of a I Natre's Nomad. By J. E. PATTERSON. (William Heinemann. 8s. 6d. net.) THERE are some natures to which romance is as the breath of life. Mr. Patterson's is one of them. - From his cradle until the present day the author's life has been that of a rolling stone, and the amount of moss which it appears likely to gather until the time when it comes finally to rest is a negligible quantity. But rolling stones sometimes gather something better than moss, and we have before us an instance in the present work-full of much hard-won wisdom, offering many a glimpse into phases of humanity strange to the majority of us, and fraught with not a little pathos ever and anon. The author has throughout his life been gifted with an astonishing knack of dodging death and a no less remarkable aptitude for sitting down and composing a dozen stanzas upon the spot to celebrate the occasion. Among the many which appear in these pages we think those addressed ""to certain Critics and Improvers of 'the Mermaid ""' are perhaps the most happily conceived. Mr. Patterson's road through life, whether high or low, has been undeniably rough, and the incidents thereof he tells with uncommon freshness and force. Probably few children ever survived such a wayward and adventurous childhood, or, having survived, so thoroughly cheated the gloomy prognostications of infallible prophets. Nailmaker, miner, deep-sea fisherman, able-bodied seaman, reporter, journalist, poet-such are a few of the callings successively, and more or less sucessfully, pursued by this versatile genius. And what though his Pegasus cast a shoe now and again P The consequent lameness but serves to show that the steed is something more substantial than a fleeting vision. In this book we find presented to us the living apotheosis of the penny ""dreadful."" Here is a real boy who sees real ghosts-nay, more, feels them-runs away to sea, has hair-raising experiences in a. god-house, fights with pirates-in fact does all that the penny ""dreadful"" ascribes to the youthful genius of its pages. But the toughest proposition that our hero struck was the publishers. For some unfathomable reason those ogres refused to play the fairy godmother to Mr. Patterson's literary productions. The loss of course was theirs. As for the critics-well, one is on dangerous ground, and must tread softly, like Agag, or suffer a fate similar to that of the unfortunate monarch. At length the unpublished author learnt the fell secret, and the sun of his literary fortune rose in dewy splendour, we trust not to set for many a long day. In case the eyes of any other struggling genius should light upon these pages, we feel in duty bound to give away Mr. Patterson's little secret; and it is this: Advertise, advertise, advertiseWhether Bibles, or whiskey, or pies, Cathedrals or huts, or political lies. Remember this well, Whatever you sell, New ways to heaven Or old ways to hell, Advertise, advertise, advertise, Or you're sure to be left to the flies."

WNhat Elizabeth Banks has not done I am sure I do not know, except tiat I am sure she has never done anything dishonour-ib:e, mean, or unworthy of her sex or her 1rofession. She h-ts had a wide and v'aried experience, and has gone through many journa istic adventures, both in the Old World and thl_ New.

She macil hlr /de'bu characteristically enough 1) writing a letter to the Times, which aatracted general attention on account of the vivacity with which it was written, and ever since th it time she has managed to keep herself very much in evidence both in English magazines and English newspapers. It has been a knock-about life, and one which is enough to ,wear the flesh off her bones, not that she has ever ha-l n;-mch surplus of that commodity to begin with. But on the whole, despite all her worries and anxieties, she has ""'he Autobi graph)y lfa Nev-.pal-pe( (;i.' 1By Mlis Ei .be h a-rks. Lo:duan Mte:hu.n at.d Co.

She is a quaint girl, with a humorous outlook upon society, a genuine Amcrican readiness to turn her hand to anything that is going, and an unsatisfied ambition to write a great novel. Pending the arrival of this unwritten romance, which is to be written with her heart's blood and illustrated with studies from the life of two continents, we have this book, ""The Autobiography of a Newspaper Girl."" In its twenty-eight chapters we have a good deal of her life-story, with her experiences in American newspaper offices and her adventures in London. In the chapter "" In the Name of Christ "" she ventures to blow off a good deal of natural and not unjustifiable indignation against an eminent American wooman who posed as zealous in all good works for the rescue of the unfortunate, and who ruthlessly turned a pretty governess into the streets of New York close upon midnight because she discovered that many years before she had loved not wisely but too well. This monster's motto was "" In the name of Christ,"" and Miss Banks has fixed it to the chapter in which she speaks her mind a piece "" on the subject. Note as an interesting,, fitct that the Americ in publisher refused to allow this chapter to appear in the American edition. Miss Elizabeth Banks is a kind of latter-dav miracle 'If the burning- bush, all fire and flame, and yet the bush is not consumied. She has been through the storni and stress of Newv York journalistic experience, and yet she hats maintained her self-respect and commii-ianded the respect of all those by whom she was employed. It is not surprising that, surveying her own experiences, she should frankly record her conviction than many woomen had much better die right out than expose themiselves to the fierv ordeal of being compelled to execute anv commission that may occur to the morbid inmagination of an editor, or 'lose their post. 'The Autobiography of a Newspaper Girl ' is a book which might be reald with advantage by all newspaper girls and all who have any ambition to be newspaper girls. I congratulate Miss lBanks upon her success, aid cordially wish hber still more success with her forthcoming novcl."
19,B3912,['9451664'],"The Old Home. By Gerard Bendall. (Alston Rivers.) IT is difficult to understand whether Mr. Bendall has written his book as an elaborate joke, or whether he is serious. If it be a joke, it is rather ponderous and lengthy. If it be seriously designed, it is an amazing production. The characters in it move and talk as if they were in the pages of Miss Austen, but they entirely lack the reality of her figures. There is a great deal of kissing in the book and a good deal of talk about marriage. The husband of one of the characters dies, and two months later another character says to the widow: "" It may be that you have wondered that, as our relations and companionship were so happy, I have not proposed marriage before this"" ! There are even more astonishing sentiments than this."

A youth, who appeared a year or two older,stepped forward and saluted Ralph as bis uncle. ** * Oh,'growled Ralph, with an ill-favoured frown, ?you are Nicholas, I suppose?'' * 'That is my name. Sir,' replied the youth. ** * Put my hat down,' siid Ralph, imperiously. *Wi*ll, ma'am, bow do you do? You must bear up against sorrow, ma'am ; I always do.' ** * Mine was no common loss!' said Mrs. Nickleby, applying ber handkerchief to her eyes. *? ? It was no 'o'connnon loss, ma'am,' returned Ralph, as he coolly unbuttoned his spencer. * flus, bands die every dav, ma'am, and wives too.' ** * And brothers also, ""Sir,' said Nicholas, with a glance of indignation. ""' Yes, Sir, and puppies mid pug-dog? likewise,' replied his uncle, taking a chair. ' Von didn't mention in your letter what my brother's complaint was, ma'am.' "" 'The doctors could attribute it to no particular disease,'said Mrs. Nickleby, shedding tears. * Wo have too much reason to fear that bc died of a broken heart. **' Pooh !' said Ralph,' there's no such thing. I can understand a man's dying of a broken neck, or mi Henna: from a broken arm, or a broken head, or a broken leg, or a broken nn.-o; but a broken heart? nonsense, it's the cant of the day. If a man can't pay his debts, lie dies of a broken heart, and his widow's a martyr.' j ""' .Some people, I believe, have no hearts to break,' j observed Nicholas, quietly. j **' How old is this Iwiy, for God's ?ake .' inquired Ralph, wheeling hack hi* chair, and surveying his, nephew from head to foot with intense scorn. '""Nicholas is \iry nearly nineteen,' replied the widow. "" * Nineteen, eli !' said Ralph, ' and what do you mean to do for jour bread. Sir?' ?*' Not to lise upon my mother,' replied Nicholas, bis heart swelling a*, he spoke. "" ' You'd have little tuouidi to live upon if you did.' retorted the uncle, eyeing him contemptuously. ??'Whatever it be.' said Nicholas, Hushed with anger, ' I shall not look to you to make it more.'

"" * Nothing,' replied Mrs. Nickleby. ** * And you spent what little money you bad, in coming all the way to London, to see what I could do for you?' pursued R-Uph. '*' I hoped,' faltered Mrs. Nickleby, 'that you might have an opportunity of doing something for your brother's children. It was his dying wish that I should appeal to you in their In-half.' "" ' I don't know how it is,' muttered Ralph, walking up and down thc room, ' but whenever a man dies without any property of his own, he always seems to think he luis a right to dispose of other people's. What is your daughter fit for, ma'am ?' *' Kate has been well educated,' sobbed 31rs. Nickleby. 'Tell your uncle, my dear, how far you went in french and extras.' "" The poor girl was about to murmur forth something, when her uncle stopped her very unceremoniously. "" "" We inu-t try and get you apprenticed at some boarding-school,' said Ralph. ? You have not been brought up too delicately fur that, I hope?' "" ' No. indeed, uncle,' replied the weeping girl. * I will try to do anything that will gain me a home and bread.' "" ' Well, well,' said Ralph, a little softened, either by bis niece's beauty or her distress (stretch a point, and say the latter). * You must try it, and if the life is too hard, perhaps drcs3-making or tambourwork will come lighter. Have you ever done anything, Sir?' (turning to his nephew.) "" * No,' replied Nicholas, bluntly. "" * y>n, I thought not 1' said Ralph. 'This is the way my brother brought up his children, ma'am.' '?' Nicholas bas not long completed such educacation as his poor father could give him,' rejoined Mrs. Nickleby,' and he was thinking of?' '?"" Of making something of him some day,' said Ralph.

The eye he bad was unquestionably useful, but decidedly not ornamental, being of a greenish grey, and in shape resembling the fanlight of a street door. The blank side of his face was much wrinkled and puckered up, which gave him a very sinister appearance, especially when he smiled, at which times his expression bordered closely on the vitiations. His hair was very flat and shiny, save at the ends, where it was brushed stiffly up from a low protruding forehead, which assorted well with his harsh voice and coarse manner. He was about two or three iind titty, and a trifle below the middle size; he wore a white neckerchief with long eads,andasiiit of scholastic black, but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long, and his trousers a great deal too short, he appeared ill at ease in bis clothes, and as if he were iu a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable. '* Mr. Squccrs was standing in a box by one of the coffee-room fire-places, titted with one such table as is usually seen in i-otfee.rooms, and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition.

The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickltby. Bv Charles Dickens. Chapman and Hall. Great success is a thing as little understood in literature now-a-d.iys, as great failure. The tut issi-\ mus ibis is found in the old place. The sale of the Pickwick Papers was very generally held to be in the nature of a bookselling curiosity, and when a j career as prosperous was foretold for a new work of; the same extent by the same hand, wise people j shook their heads and said it was impossible. It has been proved possible, notwithstanding. The sale of Nicholas Nickleby is understood, even thus early, to have exceeded by many thousands that of l\\*' Pickwick Papers. Without entering on the question of how far such a circumstance should be taken as a test of genius or even of talent, it establishes tho claim of thc work to critical consideration on the highest grounds, and with reference to the best models. We propose in this spirit briefly to examine its pretensions to rank with thc enduring fictions of our language. Since Richardson published in successive portions his famous story of Clarissa Har lo we. ami enthusiastic damsels, eager for the conversion of Lovelace, besieged and implored the author, as for a living sinner whose future state depended on thc decision, to "" save his soul alive,"" no characters of an unfinished1 work of fiction have excited anything like the interest manifested by large classes of persons in all ranks f^r tbe fate of the various actors in the tale of Nicholas Nicklcby. The Cibbers of that day, after "" a delicious meal of Miss Byron '* in one volume, were not more anxious for "" another slice of herein the next, than the Cibbers of our own, after regaling themselves with a Squeers, or a Smike, or a Newman Noggs, or a Vincent Crummies in number six, have been for other slices of them in number seven. This shows us, at the outset, a great secret of the popularity of the author. He seizes the eager attention of his readers by the strong power of reality. Ile thoroughly individualises what he takes in hand. Our sympathies are never left to wander off, into quarters vague or undefined, from thc flesh and blood to which he allies them. And this also is the reason why we cannot associate anything that is vulgar or I >w with his treatment of subjects that in themselves are avowedly so. In everything of that kind that he presents to us, there is, in his manner of doing it, the manliness and simplicity of nature, or the truth of life as it is. We are never repelled by the abominations of egotism, conceit, or dogmatism. We are never disgusted by misplaced ridicule. If there is good going on, there is a vivid and hearty style to bring out all its beauty ; and if there is evil, it runs no chance of being mistaken for good. The quantity of invention, observation, and knowledge of character, observable in tl**, writings of Mr Dickens, is never more apparent than are his kindness of heart and capacity for generous emotion. Now by all the various readers of this tale of Nicholas Nichleby?and they separate themselves into classes most widely apart from each other?these various qualities can bc in an almost equal degree appreciated and felt. In this we advance further into thc causes of so remarkable a popularity. Thousands read the book because it places them in the midst of scenes and characters with which they are already themselves acquainted; and thousands read it with no less avidity because it introduces | them to passages of nature and life of which they before knew nothing, but of the truth of which their own habits and senses suffice to assure them. This is a test which only a man of genius could bear. It is only in the presence of a writer of genius that the affinities and sympathies of high and low, in regard to the customs and usages of life, are so revealed. For it is not more by the bonds of a common humanity, than by the alliances of common habits, that we are all linked together. The highest and the lowest in these respects roost nearly approximate to each other. Like effects must always more or less result from being either above or below a dependence on other people's opinions. These are elements in the wide success and popularity of this remarkable writer, that would probably first suggest themselves in a critical examination of the book before in. Incidentally they embrace many others. His style is for the most part admirable. Bating some faults of occasional exaggeration, which we may presently advert to, it is fresh and racy, and has the surpassing charms of simplicity, earnestness, animal spirit*, and good humour. A rare virtue in It is, that it is always, whether grave or gay, thoroughly intelligible, and for the most part thoroughly natural. Its sparkling stream of vivacity or humour glides down by the easiest transition into deeper cuireou of seriousness and pathos. It is a? quick, as warm, as comprehensive, as the sympathies it is taxed to express. We know of none that csu paint more powerfully by an apposite epithet, or iltostfate mot* happily by n s|ehofeesJassion. Whatever Mr Dickes* knows or l9mMm*Lm m.A- tm.? ^wtt-M *#'-*%!* mt*mm^mmmmA ^mmmSm ? *tf*mm?W ?* vcevs^ ivOfe is ju we jp sf-avs^parsmsi ****** i* no beating about the bush for it. It is not carefully deposited, ticketed, labelled, elaborately set apart, to be drawn forth only ai formal necessity may suggest, from the various cells of his brain. It ii present with him through every passage of his book. lt animates old facts with a new life, it breathes into old thoughts a new emotion. Who that hus read his descriptions ofthe various localities of Loudon, as set down in this story of Nicholas NickUby. can ever expect to forget them more? A fresh glow of warmth and light plays over thc cheerful and familia"" places, a deeper mist of misery and blackness settles on thc darker scenes. With him, we pass along misty streets in some cold and (og^y morning, while but a few meagre shadows flit to and fro or now and then a heavy outline of coach or cab or cart looms through the dull vapour, yet were it oAy for the noises he strikes from time to time upon our ears, distantly and indistinctly as though the (o^ had muflicd them, we could not doubt that it was London. We enter with him by night, through long double rows of brightly burning lamps, a noisy, bust lim;, crowded scene, in which he shows us the rags of the squalid ballad-singer fluttering in thc same rich light that shows thc goldsmith's glittering treasures, and where one thin sheet of brittle glass is the iron wall by which vast profusions of wealth and food aro guarded from starved and pennyless men, add this is the same London as before. At all times, and under every aspect, bc gives us to feel and sec the great city as it absolutely is. Its interior life is made as familiar to us as its exterior forms. We come to know better the very places we have known best. Wc observe more smoking and bear more singing in Golden square; thc Saracen's Head on Snow hill relaxes into a grim cordiality; the Alphonse*) of Cadogan place reveal themselves plain Bills to our practised eye ; and the sight of even a real butterfly, fluttering among thc iron heads of dusty area railings in some retired and noiseless City square, startles us no more. And with all these masterly requisites for his art, is Mr Dickens a perfect novelist? By no means. He has yet to acquire the faculty of constructing a compact and effective story, without which that rank can never be attained. He has yet to subdue his tendencies of exaggeration, to which, though wc observe it infinitely less in this work than in the Pickwick Papers, he is still too prone. In saying this we only carry out the spirit of the praise we have just offered him. It is a due compliment to such a writer to assume, that he is not one of those frail folks who must bc bolstered up good and bad together. The great master in our language of thc art of constructing a plot, we need hardly observe, is Fielding. For exquisitest contrivance, for happiest extrication of story, he stands quite unrivalled. In this respect Tom Jones is an universally acknowledged masterpiece. Not an incident occurs in it from the first page to the last, which docs not more or less tell upon the story, while it illustrates at thc same time the character of thc .'gents by which its results ure to be worked out. Thus Black George is scarcely a less essential personage than Tom Jones himself, and a long list of intermediate persons iu like manner combine, each in his own peculiar sphere, to one grand effect. Its only episode, the only circumstance that is ever suffered to divert our attention from thc business going on, is that of thc Old Man of thc Hill, introduced in mere conventional imitation of the absurd custom of Cervantes and Le Sage. Passing this there is not an eddy, a current, scarcely a single ripple, on its full and flowing stream of purest incident and art. Nicholas Nie** kleby could not stand such a test for an instant. A want of plan is apparent in it from the first, an absence of design. The plot seems to have grown as the book appeared by numbers, instead of having been mapped out beforehand. The attention is ever and anon diverted from the story by digressions, introduced for the apparent uses of mere contrast and effect, while abrupt and startling recurrences are thus of course rendered necessary to recal us to the main interest and action. Admirable and very plausible reasons might no doubt be urged for all this, yet should none be admitted that contravene the sounder claims and more enduring requisites of high and perfect Art. The consequence of it is in this case, that many characters are altogether dropped as the necessities ofthe story force theimelves on tho writer, and that the grander effect of some of his most masterly and powerful writing in the latter chapters is marred by the introduction of matters, needful indeed to a gathering up of the loone or broken threads of an imperfect story, but sounding more like the minute recitals of a lawyer's deed than the natural development of a book of so much originality and ginini, Of the occasional sins against verisimititode on the side of exngteration, nriatng ont of ono lided views of a certain sort of life*, or the btw e# periog ? toondie joke to excess, tm wowW sven thrn-ns sis tbe Mtttln aad ?Deena*** ia the entry pm of the te* of Messrs Pyke and Pluck* i of the tcenes wkh Kr Mefrswy Verisopht. We have now and then as the work proceeded, directed attention to things of this kind. We are not certain even that the more amiable characters of the book are always so amiable as we are desired to suppose them, and we must confess an insuperable aversion to the heroics of Nicholas Nickleby himself, when, as it happens sometimes, they obscure even his strong and gentle mind. We take him to cut a poor figure, for example, in that quarrel with our dear Mr Lenville (how ultra-exquisite, saving only that, are all the scenes with the strollers 1), and when he stalks out nf the green room, "" bowing slightly"" to the assembled company, we long to have been there, notwithstanding our seldom-varying strong affection for him, to have joined the hearty laugh at his exit. We can scarcely reproach ourselves for this. We are not sure that even Mr Dickens himself is indisposed to quiz now and then these little foibles of his favourite hero. It is, we remember, after a certain sort of hasty demonstration of them that one of the ""helpers"" at thc Saracen's head is heard to exclaim, "" Hallo! this is somebody in disguise, this is!"" and another follows up tbe joke with ** Room for the eldest son of the Emperor of Roosher, iien'limn."" But when we follow tbe son of the imperial potentate into bis little dark and deserted room, when we see him in his tender devotion to poor Smike (an always touching and most beautiful feature in the story; w rought, too, with consummate art), when we are with him in his lonely thoughts of sister and home, all other vagaries are forgotten, and nothing is visU-ie to the moistening eye save the simplicity and sweetness of his nature. We have only to make one exception more. We referred to it when} we spoke of some exaggerations in mere style. Mr Dickens occasionally overlays his thoughts with needless epithets, and is over profuse in his use of adjectives. It is only in his reflections we find this?and that rarely?in his descriptions never. And now, having hastily glanced at objectionable points in the conduct or treatment of this famous story, what a host of beauties crowd on our grateful recollection, for which we have not opportunity or space to give even a passing glance to. With what pleasant thoughts it has stocked our memory, with what true and tender sentiments enriched our hearts, with what a healthy and manly moral instructed our minds. With bow much vivid distinctness each character takes its place before us, how plainly we pee the individualities of each, the form of their faces, the accident of iheir habits, the nicer peculiarity of their minds. These are triumphs which on I j belortg to a first-rate writer. The creative powers of the novelist, when properly directed and well sustained, take rank with history itself. The M*chylus of Parson Adams is not less real than the spectacles of Burke, the trumpet of Sir Joshua, or the snuffbox of Gibbon. In reserve for Mr Dickens are still greater triumphs if he has patience and perseverance to prepare hiimelf by study and self-restraint, hy the pursuit of art and the pruning of common-place exuberance, for their full and satisfactory achievement. We hope that he will not fail in this. Great is the glory, though the strife be bard, and heartily do we wish him strength to surmount the one and long life to enjoy the other. We see in him, at no distant day, if he does entire justice to hi* powers, the not unworthy successor of our Goldsmiths and Fieldings."

It is not a pleasant picture that Mr. Harkins draws. Most of the shop-girls scheme to entrap the Harvard students into matrimonial folly, and nearly all the young men whom he sketches are guilty of indiscretions that assist the shop-girls' plans. If the picture be true?a question on which only a Bostonian can offer an opinion?the authorities of Harvard have something to learn from older universities in the way of discipline. Not wholly dark, however, is this realistic sketch of Boston shop life. Lilian Fox, who enters the "" grand store "" at an early age, succeeds in resisting the evil influences that surround her, and is rewarded by the honest devotion of a clever student to whom her lowly parentage counts as naught. The growth of her character under the stress of temptation is by far the most skilful and pleasing feature of the book. She is essentially a lifelike creation, full of girlish vivacity and not uninclined to frivolity, but saved by native grace from the vulgar intrigues of her companions. Mr. Harkins has a gift of humour, and uses it very effectively in the portrayal of a local politician with a distorted notion of civic morality."
22,B3264,['3279216'],"COUSIN PHILL1S.* To most of us the name of _Mrs. Gaskell has hitherto spelt "" Cranford."" Comparatively few of us have any personal knowledge of this fragrant idyll, "" Cousin Phillis,"" which first saw light in the Cornhill in the early 'fifties, and is now ably and tenderly introduced by Mr. Thomas Seccombe to a forty-five-year-later audience. To read "" Cranford "" and "" Cousin Phillis "" now, and realise their respective dates, is to pause surprised at their order of production. "" Cranford "" came first-came, indeed, among Mrs. Gaskell's earliest writings, and Mr. Seccombe remarks: "" Based upon generalised reminiscences of early childhood and youth, 'Cranford' is coloured too with the riper tints of autumn, and the wonder is that these hues of sadness should be manipulated to so exquisite an issue by so fair, so sanguine, and so youthful a hand."" The hand, however, w'as over forty years old when it began these finely artistic sketches of an avowedly inartistic period; and in forty years there is much opportunity to learn observation and suffer experience. The wonder lies even more, it seenis to us, in the spontaneous radiance, the young glamorous youth and freshness of the later story, which gleams as if steeped in early morning sunshine, and is fragrant as a garden of dew-washed gillyflowers. Its charmi is so elusive and delicate that the idyll seems passively to refuse detailed criticism ; scenes, characters, phrases, captivate us, but in spite of this it stands to be judged whole, it appeals as a young, living thing. Mr. Seccombe's Introduction could not be bettered we have read it four times, out of sheer pleasure. In fiveand-twventy pages he is reminiscent, enthusiastic, critical, enlightening; he tells us the history of the story in England and on the Continent; he shows us the growth of Mrs. Gaskell and of "" Cousin Phillis."" To his own work he has brought thought and knowledge; to Mrs. Gaskell's work affection and understanding. And as an annotator does any one surpass Mr. Seccombe in his own way ? There are just four notes to this Introduction, and each is a model of generous conciseness, each is apt, helpful, graphic. The story of "" Cousin Phillis,"" "" that flawless, radiant idyll,"" is of a kind but rarely achieved with full success. Perhaps they achieve it more often in America than here, though one such triumph wvas certainly attained by Mr. Walter Raymond some years ago in "" Tryphena in Love"" -a Queen's Treasure, too, which would not be out of place in this series. Numberless newV readers will now make acquaintance with Mrs. Gaskell's heroine, as Cousin Paul did, when, as he says, |"" the westering sun shone full upon her, and made a slanting stream of light into the room %within.

The addition of another to the list of elaborate works upon which Mr Dickens rests his claim to be remembered in future times, forms always an event in contemporary literature ; and lileah House being finished, opinious upon it are now freely exchanged on all sides. Some find in it occasion to feel sorely aggrieved because Mr Dickens is not so inhuman as to be absolutely faultless. Some suggest modifications, and point out how they would have planned it if it had been their's to write. Some are in raptures over one part, some over another, and some very particular fellows are carping at every part. The judgments on lileah- House are, in short, as various as judgments are apt to be upon a man whoso failings it is thought a subtle test of criticism to discover, for the very reason that all the world admires and likes him, and his books are bought and read by everybody. That this latest of his hooks has filled the fancies of its readers with new groups of people as familiar and real as any that in life they may have known ; that it overflows with inimitable grace and tenderness; that it is stored with the most subtle wit, and with a humour, hearty and true, that sets always instinctively at work our pleasantest and kindliest emotions ; that mirth and pathos abound in it, that its satire is always just and manly, and that it is full of generous indignation against social usages that create wrong and perpetuate suffering among us,?is simply in other words to say that it is a book written by Mr Dickens. That it has also faults is to say that it is not quite a miracle, even though written by bim. MtmWyttteHM truly may be found with it, and such aa prope^ ap? company great qualities. In the whole line of u_uMtj_i throughout the history of literature, there will be discovered few writers indeed who have produced unexceptiooth-e books. Books become everlasting by tbe fetuoe tiwi it ia them, and by their unquestionable ululation abet* tte products of men having only ordinaiy power.

Novels as Mr Dickens writes them rise to the dignity of poems. In the same spirit Fielding wrote, treating his Tom Jones as an epic. Upon this high ground we must stand if we would properly discuss lileah House. It touches and amuses us, but it is destined to draw teare and smiles also from our children's children. Mr Dickens has a large public in the present, and wo do not hesitate to declare our belief that he will have one hardly less large in the future. The world will grow wiser than it is, the abuses attacked by this greatest of humorists and kindliest of satirists will disappear?but the spirit in which he writes, and to which he appeals, is indestructible ; and the emotions he awakens are not more fresh and true to us than they will be to future generations. Thc first remark we are disposed to make on lileah House has relation to its plot. The conduct of the story appears to us singularly skilful. Not without justice has it been objected that the habit of writing a story in monthly parts is apt to lead to a grouter concern for the part than for the whole, und to interfere with tho steady and continuous working of every event up to the final issue. But let us in the present instance with no less justice remark, that the habit of reading a story in parts is equally apt to prevent many readers from noticing how thoroughly a work so presented to them is calculated for perusal as a whole. The studied and elaborate care bestowed upon the construction of lileah' House is very manifest. Event leads to event; and chance words, or tho deeds of chance people, that seem perfectly irrelevant, are seen everywhere, precisely as in real life, exerting a direct and powerful bearing on the course taken by a train of incidents whereof the issue is one of life or death, of happiness or misery, to men and women perfectly unknown to them. Taking the mere surface view of such treat ment, it would of course be easy to exhibit its apparent want of connection and design, and to display in the J attempt only our own very real want of sagacity. This subtle linking together of thc deeds and interests of many people, so far as they bear on the progress of one given set of incidents, is in fact truer to nature, infinitely truer, than the common plan of representing half a dozen men and women acting and re acting on each other exclusively, as if they were fenced out from the surrounding world. Its drawback is that it compels the uso (tf a huge number of characters which come and go during tho progress of the story ; und. j as their purpose in the narrative is not always evident until the reader can look back from the journey's end over tlie ] ground he has traversed, they may now and then cause some j confusion in the reader's mind, mid produce an etlect like J that of an over-crowded picture. 13ut the art rather than the artist is there in fault. ? He this as it may, never in any former work has Mr j Dickens made* use of a plot so evidently planned before-? hand with minute consideration, or throughout so elaborately studied. Even the lits of the little law-stationer's servant aid directly in the chain of little things that lead indirectly to tho catastrophe of Lady Dedlock's death. So dexterously indeed an; the many little incidents of this kind leading to i great results managed throughout lileah House, that wu can hardly feel surprise if the results should by not very careful readers be received as substantive and independent facts,' and the small precedent details held altogether separable from them, as a mere cloud of isolated incidents. A novel j may havo its too superficial readers, as life has its too hasty obsorvers. At tho closo of his preface Mr Dickens marks incidc-ii< tally the general character of the tale by the intimation thatj in it ho has purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of i familiar things. Marvellous is the skill with which, towards j this intention, tho great Chancery suit on which the plot hinges, and on incidents connected with which, important, or trivial, all tho passion and suflering turns, is worked into j every part of the book. Whenever tho occasion arises, or j the art of the story-teller requires, tho thick atmosphere of j law that rises out of .Jumdyee t*. darndyce is made to cling | like a fog about thc peoplo in tho story. It may be more or less, but there it is. Either as a thick cloud or a light mist, it is to be seen everywhere. Lawyers of many grades, law clerks of all kinds, the copyist, the law-stationer, thu usurer, suitors of every description, haunters of tho law courts and their victims, live and move round ubout tho life of the chief persons iu the tale, and exercise almost insensibly, but very certainly, a continual influence upon them. Comparo this with what a commonplace writer would have preferred, and a congenial critic recommended, and you will understand what tho power of a man of genius really is. To have made the plot itself a connected story of a Chancery suit would havo beeu (except for tho merest commonplace) ono of tho clumsiest and most impracticable designs conceivable. Mr Dickens knew hotter what he was al>out, and tho use made of Jarndyco v. Jamdyco in lileah House is always complete and masterly. fJThe other grand feature of the tale, connected also closely yet quito naturally with this, is the Dedlock household, lt is brought out with equal power, with the same thoughtful elaboration, aud with as perfect a result. Not only have we Sir Leicester, a truo gentleman with all his weaknesses; and Lady Dedlock, the supercilious woman of fashion, with a busy heart painfully throbbing beneath that hard and quiet outside; but Yolumnia and tho cousins, the town house and the footmen, thc country house and ita good oldfashioned housekeeper, all aro worked out with the finish of a master. From the first glimpse of the assembled Dedlock household, discussing the Doodles and Foodies and Cuffys and Buffya in which they believe politics to consist, down to the last chapters that concern them?chapters, in eluding the flight and pursuit of the unhappy Lady Dedlock, which are in conception aud construction absolutely wonderful?the power aud care spent upon tho group are unceasingly exerted (yet so successfully as to bear no trace of effort)* to keep it throughout iu that central position towards which the other sections of tho tale may be seen gradually and surely to converge. Taking the story piecemeal, as a mero gallery of pictures and persons, we are disposed to think that there are particular groups in lileah House finer than anything that even Mr Dickens has yet produced in the same way. Exquisitely true and tender as are his descriptions of the suffering classes in former writings, wo can remember none by which we have been touched so deeply, or that has been graced by so much of the very finest writing, as tho entire tale of the street-wandering Joe as it may be gathered from the pages of the book before us. In tho trooper George, tho Ragnets, and their humble household, we have another of those fine, broad, hearty exemplifications of humour in which Mr Dickens delights, in which all tho ludicrous features of every object or incident are intensely enjoyed and made prominent, yet with a most genuine and charming sentiment at the same time underlying it all. Nothing is repulsive ; everything is large, laughable, and true; and the most homely and ungainly figures become radiant with the spirit of goodness. Tlie character of Esiher Summerson has been much elaborated, and the early portions of her narrative aro as charming as anything Mr Dickens has ever written*?indeed some of the best things in the book may be found throughout it, full as it is of noble fancies, and delicate and graceful thoughts; but wo suspect that Mr Dickens undertook more than man could accomplish when he resolved to make her the naive revealer of her own good qualities. We cannot help detecting in some passages an artificial tone, which, if not self-consciousness, is at any rate not such a tone as would be used in her narrative by a person of tho character depicted. Yet the graces and virtues of Esther have won so many hearts that we do not care to dwell on our objection to his method of displaying them ; and as to the one or two other characters of the book which wo might have wished away, these are quite lost in that crowd of fresh and ever real creations that will live while the language continues. Mrs Jelly by and her despondent husband, her daughter Caddy and tho Turveydrops, the trooper George and his man Phil, the brickmakers' wives and the dead infant, the lawstationer and his little woman, Roy thorn and Ski Dipole, Mr Chadband and the Coavinses, the mother of Mr < ?uppy, the inscrutable and impassable Tulkinghorn, to say nothing of 1 poor Miss Flite or tlie immortal Bucket, and a dozen others, j have been added here to the long list of ideal people with j whom Mr Dickens has made his countrymen intimately and permanently acquainted. Mr Dickens's characters, as all the world knows, pass their names into our language, and become types. lt is ; an evidence of his possession of the highest power that the best of them are thus made each to embody some characi toristic feature, to personify some main idea, which are ever after found universally applicable. Such has been the aim of the highest class of dramatists and novelists since tho beginning of all literature. They know little how much there is in any ono man's head or heart, who expect to have every I character in a tale laid bare before them as on a psychological ! dissecting table, and demonstrated minutely. We see nobody minutely in real life. The rough estimates we form of character aro on tho whole (if we possess any tact) correct; | but men touch and interfere with ono another by the coni tact of their extremes, and it is the prominences, the sharp I angles, that aro most likely to appear in a tale really worth the telling. Hence it is therefore, as well as for i other reasons, that the dramatist or novelist is concerned chiefly with the display of salient points in leach one of his characters. Tho rest ofthe sketch is filled iup by the reader or spectator instinctively (and sufficiently) I out of his own experience. Squire Allworihy, Rlifil, Philosopher Square, Parson Adams, Trulliber, and all the rest of Fielding's characters were formed upon this plan ; nor was it thought unjust or unnatural by the great novelist to give distinctness to thc picturo in each case, by just so much of genial strength and breadth of colouring as should prevent his idea from being impressed too faintly on the public mind. It is for the most part much more easy than correct to cry out?exaggeration. Wo may be only betray ing our ignorance after all. Thero is an eastern saying to the effect that there is in the world precisely what the eye can find in it, and let us not suppose that what limits our viewin any particular direction, should of necessity be an equal restriction to thc view of a man of genius. Of Mr Dickens it is to bo said, if of any oue, that his main strength has lain in the ability to concentrate his thoughts on objects external to himself. If his mero personality were at every turn set up as the limit aud bound to his perceptions, if it were still his recurring habit to tako his own character as the infallible test of all other characters, ho would in each fresh essay be always retracing only the old weary ground. Rut ready and cager at all times, with genial warmth and fulness, to enter in all the peculiarities of others, we have him continually throughout his books apprehending and interpreting i.ew forms of character and truth, and carrying with each new achievement of his genius new pleasure nnd delight into thousands of homes?because his genius is his fellow-feel in"" with his race. To illustrate these remarks a few passages may bo taken almost at random. From the tragical and touching episode of Joe we borrow a brief extract which relates a history. The poor desolate outcast's evidence has been^T^""^ inquest because he *? could not exactly say"" uhected*t to done to him after death ; but what he hid to tu *0ul(i ?* wards ascertained?extra judicially. te after While the Coroner buttons his great coat, Mr Tniv . give private audience to the rejected witness in a ?SS*""11 **U That graceless creature only knows that the d?aH recognised just now by his yellow face and black wT*11 (wbon?

We will place beside this awful and allecting picture a companion piece. .Mrs l\irdiggie is the type and embodiment of a highly fashionable Visitation of the Poor Society, and the reader will judge, from the scene that follow?, whether reckless neglect or oilicious interference be really the more inhumane. Such are tho lessons thickly strewn over all Mr Dickens's books. lt was one of a cluster of wretched hovels in a brickfield, -iihpi-> s-ties dose to the broken windows, and rniserablelit tie garden, before the doors, growing nothing but stagnant pool?. Here and there, an old tub was put to eatch the droppings ol rain-water from a roof, or they were banked up with mud into a little pond like a large dirtpie. At the doors and windows, some men and women lounged or prowled about, and took little notice of us, except to laugh wow another, or to say something as we passed about gentlefolks min. mg their own business, and not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coining to look after other people's.

Dreary and solemn the old house looks, with so tw)n-appliances of habitation, and with no inhabitants except the ""wred forms upon the walls. So did these come and go, a Dedlock ^Boswssioii might have ruminated passing along ; so did they see t sffallery hushed and quiet, as I see it now ; so think, as I think, the ""?1' t,,at ineY woul<* ,nftke in this domain when they were ?j SJ liud it, as I find it, difficult to believe that it could be, ^thout them; to pass from my world, as I pass from theirs, now ""Lin* the reverberating door; so leave no blank to miss them, and K Throu""h some of the fiery windows, beautiful from without, and ^ at this suiiftt hour, not in dull grey stone but in a glorious house ,f *t>ld, the light excluded at other windows pours in, rich, lavish, 'ittrflowiDg like ,ne sunder plenty in the land. Then do the frozen Dedlocks thaw. Strange movements come upon their features, as the hado-f* of leaves play there. A dense Justice in a corner is beguiled ; a wij,fe. A staring Baronet, with a truncheon, gets a dimple in L_ chin. Down into the bosom of a stony shepherdess there steals a tiect of li-'ht nnd warmth, that would have done it good a hundred narang0*"" t)""e ancestress of Volumnia, iu high-heeled shoes, very like her?casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two vnturies?shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint. A maid of j W* of the court of Charles the Second, with large round eyes (and ether charms to correspond), seems to bathe in glowing water, a-ad it niles as it glows. But the fire of the sun is dying. Lvtn now the floor is dusky, and ?hilo- tlowly mounts the walls, bringiug the Dedlocks down like age aud death. And now, upon my lady's picture over the gi eat chimneypiece a weird shade fulls from some old tree, that turns it pale, and flutters it, and looks as if a great arm held a veil or hood, watching an opportunity to draw it over her. Higher and darker wi shadow on the wall?now a red gloom on the ceiling?now the Ure is out. All that prospect, which from the terrace looked so near, Las moved solemnly away, and changed?not the first nor the last of kautiful things that look 60 near and will so change?into a distant phantom. Light mists arise, and the dew falls, and all the sweet ktnts iu the garden are heavy in the air. Now, the woods settle into Teat macst sus if they were each one profound tree. And now the moon mt, to separate them, and to glimmer here and there in horizontal Ee-j behind their stems, and to make the avenue a pavement of light aaiong hij*h cathedral arches fantastically broken. Now, the moon is high ; and the great house, needing habitation nore than ever, is like a body without life. Kow, it is even awful, itfaling through it, to think of the live people who have ph-pt in the fclitary bed-rooms : to say nothing of the dead. Now is the time for liatlow, when every corner is a cavern, and every downward step a pit. when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon the floors, when anything and everything can be made of the heavy 6taircaee beams excepting their own proper shapes, when the armour haa dull lights upon it not easily to he distinguished frc rn stealthy movement, and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive ot heads inside. But, of all the shadows in Chesney Wold, the ihadow in the long drawing-room upon my lady's picture is the first to come, the la6t to be disturbed. At this hour, and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up, aud menacing tLe handle face with every breath that stirs. ""She is not well, ma'am,"" says a groom in Mrs Bounceweli's audience-chamber. ?My Lady not well] What's the matter?"" ""Why, my Lady is but poorly, ma'am, since she was last here? I don't mean with the family, ma'am, but when she was here as a hird of passage-like. My Lady has not been out much, for her, and ta kept her room a good deal.""

But the style lias its own l)i(ltlancy too, so long, at least, as Mr. Le (;allienne is content with his less studied tropls, his more lightly moral reilections, his simpler pictures of the coUntry-side ; but %when hl soars into regions of raretied ether hc becomes plainly tedlious. It is a pity also that he should have included Paris in his pilgrimage---a gratuitous after-thought for which he gves no valid excuse; but to end all with a Piccadilly tragedy in a postscript is an unpardonable device. I)oes he want to (dra- our tears with a surreptitious onion as we inn)cently sniff his proffered psy? The episode of the threatened breach in the loves of Rosalini and Orlando, prevented l)y the 'il,,rim's excellent worldly wisdom, was (quite serious enou h as a set-off to the gay irresponsibility of the general theme; but this de.:dly sombre ending of the tale seems to us, as the Revolutions of our neighbours seemed to the insular taste of Tennyson, 'too solemni for the comic touche; in it.' Indeed, Mr. Le Callicnne, in such work as this, should not take himself too seriously. When he escorts us doxvn the lane that ends in the jungle of giant bulrushes and the cottage and the week's washing and tells us simnply that 'there were the usual birds,' we thank him much for that relief. But, by the way-to speak again of the dainty petticoat-does this world-weary pilgrim, with the gi4ddy past behind him, know, as you would think he ought to know, just how and where a petticoat ought to go on? One askF, because he tells us, in confidence, that one of the honest red-flannel kind 'sugests country laps ant country breasts!' In his opinion it is a covering to warm a 'Iwzi-rom fiure.' Which brings the critic to another p)int, the curious inequality of Mr. Le Gallienne's mianner-so irreproachable where souls are concerned-in dealin, with women in the body. With one e)e fixed on the proprieties 'for the sake of the jeune fl/le %%ho adores his work', he cannot refrain with the other from prying pruriently through the bodice of every second woman that comes across his path. This is his damnable offence. None, of course, but the poorest prude would complain of his treatment of that bedroom difficulty, which seemed to the lady to be 'l ke something out of S:erne.' But the delicacy with which it is (line only maokes more intolerable the memory of such a Fpasage as this: 'Once, when by chance she had forgotten to fasten her gown, I caught glimpses of a bosom that was like two happy handfuls of wonderful white cherries T'he three stops are p)art of the quotation.)

TINAYRE writes with such a light fantastic M touch that her books are always enjoyable reading. The present volume, as she herself says, "" is not a novel, but a collection of impressions, of dreams and of memories, in which fiction mingles with fact."" It is also, we are inclined to think, in no small degree autobiographical. Some of us delight in building castles in the air, others will become lost in thought as they watch the embers on the homely hearth, but Madeleine sits before her mirror and gazes into it, evoking reminiscences of other days which she records in a dainty style that forcibly reminds one of the late Gustave Droz, especially in his delightful work "" Monsieur, Madame, et BebE."" Madeleine conjures up thoughts and recollection of a multitude of subjects, mostly of the piquant gossamer kind, which is innate in the Parisienne, but occasionally striking a more serious note showing that life is not all frivolity, frills and furbelows, and that laughter has at times to give way to tears. The sketches, slight as they are, display an intimate knowledge of woman and her ways, and the authoress lampoons her foibles with no hesitating pen. The chapters ""Beauty Secrets,"" ""Friendship among Women,"" ""Women and their Dressmakers,"" divulge many home truths which a mere man could scarcely hint at. ""Women at Sales"" depicts ""the little wild beast. . . feverishly turning over scarves and laces in a caressing manner which no husband or lover will ever know."" But it is when Madeleine discusses ""Mode and Maternity"" that she is most scathing towards her sex. ""The present fashion, if exaggerated, becomes the negation of femininity.... The tight fitting garments of. to-day make prospective maternity immodest. . . Modem woman is a pretty, careless creature, who does not think, who seldom loves, and who never becomes a mother. She is a soulless, heartless doll! Look at our Parisiennes, how they flatten any prominence of figure, how they diet themselves, how they confine their bodies in mummy-like sheathes in order to attain to the literary ideal of the perverted angel."" According to Madame Tinayre, who is evidently no believer in ""as good be out of the world as out of the fashion,"" this regrettable state of things is in the main due to our latter-day novelists. It is a pity that several of her pages are disfigured by some very careless printer's errors. Has that gentleman's reader become as extinct as the dodo?"

But is a plot a necessary part of a book which professes to be an autobiography ? The life of the average man is neither a tragedy nor a comedy, and it would be hard to find in his autobiography a satisfactory plot. * Joseph Vance * impresses the reader as the truthful record of a life, and as that is what the author intended, we need not lament the absence of a plot. The book is written in a leisurely fashion. It suggests the talk of an intelligent man who has something to say, and all night in which to say it, and the listener must be unusually obtuse who does not find pleasure in listening. There is abundance of humour in Mr. De Morgan's story, and it is found not only in the humorous remarks made by the author, but also in the essentially humorous characteristics of several of the people to whom he introduces us. The reader may fancy that the task of reading will be long enough to be tiresome ; but if he has any appreciation of work that is humorous, thoughtful, pathetic, and thoroughly entertaining, he will not regret the length of the story. ' Joseph Vance ' is fresh, original, and unusually clever. If it is the author's first effort, as is apparently the case, his next book will l)e looked for with interest."
29,B9098,['6793468'],"Memoirs of the Comtesse de Boigne, 1781-181M.. INTERESTING MEMOIRS Edited from the original Manuscript by M. Charles Nicoullaud. (Heinemann, 10s. net.) These memoirs are exactly what memoirs should be?to be of value and interest. No attempt is made to write history; there is nothing pretentious about them, nothing dull. A great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady, whose salon in her day bad a European reputation: the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest; the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be. So she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience. "" If I had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory I should have given up my project, for I desired a distraction and not a laborious work. Hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book, but merely the chatter of an old woman. ... I regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work. I have successively used my pen to rest my needle, and my needle to rest my pen, and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair."" So writes the Comtesse de Boigne. There is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead lady's life, especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered, and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote. There is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production. Death plays too prominent a part. When the Comtesse de Boigne was fifty-four years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen, whom she had been bringing up for twelve years, and whom she loved as a mother. After this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which I had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind. ... I attempted to cheat my grief with this task, undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed. ... The following pages are the result of these efforts, and their object was to drive away the thoughts which I could hardly bear. Begun in this manner, as so many memoirs are begun, to turn the mind from brooding on calamity, the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth. And the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote; she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past; she lived, as it were, through the medium of her work. She lost the personal anguish of things, without losing her interest in life. In this way, as the brave among men and women are wont to do, she turned necessity to gain. There is sadness, too, in the history of the manuscript itself. The Comtesse de Boigne, nee Charlotte Louise Eleonore Adelaide d'Osmond, loved her name, as well she might. And she was childless. From the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew Osmond, who became the Marquis d'Osmond, to be her heir. He was ten years old in 1866 when she died. He came into the possessions which she left him in August 1881, in accordance with the terms of the will on his twenty-fifth birthday. With his intimate friend M. Charles Nicollaud, the present editor, he found the manuscript volumes; there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world. For twenty-five years they remained in the possession of M. Nicollaud, to whom the Marquis d'Osmond entrusted them. During that time death was busy among the family, and the Marquis d'Osmond himself at length died, "" The family name is extinct. The estate of Osmond has been sold piecemeal. The castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed."" But into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated. What is most apparent, is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them. Always it is the grande dame, the royalist, who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them. She makes no attempt to be impartial: she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters. Whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in London, or the last days of the Court at Versailles; or the bivouac of Cossacks in the Champs Elysees at the Restoration: whether she is describing the eccentricities of Sir John Legard, with whom her family stayed in Yorkshire, or summing up the character of such notables as Chateaubriand, or Talleyrand, or Madame de Stael or the Emperor Alexander ?her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness, which can pierce below the surface, and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar. The attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in- the Tuileries, where the ladies of the Empire met the ladies of the old Court after the return of Monsieur. There is a certain ease, a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be. Women of the other class are often shocked at this, consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts. The memoirs of a woman of this kind, who lived through all the upheavals of the Revolution, the Empire, and the Restoration, must be of supreme interest and value. The translation is good. And the notes which the editor, M. Nicollaud, has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness. The present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs. The second volume, bringing the narrative to the Revolution of 1830, is in preparation, and a third will continue the story down to the fall of Louis Philippe."

The characters partly historical and partly fictitious, do not touch upon and gratify the recollections where rcalitv exists for them?nor captivate the fancy, where they are originated by the author. The story is feeble and improbable, and the language though not inflated and extravagant, as that of many of our modern novels is, has a peculiar flavour not particularly pleasant, and is rather a purified Irish, than plain English. In Taunton and its neighbourhood is the story lucie,!. A Scotch family of the name of Fullarton having followed thc fortunes of the unfortunate Duke of Argyle, one of two brothers had accompanied that nobleman to the continent, the other settled at Taunton, where the Kingsly's, their friends, resided.

31,B4957,"['8942801', '2436302', '6831927']","The White Peacock. By D. H. Lawrence. (Heinemann.) This novel is a characteristic specimen of the modern fiction which is being written by the feminine hand. The older ideas and ideals are sacrificed ruthlessly to an attempt to breathe vitality into a succession of cinematographic pictures illustrative of the lives of the dramatis personal. Tbere is, however, no selection, as this method would suggest; impressions are merely scattered at random. It is, as it were, paulo-post-impressionism in fiction. That there is cleverness in this/modern study of nerves is obvious from the first chapter, but it is equally impossible to avoid the conclusion that the characters were spun in the author's brain. There is no verisimilitude. Farmer's daughters talk high culture, and an ordinary reader's head whirls in trying to determine the social relations of the sundry people involved* Scenes seem introduced merely because the author has observed them or thought of them, not because they add anything to the plot, or even to the atmosphere* Such is the modern method which a growing school of writers in this country encourages, but which, as we have pointed out before, owes its conception rather to Zola than to English sources. The author of 'The White Peacock* is never realistic with the crudity of the master, but she is needlessly frank to a fastidious mind. As the trend of the novel in general seems to be in this direction, she should be successful, particularly when she has learnt her craft better. There are suggestions, and even more than suggestions, of the making of a fine style in her writing.THE WHITE PEACOCK. By D. H. LAWRENCE. Heinemann. InjD. H. Lawrence we have a new writer, one most certainly to be reckoned with. It is his first book, we understand, and he is quite young, quite unknown. The White Peacock should be read. The book stands out among the ruck of contemporary fiction unmistakably as a work of artistic and literary excellence, as the writing of a man who knows he will achieve both fame and distinction. It is not perhaps a very good novel. Mr. Lawrence is somewhat prolix in his conversations; his life's orbit would seem a little limited; there are loquacious oases of rather heavy and almost suburban dulness. But there are flashes of real genius, touches of physical interpretation, a skill of observation, a zeal of life, a glow of intellect, and, above all, a wonderful sensitiveness of art and nature which mark the writer as a real force. He still needs craft, the unerring craft of a Wells; he needs experience. There is nothing much in the story, which is the study of a little country circle without much incident or movement. Yet the book has a great fascination. The scent of the countryside is all about it. These people of his are real-there are some extraordinarily good descriptive scenes-and the end is real. No mawkish sentimentality. No boy-and-girl book this. A true piece of writing, revealing in places the sense of beauty and passion of a quite remarkable talent.FICTION The White Peacock. By D. H. LAWRENCE. (Heinemanil. 6s.) I HITHIDro we have only known Mr. D. H. Lawrence as being one of the many interesting poets discovered by the English Review. Henceforth we shall certainly know him as the author of ""The White Peacock,"" for it is beyond all argument an admirable and astonishing piece of work. We use the word "" astonishing "" advisedly, for, like most new books of uncommon merit, "" The White Peacock "" surprises even while it charms. There are pages in it that made the present reviewer, a sophisticated and disillusioned reader of novels, lay down the book and rub his eyes in wonder at the author's individuality and courage. It is no very new story that he has to tell. That a young woman should encourage two young men at once, and should end by marrying the wrong one, is possibly even more frequent in fiction than in life. Again, that the slighted lover should thereon marry beneath him and take to drink is only ill accordance with the best traditions of the ingenuous school of novelists. But in the hands of Mr. Lawrence this old theme is quickened with new life. The action takes place in the rural districts of Nottinghamshire, and it would hardly be fanciful to say that Nature is the protagonist of the drama, and that the author has drawn her character with uncommon care. We realise her in all her moods, and she is as interesting as she is convincing. Nor has the author taken less pains with the drawing of those special manifestations of Nature that are called men and women. The heroine is a delightful picture of a lively, clever girl, who likes excitement of all kinds, and especially the rather dangerous excitement of leading passionate men on to making passionate love. Mr. Lawrence's unravelling of this heedlessness is almost uncanny in its shrewdness. But his greatest success is the character of George, the farmer-lover, whose defeat and degradation supply the book with its motive. This is a really masterly study of passion, now wordless and pitiful, now strung to its utmost intensity of self-expression when the man realises his weakness, and his own words hurt him like blows. Lettie loves his physical strength and the completeness of his submission, and, wisely enough, according to her lights, marries the other man because his money and social position make him a more suitable match. It is clever of Mr. Lawrence to compel us to sympathise both with George and Lettie. We are made to feel that they are both hard driven by their natures, and are not to be blamed for the, inevitable catastrophe. But, in truth, of all the many characters in the book, there is not one who does not move within the bounds of our sympathy; the men are men, the women women, and the children, who appear all too rarely, are such children that we hope the author will be more generous of them in his next work. Apart from the characterisation the book would stand by its vivid pictures of a country life that is new to us, where, side by side with the primitive roughness that lingers wherever men and women till the soil, the new ideas have taken root and are apparently about to flourish. The author treats of the primitive with praiseworthy frankness, and there is no denying the interest of the spectacle of a young farmer looking at Aubrey Beardsley's illustrations for the first time. It is apparent to us that Mr. D. H. Lawrence is one of those rare writers who intends only to tell the truth as he sees it, and nothing but the truth. As a consequence he has given us a book of considerable achievement and infinite promise."

To tbis rare, and almost wonderful, exception it is not necessary that we should more expressly refer; but we must add that even in that case the experiment, however generally successful, occasioned many important distortions and perversions of facts,?and we will venture to say that it has produced, especially in the present generation, much doubt, confusion and error as to characters, opinions, and events. These observations are in a manner challenged by Sir E. B. Lytton's dedicatory preface, and by the notes which he has placed at the foot of his page and appended to each of his volumes. They appear to set up a claim for his fiction, notwithstanding his denial of the pretension, to the dignity and, importance of history. We hold it impossible to reconcile the two satisfactorily. Either let us have a production of mere fancy, or let us have a book depending mainly on its facts and statements the value of which can be measured by ordinary and known standards. The author commences with informing us that he has abandoned thc usual course of historical narrative in his incidents:?he makes a merit of perverting what has hitherto been received in relation to the connexion between Harold and Edith. ""We admit at once that, for his purpose, he had 1 reason for making the change?because itrenders the story not merely more interesting, but on every account more readable. On this point Sir E. B. Lytton observes :?"" The love ?tory of Harold nnd Edith is told differently from the well-known legend, which implies a leis pure connexion. But the whole legend respecting the Edeva faira (Edith the fair) whose name meets us in the Doomsday Roll, rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance; and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal, but which, on many accounts, I hope, may be intrusted fearlessly to the young."" That is to wy, he made this important deviation because he did not wish to have his novel banished from drawing-room tables and the boudoirs of 'he ordinary readers of such productions. We should have complained less of aberrations of this kind if the writer had not been rather ostentatious of his authorities; from ""hich he clearly means it to be inferred that ?n all the main incidents of his story he has adhered to the most authentic representations. *e do not dispute that in many instances he lias done so,*?but we think that he has thereby rendered his work less attractive. His archae*>gy spoils his book as a fiction?just as his departures from the same injure it as history, he has thus put a curb on his imagination, both ??regardspersons and events,?and would have produced a better and more popular work had he subjected himself to none of these restraints. As it is, the old figure of a man dancing a hornpipe in fetters recurs to the reader. We may be surprised that he can do so well, thus loaded, ?but feel sure that he could have done much better, unencumbered. In fact, the author has most succeeded where he has most rejected the inconvenient restraints to which he elsewhere submitted; and those portions of his three volumes will be read with most pleasure where he has given way to the variety and gracefulness of his own fancy and the vigour and boldness of his own imagination. The description, for instance, of all that relates to the war of Harold against Gryffyth, in Wales, is unsurpassed in interest and power by anything from his pen. We will select our first specimen from this part of Vol. II.; premising that Gryffyth, his queen, and his starving followers have been shut up in a mountain fastness, and that Harold, by a monk and a young Norman, has sent them a message of mercy on submission.? "" As the monk ceased, the thrill of the audience was perceptible, and a deep silence waa followed by a general murmur, as if to constrain the King. Then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man. The red spot flushed the dark cheek, and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow. He made one stride towards thc monk, and said, in a voice loud, and deep, and slow, rolling far up the hill,?*Monk, thou hast said; and now hear the reply ofthe son of Llewellyn, the true heir of Roderic the Great, who from tlie heights of Eryri saw all the lands of the Cvmrian sleeping under the dragon of Uther. King was I bom, and king will I die. I will not ride by the bide of the Saxon to the feet of Edward, the son of the spoiler. I will not, to purchase base life, surrender the claim, vain before men and the hour, but solemn before God and posterity?the claim of my line nnd my people. AU Britain is ours?all the Island of Pines. And the children of Hengist tire traitors and rebels?not the heirs of Ambrosius and Uther. Say to Harold the Saxon, "" Ye have left us but the tomb of the Druid and the hills of the eagle; but freedom and royalty are ours, in life and in death?not for you to demand them, not for us to betray."" Nor fear ye, O my chiefs, few, but unmatched in glory and truth; fear not ye to perish by the hunger thus denounced as our doom, on these heights that command the fruits of our own fields! No, die we may, but not mute and revengeletw. Go back, whispering warrior; go back, false son of Cymry?and tell Harold to look well to his walla and his trenches. We will vouchsafe him grace for his grace?we will not take him by surprise, nor under cloud of the night. With the gleam of our spears ami the clash of our shields, we will come from tho hill; and, famine-worn as he deems us, hold a feast in his walls which the vultures of Snowdon illume their pinions to share !'*?' Rash man and unhappy!' cried the monk; 'what curse drawest thou down on thy head! W'ilt thou be the murtherer of thy men, in strife unavailing and vain ? Heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt causeto be shed.'?' Be dumb !?hush thy screech, lying raven!' exclaimed Gryffyth, his eyes darting tire, and his slight form dilating. ' Once, priest and monk went before us to inspire, not to daunt; and our cry, Alleluia ! was taught us by the saints ofthe Church, on the day when Saxons, fierce and many as Harold's, fell on the field of Maes-Garmon. No, the curse is on the head of the invader, not on those who defend hearth and altar. Yea, as the song to the bard, the cursk leaps through my veins, and rushes forth from my lips. By the land they have ravaged; by the gore they have spilt; on these crags, our last refuge; below the carn on yon heights, where the Dead stir to hear me,?I launch the curse of the wronged and the doomed on the children of Hengist! They in turn shall know the steel of the stranger?their crown shall be shivered as glass, and their nobles bc as slaves in the lund. And the line of Hengist and Cerdic shall be rased from the roll of empire. And the ghosts of our fathers shall glide, appeased, over the grave of their nation. But we?we, though weak in the body, in the soul shall be strong to the last! The ploughshare may pass over our cities, but the soil shall be trod by our steps, and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards. Nor, in the great Judgment Day, shall any race but the race of Cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth, to answer for the sins of the brave.' So impressive the voice, so graud the brow, and sublime the wild gesture of the King, as he thus spoke, that not only the monk himself was awed ; not only, though he understood not the words, did the Norman knight bow his head, as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct, flashes out from the cloud,?but even the sullen and wide-spreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment. But the spearmen and multitude above, excited by the tidings of safety to life, and worn out by repeated defeat, and the dread fear of famine, too remote to hear the King, were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators, creeping from rank to rank; and already they begun to sway and move, and sweep slowly down towards the King. Recovering his surprise, the Norman again neared Gryffyth, and began to re-urge his mission of peace. But the chief waived him back sternly, and said aloud, though in Saxon:?' No secrets can pass between Harold and me. Thus much alone, take thou back as answer:?I thank the Earl, for myself, my Queen, and my people. Noble have been his courtesies as foe; as foe I thank him?as King, defy. The torque he hath returned to my hand, he shall see again ere the sun set. Messengers, ye aro answered: withdraw and speed fast, that we may pass not your steps on the road.' The monk sighed, and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle; nnd a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there, that the King was alone in his fierce defiance. Then lifting again the rood, he turned away, and with him went the Norman."" The above, and nearly all that belongs to it, is invention,?and very admirably invented it is. We know nothing much more animating and inspiring than the whole that relates to the Cat-King (as GryfTyth is called by the Norman), his struggles, his defeats, and his suffering.*. We venture to think that Sir E. B. Lytton w much mistaken when he represents, not merely the clergy, but the young soldiers and courtiers of the reign of the Confessor as well acquainted with the literature of Greece and Rome. It is true that as regards abbots and monks he is, in compensation, very severe. He does justice to such ecclesiastics as Lanfranc and Aclred; but he makes an abbot who figures prominently in one or two scenes ignorant ofthe commonest rudiments of Latin,?while a younger brother in his company is lost in wonder at the learning of his superior. The following is a short part of their dialogue.? ""' The King's Norman favourites at least honoured the Church.'?' That is true,' said an abbot, 4 and, an it were not for two things, I should love the Norman better than the Saxon.'?' What are they, my father ?'?asked an aspiring young monk.?. 'Inprints,"" quoth the abbot, proud of the one Latin word he thought he knew, but that, as we see, was an error; 'they cannot speak so as to be understood, and I fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning.' Here was a sanctified groan:?'Count William himself spoke to me in Latin !' continued the abbot, raising his eyebrows.?' Did he ??Wonderful !' exclaimed several voices. 'And what did you answer, holy father?'?'Marry,'said the abbot solemnly, 'I replied, ""Inprinis.""'?'Good!' said the young monk, with a look of profound admiration."" We have introduced this extract by way of contrast with the learning attributed to other classes. Even of GryfTyth, the Cat-King of Wales, we are told that ""his mind had turned from the literature of Rome to the legends and songs and chronicles of his land;"" nnd other personages, both Saxon and Norman, refer to Greek and Latin authors with fur too much familiarity. Homeric fables and Homeric personages are mentioned and alluded to by the characters; and though we may be willing to admit that more learning existed among our Anglo-Saxon forefathers than has by many been supposed, yet we most seriously doubt whether it is consistent with the state of knowledge of the time to put quotations from Horace into the mouth of a young soldier,?still more, that he should employ such in conversation with a rude Saxon from the weald of Kent. Of course, what the author introduces on his own account and in his own person in the progress of the narrative is not liable to any such objection ; and whether it did or did not require to be translated in a.d. 1052, it is quite clear that Sir E. B. Lytton is of opinion that it requires to be translated in a.d. 1848,?for we cannot call to mind an instance in which he has employed a scrap of Latin where he has not done his readers the favour to render it into English. Whatever might be the case in England in the eleventh century, wo are sure that Greek was not studied in Italy even in thc thirteenth century,?and that Dante knew nothing of Homer unless at second-hand. In connexion with this matter, we may here not unfitly notice the great number of Saxon and Anglo-Saxon words employed by Sir E. B. Lytton without explanation, even where explanation seemed most necessary. If the absence of this explanation should have the effect of inducing the readers of * Harold' to make themselves in some degree proficients in the great and noble language of their remote ancestors, so much thc better ; but in the mean time it might not have been improper to have added an interpretation, in brackets or otherwise ? provided it were really necessary that the author should go out of his way to employ terms so little understood by the great body of persons to whom he addresses himself. Sometimes the context will enable the reader to guess what is meant; but generally, we think, he will be quite at a loss for the meaning. We copy a few?and but a few?regarding which, we are confident, even well-educated persons will be at some loss: ?weregeld, lithtmen, ceorl suhcendinen cyst, mane uses, dour, cnehts, quern : which, with many more, are of perpetual occurrence. We say nothing of such words as thegn, which might have been more intelligibly and less cacophonously written thane,?or of zemmes, which Sir E. B. Lytton himself seems sometimes to use indifferently with gems,?but we should like to know what is gained by the rejection of a word having the same meaning and in daily employment. The author seems to have *'crammed"" himself from Mr. D'Eyncourt's folios (as he admits in his prefatory epistle)?and then fancied that matters familiar to him must also be well known to others. This is an ordinary error. The great reputation which the author has justly acquired enables him easily to afford that such minor faults and blemishes should be pointed out. For this reason, we tell him that ne is not to suppose, because he sees in a plan of London of the middle of the sixteenth century two rings marked down for the baiting of bulls and bears, and because the sport may be mentioned by Fitzstephen, that these places existed on the same spot in the middle of the eleventh century. His mention of these rings forms part of a very interesting, but not a very accurate, description of London before the Conquest, in his first volume. The truth is, that we have no sufficient materials for such a description; and on this account we are willing to take Sir E. B. Lytton's fanciful representation,? which is highly picturesque. He is seldom at fault when he relies on himself and his own resources. One instance to the contrary may, however, be pointed out near the end of his second volume; where William, then Count? or Duke?of Normandy challenges Harold to bend his bow,?an exertion to which the Saxon noble is not accustomed, and which therefore he declines. The meaning of bending a bow is not, as Sir E. B. Lytton seems to imagine, the pulling of a cloth-yard arrow to the head after the bow has been strung; it is stringing a bow, ?an operation requiring both art and strength, and dangerous to the weak and the unskilful. Of the story itself we have said little; because the rude outline of nearly the whole of it is to be found in history?if history it deserve, at that early date, to be called. Tlie loves of Harold and Edith form but a small portion of the tale; ?and as that is the most imaginative portion, so iu several respects it is the best. The character of the heroine is delicately and touchingly drawn ; and her feminine sweetness and tenderness are excellently set off by, and contrasted with, the more masculine proportions and appearance of Hilda, her magical and mysterious grandmother,?who, from first to last, acts a very prominent part in all that relates to Harold's affection and to his ambition. She is a very grand personage, who adheres to the Saxon faith, rejecting the Christian creed, and resorts to all the solemn and awful incantations belonging to her ancient superstitious. It must be confessed that she now and then reminds us of Norna in Sir W. Scott's ' Pirate,' and of Meg Merrilies in his ? Guy Mannering'; but it is only for a moment,?and in such a manner as could not have been avoided by the author. What follows is a small part of a scene in which the two lovers and Hilda are introduced, in the second volume.? "" * There is no joy for me,' returned Edith plaintively; 'and I have that on my heart,"" she added, with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone, * which at last I will dare to speak. I reproach thee, Hilda, that thou hast marred all my life; that thou hast duped me with dreams, and lett me alone in despair.'?' Speak on,' said Hilda, calmly, as a nurse to a froward child.?' Hast thou not told me, from the first dawn of my wondering reason, that mv life and lot were interwoven with?with (the word, mad and daring, must out) with those of Harold the peerless ? But for that, which my fancy took from thy lips as a law, I had never been so vain and so frantic; I had never watched each play of his face, and treasured each word from his lips; I had never made my life but a part of his life?all my soul but the shadow of his sun. But for that, I had hailed the calm of the cloister?but for that, I had glided in peace to my grave. And now?now, O Hilda?' Edith paused, and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command. 'And,' she resumed quickly, 'thou knowest that these hopes were but dreams?that the law ever stood between him and me?and that it was guilt to love him.'?' I knew the law,"" answered Hilda,' but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird. Ye are sibbe to each other, some five times removed; and therefore an old man at Rome saith that ye ought not to wed. When the shavelings obey the old man at Rome, and put aside their own wives and frillas, and abstain from the wine cup and the chase and the brawl, I will stoop to hear of their laws,?with disrelish it may be, but without scorn. It is no sin to love Harold; and no monk and no law shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together, form and heart""?' Hilda! Hilda! madden me not with joy,' cried Edith, starting up in rapturous emotion, her young face dyed with blushes, and all her renovated beauty so celestial that Hilda herself was almost awed, as if by the vision of Freya, the northern Venus, charmed by a spell from the halls of Asgard.? ' But that day is distant,' renewed the Vaia_' What mattera! what matters!' cried the pure child of Nature; 'I ask but hope. Enough,?oh! enough, if we are but wedded on the borders of the grave!"" ?' Lo, then,' said Hilda,' behold, the sun^fthTS dawns again!' As she spoke, the Vaia stretchy her arm, and, through the intersticed columns of th fane, Edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward. Presently into the space of the eire! came Harold, her beloved. His face was pale jjiv grief yet recent; but, perhaps more than ever,diiaj.v was in his step and command on his brow, for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of Saxon England. And what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of man as the pare sense of power responsible in an earnest soul??Thon comest,' said Hilda, 'in the hour I predicted; atthe setting ofthe sun and the rising of the star.'?' Vak1 said Harold, gloomily, ? I will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies; for who shall judge of that powet of which he knows not the elements ? or despaetht marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture.'"" The earlier portion of the story is perhaps too much made up of obscure history to be very interesting; and the only incidents in the first volume that may be said really to belong to a novel consist of the return of Earl Godwin and his four sons from banishment, and the declaration by Harold of his love for Edith,?who, as we have seen, stood within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity to him. The incidents acquire a more rapid movement in the second volume,?and the interest is powerfully wound up in the third. They, therefore, who pause and look back when they have arrived at the end of 300 pages will feel dissatisfied; let them wait until they have finished the whole, and their dissatisfaction will then be that they have come to the end of the work. It is not unusual in productions of this clan to find that the person intended for the hero ii not the hero in fact. Such, in a degree, is the case with Harold. In various parts of tht story he is not so much its hero as William, Duke of Normandy, the victor at Hastings; and Sir E. B. Lytton has drawn the character of William with such force and fulness that when ht and Harold are together it is not to be disputed that William attracts more attention, if not interest, than his younger rival. We do not say that the affections of the reader are not with Harold; but the genius, the resources, the mental power and subtlety of William engross our admiration,?and would make us feel certain, even if we knew nothing historically of the issue, that he must triumph. We admit all along the courage and generosity of Harold; but, as the author tells us, his parts are comparatively slow,?and when in Normandy he was outwitted, and would have been more so, hut for the sagacity and penetration of his little nephew Haco. This may be true as history, bot it is not right as art?and here we have a particular example of the difficulties of the historical novel. We cannot go thoroughly and heartily along with any hero whom we expect to set duped, and who we know in the end will be conquered.I{AROLD, THE LAST OF THE SAXoN KINGS. In three volumes. London: Bentley. 1848. It is by no means our intention to enter into any lengthened investigation of the merits of this work, nor is it necessary so to do; Sir Bulwver Lytton is not a new aspirant' after literary honours, but, as we had long since been given to understand that he had' made his last appearance before the literary world, the present emanation from his pen naturally attracts a considerable share of attention; nor is it without good reason that this attention is excited. .The present woi k may worthily rank with its predecessors on the score of merit. Cast long back in our history, the plot unravels itself before our eyes as naturally as if it were a tale of yesterday; our author tells us he had long pondered upon the idea of founding an historical romance upon the Norman invasion, and accordingly having done so, he has rendered the subject completely his own, and has thus been enabled to present us with details minute and graphic concerning that period of our history. The auce was one fraught with interest, as being the last hours of the old Saxon mnonarchy. The legend of Harold and Edith is related, but differently to the received opinion concerning it, and this has been done out of consideration to the younger portions of the reading public, into whose hands such a work may naturally be 'expected to faUl. Superstition has much to do with the agency by which the events are brought"" about, but it would seem almost impossible to discover these superstitions from the' narratives of these times-they were believed in, thought to have a part in every action of life; so that, unless we consent to listen to the voice of superstition, we must not expect to obtain a correct idea of our Saxon forefathers. No terror is sought to be inepired by' these ghostly aids, they are simply used as valuable assistants in times of emergency. The author has succeeded in pourtraying a very beautiful character in Edith; she is firm, noble, and affectionate, loving wvith an unselfish love, that teaches her that the splendour of affection is manifested, not by basking in the enjoyment it affords, butt \where necessary in sacrificing it upon a high and holy shrine. Her love for Harold was too strong to wish to plunge him into danger for her sake, even though it brought her all she coveted on earth-the desire to be near him.. Harold is a very fine creation,' admirably sustained throughout; we may, on the whole, pronounce Harald to be one of the most striking of. Sir Bulwer Lylton's ever striking novels. There is something highly classical in the style, which tells at once of the bent of the atithor's mind, and the high and ennobling studies to which hie has been accustomed.Harold, the last ofthe Saxon Kinqa. vy Sir E. Bulwer Lytton. London, Bentley. 1i a somewhat affected and pedantic dedicatory epistle, Sir Edward flulwer Lytton informs us that this nvwel is meant to instruct the ignorant reader, as well ts to delight the mere seeker after amusement. He also threatens us with a series of similar stories, in which the earlier history of England is to be done into romance4, furnishing what lie considers genuine pictures of old English morals, men, and manners; and exposing to the ignorant eye of his fellow-countrymen the true motives and characters of the great personages who have hitherto been doomed to be described only by p)rofessed historians and chroniclers. A man more utterly inadequate to the task than the brilliant author of Pelhamn we can scarcelv conceive. That one who looks upon Pelham as a gentleman, upon The last Days of Pomopeii as a elaaical story, and upon Lucretia as a tale favourable to virtue, should also look upon himself as brmed tO somprobend the motie of th. dark and the medieval ages, is, perhaps, not a thing to create much surprise; but at the same time we cannot but regard it as a mere literary hallucination, to which we cordially trust that the public voice will give no encouragement whatever. If, indeed, the public find it half such hard work to get through the first volume of Harold as we have found it ourselves, we have small fear for the result. If they smile with us at the author's pedantry; at his amusing patronising kindness towards the simple reader; at the benevolence with which he translates a Latin sentence for the benefit of the unlearned; at the hodge-podge of old phraseology and the style of the Chroniclers, intermingled with the true Bulwerian sentiment and language; at the affectation with which dialogue and narrative is interlarded with scraps of Norman French, Saxon technicalities and names of common objects, and cant ejaculations; if they yawn with us over the author's tedious historical disquisitions, over the Ossianic raptures of Hilda, and his very lively and exciting fragments on verbal derivations, and the literary references which thickly strew his pages; if, besides all this, they can see into the secret bitter dislike of that devoted spirit of religion which, with whatever personal weaknesses, was the animating spirit of the Confessor-King, we have little expectation that the world will petition Sir Edward to continue his coquetting with the muse of history, or to turn the events of our annals into a Salmngundi of truth ard falsehood. From all this, our readers will not suppose that we have found the perusal of Harold, the last of the Saxon Kings, a very pleasant refreshment in the hot weather of July. In truth, we have toiled through its pages with a dogged perseverance; but with little pleasure, and no interest. Here and there, indeed, the story becomes more lively and brilliant; and the volumes are not without many passages worthy of the fame of its author. Especially towards the terniination, when Sir Edward drops more and more his assumed office of annalist, and writes like a man of common sense, his tale becomes more readable and life-like, until, all at once, with the beginning of some new chapter, the style of the modern novelist is laid aside, and a foolish, bad imitation of the antique cast of chronicle is thrust upon the reluctant attention. We need scarcely say that Sir E. B. Lytton's ideas of the religious principles of the time of his story are in the last degree superficial and incorrect. He writes as much nonsense about plriests, and monks, and relics, and Church-services, as the scribblers of the vulgarest tales about Jesuits and convents. His portraits of such mlen as King Edward, and his notions of the sentiments by which he was guided, are as laughable misconceptions of matters of fact as ever came forth from the pen of romancer or polemic. The scene of the monarch's death-bed is one of the choicest specimens of absurdity 'we ever were fated to read. It will please and edify our readers to see Sir Edward's ideas as to how a Christian King dies. "" The King lay for some moments silent, but evidently striving to re-collect his thoughts. Meanwhile the two arch. prelates bent over him: Stigand eagerly, Alred fondly. Then raising himself on one arm, while with the other he pointed to Harold at the foot of the bed, the King said, ' Your hearts, I see, are with Harold the Earl; so be it, je l'octroi.' At these words he fell back on his pillow; a loud shriek burst from his wife's lips; all crowded around; he lay as the dead. At the cry and the indescribable movement of the throng, the physician came quick from the lower part of the hall. He made his way abruptly to the bedside, and said chidingly, ' Air, give him air.' The throng parted, the leech moistened the King's pale lips with the cordial, but no breath seemed to come forth, no pulse seemed to beat; and while the two prelates knelt before the human body and by the blessed rood, the rest descended the dais, and hatened to depart. Harold only remained; but he had passed from the foot to the head of the bed. "" The crowd had gained the centre of the hall, when a sound that startled them as if it had come from the grave chained every footstep-the sound of the King's voice, loud, terribly distinct, and full as with the vigour of youth restored. All turned their eyes, appalled; all stood spell-bound. There mate the King upright on the bed, his face men above the kneeling prelates, and his eyes bright and shining down the hail. "" 'YYu,' he odd dellberately,'I ea ts shal be a nl vision or a fale Malon, pant me, Almigbty One, the power of speech to tell it.' He aused a moment, and thus resum_ t ' It was on the banks of t fm Sene, this day thirtyad. one winters ago, that two holy monks, to whom the gift of prophecy was vouchsed, told me of direl woes that hould all on England; ' Fer God,' said they,' after thy death, has de. livered England into the hand of the enemy, and fiends shall wander over the land.' Then I asked in my sorrow, ' Can nought avert the doom ? and may not my people free themselves by repentance, like the Nmnevites of old?' And the prophets answered, I Nay; nor shall the calamity cease, and the curse be completed, till a green tree be sundered in twant, and the part cut off be carried away, yet move of itself to the ancient trunk, unite to the stem, bud out with the blossom, and stretch forth its fruit.' So said the monks, and even now, ere I spoke, I saw them again, there, standing mute, and with the paleness of dead men by the side of my bed.' "" These words were said so calmly, and as it were so rationally, that their import became doubly awful from the cold precision of the tone. A shudder passed through the assembly, and each man shrunk from the King's eye, which seemed to each man to dwell on himself. Suddenly that eye altered in it cold beam; suddenly the voice changed its deliberate accent t the grey hairs seemed to bristle erect, the whole face to work with horror; the arms stretched forth, the form writhed on the couch, distorted fragments from the older Testament rushed. from the lips: ' Seyuelac ! Sa eac !-the Lake of Blood,' shrieked forth the dying King; I the Lord bath bent his bows the Lord bath bared is sword. He comes down as a warrior to war, and his wrath is in the steel and the flame. lie boweth the mountains, and comes down, and darkness is under his feet V' As if revived but for these tremendous denunciations, as the last word left his lips the frame collapsed, the eyes set, and the king fell a corpse in the arms of Harold."" In an earlier stage of the tale, a similarly exquisite picture of the pious monarch's proceedings is given with all our author's felicity and truth-telling correctness. Veneration for the relics of saints is, of course a fertile theme for ridicule throughout the story; aniA the poor king is painted as ready to sacrifice the lives and I appiness of living thousands for the sake of the bones of the deceased. The efforts of the writer to shew up the Confessor as a drivelling child of superstition are indeed sufficient proof of his inadequacy to the task he has undertaken. The following conversation between Edward and Harold is but one of a whole clas of passages: "" When the son of Leofric had left the chamber, the King rose wearily, and said, in Norman French, to which language he always yearningly returned when with those who could speak it, ' Beaufr~re and bin aimW, in what trifles must a king pass his life I And all this while matters grave and urgent demand me. Know that Eadmer, the cheapman, waits without, and bath brought me, dear and good man, the thumb of St. Jude. What thought of delight! And this unmannerly son of strife, with his jay's voice and wolf's eyes, screaming at me for earldoms I-oh, the folly of man ! Naught, naught, very naught I' '.Sir and king,' said Harold, I it ill becomes me to arraign your pious desires, but these relics are of vast qost; our coasts are ill defended, and the Dane yet lays claim to tour kingdom. Three thousand pounds of silver and more does it need to repair even the old wall of London and Southweorc.' ' Three thousand pounds !' cried the King; ' thou art mad, Harold ! I have scarce twice that s8um in the treasury; and besides the thumb of St. Jude, I daily expect the tooth of St. Remigius-the tooth of St. Remigius !' Harold sighed. ' Vex not yourself, my lord, I will see to the defences of London. For, thanks to your grace, my revenues are large, while my wants are simple. I seek you now to pray your leave to visit my earldom. My lithsmen murmur at my absence, and grievances, many and sore, have arisen in my exile.' The King stared in terror; and his look was that of a child when about to be left in the dark. ' Nay, nay; I cannot spare thee, beau frare. Thou curbest all these stiff thegns, thou leavest me time for the devout; moreover, thy father, thy father- I will not be left to thy father! I love him not.' ' My father,' sid Harold, mournfully, ' returns to his own earldom; and of all our house you will have but the mild face of your Queen by your aide.' The King's lip writhed at that hinted rebuke or implied consolation. ' dith the Queen,' he aid, after a sught pause, 'is pious and good; and she bath never gainsaid my will, and H bath et before her as a model the chate Susanmak, a I, u_ worthy man, from youth upward, have walked in the purk teps of Joseph. But,' added the King, with a touch of hu feeling in his voice, ' cant thou not conceive, Harold, theo who art a warrior, what it would be to see ever beore thea th face of thy deadliest foe; the one against whom all thy sM- glee of life and death had turned into memories of hyssop and gal ?' ' My sister !' exclaimed Harold, in indignant amaze. ' My sister thy deadliest foe I She who never once murmured at neglect, disgrace; she whose youth bath been consumed in prayers for thee and thy realm-my sister ! 0 king, I dream !' 'Thou dreamest not, carnal man,' said the king, peevishly. 'Dreams are the gifts of the saints, and are not granted to such as thou. Dost thou think that, in the prime of my manhood, I could havc youth and beauty forced on my sight, and hear man's law and man's voice say, ' They are thine, and thine only,' and not feel that war was brought to my hearth, and a snare set on my bed, and that the fiend had set watch on my soul ? Verily, I tell thee, man of battle, that thou hast known no strife as awful as mine, and achieved no victory as hard and as holy. And now, when my beard is silver, anrd the Adam of old is expelled at the precincts of death; now thinkest thou that I can be reminded of the strife and temptation of yore without bitterness and shame, when days were spent in fasting and nights in fierce grayer, and in the face of woman I saw the devices of Satan ? "" Edward coloured as he spoke, and his voice trembled with the accents of what seemed hate. Harold gazed on him mutelv, and felt that at last he had won the secret that had ever p~erplexed him; and that in seeking to be above the humanity of love, the would-be saint had indeed turned love into the hues of hate -a thought of anguish, and a memory of pain. The Kling recovered himself in a few momnents, and said, with some dignity, I But God and his saints alone should know the secrets ot the household. What I have said was wrung from me. Bury it in thy heart. Leave me, then, Harold, sith so it must be. Put thine earldoom in order, attend to the monasteries and the poor, and return soon. As for Algar, what sayest thou ?' ' I fear me,' answered the large-souled Harold, with a victorious effort of justice over resentment, ' that if you reject his stit, you will drive him into some perilous extremes. Despite his rash and proud spirit, he is brave against foes, and beloved by the ceorls, who oft like best the frank and hasty spirit. W% herefore some power and lordship it were wise to give, without dispossessing others; and not more wise than due, for llii father served you well.' ' And bath endowed more houses ot God than any earl in the kingdom. But Algar is no Leofric. 'We will consider your words, and heed them. Bless you, beae fr~re! and send in the cheapman. The thumb of St. Jud; '! What a gift to my new church of St. Peter ! The thumb of St. Jude ! -Non nobis gloria! #ancta Maria!The thumb of St. Jude!'"" In nil jlustice, however, we must give a quotation or two displuaying the mrore trutilt'ul and agreeable qualities of tle better parts of the story. Such an one is the scene 'whihi followvs, describing a Saxon dinner of olden da\s: "" A monk of the order of St. Benedict, then most in favour, ushered the noble visitor into the cell of the Abbot, who, after gazing at him a moment in wonder and delight, clasped him to his breast and kissed him heartily on brow and cheek. ' Ah, Guillaune,' he exclaimed in the Norman tongue, ' this is indeed a grace for which to sing Jubilate. Thou canst not guess how welcome is the face of a countryman in this horrible land ot ill-cooking and exile.' ' Talking of grace, my dear father, and food,' said de Graville, loosening the cincture of the tight vest which gave him the shape of a wasp-for even at that early 1)eriod small waists were in vogue with the warlike fops of the French continent-' talking of grace, the sooner thou sav'st it over some friendly refection, the more will the Latin sound unctuous and musical. I have journeyed since daybreak, and am now hungered and faint.' ' Alack, alack!' cried the Abbot, plaintively, ' thou knowest little, my son, what hardships we endure in these parts, how larded our larders, and how nefarious our fare. The flesh of swine salted-' ' The flesh of Beelzebub,' cried Mallet de Gravilte, aghast. ' But comfort thee, I have stores on my sumptermiules-poulardee and fishes, and other not despicable comestibles, and a few flasks of wine, not pressed, laud the saints ! from the vines of this country: wherefore, wilt thou see to it, and instruct thy cooks how to season the cheer?' ' No cooks have 1 to trust to,' replied the Abbot; ' of cooking know they here as much as of Latin; natheless, I will go and do my best with the stew-pans. Meanwhile, thou wilt at least have rest and the bath. For the Saxons, even in their convents, are a clean race, and learned the bath from the Dane.' ' That I have noted,' said the knight; ' for even at the smallest house at which I have lodged in my way from London, the host bath eourteonslv offered me the bath, and the hostess linen curious and fragrant; and to say truth, the poor people are hospitable and kind, despite their uncouth hate of the foreigner; nor is their meat to be despised, plentiful and succulent; but, pardex, as thou sayest, little helped by the art of dressing. Wherefore, my father, I will wile the time till the pomlardes be roasted, and the fish broiled or stewed, by the ablutions thou pfferaet me. I shall tarry with thee some hours, for I have much to learn.' "" The Abbot then led the Sire de Graville by the hand to the cell of honour and guestship; and having seen that the bath prepared was of warmth sufficient,-for both Norman and Saxon (hardy men as they seem to us from afar) so shuddered at the touch of cold water that a bath of natural temperature (as well as a hard bed) was sometimes imposed as a penance,the good father went his way, to examine the sumpter-mules and admonish the much-suffering and bewildered lay-brother who officiated as cook,-and who, speaking neither Norman nor Latin, scarce made out one word in ten of his superior's elaborate exhortations. "" Mallet's squire, with a change of raiment, and goodly coffers of soaps, unguents, and odours, took his way to the knight, for a Norman of birth was accustomed to much per. sonal attendance, and had all respect for the body; and it was nearly an hour before, in a long gown of fur, reshaven, dainty, and decked, the Sire de Graville bowed, and sighed, and prayed before the refection set out in the Abbot's cell. so The two Normans, despite the sharp appetite of the lay. man, ate with great gravity and decorum, drawing forth the morsels served to them on spits with silent examination; sel. dom more than tasting, with looks of patient dissatisfaction, each of the comestibles; sipping rather than drinking, nibbling rather than devouring, washing their fingers in rose-water with nice care at the close, and waving them afterwards gracefully in the air to allow the moisture somewhat to exhale before they wiped off the lingering dews with their napkins. Then they exchanged looks and sighed in concert, as if recalling the polished manners of Normandy, still retained in that desolate exile. And their temperate meal thus concluded, dishes, wines, and attendants vanished, and their talk commenced."" Such another is the story of a contest in feats of strength and skill between Duke William and Harold, when the latter went to Normandy to claim the restoration of his kinsmen, who had been hostages in William's hands. "" One day, as during a short truce with the defenders of the place they were besieging, the Normans were diverting their leisure with martial games, in which Taillefer shone pre-eminent; while Harold and William stood without their tent, watching the animated field, the Duke abruptly exclaimed to Mallet de Graville, ' Bring me my bow. Now, Harold, let me see if thou canst bend it.' The bow was brought, and Saxon and Norman gathered round the spot. I Fasten thy glove to yonder tree, Mallet,' said the Duke, taking that mighty bow in his hand, and carefully feeling the string. Then he drew the arc to his ear; and the tree itself seemed to shake at the shock as the shaft, piercing the glove, lodged half way in the trunk. ""I' Such are not our weapons,' said the Earl; ' and ill would it become me, unpractised, so to peril our English ho. nour as to strive against the arm that could bend that arc and wing that arrow. But, that I may shew these Norman knights that at least we have some weapon wherewith we can parry shaft and smite assailer, bring me forth, Godrith, my shield and my Danish axe.' Taking the shield and axe which the Saxon brought to him, Haiold then stationed himself before the tree. ' Now, fair Duke,' said he, smiling, I choose thou thy longest shaft-bid thy ten doughtiest archers take their bows; round this tree will I move, and let each shaft be aimed at whatever space in my mailless body I leave unguarded by my shield.' I No,' said William, hastily; ' that were murder.' I It is but the common peril of war,' said Harold, simply; and he walked to the tree. ""I The blood mounted to William's brow, and the lion's thirst of carnage parched his throat. ' An he will have it so,' said he, beckoning to his archers, ' let not Normandy be shamed. Watch well, and let every shaft go home; avoid only the head and the heart; such orgulous vaunting is best cured by bloodletting.' The archers nodded, and took their post, each at a separate quarter; and deadly indeed seemed the danger of the Earl, for as he moved, though he kept his back guarded by the tree, some parts of his form the shield left exposed, and it would have been impossible, in his quick-shifting movements, for the archers so to aim as to wound, but to spare life; yet the Earl seemed to take no peculiar care to avoid the peril; lifting his bare head fearlessly above the shield, and including in one gaze of his steadfast eye, calmly bright even at the distance, all the shafts of the archers. At one moment five of the arrows hissed through the air; and with such wonderful quickness had the shield turned to each, that three fell to the ground blunted against it, and two broke on its surface. But William, waiting for the first discharge, and seeing full mark at Harold's shoulder as the buckler turned, now sent forth his terrible shaft. The noble Taillefer, with a poet's true sympathy, cried, I Saxon beware!' but the watchful Saxon needed not the warning. As it in disdain, Harold met not the shaft with his sIld, but swinging high the mighty axe (which with most men required both arms to wield it), he advanced a step and clove the rushing arrow in twain. "" Before William's loud oath of wrath and surprise left his lips, the five shafts of the remaining archers fell as vainly as their predecessors against the nimble shield."" On the whole, we should say that Harold is an utter failure. Sir Edward Lytton is not the man for the task. He has not a breath of the spirit of the middle ages within his breast, and thus writes at haphazard when he would expound the motives and feelings of the personages of his story. He sees nothing of their characters and conduct but a few external peculiarities, unlike any thing that ever came across his own limited experience, and associated in his mind with ideas with which thev hand no real connexion whatsoever. He has also adopted a foolsb medley of styles of composition, which destroys the readableness ot his book as much as its incorrectness destroys its historical utility. The result is, that Harold is about as much a picture of Anglo-Saxon and Norman times, as Lord Eglintoun's gim-crack tournament was a revival of the genuine sports of antique days. Added to this, Sir Edward has been so worried by the critics of the press for the immoral tendencies of his previously publishied novel, Lucretia, that he has determined to make Harold a terribly moral (!) book, and bhas converted the connexion between the Saxon king and Edith into a pure, sentimental affection. Anmd this by way of historical accuracy.rZCTXOr. IIHrold, the Last of thie Saxon Kin lrs. B3y Sir E. If. Lo r'roN, Hart. In 3 vols. LJon(don. 184S. Bentley. IIAVING received from Sir E. BUs.ER LYTTON a very polite note stating that he had requested his publisher to send us a copy of his Harold for review, wc should have felt some surprise that it had not reached ius, hut that the same thing has occtirrcd in some halfdozen other instances; proving that it is not an accidental neglect, but the result of that unaccountable and strangely implacable hostility vhich TIiE CRITIC has from the beginning until now encountered from two or three publishers, who have no cause, that we are aware of, for their enmity, as we are not consciotus of having dealt with other than the most perfect fairness with any book to which their names have been appended (luring the five years Tniz CRITIC has been fulfilling the duties of a literary journal. That their hostility, unkind and uncalled for as it is, has not in any way affected our conduct towards them, every reader can bear testimony; for still have the hooks they publish received the same impartial notice, and filled the same prominent kAkce in our columns as if they had extended to us the same courtesy as they shew to our other literary journal, and as other publishers shew to this. Although compelled to borrow their l)ooks from circulating libraries, they have not been either neglected or unjustly treated in our columns; nor, even if the same hostility be continued unmitigated, will any different rule govern our conduct for the future. We notice the fact now, only because the present instance is a remarkable one, and to account to the author and to our readers for a brevity of notice compelled by the inconvenient circumstances under which this review is written. Harold differs materially from any other of Sir E. B. LYTTON'S fictions. It is in its design an epic, and in its composition a chronicle. The author has successfully endeavoured to combine the unity of the one with the individuality of the other. The period chosen is peculiarly adapted for an epic, whether in prose or in poetry. The catastrophe is a great historical event, gradually evolved out of the incidents that occupy the narrative. The interest rises with every chapter, and at the close becomes intense. But Sir E. B. LYTrTO.N has, in this romance, attempted much more than merely an attractive story; he has sought to embody history, to present an accurate as well as a vivid and life-like picture of the times ;-to realize them, as it were, to his readers' imagination and to his own. Hence Harold is something more than a sofa-book. It is a work for the study, and might worthily take its place upon the historical shelf in the library. So careful has been the author to preserve the strictest accuracy in the appointments of his romance, that he has adduced at the bottom of the page the authorities from which his information is taken. So laborious a work may not please the mere novel-reader so much as a flimsy creation of the fancy, but' it will be more valued by those whose approval is most valuable, and will secure for it a more lasting existence. As it is a book which wvill be read by every body, we will not attempt to anticipate their enjoyment by any account of the plot; suffice it to observe that Britons, Saxons, Normans, and Northmen, are introduced with their several distinctive characteristics, giving immense variety to the picture; and that Harold is sketched with a mastery of minute traits of character, gradually developed, which the author has not sur. passed, if lie has equalled, in any former fiction. We present one specimen only THE DEATH OF EDWARD THE CONFESSOR. The King, who had already undergone the last holy offices of the church, was lying quite quiet, his eyes half closed, breathing low but regularly. He had been spechless the two preceding days; on this he had uttered a few words, which shewed returning consciousness. His hand, reclined on the coverlid, was clasped in his wie's, wbo was praying fervently. Something In tOn touch of her hand, or the sound of her murmur, stirre the King from the growing lethargy, and his ""*as oaeni, fixed on the kneeling lady. ""Ah !"" said he, netly, "" ever good, ever meek ! Think not I did ot love thee; hearts will be read yonder; we shall have our guer- don."" The lady looked up through her streaming tears. Edward released his hand, and laid it on her head as in benediction. Then motioning to the ! Abbot of Westminster, he drew from his finger the ring which the palmers had brought to him, and murmured scarce audibly--"" Be this kept in the House of St. Peter, in memory of me."" "" He is alive now to us-speak-"" whispered more than one thegn, one abbot, to Alred and to Stigand. And Stigand, as the harder and more worldly man of the two, moved up, and bending over the pillow, between AIred and the King, said-"" 0 royal son, about to win the crown to which that of earth is but an idiot's wreath of withered leaves, not yet may thy soul forsake us. Whom commendest thou to us as shepherd to thy bereaven flock ? Whom shall we admonish to tread in those traces thy footsteps leave below ?"" The King made a slight gesture of impatience; and the Queen, forgetful of all but her womanly sorrow, raised her eye and finger in reproof that the dying was thus disturbed. But the stake was too weighty, the suspense too keen, for that reverent delicacy in those around, and the thegns pressed on each other, and a murmur rose, which murmured the name of Harold. "" Bethink thee, my son,"" said AIred, in a tender voice, tremulous with emotion, "" the young Atheling is too much an infant yet for these anxious times."" Edward signed his head in assent. "" Then,"" said the Norman Bishop of London, who till that moment had stood in the rear, almost forgotten amongst the crowd of Saxon prelates, but who himself had been all eyes and ears. "" Then,"" said Bishop William, advancing, "" if thine own royal line so fail, who so near to thy love, who so worthy to succeed as William thy cousin, the Count of the Normans ?"" Dark was the scowl on the brow of every thegn, and a muttered "" No, no: never the Norman !"" was heard distinctly. Harold's face flushed, and his band was on the hilt of his ateghar. But no other sign gave he of his interest in the question. The King lay for some moments silent, but evidently striving to re-collect his thoughts. Meanwhile the two arch-prelates bent over him-Stigand eagerly, Aired fondly. Then, raising himself on one arm, while with the other he pointed to Harold at the foot of the bed, the King said-'"" Your hearts, I see, are with Harold the Earl; so be it, je l'dctroi."" At those words he fell back on his pillow, a loud shriek burst from his wife's lips, all crowded around-he lay as the dead. He recovered for a short time, andThere sat the King upright on the bed, his face seen above the kneeling prelates, and his eyes I bright and shining down the hall. ""Yea,"" he said deliberately, ""4yea, as this shall be a real vision or a false illusion, grant me, Almighty One, the power of speech to tell it."" He paused a moment, and thus resumed :-"" It was on the banks of the frozen Seine, this day thirty-and-one winters ago, that two holy monks, to whom the gift of pro. phecy was vouchsafed, told me of direful woes that should fall on England; ' For God,' said they, ' after thy death, has delivered England into the hand of the enemy, and fiends shall wander over the land.' Then I asked in my sorrow, 'C an nought avert the doom ? and may not my people free themselves by repentance, like the Ninevites of old ?' And the Prophets answered, I Nay, nor shall the calamity cease, and the curse be completed, till a green tree be sundered in twain, and the part cut off be carried away; yet move, of itself, to the ancient trunk, unite to the stem, bud out with the blossom, and stretch forth its fruit.' So said the monks, and even now, ere I spoke, I saw them again, there, standing mute, and with the paleness of dead men, by the side of my bed !"" These words were said so calmly, and as it were so rationally, that their import became doubly awful from the cold precision of the tone. A shudder passed through the assembly, and each man shrunk from the King's eye, which seemed to each man to dweeU on himself, Suddenly that eye altered in its cold beam; suddenly the voice changed its deliberate accent; the grey hairs seemed to bristle erect, the whole faWe to work withb horror; the g arms stretched forth, the form writhed on the couch, a distorted fragments from the older Testament rushed e from the lips: ""Sanguelac! Sanguelac !-the e Lake of Blood,"" shrieked forth the dying King, a ""The Lord bath bent his bow-the Lord bath e bared his sword. He comes down as a warrior to s war, and his wrath is in the steel and the flame. 2 He boweth the mountains, and comes down, and darkness is under his feet !"" As if revived but for l these tremendous denunciations, as the last word left his lips the frame collapsed, the eyes set, and the King fell a corpse in the arms of Harold. t"

With all this, 'The Story of Iris' approves Dr. Holmes to be an American writer.?The number of mysterious girls who figure in Transatlantic fiction is appalling.)':' Such a tribe of fine-hearted, poetical, only half- | ! understood damsels exists in no old country, not even in Germany; where young gentlewomen, "" sad as night,""?we hope not "" for very wantonness,""?toy with fancies of suicide, while they- are knitting their antimacassars,?where Lotte sitteth with her hand clasped in Jennys, during a whole coffee-visit or garden-party, in rapt indifference to the males who stream past in a cloud of smoke. "" Iris"" is j ei the Una of the boarding-house iu which the scene I ""' of this volume is laid,?Dr. Holmes, in an jl imaginary character, describing himself as also j ?' a dweller in one of those household societies j ' which, so far as we can read the riddle, imply !.. companionship without affinity?intimacy,with i 8, no real confidence. Besides the mystery of 18 "" Iris "" who keeps* a book tight locked, j b which contains some very pleasant verse, as | g we shall show,? his boarding-house contains t a more dismal curiosity,?a deformed man,? | b to whom this girl clings with the love of pity, ^ and whose bodily trials end in gradually * engaging for him the sympathy of all his com- j 5 Eanions in the house. Yet some of these are of | c omespun quality enough; for instance, the I , young man here to be introduced to the polite reader under the name of "" John"":? ""The young man, John, asked me to come up one day and try some 'Old Burbon,' which lc he said was Al. On asking him what was ! t the nmnber of his room, he answered, that it was 1i forty-'leven, sky parlour floor, but that I shouldn't | - find it, if he didn't go ahead to show me the way. I followed him to his habitat, being very willing ' to see in what kind of warren he burrowed, and j; thinking I might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity. Mighty close quarters they were where the young man John bestowed himself and his furniture ; this last consisting of a bed, a chair, a bureau, a trunk, and numerous pegs with coats and 'pants' and ' vests'?as he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons, or trousers, ?hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them. Several prints were pinned up unframed,?among them that grand national portrait-piece, ' Barnum presenting Ossian E. Dodge to Jenny Lind,' and a picture of a famous trot, in which 1 admired anew the cabalistic air of that imposing array of expressions, and especially the italicized word,' Dan Mace names b. h. Major Slocum,' and ' Hiram Woodruff nam es g. m. Lady Smith.'?'Best three in five. Time: 2.40, 2.46, 2.50.' * * I say, Governor,? broke in the young man John,?them hosses'll stay jest as well, if you'll only sat down. I've had 'em this year, and they haven't stirred.?He spoke, and handed the chair towards me,?seating himself, at the same time, on the end of the bed. You have lived in this house some time??I said, ?with a note of interrogation at the end of the statement. Do I look as if I'd lost much flesh ?? B?id he,?answering my question by another. No, ?aid I;?for that matter, I think you do credit to 'the bountifully furnished table of the excellent lady who provides so liberally for the company that meets around her hospitable board.' [The sentence in quotation-marks was from one of those dis- interested editorials in small type, which I suspect to have been furnished by a friend of the landlady's, and paid for as an advertisement.] * * It a'n't the feed,?said the young man John,?it's the old woman's looks when a fellah lays it in too strong. The feed's well enough. After geese have got tough, _' turkeys have got strong, V lamb's got old, 'n' veal's pretty nigh beef, 'n' sparragrass's growin' tall 'n' shm 'n scattery about the head, 'n' green peas are gettin' so big 'n' hard they'd be dangerous if you fired 'em out of a revolver, we get hold of all them delicacies of the season. But it's too much like feedin' on live folks and devourin' widdah's substance, to lay yourself out in the eatin' way, when a fellah's as hungry as the chap that said a turkey was too much tor one 'n' not enough for two. I cant help lookin' at the old woman. Corned-beef-days she's tolerable calm. Roastin'days she worries some, 'n' keeps a sharp eye on the chap that carves. But when there's anything in the poultry line, it Reems to hurt her feelins so to see the knife goin' into the breast, and joints comin' to pieces, that there's no comfort in eatin'. When I cut up an old fowl and help the boarders, I always feel as if I ought to say, Won't you have a slice of Widdah??instead of chicken. The young man John fell into a train of reflections which ended in his producing a Bologna sausage, a plate of'crackers,' as we Boston folks call certain biscuits, and the j bottle of whisky described as being A 1. Under j the influence of the crackers and sausage, he grew ! cordial and communicative. It was time, I thought, j to sound him as to those of our boarders who had I excited my curiosity. What do you think of our young Iris??I began. Fust-rate little filly;?ho , I said.?Pootiest and nicest little chap I've seen I since the schoolmarm left. Schoolma'am was a , | brown-haired one,?eyes coffee-colour. This one has i J got wine-coloured eyes,?'n' that's the reason they i : turn a fellah's head, I suppose. This is a splendid - I blonde, ? I said, ? the other was a brunette, I Which style do you like best ? Which do I like ' I best, boiled muttoh or roast mutton'??said the I young man John. Like ""em both,?it a'n't the ,. j colour of 'em makes the goodness. I've been kind j of lonely since schoolma'am went away. Used to like to look at her. I never said anything particular to her, that I remember, but-1 don't know whether it was the cracker and sausage, or that the young fellow's feet were treading on tbe hot ashes 1 I of some longing that had not had time to cool, b j but his eye glistened aa he stopped. I suppose she s I would'nt have looked at a fellah like me,?he said, t I ?but I come pretty near tryin'. If she had said, . Yes, though, I should'nt have known what to do ? with her. Can't marry a woman now-a-days till il ' you're so deaf you have to cock your head like a e I parrot to hear what she says, and so long-sighted y j you can't see what she looks like nearer than arnTsn j length. Here ia another chance for you,?I said, s ?What do you want nicer than such a young lady l, as Iris ? It's no use,?he answered.?I look at them d girls and feel aa the fellah did when he missed t- catching the trout. T'ood 'a' cost more butter to is cook him 'n' he's worth,?says the fellah.?Takes il j a whole piece o'goods to cover a girl up now-a-days. n I I'd as lief undertake to keep a span of elephants,? ?> j and take an ostrich to board, too,?as to marry one of 'em. What's the use? Clerks and counterjumpers a'n't anything. Sparragrass and green peas a'n't for them,?not while they're young and tender. Hossback-ridin' a'n't for them?except once a year,?on Fast-day. And marryin' a'n't for them. Sometimes a fellah feels lonely, and would like to have a nice young woman, to tell her how lonely he feels. And sometimes a fellah,? here the young man John looked very confidential and, perhaps, as if a little ashamed of his weakness, ?sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagon,?a kind of a little Johnny, you know;?it's odd enough, but, it seema to me, nobody can afford them little articles, except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything, and the folka that are so poor they .don't want anything. It makes nice boya of us young fellahs, no doubt! And it's pleasant to see fine young girls sittin', like shopkeepers behind their goods, waitin', waitin', and waitin', 'n' no customers,?and the men lingerin' round and lookin' at the goods, like folks that want to be customers, but hav'nt got the money!"" We return to the deformed gentleman, into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until Death opened the door,?that we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room, and the Professor's speculations on the same. These, if not wholly new, are neatly put, and give a fair idea of Dr, Holmes when he is bent on philosophizing :? "" I have never yet crossed the threshold of the Little Gentleman's chamber. How he lives when he once gets within it, I can only guess. His horns are late, as I have said ; often, on waking late in the night, I see the light through cracks in his window-shutters on the wall of the house opposite. If the times of witchcraft were not over, I should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises. Sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor, that makes me shiver to hear it,?it sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then. Occasionally I hear very sweet BtTains of music,?whether of a wind or stringed instrument, or a human voice, strange as it may seem, I have often tried to find out, but through the partition I could not be quite sure. If I have not heard a woman cry and moan, and then again laugh as though she would die laughing, I have heard sounds so like them that?I am a fool to confess it?I have covered my head with the bedclothes; for I have had a fancy in my dreams, that I could hardly shake off when I woke up, about that so-called witch that was bia great-grandmother, or whatever it was,?a sort of fancy that she visited the Little Gentleman, ? a young woman in old-fashioned dress, with a red ring round her white neck,?not a necklace, but a dull stain. Of course you don't suppose that I have any foolish superstitions about the matter,?I, the Professor, who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any man's bead! It is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies. A man not only believes, but knows he runs a risk, whenever he steps into a railroad car; but it doesn't worry him much. On the other hand, carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary country-village, and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago, and there are rumours of ugly spots on the walls,-the old man hung himself in the garret, that is certain, and ever Bincethe country-people have called it' the haunted house,'? the owners haven't been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noises,?so it has fallen into sad decay, and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof, and the clap-boards have turned black, and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear, and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shaking,-take the man who didn't mind the real risk of the cars to that old house, on some dreary November evening, and ask him to sleep there alone,?how do you think he will like it? He doesn't believe one word of ghosts,?but then he knows that, whether waking or sleeping, his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images. It is not what we believe, as I said before, that frightens us commonly, but what we conceive. A principle that reaches a good way, if I am not mistaken."" Here are some verses out of the book of "" Iris,"" which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic:? UNDER THE VIOLETS. Her hands are cold; her face is white; No more her pulses come and go; Her eyes arc shut to life and light;? Fold the white vesture, snow on snow, And lay her where the violets blow. But not beneath a graven stone, To plead for tears with alien eyes; A slender cross of wood alone Bhall say, that here a maiden lies In peace beneath the peaceful skies. And gray old trees of hugest limb Shall wheel their circling shadows round To make the scorching sunlight dim That drinks the greenness from the ground, And drop their dead leaves on her mound. When o'er their boughs the squirrels run. And through their leaves the robins call. And, ripening in the autumn sun, The acorns and the chestnuts fall, Doubt not that she will heed them all. For her the morning choir shall sing Its matins from the branches high, And every minstrel-voice of spring That trills beneath the April sky, Shall greet her with its earliest cry. When, turning round their dial-track, Eastward the lengthening shadows pass, Her little mourners, clad in black, The crickets, sliding through the grass, Shall pipe for her an evening mau. At last the rootlets of the trees Shall And the prison where she lies, And bear the buried dust they seize In leaves and blossoms to the skies. So may the soul that warmed it rise! If any, born of kindlier blood, Should ask, What maiden lies below? Say only this: A tender bud, That tried to blossom in the snow, Lie3 withered where the violets blow. A fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round tho breakfast - table of the Transatlantic Mrs. Todgers, or to reveal what untied the knot, and cleared up the mysteries of the boarding-house. The book will not be read for its narrative; but it may be taken up again and again, and its pages paused over, for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain. Mr. Prentice is a humorist of a different kind from Dr. Holmes. He is a painfully diffident American editor, one of a class distinguished for their modesty. For something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers; living thus before the public in the columns of those journals. He has collected them all?to forestall others in doing so,?not because he thinks such collections praiseworthy, at least by other men. Some of them, he says, made the Louisville Journal famous, or at any rate notorious; and were exceedingly offensive to individuals, whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature. One merit of the collection in Mr. Prentice's eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own,? original, ? representing the editor himself. Thus he embalms, as it were, some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity. American museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the Yankee Yorick, or lend it out to evening parties, as was done with that of George Frederick Cooke; but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of Prentice's head and its contents, when he was young. Of the more youthful head, with its quips and sharp sayings, PrenticeYorick is manifestly proud, albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing. The world had its Menagiana after the wit was dead, and half a hundred other Anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed. Now-a-days, the initiation has been made in the States for a man to read his own Ana, set up his own statue, chiselled by himself, burn incense to and under his own nose, and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic Figaro, "" Que les gens d'esprit sont betes I"" In all the Anas hitherto published, the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine. The flashes are those of a thunder-cloud; the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning, ? spontaneous; bright effects of natural causes,?words that burn, titterings among contending wits, where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains, and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest. Not of these are the Prentice sayings. They were composed or invented by elaborate process, ?the joke not being the consequent ot' a pre- cedent, but this latter being made for the sake of the former. Thus Mr. Prentice gives us, frequently, only bottled lightning. He maintains, nevertheless, with all the pertinacity of Dennis, that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august Louisville Olympus. "" To express a thought, or a fancy, or a conceit moro conveniently,"" says the trans-oceanic joker of jokes, ""I have put the words into the form of a dialogue, purporting sometimes to be between two politicians, sometimes a man and his wife; but such paragraphs are not less my own, nor less original, than the rest."" Mr. Prentice's own description will thus best characterize the manner of his wit. Give him his time?only let him think?and at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible, if you will only have patience ! This process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent; and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve "" his 'prentice han'"" in this respect, we cannot do better than refer him to the ""Guepes"" of M. Alphonso Karr. Bad, however, as some of these jokes are, that same ""'prentice han'"" is not altogether unskilful?though thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master. The following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work, and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith. Here are half-a-dozen of the smart things whichthe author deems worthy of handing down to posterity:? "" The editor of the-asks if he shall write our life. Exactly as he pleases. Perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura, as iu living such a one as his own."" "" The Louisville Democrat announces the melancholy fact that Gen. Cass has been slain ' by the jawbone of an ass.' Does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death?"" '' A lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses, but she shouldn't break the peace."" "" The earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman; and yet, at one season, he always harrows her bosom, and at another plucks her ears.*' "" An editor in the West boasts that his enemies will find him ' a young David.' Very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaim?Goliar."" ""Several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of Mt. Vernon. Ah, ye miscreants, the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon Washington's.'' "" We know a beautiful girl, who would prove a capital speculation for a fortune-hunter of the right sort. Her voice is of silver, her hair of gold, her teeth of pearl, her cheeks of rubies, and her eyes of diamonds."" The playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality ; for instance :? "" Yesterday the junior editor of the Democrat called upon the senior editor of the Journal to welcome him back to Kentucky. The senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chair?full grown, minus two legs?to sit in ! To sit in! To tumble out of! which he did without an effort. No bones broken, andmatters compromised.?Louisville Democrat. Well, you and the chair had four legs between you, which certainly should have been enough to stand upon. If you insist that we gave you the fall, you must at least admit, in justice to our magnanimity, that we didn't hit you after you were down."" These folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling:? "" The editor of the New Hampshire Patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives. Ah, yes; but, when he dies, will not the fat be all in the fire!"" ""The editor of the-says he almost scorns to deny our charges, 'they are so utterly ground- less.' We believe he generally scorns to deny ' groundless' charges. He prefers confining hima^f to the denial of true ones."" "" The editor of the SouUiern Democrat wants to know what makes us so smart. If we are smart,, it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid ?cant help it."" ""A democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down. No doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well."" The subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented joke,?where there is a lack of truth as well as of wit:? ""An English paper says that a superbly oma* mented whip was one of the presents made to the Princess Royal of England on her late wedding-day. We are not told whether the bridegroom, upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride, looked scared or not. The richest part of the whip was the butt?so we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either."" There are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the Republican wit for the unchivalrous Irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour. Here are some of them:? ""John Mitchel says, in his Southern Ciiizen,thsX this country ' needs a rattling war.' She certainly does not need any more rattling Irishmen."" ""John Mitchel, the Irishman, is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the Hon. John Bell in the U.S. Senate. He is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with Macbeth, 'stop that dreadful Bell.'"" We thought the quotation was from 'Othello'; but they have probably a new Shakspeare in Louisville. The sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words. Again:? "" John Mitchel, who made his escape from Botany Bay, should remember that wheu he abuse* fugitive slaves, he abuses himself."" "" John Mitchel is by this time in Europe. We are rid of him. If he could have had his way, we should Ijave been rid by him."" The ladies, of course, come in for a large share of our wit's notice :? "" The more our ladies practise walking, the more graceful they become in their movements. Those ladies acquire the best carriage who don't ride ia one."" ""A graceful correction.?'The proper study of mankind is woman'?Punch. Woman is certainly wonderfully constructed; we have always loved to study her and get her by heart. Our first lessons were delightful, but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive."" ""A Kentucky editor says that among other presents, the ladies have sometimes given us scissors. Oh, yes, some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors, accompanying the gift with the old motto?' we part to meet again.' Let those beware who, like our ugly neighbour, would come between."" "" A Miss Way advertises that she will debate woman's rights with a Kentucky lawyer in that city, after which she will make a grand balloon ascension from Congo Square.?Exchange. Does she propose to take the Kentucky lawyer up with her? Or does she mean to throw him sky high in the argument and then go up after him in her balloon?"" ""Brigham Young says, in one of his late manifestoes, that' the great resources of Utah are her women.' It is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi* resources."" The last of the half-dozen, and the concluding maxim in the book, may be profitably read on both sides of the water:? "" Oftentimes the ' fastest' young women an th* most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption."" With these specimens of the Prenticeana, our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean, and how it is appreciated by the maker of it. We will only add, that he has annexed a very great number of "" Joe's,"" committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general, ready to take all that is worth having, and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers."
37,B38,"['8868459', '3149957']","The Spendthrift. By Francis Dodsworth. (Grant Richards.) The binding of 'The Spendthrift' is the reverse of engaging; but it is not an unfitting key-note to the contents. It is a novel of the turf and racecourse, and the air of knowledge and truth is the most satisfactory thing about it. One feels that the author knows his ground, that the rise and fall of the youthful gambler are written by an experienced and shrewd observer of certain phases of life. It is a pitiful story, and the nard, unrelenting realism but adds to the pity of it. The spendthrift has no charm of personality or manner ; even his callow youth shows none of the early enthusiasms or generous romance that even modern training does not always entirely obliterate.THE SPENDTHRIFT. By Francis Dodsworth. 6s. (Richards.) "" The Spendthrift "" is a vigorous bit of work. The material is ably put together, and the characterisation is within its limits shrewd and terse. The writer's first-hand knowledge or close study of the Turf will also be counted to his merits at an hour when story-tellers are encouraged to be specialists. Yet we seriously doubt if the book was worth writing. Even as an awful warning, as a soiemn moral lesson, it can hardly reconcile us to its sordidness. It is a much cherished belief that every man's life, if it be honestly told, is worth telling; but it is not the truth. Such a story as this is profitless and without interest. There is no relief to the dreary commonplace of an existence like Devan's. He is without heart, without intelligence, without any stirrings in his being, save the obstinate desire of gain, the obstinate resignation to loss inspired by the billiardroom, the card-table, and the turf. There is no tragedy in his life, which in its miserable end was a paltry fulfilment of its possibilities. Fatigue rather than regret killed him at the last. Some flitting, generous impulses in a woman, some kindly ministrations of a servant, there are. But the woman and the servant are only shadows, and rouse but faint instincts of sympathy in us. Even the least Pharisaical may turn away with a weary expression of gratitude for their unlikeness to this mere betting and gambling machine."

But is a plot a necessary part of a book which professes to be an autobiography ? The life of the average man is neither a tragedy nor a comedy, and it would be hard to find in his autobiography a satisfactory plot. * Joseph Vance * impresses the reader as the truthful record of a life, and as that is what the author intended, we need not lament the absence of a plot. The book is written in a leisurely fashion. It suggests the talk of an intelligent man who has something to say, and all night in which to say it, and the listener must be unusually obtuse who does not find pleasure in listening. There is abundance of humour in Mr. De Morgan's story, and it is found not only in the humorous remarks made by the author, but also in the essentially humorous characteristics of several of the people to whom he introduces us. The reader may fancy that the task of reading will be long enough to be tiresome ; but if he has any appreciation of work that is humorous, thoughtful, pathetic, and thoroughly entertaining, he will not regret the length of the story. ' Joseph Vance ' is fresh, original, and unusually clever. If it is the author's first effort, as is apparently the case, his next book will l)e looked for with interest."

Not a novel in the fictional sense, for this is a study of real life, written with candour, the confession of a woman born illegitimate, out of which there emanates a soul. An unusual thing in English fiction, and the more unusual in that the writer is Irish, Protestant Irish, and the life she records is in Scotland. The whole thing savours of Marie Claire. Here we find a self-educated girl turning novelist. She has great natural sympathies. She writes simply. She has ""created."" We have seen "" Peg o' My Heart,"" the Irish girl, that is, as represented commercially for English consumption. This book is the prose of the picture, only not told commercially, not adapted for the stalls, not written down to a public brought up on artificial burglar heroics or false amatory make-believe; nor have we any hesitation in saying that this book stands right out as among the few that are genuinely worth reading both for its charm and true inwardness. Nothing romantic happens. In place of the usual hero, the usual vagaries, the inevitable marriage, we have the tragedy of a life, its struggles and situations, and in the end the happiness of mind reached by Conscious tranquillity. There is a touching beauty in this work. As we close the book our heart goes out to the writer in a manner very rare in these days of the stockpot novel."

41,B9099,['6793468'],"Memoirs of the Comtesse de Boigne, 1781-181M.. INTERESTING MEMOIRS Edited from the original Manuscript by M. Charles Nicoullaud. (Heinemann, 10s. net.) These memoirs are exactly what memoirs should be?to be of value and interest. No attempt is made to write history; there is nothing pretentious about them, nothing dull. A great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady, whose salon in her day bad a European reputation: the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest; the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be. So she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience. "" If I had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory I should have given up my project, for I desired a distraction and not a laborious work. Hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book, but merely the chatter of an old woman. ... I regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work. I have successively used my pen to rest my needle, and my needle to rest my pen, and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair."" So writes the Comtesse de Boigne. There is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead lady's life, especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered, and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote. There is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production. Death plays too prominent a part. When the Comtesse de Boigne was fifty-four years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen, whom she had been bringing up for twelve years, and whom she loved as a mother. After this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which I had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind. ... I attempted to cheat my grief with this task, undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed. ... The following pages are the result of these efforts, and their object was to drive away the thoughts which I could hardly bear. Begun in this manner, as so many memoirs are begun, to turn the mind from brooding on calamity, the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth. And the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote; she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past; she lived, as it were, through the medium of her work. She lost the personal anguish of things, without losing her interest in life. In this way, as the brave among men and women are wont to do, she turned necessity to gain. There is sadness, too, in the history of the manuscript itself. The Comtesse de Boigne, nee Charlotte Louise Eleonore Adelaide d'Osmond, loved her name, as well she might. And she was childless. From the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew Osmond, who became the Marquis d'Osmond, to be her heir. He was ten years old in 1866 when she died. He came into the possessions which she left him in August 1881, in accordance with the terms of the will on his twenty-fifth birthday. With his intimate friend M. Charles Nicollaud, the present editor, he found the manuscript volumes; there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world. For twenty-five years they remained in the possession of M. Nicollaud, to whom the Marquis d'Osmond entrusted them. During that time death was busy among the family, and the Marquis d'Osmond himself at length died, "" The family name is extinct. The estate of Osmond has been sold piecemeal. The castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed."" But into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated. What is most apparent, is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them. Always it is the grande dame, the royalist, who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them. She makes no attempt to be impartial: she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters. Whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in London, or the last days of the Court at Versailles; or the bivouac of Cossacks in the Champs Elysees at the Restoration: whether she is describing the eccentricities of Sir John Legard, with whom her family stayed in Yorkshire, or summing up the character of such notables as Chateaubriand, or Talleyrand, or Madame de Stael or the Emperor Alexander ?her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness, which can pierce below the surface, and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar. The attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in- the Tuileries, where the ladies of the Empire met the ladies of the old Court after the return of Monsieur. There is a certain ease, a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be. Women of the other class are often shocked at this, consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts. The memoirs of a woman of this kind, who lived through all the upheavals of the Revolution, the Empire, and the Restoration, must be of supreme interest and value. The translation is good. And the notes which the editor, M. Nicollaud, has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness. The present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs. The second volume, bringing the narrative to the Revolution of 1830, is in preparation, and a third will continue the story down to the fall of Louis Philippe."
42,B5236,['6847150'],"The Celebrated Madame Camfan. ""Lady in Waiting to Marie Antoinette and Confidante of Napoleon"" By Violette M. Montagu. (Eveleigh Nash. 15s. net.) ""HORTENSE has a beautiful disposition; we understand one another so perfectly,"" were almost the last words of that survivor of hundreds of wrecked fortunes, Madame Campan. It was because she cottld see the beauty in the disposition of many such people as the Queen of Holland, and because her quick and sympathetic nature enabled her to understand perfectly so many of her friends and pupils, that she has become one of the most interesting figures in French social history. In her wonderful and useful career are interwoven the symbolic bees of Napoleon and the Bourbon lilies of France?both stained with the blood of the revolution and of?as it now seems?useless wars. Long before we begin Miss Violette Montagu's wellarranged and admirably clear account of Madame Campan we are interested in her, but all is newly set forth with skill and leisure, from the birth of Henriette Genist and her acquaintance with the roi bien-aime until the last line is penned and this remarkable woman lies, in 1822, at peace at last in the cemetery at Mantes. The intention of the author of this book has been, as she says, ""to present a faithful picture of the France of the (Eil de Bceuf and of that greater France when no education was considered complete without a sojourn in Paris, that Parnassus whither Napoleon, the master mind, invited the world's most gifted artists, musicians, litterateurs, scientists and thinkers."" This is a bold undertaking, but one for which Miss Montagu would be perfectly fitted but for an occasional efflorescence of style and a slight inclination to wander from the matter in hand. But as her more direct work, "" Eugene de Beauharnais,"" proved, she knows the vast numbers of memoires of the period perfectly, and is completely at ease in later eighteenth and early nineteenth century France. While dealing with the fortunes of her heroine, all the hurrying, pushing, palpitating world of Louis XV, Louis XVI, of the Revolution, of the Napoleonic era and the confused time that followed, are laid before us. How low men were, and how they rise, How high they were, and how they tumble, O vanity of vanities, O laughable, pathetic jumble ! lhat is the sort of picture one sees once more in Miss Montagu's interesting pages. It is true that much has been told to us before; almost all the characters are historical; but the author endows them with new life and adds a thousand little touches, gathered from wide reading or personal observation, which make her story of Maman Campan?for she was a mother to all the great or would-be great ladies of the Empire?fresh and delightful. The reader of to-day need not trouble himself about the rather heavy and at the same time elusive volumes of ""Memoirs"" which Madame left us; for Miss Montagu has adjusted the stilted style to modern taste. The first part of the volume dealing with the Court of Marie iVntoinette is to some extent Madame Campan's own work, wisely edited and assisted by much knowledge gleaned from other and equally useful sources. The second part, which the author calls ""The Governess of the Bonapartes,"" is founded on some of the correspondence between Madame Campan and the mother of Napoleon III, who was, of course, under her care as Hortense de Beauharnais, and among all her beloved pupils the most beloved. The Fates may not have allowed all the girls who were brought up by Madame Campan to prove later very kind or very clever, but the governess at least saw that their minds and bodies were perfectly healthy while she could influence them, and her carefully thought out methods certainly produced many capable, witty women and caused a tradition of wise education to flourish in France even until to-day. Madame herself came of a family famous during generations for their taste for hard work and common sense, for caution and in some cases coldness. But the fine flower of their race, the Henriette of the present volume, combined much knowledge of men and things with wide sympathy, and much warmth of character with wisdom which was both lively and discreet. From the days when, a child lectrice, she entered the Court of Louis XV as the companion of his daughters, to the very end, she held in her heart the spirit of a devoted and unselfish mother, and although her own marriage ?made by her parents, of course?was unhappy, she never failed to make lighter the burdens which others had to bear. At fourteen, Miss Montagu says, her heroine was in danger of becoming a blue-stocking, for she was quick and clever and made much of by the various masters of the arts of the day. Albanesi, the most fashionable of singing masters, taught her the melodies of the alluring Lully, while Goldoni himself made her familiar with Italian. The little picture of her as she comes into prominence shows that the blue-stocking period was soon over. Miss Montagu pictures her entering the great world ""wearing a long train, her slender figure enclosed in stiff stays and voluminous panniers, with her little tearstained face besmirched with rouge and powder."" Her father had given her many wise warnings. ""Whenever you receive flattering attentions,"" he said, ""you will gain an enemy."" Of flattery and enemies Madame Campan had her fair share as the years passed; but her head was always cool and her heart true and sound, and thus she survived?the friend of humanity -?through so many and such various periods of Court life. Her character and her surroundings make her a particularly interesting subject for such a volume as Miss Montagu gives us. It is the life of a wise and sympathetic woman written by another?and such an alliance will always make a delightful book."

Of course, Mr. Yeats's mind is a prodigiously interesting and unusual mind; and well worth exploring ; but when one is following a bewildering path into a cavern one does not like the guiding light to gutter or wobble about. There are moments in this volume when we fancy a bat has flown into the candle. Here, for instance, are two consecutive sentences: "" One night I heard a voice that said : * The love of God for every human soul is infinite, for every human soul is unique ; no other can satisfy the same need in God.' Our masters had not denied that personality outlives the body, or even that its rougher shape may cling to us a while after death, but only that we should seek it in those who are dead."" Even if we drink a glass of cold water and begin again, it is impossible to make a coherent thought out of those two pieces of wisdom. They need Mr. George Robey's interpreting, "" in other words,"" to simplify them. They are the means, however, by which Mr. Yeats softens to us the news that he believes in ghosts. There was no need for Mr. Yeats to protest his faith with such cocoons of *Per Amica Silentia Luna. By W. B. Yeats. (Macmillan & Co., 45. dd. net.) words. We are too eager for knowledge at the present day to be content with derision in place of it. Mr. Yeats says : "" I have always sought to bring my mind close to the mind of Indian and Japanese poets, old women in Connaught, mediums in Soho... .because no authority seemed greater than that of this knowledge running backward to the beginning of the world."" We wish that he had expressed himself always as clearly and beautifully as when he says : "" Faith is the one gift that man can make to God."" It is difficult to catch the authoritative voice of conviction in a remark like the following : "" All souls have a vehicle or body, and when one has said that, with More and the Platonists, one has escaped from the abstract schools who seek always the power of some Church or institution, and found oneself with great poetry, and superstition which is but popular poetry, in a pleasant, dangerous world."" Mr. Yeats is too great an artist to make bogus confessions. He is saying what he means, however elaborate or deliberately casual his prose. He believes that every great man has a Daemon to mingle with his life. It is a Daemon, literally and not figuratively speaking, who inspires every man of genius, the Daemon who is the creator of the work of art. Mr. Yeats contrasts man with his failings in daily life, with man at the divine moment of artistic achievement, and divides them from one another under the names of Self and Anti-Self. Self is the man fretted by everyday vexations and distresses; Anti-Self is the Daemon, maker of a thing far greater than the man himself. It is in his attempted explanation of his belief that Mr. Yeats, like other theologians, breaks down. He bases his theory in his own case on the fact that when he comes home from a dinnerparty where he has talked a great deal, he experiences what one would describe, if one were speaking of oneself, as the feeling that one has talked for effect and made an insincere jabbering ass of oneself. Mr. Yeats describes his sensation thus: "" When I come home after meeting men who are strange to me, and sometimes even after talking to women, I go over all I have said in gloom and disappointment. Perhaps I have overstated everything from a desire to vex or startle, from hostility that is but fear; or all my natural thoughts have been drowned by an undisciplined sympathy. My fellow - diners have hardly seemed of mixed humanity, and how should I keep my head among images of good and evil, crude allegories r"" How indeed ? Did not Charles Lamb talk for a whole evening about phrenology because a fellow-guest had the misfortune to ask if Milton was a great poet ? "" But when I shut my door and light my candle I invite a marmorean Muse, an art where no thought or emotion has come to mind because another man has thought or felt something different, for now there must be no reaction, action only, and the world must move my heart but to the heart's discovery of itself_all my thoughts have ease and joy, I am all virtue and confidence."" It is in such moods of ecstatic confidence that Mr. Yeats sees the vision that he translates for us in his work. He will not accept the commonplace idea that this "" heroic condition "" is his true self. He regards it rather as "" The Lord of Terrible Aspect "" who appeared to Dante and said "" Egodominus tuus "" ?the descent of the Daemon who, when the moment of creation comes, makes for Mr. Yeats what is to him a new personality and to us his genius. "" When I consider the minds of my friends,"" says Mr. Yeats, "" among artists and emotional writers, I discover a like contrast,"" and he cites example after example of men and women who are entirely opposed in their everyday life to the nature that they reveal in their work. There is an actress who is a dove upon the stage and a termagant in private life, a censorious friend whose comedies are full of unpunished rogues, contemporary poets who have been preoccupied with religion in their verse, but with women or liquor in their lives ; and Mr. Yeats refers to Dante's lechery and Shakespeare's "" pottle pot "" with the satisfaction of a man who has scored a point in a debate. But this division into Self and AntiSelf is too abrupt treatment for so complicated a thing as the human mind. It is impossible to divide personality with a butcher's cleaver. One may get interesting generalization as the result, but one will not get truth. If Mr. Yeats's theory were correct, psychologists might expect to find lyric verse behind every swollen nose. The elements of a man's nature cannot be seen as separate things like the two sides of a penny, but are interwoven like the branches of a tree with the air, and the air with the veining branches of the tree."

We have here a volume of five short stories bound up in the form of a six-shilling novel, and there is nothing on titlepage or cover to show that the book te not one, which, to say the least, must tend to confuse the prospective purchaser. The stories are of the usual Transatlantic kind, embellished with choice gems from the Yankee vocabulary, arid have the additional advantage, from the McKinley point of- view, of being printed in the great U.S.A., which te enough to make a peregrinating Martian imagine that the art of printing ? is lost to this benighted country, and that we have not a storyteller amongst us.

47,B44,['6755117'],"The Romance of Sandro Botticelli woven from his Paint- mgs. By A. J. Anderson. Illustrated. (Stanley Paul and Co. ios. 6d. net.) Judging from its title, the majority of readers will doubtless suppose this book to be a biographical work of the accepted order, in which case, however, they will be mistaken. Mr. Anderson has set out on a more daring expedition than a quest of plain or doubtful fact. As he explains in a note: "" The word romance is used in the sense of a fictitious narrative in prose, with imaginary conversations and fictitious incidents, and not in the modern sense of a love-story. Thus the title might be read: ' The story of Sandro Botticelli, reconstructed from his paintings.'"" As it is, the author has given us some very pretty romance, and has told the story, as his imagination pictured it, of the events, loves, disappointments, and triumphs of which the canvases stood as the centre as they became imbued little by little with life and colour. But surely this practice?however successful may be its results in the way of drama and popular interest?is a dangerous one. In this case, the work is interspersed with some really invaluable criticisms and sidelights on those pictures from which the author has drawn his creative inspirations. But the peril remains. Were this method to become common, how many modern artists would go in fear and trembling lest some self-elected benefactor of the dim future should endeavour to reconstruct their lives from some specimen of their art once hung on the walls of the Royal Academy! They would probably have reason for their dread. But even this, speaking generally, does not justify this new departure in the way of romantic biography."
48,B4658,['3218943'],"THE MEMOIRS OF THE MAROUISE DE KEROUBEC (1785-1858). 7s. 6d. (Geoffrey Bles.) The Marquise de Keroubec is so attractive a lady that one would like to know more about her; for her memoirs only contain thirty-two entries for the seventy odd years which they cover. Whether, in this English version, we have them complete is left in doubt, for whereas on the title page they are described as "" extracts from her diaries,"" in the publisher's foreword we are told that "" the memoirs are presented in their entirety."" Nor is any information vouchsafed as to the French edition, if there be one. Except for an occasional foot-note the translator, who is anonymous, sticks to his translating. He does not even comment on the fact that the title of Keroubec is absent from the French peerage books. But these fragments, so far as they go, certainly give a lively picture of the life of a French lady of fashion in the provinces under the ancien regime, and during the early days of the Revolution, as an emigrie in England, with the army of invasion, at Paris, where she went on the stage for a time, in the country again and back in Paris under the Directory, the Empire and the restored monarchy. Readers of Abel Hermant's Confidences d'une A feule will be struck by the extraordinary way in which they are anticipated by Madame de Keroubec's adventures. But although the latter's esprit gaulois is noted by her publisher, she is reticence itself compared with M. Hermant's marquise."
49,B8431,['8771275'],"Vassili Verestchagin, Painter, Soldier, Tra- teller: Autobiographical Sketches. 2 vols. Illustrated. (Bentley & Son.) Mr. F. H. Peters has translated these sketches "" from the German and the French,"" a process which may partly account for the fragmentary character of two extremely readable and spirited volumes. The sketches begin with the author's sixth year, and conclude with reminiscences of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877. Madame Yerestchagin occupies a large portion of the book with an account?which is most characteristic and cleverly written, and by no means overcharged with admiration for the English ? of her journey with her husband through India. In the gentleman's narrative we have him as he sees himself, while the lady supplies a picture which does not differ materially from her husband's portrait. The artist's love for colour and energetic motives, which was manifest in the pictures he exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery, is displayed on every page. Travelling through Central Asia as an attache of General Kaufmann, M. Yerestchagin enjoyed peculiar privileges; and he bears emphatic testimony to the decrease of slavery under the dominion of his countrymen, not only in the territories they have annexed, where slavery is forbidden, and where the markets no longer exist, but in the neighbouring states, where the natives believe, "" not without reason, that the Russians may come any day and pay them a visit, and mercilessly release the slaves, as they always do wherever they go."" Domestic castigation, much affected by the natives, is less rife than of yore. ""The end of the world is coming,"" cried our author's landlord, with a gesture of despair. "" How so ? "" "" Why, what else is one to expect when a husband may no longer correct his wife ? If you beat her, she threatens to go to the Russians."" In fact, the unpatriotic ladies appeal to Caesar, not often in vain. They do not seem to be innocent of intrigues and gossip?vices which, according to the traveller, are due to the degraded social state of creatures who are confined to merely animal functions, and disfigured physically by the labour of a beast of burden. In Central Asia the townswomen are worse off than in Persia and Turkey, but the nomads are freer. One of the most interesting and remarkable sections of this book is devoted to the public displays of dancing boys (tamasha), which occur at the feast of Beiram. It is too long for extract, but will be found on pp. 105110 of vol. i. The complex and comprehensive system of pauperism obtaining at Tashkend, in Central Asia, is almost worthy of a subsidized Irish parish. The account of it is followed by notices of opium-eaters among the Sarts, not materially different from what we know. The Kirghiz falconers are a most picturesque set, and they carry their birds?golden eagles, the text calls them?hooded with leather, and upon their hands; they cast them off in the mediaeval fashion, and use them to kill foxes. Hawks are employed in a similar manner. How Russia has crept upon China is shown in many passages of the book; in none more clearly than the following. The South Tarbagotai detachment of 130 Cossacks (largely armed with flint muskets dating from the beginning of the century) and two guns was in 1870 on the frontier near the little river Bachty. This frontier was very like what farmers in Surrey and Hampshire whose land abuts on common land felicitously call "" a rolling fence."" The detachment was originally quartered in Urdshar, "" whence it has moved gradually forward till it has reached its present station, and has thus extended the Russian frotier by about 100 versts. Between 1850 and 1860 many districts in the neighbourhood of Urdshar still belonged to the Chinese; now they have not a single acre of land within a radius of 100 versts. Thus Russia grows from day to day; nay, from hour to hour."" "" But if it goes on growing like this,"" adds M. Yerestchagin, drily, ""the consequences will be serious."" Here is what our author saw of the results of the Mohammedan rebellion against the Chinese Government in the region of Tchugutchak :? "" Presently large clumps of trees were visible in the distance on both sides of the road, marking the farms, of which there were many round Tchugutchak. About two versts outside the town we Baw several ruined houses and chapels; the paintings on the walls were still uninjured. Some splendid old trees were still standing, but quite dead, for the irrigation canals are silted up and the soil is quite dry. In the town similar sights meet the eye. Wonderful groves and avenues, the work of years, are sometimes completely destroyed or going to decay. As you approach the town it is hard to believe it is empty ; you cannot help hoping to meet some human being, if it be only a robber. But not a soul is to be seen anywhere. The houses are for the most part uninjured, and likewise the paintings on the walls and the wooden latticework of the windows. Potsherds and fragments of articles of every conceivable kind were lying all about?vessels of iron and clay of all sizes, a quantity of copper coins strung on a string, dresses, caps, plaits of hair, shoes of all sizes? the clumsy Bhoes of Dunghans and Calmucks side by side with the miniature slippers of Chinese women. 1 put a pair of extraordinarily small slippers in my pocket as a memento. But, above all, skulls are to be seen lying about everywhere. The town is like a vast tomb, and the whole impression it produces is terrible. I wandered about for a whole day in B.'s company, and then for several days alone, without being able to accustom myself to this stillness as of the grave, and to the sight of all these streets, chapels, theatres, and squares standing for ever empty. The gate of the fortress, which the besiegers had blown in, is still tolerably strong. Near the gate is to be seen the entrance into the subterranean gallery by which the besiegers, after a long and tedious siege, made their way into the fortress. Then came a merciless butchery, in which no one was spared. Skulls and bones lie literally in heaps against the walls here and all around the fortress; at many points, e. g., by several of the gates, the skulls were piled up to a great height. In the fields round the town, too, lie skulls ; as far as the eye can reach, skulls, and skulls, and again skulls. The wolves and the jackals have already done their work ; the ravens are still engaged in picking the bones clean for the sun and rain to bleach. One of the farms in particular which lie nearest the town abounds in bones. A body of Calmucks, fifteen thousand strong, came this way to help the besieged ; but a force of only a few hundred Dunghans fell upon them, drove them back, and killed them to the very last man. What wonderful energy on the part of the insurgent Mohammedans, what cowardice on the part of the Chinamen ! I had enough to occupy me; from the governor's palaoe to the simple little houses of the common people, all the dwellings were habitable, all were painted, all decorated with paintings, sculptures, bas-reliefs, flowers, dragons, <6c. Theatres of an original construction, Buddhist temples in which some colossal idols were still intact (though the Mohammedans evidently showed great zeal in overthrowing these and breaking them in pieces), seemed almost to be waiting for the people to throng in to their prayers and their amusements. For three whole weeks I lived with one Cossack and one Tartar in a wretched cabin outside the walls of the fortress, and every day from morning till evening I roamed about, looking at everything, drawing and painting. Occasionally a wild goat would stray into the courtyard where I was painting, stand transfixed with astonishment, and then rush off at full speed across the steppe."" Making ample allowance for M. Yerestchagin's professional love of effect, and his characteristic delight in strong local colours, here is a picture?one of many in which this book abounds?painted in words by himself. By quoting it we allow the author to illustrate himself, his travels, his taste, and his literary art. The picture, supposing it to be wholly veracious, is not more terrible than that which the chroniclers of the doings of the Northmen in what is now France and Belgium relate of the condition of various cities which are almost within sight of our own shores?Tournay, for instance, which lay desolate for a generation (a.d. 880-911) because the Seople, dreading the sea-kings, fled to Foyon and left Tournay empty. M. Yerestchagin's numerous cuts, mostly figures and portraits designed to illustrate the physical character of the people he met while travelling, are very good indeed, and nicely engraved."

And who that has striven ardently, and laboured honestly, has lived in vain, if it be only for a brief morning hour .'""' The following sketch of various classes ""f women is drawn to the life:? "" Some amongst us there aro to whom life has been a rough soil; they go through it without being loved, and, what is worse, without being able sincerely to love any one. The frostiness of thc air around them chills thc warmth in their breasts; they become bitter and hard ; and as they can produce no flowers, they turn themselves into rods. They cannot leave virtue and beauty at peace, and they quarrel with beauty and weakness. Let us hope that by the light of a moro friendly sun, the tree of their life shall put foi th new buds, and thal they shall receive and give forth gladness. Others there are, iind they are many, whom nature has Modally provided foi ; tiny are good and amiable; they love virtue ; but the world and temptation, unwise counsellors, and their own hearts' weakness, make them fall. The best heall becomes soiled by unworthy desires and low pleasures. Fallen angels! many are there anion*, them who weep bitter tears over the grave of their own innocence, and these may one day arise in renewed virtue. Others there aro who overlay its h-.*s with flowers and mirth; over these weep the angels of heaven. .Many chers are there also whom lianne ?iud fortune made for temptation, but friendly stars have kept watch over them. Their hearts were early attached by a jure love, and a protecting home closed around them liken Midsummer bower. Theil joys and their sorrows are alike innocent, and all their intercourse? with their fellow creatures is peaceful. No one hates thom, and, what is more tranquillizing, no one loves them more or differently to what the Cospel permits. They live loved and honoured, and general opinion calls them patterns iind examples, lint these quietly happy one*, these untried ones, how often do they pass heavy judgments on those who, in an atmosphere ditferent to their own, have fio/en their hearts, or scorched their wings. They fancy that they have a light to despise them; and yet it is possible, after all, that they aro in no way superior to then), except in being happier. Others also are there, thank (ind !? and my heart warms in thinking that 1 know and love such?who, neither step-children nor favourites of nature and fortune, tempted or not templed bylife, resemble each other nevertheless in this, that they never let anything dim the celestial mirror in their souls. Pure themselves, and hating all evil, yet they pity and purdon those who sin. A heaven of pure compassion lies in their glance, and through it only does the guilty one read his judgment. (Sood, true, wise, patient, alfcctiouate, they do not permit themselves to be disturbed by human weakness or severity: they go tranquilly on their way ; iliey have a light within them that guides them, and that warmly, beneficently beams around them. They understand how to compassionate those sorrows they have themselves never felt; and when they stiller, they can yet smile joyfully on others. Like the hird of paradise, they hover onwards over the earth, without disfiguring their wings with its dust, and by their loveliness they entice others to follow on their heaven ward dight. And now hack again-well ! but I had nearly forgotten thc fifth and most populous class of women, and thus, with them, nearly shut myself out of the creation. I do not know how j better to designate them than as ' the hannie.*.*.' We, its members, aro as numerous iis the potatoe, and come, like it, all over the vvoild. We are the world's household fare, and the world would go on badly without us. We fill the room, and yet deprive nobody of a place; we neutralize the warring elements of life, which without us would destroy one another. We are produced by the ju.-te milint, and this our element we seek to diffuse over the world. We call exultation folly, and Sappho a mad-woman. We go to church and to the opera, and don't wish to he much noticed. We take from life exactly what life will give us, iind are contented; we put our houses in order, salt our meat according to established rule; speak moderately good or ill of our neighbour, think only its much as is necessary, and beat down the price of every thing that is much praised or greatly in demand ?in one word we are what arc called 'cipud people,"" and keep the world in equipoise. We sing best this J good song? Tralliiln, tfiillnlii, trallii, trail; Tiiilliila. triillitla, trallom !"" The following scene between Adelaide and lier betrothed vvill give the reader an insight into the character of both :? "" When these amiable women were gone, Count Alarik said: 'The impression made hy personal beauty, is generally acknowledged ; I am the hist who would wish to deny the beneficent inlluence of beauty on the mind, its bewitching power on the heart, hut what works equally with this, and deeper and more beneficially, aro the qualities we hiive just had an opportunity of admiring in Mrs. L. and her daughters, That fine proportion in thc development of the powers of the soul, that clear uiiderstaniiin.:, that precision and order in tho expression and di livery of opinions which instantly muk"" them coii,pr.hen*ii>!ca;'.d clear, these make on mc an impre* mn, c-unl to that of beaut v ; ti:i* colouring of the sou!, it is true, reveals itself clovver, but at the mme time il is not s:> pciishiib!e as that of the body.'

The world moves so joy fully, so pleasantly for tho young beauty, so that it is diilicult for her to seize the seriousness of lifo.' 'And why this seriousness, why must it bc so important to st he it .' asked Adelaide. ' l?ecau*e a human being is called to something more than being merely a flower or ii butterfly ; as such, it is possible to please, to charm, to call forth approbation ; but never esteem nor true love,' Ade!.lid.* looked oppressed, and furs rose to lier eyes. - J.if,. ;,- so pleasant!' said she. ' Cod has given us joy and Iil'e ; why shall we rn i enjoy his gifts? Ah, let us, let us be joyful '.' ' Life has higher ;ind weightier interests.' said Count Alarik with deeper earnc-tness, 'iind which but ill agree with a thoughtless enjoyment of its pa*sing pleasures."" 'There are,' said Countess Augusta,'weighty and important duties to be performed ; man must nut live for himself alone -* 'What do you mean, then,'asked Adelaide earnestly, half anxious, half laughing, * with your importance and your duties ? Is it something out of the llomau history that one must resemble, to be ii human being?' * * Count Alarik looked at lier with an extraordinary emotion. She stretched her hand to him with the nio.-t engaging charm, and said : ?Let me be glad in life and in death! Cod is good; he intends good to us all in joy as in sorrow ; . why should we not ho glad ? Let me not see this gloomy seriousness!"" Count Alarik did not answer ; he pressed the snow white hand to his lips, followed Adelitide with his eyes during the whole evening, but remained silent and thoughtful. Adelaide was grave for a moment, but soon returned to her usual liveliness, and laughed, sung and played with the little ones.'' The description of ii Swedish spring, and its awakening influence on nature and cn man, isa pleasant and life-like picture :?? "" It is spring in the north, and all the town-dwellers iire bidden iis guests to the rural festivity.

Little is known, however, of her personal history, and it is to be regretted that her English translator has not taken the trouble to collect a few particulars concerning the life of an author who occupies so remarkable a position. We believe Miss Bremer was born to affluence; but troubles have fol leu heavily on her family, and reduced her in the spring of life to a state of dependence upon her friends, who move in the best circles of the capital. Her genius has thus been prompted to exertion by adversity, and many touching allusions to her own circumstances may be found scattered through her productions. She resides chiefly at Stockholm. Tlie secret ot her success lies in that truthfulness ?>f delineation which, whatever form it takes, or in v. hat ever manner it makes itself manifest, is always si'.ru to strike home to the heart of a people. She m\es nothing to art, and everything to the depth aud seriousness of a resolute purpose. She is the least .skilful ol all living novelists. She has no notion of consiructiiii' a narrative on anv inlellig;i;.e principle of arrangement; she never dreams of < >mhveiing a series (tl*incidents in natural sequence. Willi her, the end arul aim of thc design is to work out thoronuhly and sincerely the whole passion of the subject h fore her, without embarrassing her progress willi any reference to what has gone before, or what is likely to follow. How she succeeds in raising tho edifice and finally roofing it, must be a grave puzzle to the 'aesthetic' critics of Germany ; for she may be fairly compared to an architect uho builds a house without scaffolding. Vet her looks arc, nevertheless, solid and symmetrical in relation to their ultimate object, and, like all truths lound*.*] in strong feelings and fixed conviction, have an innate energy in them that overrules criticism. Her novels are not. novels of plot or costume, hut of character and observation. lier knowledge of human nature is profound?ol' human nature as it is dewhmed in the world, and acted upon by worldly influences. She paints society with a wisdom rarely brought to bear upon domestic scenes; and she unveils with such clearness and courage the mixed emotions that throb beneath the surface, that the reader derives from the reality of h.-r pictures a sort of artificial experience of life. The volumes before us contain two talcs, or, more properly, a family chronicle divided into two parts. The faults which were so prominent in Miss Brewer's former publications are even more conspicuous in this The interest is broken up and distributed amongst a gre.it variety of persons; the narrative is a progress through a succession of events rather than a compact story; the individuals who move in it are strongly contrasted, and some of them are drawn in sheer wilful excess ; in the matter of plot there is a tendency to extravagance and* romance which is strangely irreconcilable with the good sense and cultivated taste of the author ; and if we add that there is too much German mysticism, and too much of that so-called art-enthusiasm which deals so largely in loose abstractions as to bc nearly unintelligible, we shall have discharged our conscience of every grain of objection that has settled upon it during a careful perusal of these volumes. But how large a balance of praise remains to oe counted up! The minute fidelity of the details; the vivid distinctness with which every mental struggle and secret emotion is traced; the moral beauty and womanly purity which steadily illuminate thc narrative; and thc calm Christian philosophy out of which all its earnest lessons of truth anil justice, and resignation, and serene wisdom, arc drawn, must receive implicit admiration on all hands. The style, occasionally perhaps a little too florid, is generally eloquent and appropriate; and, much as she crowds thc scene with figures, Miss Bremer possesses beyond any other living writer of her cUss, the power of realizing to the imagination every individual she introduces. There is scarcely a single person in her tumultuous groups that does not stand out palpably in his lning lineaments. The President's Daughters occupies only the first volume. Nina, the youngest of the family, engrosses the remaining two. The President is ""a widower with four daughters, and we are introduced on the very threshold of the narrative to this fair household, on whose fortunes the whole story revolves. The narrator is tbe governess to whose charge the orphan* are consigned. "" The first wat a tall, thin figure, with a remarkably plain countenance, and stiff and unpleasing demeanour. She curtseyed coldly and reservedly, and was presented by her lather as * Edi*.' * Adelaide' mas then named, and a yoong, lovely creature .approached me, and beaming with smiles, blushingly embraced me. I thought I had never seen anything more bewitching. ??? Chickens! chickens! my little chickens. Nina and Mina!' now exclaimed the President, and lifted in his anas two of tbe sweetest little beings in the world. Lighthaired, Mae-eyed, rosy-lipped, omlcately-formed were they; and so like each other, that in the bsginoina I could not possibly distinguish them. I was enchanted wah these | lovely ttttlc chSldreo, aad desired nothing more tata to make scqitaiaftance with them. The President did all thal 4?esaMs?**lssj skis afc***; ts* tivy ***** gravely and bairne ts* sstsasksra, sjsylrtsflssfessiftji*^ feat* legged, stiff-armed figures, which I cut out of cards, mediators between us. At sight of these the little ones began as it were to thaw, and presently I wag covered with their carts, their dolls, and their castles, as well as being informed, in confidence, that they thought mv nose very large. "" In the meantime I paid attention to the President, who was conversing with his two elder daughters. Adelaide related to her father the events of the day?the dinner company and the dishes. Edla added a remark or two, and even sometimes upon her sister's words. The President marvelled much at the mixture of * chicken and cauliflower.' For my part, I could not take my eyes from Adelaide; she struck me as indescribably beautiful and pleasing. Her countenance was more round than oval; the forehead high and finely arched; the nose small and exquisitely formed, whilst a"" pair of large dark blue eyes beamed with joy and good-heartedness, and the roses of health tinged both her lips and her cheeks. Her smile, nay, her whole manner, was such as we ascribe to a cherub. She was ot* middle height; her figure finely moulded and her carnage noble ; her neck, her arms and hands, dazzlingly white and of the most perfect form. Her head, which""was adorned with rich chesnut-brown hair, she carried a little thrown back, which gave her an appearance of haughtiness, nay, almost of arrogance ; nor was this contradicted by her manner, however softened that might be by an expression of sincere sweetness and good-will. Beside this brilliant figure her sister showed like a shadow, and I suspected that it was her own sense of this which made her so gloomy."" The foundations of the subsequent interest are visibly laid in these portraits. Kdla, plain, reserved, and melancholy, has no share in her father's affections. The worthy President is a man of conventions, and, without being conscious of an injustice, is devotedly fond of the beautiful Adelaide. A morose spirit is gradually engendered in the heart of the neglected Edla, and from ont; step to another,! the distance between her and lier father widens into distrust and aversion. Passing over a long interval, let us come to the sequel. It is evening; the company juc assembled in the drawing-room; and Adelaide has just sung a song about * Home.' The subject is a dangerous one. 44 * A home !' said Count W. softly, as he crossed his arms on his breast and bowed his head ;4 a home, with a beloved wife?it is in truth a heaven!' 444 Yes,' said the President, * and with an amiable daughter, who in everything seeks to please her father, and provides so tenderly for his comfort and enjoyment.' 44 The tone in which this was said, and the sharp glance he cast upon Edla, caused ali eyes to turn upon her. She coloured violently. I am certain that the President immediately repented his hasty and unfriendly words ; but what was said, was said, and Edla's embittered feelings ro.e hastily to a decree which I should have thought with her to be impossible. She turned to Count Alarik and said : 44 4 You have compared home to a heaven, do you know what else it may resemble ?' 44 lie looked questioningly upon her, and she continued: ?4 A house of correction.' 44 I shuddered at these bitter words. The President started so that the tea was shaken out of his cup. Count Alarik regarded Kdla seriously and reproachfully. 44 Kdla continued with violent excitement: * There is an overseer, and there are prisoners. The fonner assigns work to the latter, and when they neglect it, he punishes them. He exacts the fulfilment of duties, but gives neither the tenderness nor the joy which makes* duty light. But why complain of it V she added casting up a glance full of anger and despair, * the lesser life is but a counterpart of the higher, and home is an image of the world's order.' 44 i Miss Kdla!' said Count Alarik warningly. 44 The President was violently affected, but restrained himself, and turning to Count Alarik, said with a specious calmness?4 Is it not wonderful, my dear Count, that man so often embitters his own days, and then complains impatiently at the suffering he has himself causer) .' My late \ wife--' (the President became moved, as he almost always did when he named her); * poor Frederica made me ! s the happiest of husbands ; if she had lived she would like- i \ wise have made me a happy father, for she would have |, taught her daughters that mildness and concession which j alone can gain love; she would have taught them to deserve . ^ a father's tenderness, who desired nothing better than to see all his children happy around him, and to clasp them a to his bosom/ I? "" The President was moved, and evidently ready for reconciliation. Not so Edla; the long pent-up poison of bitterness was boiling up in her. 444 Love alone/ she said, * wins return of love. That father who gave his child life and did not give it tenderness, and does not give it joy, has no right to make any claims.' ""'No right?' said the President with warmth, and too excited to be able to weigh his words. ' No right! But vou! you can never be wron<*, you must always he right, but it I have no right to claim from you some compliance and obedience, I have at least a right to free myself and my house from discomfort and disquiet For the last three years you have not given me one single joyful day ; you have yourself evidently shown that you despise your father's counsel, and dislike his house; if in future this does not become other than it has been heretofore, then it is best that?that we part!' ""' It will then be my affair,' said Edla coldly and growing pale,' to give place. I shall soon no longer give discomfort or disquiet to any one.' "" She arose, laid aside her work, and was about to go. Count Alarik seised her arm. ' Child !' said he softly,* no precipitance! Miss Edla, you are wrong; bethink yourself!' 44 She stopped and looked wildly at him. ' What shall I do?' she asked. M* Yon have been wrong. Confess it Beg your father's forgive neaii' M * No I* saki abe violently, as she sought to disengage her arm; bat Count Alarik held it fast, and eondncting her aside, spoke earnestly to ber in a low voice."" # The bitterness of ?dla*s life is now converted into a shape of real suffering.

"" 4 You !' said the President, not without bitterness,4y? have more important things to attend to;?remain you wiri your studies, your books, your Plato.' 44 Elda was hurt, and made a movement as if to draw herself back ; but conquering herself, she weut near, and begged with tearful eyes : 44 4 Let me go with you?let me take care of papa! I will willingly leave everything for that.' 44 4 I do not exact,' said the President coldly,4 such great sacrifices from my children ; I do not ask that they should leave their pleasures for my comfort. I did so before,perhaps ; but I have seen I was wrong. Remain you wuk your books, Edla.' 44 This moment was decisive. I trembled for fear thr Edla's wounded feelings might prevent her from making a new trial on the President's heart; I feared that this moment would for ever divide father and daughter from each other. But Edla drew herself a little farther off, and said mildly? ??4 And if my books admonish me of my duty ? And i that goodness papa has shown me has made this duty dearer to me than everything else?' She stopned; the President said nothing. ""41 shall not ask more,' she continued ; ' I shall not be obtrusive. Papa does not love me, and I know that I have not been in the right?I hare not deserved to be loved; but?but I would if I could make up-.' She stopped again. 44 * The fault has been mutual, Edla,' said the President with cold friendliness. ' I have no right to expect love from you, when I have not made you happy; and it would be egotism of me were I now to avail myself of what your sentiment of duty offers.' 444 Oh, this is hard?very hard!' said EdUwithdeej pain, but without bitterness. She drew herself back, and was about to leave the room. . 44 4 Edla!' called the President hastily, as he turned and stretched his arms towards her; 4 Edla, my child.con* here!' Large tears stood in his eyes. Edla threw nerseii weeping on his bosom. _^j^ 44 A silent, long, and heartfelt embrace succeeded, on which the angels smiled. ^ .. . -^ ""' Forgive?forgive?my child !? said the President wita a broken voice; ?I wanted to try you.

""Clara's father was a learned man, but a dry one?a nerfect encyclopedist, whose heart dries itself up into an Article. Her mother was a lovely woman, full of heart and spirit, of gentle birth, endowed with a proud mind, and more than that, with a blind enthusiasm. There are prosaic unbendabilities, as well as there are poetic impossibilities; hrinc these together, marry them in fact, and you have prepared the most wretched household on earth. The deep ind the beautiful may unite themselves, since these have as necessary a connexion as root and flower; it is the most glorious' union that is found in life. But petrified forms and unbridled animal spirits agree like fire and water. Such was the connexion between Clara's father and mother. He loved her at hrst, because she was beautiful and admired hi< acquirements. She married him out of blind enthusiasm for knowledge and science, and because he paid her homage. She hoped every day to made a pilgrimage to heaven; he hoped every day to have a better dinner. Both deceived themselves. From that time he despised her deficiency in knowledge; she his pedantic forms."" I Her domestic code may be summed up in one word?cheerfulness. In another place she reads tbe following pertinent lecture to gentlemen who have incurred the cares and responsibilities of housekeeping. ""Thou who sittest at thy table like a thunder-cloud charged with lightning, and scoldest the wife and the cook about fue dinner, so that the morsel sticks in the throat of the mother and children?thou who makest unhappy wife and child and servants,?though who preparest for every dish a t>itf/r; sauce out of thy gall?shame and indigestion to thee!

May goodwill ever spread the table for thee; may friendly faces ever sit round iny dishes. Honour and joy to thee! "" "" A soft answer turneth away wrath ; but angry ""words stir up strife,"" exclaims the wise man ! From the life of the world, which is too busy and Hurried to let the true characters of men expand, we have this striking apostrophe to the tranquil moments when thc soul has leisure and opportunity to discorer itself.

By John Brown, M.D. (Edmonston & Douglas.)?Printed on fair pages, thc clear type being set oft' by the white of the ample margin, well illustrated and bound in light, glazed boards, Dr. Brown's story of ' Rab and his Friends' (published in the ' Hone Subsecivie') forms a pretty but somewhat too perishable ornament for the drawing-room table. As a delineator, Dr. Brown has much pathetic force, and under the guidance of his heart tells a sad story with admirable effect. His great failing is want of humour,? though, like so very many other Scotchmen labouring under the same deficiency, his chief ambition J is to be esteemed a humorist. As a philosophical critic, the doctor is altogether beyond us. The following sentence we have read over six times with increasing perplexity:?""And though in all works of Art there should be a plus of delectation, the ultimate overcoming of evil and sorrow by good and joy,?the end of all Art being pleasure,? whatsoever things are lovely first, and tilings that are trite and of good report afterwards in their turn,? still there is a pleasure, one of the strangest and strongest in our nature, in imaginative suffering with and for others,? In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering; for sympathy is worth nothing, is indeed not itself, unless it has in it somewhat of personal j pain."" Does Dr. Brown mean that in works : of Art evil and sorrow should be overcome . through thc agency of "" whatsoever things are lovely first, and things that are true and of good report afterwards in their turn""? If such be his meaning, he ought at least to have helped his j rambling involutions, in their task of stating a simple matter in an obscure manner, with an insertion of ""by"" before "" whatsoever."" The story itself has no ordinary merits. The Introduction, in which the author attempts at the same time to be funny and profound, is so awkward and in such bad taste that it will prevent many from reading on. As he approaches the heart of his tale, however, the narrator becomes simple, nervous and powerful. When the honest, time-worn village carrier takes his dead wife in his arms, wraps her in the same white blankets she made long years before for her bridal bed, bears her from the hospital (in which she has expired), puts her in his cart, and drives home over the cold, bleak, desolate moor,?the heart of the reader goes forth after the wretched man, and prays God to take him to his keeping. The saddest tale of human suffering, where the suffering is distinct for human sin, has in it an unspeakable sweetness; and Dr. Brown, who in depicting such sorrow can stir the depths of feeling with the power of a master artist, does a wrong to society when he exercises his ingenuity and pains his readers with attempting to be a humorist."
52,B4001,['3289630'],"THE HERKOMERS. By Sir Hubert von Herkomer. 7S. 6d. net. (Macmillan.) Last spring Sir Hubert von Herkomer published ""for private circulation "" a sumptuous volume giving an account of his family and himself, the main purpose being a study of the artist's father, and the relations between father and son. The book was enriched by 28 admirable full-page reproductions of paintings and drawings relevant to the subject. Apparently a good deal of public interest was aroused, for we have now a re-issue of the work by Mac. millan & Co. Though reduced in size from the original elition, and containing only six of the twenty-eight illustrations, it forms a handsome volume, and cannot fail to prove acceptable to all interested in character and art. As the original edition was fully reviewed by Professor John Adams in the Mlay, i910, number of THE BOOKMAN, it is unnecessary to go into further details as to the subject. matter. A point of some interest is that while the original edition is boldly marked Volume I., there is no indication in this re-issue that there is to be a sequel. It is true that the last words of the book, "" it may be as well to break the story of my life here,"" may be held to promise that there is to be a continuation. But on the other hand the work is certainly complete so far as it goes, and there is no suggestion of the broken shaft. Probably Sir Hubert will finish the book for his own satisfaction, and for private circulation. If this be so there is very little doubt but that a companion volume to the present will be called for by Alessrs. Macmillan and welccwed by the public."

The episodes are stirring and wild and sometimes luridly powerful. Pistol shots are not much less frequent than commas. (Harper & Brothers. 278 pp. 6s.)Lin McLean. By Owen Wister.

The good old days of which he speaks seem to have grown old rather quickly. They were the days of railroads, but before the days of dining-cars. The talk of the people was extremely racy, and one would say that modern idiom can hardly have improved upon it. Whether Mr. Wister is historically exact or not matters little, however. His incisive style fixes one's attention, and town and country, man and beast, and woman too, are all set before one as clearly as in a photograph. The story is not so precise. It is presented as a series of episodes, and possibly the chapters were published separately, as one finds in them a certain amount of recapitulation ; but this may be only for the convenience of tihort memories. Mr. Wister's reputation in America is considerable, and it seems well deserved."
54,B3019,"['8868540', '6657197']","Memoirs of a Highland Lady. LITERATURE Edited by Lady Strachey. (Murray.) We were once shown a picture by Raeburn of an elderly Scotchman, an elderly Scotch gentlewoman, and a beautiful Scotch girl. They were, said the owner, an uncle who had fought under Clive, his maiden sister, and their niece?all Johnstones of Alva, if memory serves aright. That group has been recalled by this most charming book, which, like the picture, suggests a Scotch Jane Austen, much more Jane-Austenish than Susan Ferrier. Its author, Elizabeth Grant, was born in Edinburgh, May 7th, 1797, had an unhappy first love in 1815, was married in 1829 in Bombay Cathedral to Col. (afterwards General) Henry Smith of Baltiboys, lived thereafter in Ireland, and died November 16th, 1885. She was the eldest of the five children?two sons and three daughters?of Sir John Peter Grant, of Eothiemurchus (1774 - 1848), by his English wife, Jane Ironside, whose father was a long ? descended clergyman at Houghton-le- Spring. Sir John Peter, the only son of a doctor, had succeeded in 1790 to the Rothiemurchus property by the death of his uncle. He was an Edinburgh advocate and London barrister, sat as Whig member for Grimsby and Tavistock, and in 1827, having frittered away his 2,000/. a year and gone bankrupt, was appointed a judge in Bombay, and knighted; later he was Chief Justice at Calcutta. These memoirs, written by Mrs. Smith for her children during 1845-67, come down only to 1830, and record her life in London, at Thorley Hall, Hertfordshire, at the Doune in Rothiemurchus on Speyside, at University College, Oxford (of which Dr. James Griffith, one of her numberless cousins, was Master), in London again, in Edinburgh, and in India. They have already been privately printed, and now are generously given to the world, with a brief?too brief?introduction by a niece, Lady Strachey. No book of the kind has proved more delightful. "" If ever I write a novel,"" Mrs. Smith says once, and about 1826 she and a sister Mary did between them produce "" a bundle of rubbish"" for some forgotten Inspector, and received 40/. in return. That rubbish might repay recovery, but a novel by her!? yes, we could wish she had written a novel. As it is, these five hundred pages would set up a dozen present-day novelists, and might have furnished themes to the great poets of the past. Here is one that is truly Wordsworthian:? ""The young people were not of Rothiemurchus. They lived up in Glen Feshie, a great way from our march, and they had not long been married. He was either a small farmer, or the son of one, or merely shepherd to a more wealthy man, I am not sure which, but his business was to mind a large Hock that pastured on the mountains.At the beginning of a heavy snowstorm our young husband departed on his round of duty. The wife was preparing for her first baby ; she was also busy with her wheel, the first work of a newlymarried notable Highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband. She baked the bread, she trimmed her fire, and she busked her house, then took her wheel, and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney, she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winter's night. Ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door, which, poor young thing, she was never to hear again, for he never returned from those wild mountains. They sought him for days ; no trace of him could be discovered. When the snow melted, and the summer flowers burst into bloom, party after party set out in quest of his remains, all unsuccessfully. It was not till late in autumn, when our gamekeeper was on the Brae-Riach shooting grouse, that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure. It was all that was left of the missing shepherd, and his collie lay dead beside him. Deceived by the snow, he had wandered miles away from his own ground, and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot. His widow was past all knowledge of his fate ; her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth, fever ensued, and though she recovered her strength, her mind was gone. She lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband, went cheerfully about her usual work, preparing things for him, going through the same routine as on the day she lost him ; baking, sweeping, putting on fresh peats, and ending with her wheel by the side of the clean hearth in the evening. She would show her balls of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her, and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard. Sometimes in the evening, they said, she would look wearily round and sigh heavily, and wander a little in her talk, but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever. She was never in want, for every one helped her; but though she was so much pitied, she was in their sober way much blamed. The Highlanders are fatalists; what is to be, must be ; what happens must be borne patiently. We must * dree our weird,' all of us."" This needs no praise of ours, for it could not have been told more beautifully. And it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the Highlanders. There was no deep religious feeling among them in those pre-Disruption days; fairy legends, old clan tales, forebodings, and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the Bible. The minister of Duthil possessed only two English sermons, though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety. His brother of Alvie, known as Parson John, used often, for lack of matter, to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers. Once, learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours, he next Sunday, after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text, raised his hands and ejaculated, "" My brethren, it was a' lees I told you last Sabbath day."" The fusion of classes, from duke to peasant, was singular, yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general, whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day, and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited. These were Grants; and of Grants, Grants, Grants, nearly seventy figure in the excellent index, not all of them quite entitled to the surname. Thus there was Annie Grant, the ""accidental"" daughter of Mrs. Smith's great - great - uncle; a bare - footed herdlassie once, she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to Sir John Peter's family, and, marrying an Indian general, became a welcome guest at Newstead and Kensington Palace. The consumption of whisky was vast. At the Doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the side-table, and another was the allowance in the pantry; in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared "" for the first time in the drawingroom to tea?and sober."" The very poorest cottages could offer whisky, and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day. One day a woman "" with a child in her arms, and another bit thing at her knee, came up to the house ; the horn cup was duly handed to her, she took a * gey guid drap' herself, and then gave a little to each of tne babies. ' My goodness, child,' said my mother to the wee thing that was trotting by the mother's side, 4doesn't it bite you?' ' Ay, but I like the bite,' replied the creature."" The book is not purely Highland. Scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of well-known, even great people. Shelley was at University when, in 1810, Elizabeth Grant went to stay there with her cousin. She describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate, and as making, when reprimanded, extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof, so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor. At the Hampstead villa of an uncle, William Frere, she sometimes in 1823 met ""that poor mad poet Coleridge, who never held his tongue, but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing, with eyes on fire, and his silver hair streaming down to his waist."" Edward Irving, too, came there (he struck her as ""very dirty""), and Joanna Baillie, "" a nice old lady."" Scott she was never in company with, and the idea of the Highlands given by ' Waverley' seemed to Her ""utterly at variance with truth."" None the less this passage, under 1817-8, ii interesting:? "" Walter Scott went out very little, and when he did go he was not agreeable, generally sitting very silent, looking dull and listless, unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance. In his own house he was another character, especially if he liked his guests. It was odd, but Sir Walter never had the reputation in Edinburgh he had elsewhere?was not the lion, I mean. His wonderful works were looked for, read with avidity, praised on all hands, yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad. The fat, vulgar Mrs. Jobson, whose low husband had made his large fortune at Dundee by pickling herrings, on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to Sir Walter's son, said the young people were attached, otherwise her Jane might have looked higher; it was ' only a baronetcy, and quite a late creation.' "" Then there are stories of Lady Eldon and her sister-in-law Lady Stowell?one thrifty, one something more. For the first, when her husband was earning thousands a year, would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars, she herself standing at the window of her lord's fine mansion, and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement; whilst the second grudged her husband his clean daily shirt, and used herself to take a night's wear out of the cast one for a bedgown. The future Lady Byron, Burns's ""BonnieLeslie"" (""one of the cleverest women of her age""), Mrs. Thrale, Catalani, Mrs. Siddons, Sir Augustus d'Eete (the original, we believe, of Harry Richmond's father), Basil Hall, John Clerk of Eldin, Jeffrey, Canning, the Abbe Sieves, and many more emerge and disappear. In connexion with ""Prince"" Augustus anice point of etiquette comes up ? that with royalty to dinner one must not have fingerglasses, for nobody ever washes before royalty. Still, after all, we like the Highland folk best. There was old Lovat, who, when on a visit to Cluny in 1809, took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen :? 44 And so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage, and filled it with eggs and a large stone, and there he sat hatching, never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl, and having his supplies of food brought to him. They had at last to get Lady Cluny's hen-wife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their Elace, when Lovat, satisfied he had accomplished ia task, went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them."" There was Elizabeth's great-great-grandfather, Patrick Grant, surnamed Macalpine (1665-1743), who never slept at night without praying for two men, Rob Roy and the Duke of Gordon, Rob Roy having helped him at a pinch to best the Mackintosh. Macalpine, whose soft, white, womanish hands could draw blood from any other man's finger-nails, himself always went about with twenty-four gaily dressed followers ; he was judge and jury in one, and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences. He married twice?first the high-born Mary Grant, and then, in old age, a low-born Rachel Grant, who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the "" Spreckled Laird,"" her stepson:? ** Once, after the service in the kirk was over, poor Lady Rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made, and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husband's grave, crying out through her tears, ' Macalpine! Macalpine ! rise up for ae half-hour and see me richted !' "" She had borne him four sons, the third of whom Elizabeth saw often, for he lived until 1813, or a hundred and forty-eight years from the birth of his father. This was dapper little Capt. Lewis Grant, who was also twice married, and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word, though they occupied the same rooms, and every night played backgammon together. And there was in 1814 a ""very old Mrs. Macintosh of Borlam"" (? Mackintosh of Borium, a daughter-in-law of the brigadier), who lived at Kin gussie with her daughter, the widow of a Major Macpherson, and a comely widow too :? "" The Leddy Borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age, upright, active, slender, richly dressed for her station, and with a pleasant countenance. Her handsome silks caused many a sly remark. She was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom Sir Thomas Dick Lauder endeavoured to portray as * Lochandhu.' There were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country. A cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at Belleville, for he did not deal in black cattle only ; no traveller was safe when Borlam wanted. His wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in, and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime ; seemingly a true suspicion, for the Lady Borlam's silks would stand alone, and she had plenty of them. With them she wore the Highland mutch (the high, clear cap of fine muslin, trimmed in her case with Flanders lace), and calm as a princess, she moved about in her ill-gotten gear. She was a wonderful old woman, keen, merry, kindly, and as cute as an Irishwoman, never tripping in her talk, or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband."" We had marked for quotation a score of other things, as the Dutch-like interior of the inn at Seaham, the floating of the timber to the Spey, the floaters' ball, the eagles (? ospreys) that built upon Loch-an-Eilein, the bediamonded aldermanesses at Margate with their tumblers of brandy-and-water, the middle-aged beauty who ""wriggled about like an eel"" at the mention of any of, her numerous fancied admirers, and the horrible upbringing of the Grant children? icy baths through the winter, the father's whip on occasion, the dark closet, and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten. But we must leave a few lines for faultfinding?a very few will suffice. The type?that of the private issue?is cramped and repellent; a future edition should be in two volumes, with a portrait, if possible, of Mrs. Smith, and with views of the Doune, Thorley Hall, Belugas, &c. Though not without interest, the thirty pages on the tour in Holland might perhaps be omitted, and the sixty on India ; but there should certainly be a few foot-notes, explanatory and sometimes corrective. The Northern Meeting was started in 1788, not soon after 1797; the Eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend, whom to see is madness, and to meet inexorable death; the account of the Sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong, alike by their own legend and by known facts; certain books, like the 'Autobiography of Mrs. Fletcher,' might here and there be cited with advantage; ""a small hexameter"" on p. 125 must be a misprint; and "" expletives is oddly misused on p. 230. But what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 Memoirs.' We admire them greatly, but cannot feel certain we should have loved their author.Memoirs of a Highland Lady: the Autobiography of Elizabeth Grant, of Kathie- murehua, 1797 - 1830. A HIGHLAND LADY. Edited by Lady otracney. (Jolin Murray.) The Grants of Kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of Grant which, by judicious obedience to the powers that were, succeeded'in keeping their lands in the North at tunes when more hot-headed dans were disinherited. Rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods, and the stock which dwelt there has always been a vigorous one, giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history. This book is the autobiography of a lady of the house, written many years later?a sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of Highland gentle-folk in England and at home in the far-off days of the early century. The extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity. One might compare it with the gossip of Dorothy Osborne or the memoirs of another Highland lady of the same clan, Mrs. Grant of Laggan, who told the story of the Prince's arrival at Gortuleg after Culloden; but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity. Miss Grant of Rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the reader's eye. She confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness; she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess; and she is quite open with her dislikes. In its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one, for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family, tells it, too, with no omission of darker scenes, till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin. We hear of the early days in Lincoln's Inn Fields and of the holidays at watering-places; then of the long years in the Highlands, varied with seasons in Edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south; and then, at the last, of the money troubles, consequent upon an injudicious union of Highland hospitality with political ambition, of the Indian judgeship for the father, and of the marriage of the diarist, when ""Eliza Grant"" takes final leave of us. It is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter. The style is without art, but direct, vivid, and at times fired with a genuine emotion. Parts might have been left put without hurting the book; but, as it was originally published for the family, there is reason for its completeness. But even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs, which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory. By far the best are the Rothiemurchus chapters; but the early days in England were not without interest. The children were brought up on a Spartan plan?up at six, cold water summer and winter, and a breakfast of porridge. But they were a set of little madcaps even in those prim'days, and were none the worse for the training. The long journeys between the Highlands and London gave food for child's fancy. What impressed the small Elizabeth in Edinburgh was the "" size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses, and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny."" Nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean, and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere. She meets Lord Lovat, is much impressed, and little wonder, for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen, and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage. In 1810, she went with her sister to Orford to stay with the Master of University, and a dreary place she found it. "" Two facts struck me, young as I was, during our residence in Oxford,"" she writes, "" the ultra - Tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society."" She carried on a child's flirtation with a young gentleman who played the French horn; and she was much shocked by young Mr. Shelley: '?' The ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was Mr. Shelley, afterwards so celebrated, though I should think to the end half-crazy. He was very insubordinate at University, always infringing some rule, the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked. He was slovenly in his dress, and when spoken to about these and other irregularities, he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures, expressive of his humility under reproof, as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor."" Soon after, the whole family retired to the Highlands for good, and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at Kothiemurchus, where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs. On the way to the North the father read Childe Harold (then newly out) to the children : "" I was not given to poetry generally,"" says the chronicler; ""then, as now, it required ' thoughts that rouse aud words that burn' to affect me with aught but weariness; but, when, after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment, saying, ' Thia is poetry!' I felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure."" ? The whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done; and so, too, the account of the simple household and its retainers, among them "" old John Mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires, pumped the water, turned the mangle, lighted the oven, brewed the beer, bottled the whiskey, kept the yard tidy, and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp ?like Daavid'! "" The Grants were a remarkable clan, for the cotters' and foresters' sons had a ^ueer habit of suddenly leaving home, and generally getting somehow or other to India, whence they returned Generals and Baronets and men of fortune. Nothing, indeed, in the whole book is so extra* ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these Highland adventurers, who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize. Distinctions between classes, too, were not rigid in the North. Miss Grant has a deep scorn of the English lower and middle classes, but in Scotland all are gentlefolk?a belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest Grant to his chief. ? And, certainly, we find barefooted Highland girls making great marriages, and every social barrier turned topsy-turvy. There are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages, for Miss Grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words. Take this of the Highland kirk: ""The girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees. I do not know if it improved or hurt the hair, but it agreeably scented the kirk, which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peat-reek, for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the English sermon; they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls; spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste. The old women snuffed too, and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings, their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit; lapses from faith was their grand self-accusation, lapses from virtue were, alas! little commented on; temperance and chastity were not in the Highland code of morality. Both in the Highlands and in Edinburgh, where the family went in the season, there was no lack of great folk to be seen. Across the river at Kinrara the famous Duchess of Gordon?the friend of Burns?entertained large house parties. The writer's comments on people are forcible and plain-spoken. She objected to Lord Tweeddale because ""he had that flat Maitland face, which when it once gets into a family, never can be got out of it."" The account of the old Edinburgh society is entertaining. She classifies it into sets?the exclusive, the card-playing, the quiet country-gentleman, the fashionable, and the literary. She met all varieties?the Jeffreys; Sir David Brewster ; the crazy Lord Buchan, who collected such relics as a tooth of Queen Mary's and a bone of James the Fifth; Harry Erskine; John Clerk of Eldin (about whom she has many stories to tell); and Sir Walter himself. There is also a well-drawn portrait of Canning, whom she met in Holland. She is most fearless in confessing her opinions. She confesses that she found Waverley intolerably dull. Peter the Great she thought only a "" lunatic barbarian "" ; Coleridge, whom she met at Highgate, is ""a poor, mad poet, who never held his tongue, but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing, with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist."" The chief thing that impressed her about Edward Irving was that he was "" very dirty."" She is severe on the two Sobieski Stuarts, and is highly scornful about their pedigree; but one might say something on the other side. Her sister Jane goes to Abbotsford on a visit: ""Jane was in an ecstasy the whole time. Sir Walter Scott took to her, as who would not P They rode together on two rough ponies with the Ettrick Shepherd and all the dogs, and Sir Walter gave her all the Border legends, and she corrected his mistakes about the Highlands."" We h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of Miss Grant's stories. The book is not all comedy, for the account of the final parting from Rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader. But the prevailing tone is a cheerful one, and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales: "" A coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the 'Duke's Arms' at Dunkeld to Blair during the summer season. The announcement read as follows: 'Pleasing intelligence. The Duchess of Athol starts every morning from the "" Duke's Arms"" at eight o'clock.'"" The other is told of Lord Eldin: "" Some one having died, a man of birth and fortune in the ""West Country, celebrated in his life for drawing pretty freely with the longbow, it was remarked that the heir had buried him with much pomp, and had ordered for his remains a handsome monument; ' wi' an epitaph,' said John Clerk, in his broadest Border dialect; ' he must hae an epitaph, an appropriate epitaph, an' we'll change the exordium out o' respect. Instead o' the usual Here lies, we'll begin his epitaph wi' Here continues to lie.'"""

In this volume he takes us to Spain, and offers a love story of old Madrid. ""Two young girls sat in a high, though very narrow, room of the old Moorish palace to which King Philip the Second had brought his court when he finally made Madrid his capital."" (Macmillan. 6s.)The Children of the King: a Tale of Southern Italy. By F. Marion Crawford. 2 vols. (Macmillan & Co.) Ruggiero dei Figli del Re is the hero of Mr. Crawford's vivid and idyllic romance. Ruggiero has no other surname, and needs none. He and his brother Bastianello ? we should call them Roger and Sebastian? could, or at any rate did, trace their descent from a king who had endowed his son with a fief on the Calabrian sea-slopes ; but now they are poor and thrifty boatmen of Sorrento, blue - eyed and yellow - haired, gigantic in strength and stature, Gothic in their simplicity and loyalty. We see them first as gaunt, half-starved lads at the deathbed of their mother, and again inflicting dire vengeance on their mother's tyrant. The first few chapters are told in Mr. Crawford's quietest and most unaffected style, as though it were a mere story of boys for boys; but the introduction of these two orphan brothers is very picturesque and attractive, so that one follows the main romance with consecutive interest. And the main romance is this?that Ruggiero falls in hopeless and hapless love at the first sight of a charming signorina, who is on the point of being handed over, with her fortune, to a needy count, of ancient lineage. Ruggiero's love is revolutionary; it has no limits and brooks no restraints, except that of respect for its object. A few days suffice for its germination and final development; the idyl is cut clear and complete, with no unnecessary touch of the chisel and no superfluous detail in the composition. Mr. Crawford is not always profound in his meditations, but he rarely fails to transfer to his stories the intimate and fultimate meaning of the simple themes which he delights to handle. He has been even more successful than usual in studying the principal characters of 'The Children of the King.'IN THE PALACE OF THE KING. By F. Marion Crawfwd. 6.. tMacmilsn.) Mr. Crawford has deserted Italy to give us ""a love story of old Madrid."" Tr:e scene is the Moorish p flace, the hero the hapless Don John of Austria, and te villain Piuilip the Second. There are excellent materials for romance, which Mr. Crawford uses most artistically. The plat is novel, and the introduction of the blind girl is most effective. The whole story is compressed into less than twenty-four hours, so that character is everywhere subordinated to action. The result is an occasional jerkiness, and a feeling that the night must have been marvellously long. S:ill, the story is so ingeniously constructed that we can omerlook even the improbability of the hero being so readily left for dead. The sc!ne where the heroine falsely confesses her shame to save her father's life is highly dramatic. Indeed. ' In the Palace of the King"" should be really telling if put upon the stage. We have had enough and to spare of the "" sword and cloak "" romances, but this is altogether above the ordinary level.

The "" Realm of Pysclie "" is one of many enclhantments, and not a little illusion. Folly and vanity run riot in certain quarters of it, and there is much winnowing to be done. But one can deal with the present work without qualms. 'Miss Amanda Jones, the well-known American poetess, tells the story of her long and remarkable life in a keen, vivacious style, and her account of the many instances of spiritual interposition and guidance in her career have too many parallels in modern literature to make them seem intrinsically improbable. The book is fortified by an introduction by Professor James Hi. Hyslop, distinguished in pyschical science, who tesifies to the strength and value of the narrative. ( suite apart from the psychical phenomena of whicli the book treats (and which are not for all readers) we found in Miss Jones's recordi much of general interest on the hunian side, as dealing with the views and experiences of an American woman of cultivated and alert mind, with a wvide and mature outlook on life. Those who are interested in fenminine movements will find congenial reading in Miss Jones's account of the career of the "" Women's Company for Working W\'omen, started by a WE'oman."" Men crept in by craft and guile, however, and the Company was '' whirled away.A Psychic Autobiography. By Amanda T. Jones. (W. Rider and Sons. 4s. 6d. net.) THE character of the author, and, to some extent, the spirit in which this book is written, may be gathered from a little anecdote in one of the earlier chapters. "" Wanting religion "" at the age of thirteen, and stirred to emotional enthusiasm at an old-time ""camp meeting,"" she relates that she went forward to the penitent form when the usual invitation was issued, she being the only one so moved. The minister failed to see her at first, but when he became conscious of her presence he prayed, ""O Lord, there has one little girl come, but we're afraid she doesn't know what she's come for."" Thereupon, she informs us, she went home and "" added to her vocabulary one single wicked word."" ? The writer who can tell such a story against herself is no religious or psychic crank, and the rest of the book proves the point. It is a bulky collection of "" experiences "" of various kinds, few of them very startling, but all designed to illustrate various aspects ofpsychic belief. There are the usual well-attested miraculous happenings, including one in which the author saw General Sherman in a nightshirt while Sherman was hundreds of miles away, though no material good, as far as we cari ascertain, accrued from the sight. And there lies our chief objection; prophecies, miracles, and visions alike achieve no practical end Beyond proving the fact that this life is not all, there is more beyond?and that is a fact that needed no proof. There are some exquisite verses scattered about the book, in addition to its psychic and "" psychometric "" incidents."
57,B2396,['6690974'],"FICTION Set in Authority. By Mrs. Everard Cotes (Sara Jeannette Duncan). (Constable, 6s.) A novel which is serious but not dull, philosophic but not dry, full of purpose but not one-sided, is so rare? and especially so among novels written by women?that Mrs. Everard Cotes's new book should be read carefully and intelligently, not tossed aside aa soon as the reader discovers that it is about India and the feasibility of carrying our beloved doctrines ot Liberalism into practice in that strange land. Mr. Broadbent himself in John Bull's Other Island was not so doughty a champion of Liberal principles as Anthony Andover, Baron Tharne, the Viceroy in Mrs. Cotes's novel. In one point, at any rate, he was determined that a favourite doctrine of Liberalism?the equality of all men and all races?should be made real and practical in India; and so, when a British private soldier is supposed to have murdered a native, the Viceroy overrides the decision of the Chief Commissioner of the district in which the murder is supposed to have taken place, and, in effect?though the gallows are never used?procures the condemnation of the soldier for murder. And, after all, there was no murder, and the man who is hounded to death by the Viceroy is innocent. A terrible comment on the application of the principles of our glorious Liberalism to other lands than our own ! But we must not give a wrong idea of this novel. It is not a political object-lesson only. In with the politics is wound a story of men and women, of love and loss and hopes and fears, which displays a number of very cleverly drawn characters, whose thoughts and feelings are of deep interest. The soldier, by strange bonds that remain concealed till the very end, is united by close ties to the Viceroy himself? ancf the discovery adds pathos to the wretched muddle which everybody made ot things. It is not a comforting or exhilarating story, but it is a clever, mature, and thoughtful piece of work that will increase Mrs. Cotes's already high reputation."

The great feature in it is the admirable biography which Mr. Bruce has given us, and the excellent use he has made of the fresh material at his disposal. Much light is thrown upon the poet's poverty and on his mode of life. The neglect of Lord Thurlow to do anything for his old fellow clerk is distinctly proved. Air.

(Longman ft Co.)?A collection of poems by Mr. Story has interest just now, when so many poems are put forth, and such opposite opinions are asserted. The followers of Landor, Browning, and Tennyson would at once denounce Mr. Story?but we fancy that Landor, Browning, and Tennyson themselves would see something in him to admire. Poets are not always irritable to poets, but their followers affect the hostility of a clanship. At the ago of sixty-two Mr. Story collects the labours of his literary life?his poems covering a period of forty years?from 1816* to 1857?commencing when Byron had only begun to assert himself, before Keats had published, and when Shelley was writing sternly under blighting miscomprehension and calumny: when Wordsworth and Coleridge had few readers, and when it was perversely held that poetry should be modelled on something that had gone before. The varied reputations made iu forty years never seduced Mr. Story from the path he originally chose. Beginning life as a Northumberland herd-boy, he was "" literally charmed"" by Dr. Watts; but, springing from so slight a hillock of inspiration, he dashed into a style resembling the minor flights of Burns, then, as now, most keenly loved and appreciated amongst an otherwise unread Northern peasantry. His poems are dated, and usually have some two or three lines of historical gossip which give interest because clearly carrying truth. The first poems are all love?""Mary K-,"" ""To the same,"" ""To the same,"" by the dozen; when other ladies supplant Mary, precisely as we find in Burns. In 1$23 Mr. Story wrote with a grand simplicity of construction, idea, and sequence?of which wo furnish a fair specimen:? In May's expansive ether Floats many a downy cloudSome white and pure as silver, Some edged and streaked wi' gowd. I care na for the gorgeous sight, Though fair aa sight may be; My bonnie Craven lassie Is the dearest sight to me! ?In later years Mr. Story necessarily changes, and devotes his energies to songs of peace and war. Thus, 1853:? We rear no war defying flag, Though armed for battle still; Th* feeble, if he like, may brag? The powerful never win. The flag we rear in every breeze, Float where it may, or when, Waves forth a signal o'er the seas Of?""Peace, Good-will to men I"" ?In the following year the note changes:? Bring out the old War-flag! Long, now, it has lain, Its folds?rich with glory?all piously furled; And the hope of our heart was, that never again Should we see it float forth in the wars of the world. For stUl we remembered the blood, and the tears, Both real?for sight, not imagined?for song, That dimmed e'en its triumphs through many dark years, When it waved in the battles of Right against Wrong! ?We have shown the elements of Mr. Story's volume. As a writer of songs following in the wake of Burns, Campbell, and Allan Cunningham, he has been successful: his songs have for years been sung in "" domestic circles ' and at political gatherings. But they are of a past age, and?for a period at least?cannot hope to contend with ' A Soul s Agonies.' After a time readers may be glad to return to rustic simplicity, and clear their souls with verse fresh from the mountain and the moor. Mr. Story will then take his turn.Thc Poetical Worts of Sir Walter Scott. Vol. VU. Marinion. Edinburgh: Cadell. 'i'nis new issue of the poems of Scott becomes more interesting as it goes on.

59,B8216,['5001346'],"FICTION. T/le Yewacomes. By KV. M. THACKEIAY. Londlo: 3Bradbury and Evans. FEW works of fict ion leave on the reader's mind so strong an impression of reality as this last work of Mr. Thackeray's. Theeasy an(l indefinite, yetcomplete manner in which its persons and personages are gradually set before us, the unforced and apparently artles.s movement of the narrative, tile remarkable naturalness of the conversations, and eveni tile oCCaiSiOI;Ll obscurity of some of the genealogic threads, all conduce to this result and we ask ourselves, like the author in his last pages, can it be that the Colonel and Clive, and Miss Ethel ad Lady Kew, and the Reverend I Iloneyman, and all their associates and1 satellites, are indeedl but thin ghosts an(l shadows ? Vanity Fair is again the stage ; the fashionable world of London, fio!i the p ir sose;q ot the peerage to the tIpp1er stratumi of nik '.e(l folk, who have no grandfathers, or vorse than none; the WVestend, Cilus, C ity. sipply the wcll-accustomied scene, shiftd(I a littic, at duIe seasons, to the country-se:Lt or to Badoen and Rome, with very Slilght glinlmp-~s into Some less haughty regionsstich as a fittertutur's tobacco-smoky chambers in tihe T-iiplem or a middle-class lodging-hlouse !Mlut for the distinctly ""lower classes.' our autihor, Ias ustulal, has not the slighltest manifestatioa of interest or sympathy. Our old aeqtaintauice j.Jeanuics.' inideed, bIing exalted into that grand sphere upon the willngs of plusih, conies occaisionally unler our notice. But, if we should incline to object to tile aitihor's preiliection for Ihigh awl titled company, it must be couit;ssed that he is not wholly owcupied in the contemplation of their virtues and glories; is not much of a flatterer or toady; has indeed, rather a knack of bringing down these nobles to ninepence, and showing that a Countess may be a mean, hardhearted, scheming old woman-a Marquis an empty coxcomb who talks very iudifflerenit English-and that the officers of the Guards, gentlemen of the clubs, titled young ladies of the nobility's ball-rooms, are essentially the same beings as those young bucks, old fogies, and pretty flirts, the natives of much inferior social circles. Higher up are better manners, certainly, as well as better wines and cookery, and every variety of affair is transacted and afterwards ground into conversation, with less friction and noise; for which reasons, no doubt, among others, it is that our author likes to keep good company, and to write about it when he ii bent on pointing a moral and adorning a tale. Besides, if we receive a skilful picture of an actual phase of English society, very important and interesting, and hitherto, one must suspect, inadequately portrayed by novel-writing artists, it is something to be grateful for. Mr. l)ickens's ""genteel"" people are ludicrously ill-coloured; and the crowd of fashionable novels are after a few patterns, originally of no very clear or exact design. Perhaps Mr. Thackeray stands alone as the delineator of modern English aristocratic society. His pictures, most likely, are not faultless. Whose are? A line here may be out of place, a tint there too strong or too weak; but there is quite enough evidence of faithfulness and capability in the artist to make his work a fit subject for serious study. Mf r. Thackeray's qualiheations are peculiar and unquestionable; a gentleman of education and refinement and wide knowledge of the world; a practised writer, with the best style for easy originality and polish of any Englishman living; a deep satirist and pathetic moralist, who, however, is cautious against overemphasis and preaching, sees everything on its two sides, and refuses to run wild either in objurgation or praise; a lover of truth and manliness; a humourist. too, who keeps, as it were, his wheels constantly lubricated with the essential oil of good-humour and quiet drollery; our author, in addition to all this, is one who sits at rich men's tables, who knows well how the Great world is accustomed to talk and think, what are its tastes and usages, its opinions and prejudices; and who can satirise that high-bred community with so initiated an air, familiar and not presumptuous, censorious without boring, that the Great World itself deigns to listen and murmur applause, with somewhat of a new sensation. A man of moral insight and high genius, writing, with clear understanding of his subject, novels of fashionable life-this, indeed, is something new in literature, and deserves to make a sensation. And now, what is the nature of this Fashionable World according to the report of our peculiarly qualified author ? "" Vanity Fair,"" "" Pendennis,"" "" Newcomes,"" these three books are, as far as regards their evidenee on this subject, essentially one. The land is a pleasant land, of palaces and villas, of parks and gardens, of smooth-rolling chariots and highstepping steeds, of fair women and jewelled raiment, of smiles and gay-flowing chat, of splendour and authority, with crowds of obsequious slaves, of hock and claret-and cuisine for its milk and honey-a land of the desire of the eyes and the pride of life. Mr. Thackeray has been there, with observation keener than a native's; and, unless the witness be held dishonest or stupid, we are forced from what he tells us to conclude that Haut Ton is not remarkably wise, nor particularly witty, nor peculiarly liberalminded, nor immoderately virtuous and religions. Narrow prejudices, mean ambitions, pride, vanity, pomp, insolence, luxury, cupidity-multiform selfishness. in short, dressed in graceful manners, and glorified with wealth and the traditions of lofty rank-can it be that any fair analysis of Haut Ton can present us for the most part with such elements as these? Is the Marquis of Steyne a representative personage, and his sister Lady Kew, and the most noble Farintosh? Is Miss Ethel to be taken as a very favourable specimen of the beautiful maidenhood of that rank. and Lord Kew as of the most recommendable kind of young nobleman? Does Love among these ""upper clwases"" usually signify Flirtation, and Life a succession of gratiffeations and various intrigues; and the World a highly artificial stage where ire always play the first parts; and Nature aside-sceneanddrop-scene;andttasugar-plum|and Marriage a convenient arrangement; and Religion a decent bit of conservatislll, sometimes rising into a temporary fashionable amusement, like Potichomanie; and Death a disagreeable topic, and, in reference to one's self, a still more disagreeable occurrence-are these the polite definitions? l It would appear so. Perhaps our author has a spite against the upper classes.? But do the middle get off any better? Rather worse; for they are painted with all the bad qualities of their superiors, with the addition of ungainly manners, and a constant admiration and worship (not heroic) of such as live in a prouder street of Vanity Fair than themselves, A doleful and depressing view of human nature, surely! True, we have Mr. Pendennis's mother' and Lady Walham, who are religious and selfsacrificing, but depictured at the same time as somewhat narrow-minded and tiresome individuals, with a selfishness one degree removed, as it were, an(l blindly devoted to their next-ofkin- and we have Mr. Pendennis's model wife, a great deal too good for him, and whose principles that gentleman, retaining the full consciousness of his superior wisdom, condescends now and again to recognise with approbation, always with the understanding that she is strictly to keep to her own place, and be a model I wife and worship him. The Colonel, the hero of this last book, an elaborate and touching portraiture, is evidently brought up very close to the author's ideal of a high-minded gentleman; and who has read his history and failed to love him ? Simple, kindly, generous, brave, full of prejudices and impulses, he is, perhaps, the most real, and certainly the most loveable, of Mr. i Thackeray's creations. We can regard him as a man whose qualities were very, sweetly mixed, but whose nature had struck down no deep roots, and bears no fruitage of wisdom or encouragement. With tears which do not brighten into fairer weather, but leave a leaden cloud of despondency over the scene, we quit the poor Colonel's bedside in Grey Friars. His son Clive is our novelist's A. I sample of a young man, handsome, lively, clever, generous, good-natured-non u(rsit'eris extra. Hle drinks his full share, smokes immensely, idles in the familiar rooms of Warrington and Mr. Pendennis, and talks slang there and at the Haunt where Fred. Bavham and others have late beer and 'lobster; likes sketching, and does it semi-professionally; goes to Baden and Rome, idles there and lets his beard grow, falls in love with his cousin the beautiful flirt, wishes himself a marquis or duke and hates those who are, sulks over his father's indulgence, marries a plump Scotch girl and her mother, and becomes permanently disgusted with existence. In his companion the youngpainter, John James Tidley, Mr.Thackeray seems to show a sort of half intention to illustrate the value of fixed moral principles and "" the beauty of holiness ;"" but he shies off, is probably afraid of boring his readers, does not feel at home here, and makes the good boy a servant's son, a prott;e and humble companion of Clive's, and of mean and meagre person, as if by way of apologising for his purity of life and simplicity of I purpose. Here, as it appears to us, we touch on ithe worst and central fault of Mr. Thackeray's books. The author, knowing better, chooses to Iwrite as "" man of the world;"" that is his platform (to use a convenient Americanism); his bearing towards virtue and vice is easy and genteel; he is on good terms with either, and patronises both. We do not desire that the I novelist should be intolerant or vehement, or in iany way strain his characteristic turn of thought and expression; hut the question here is of the !most essential of all truths and principles- the !opposite, antagonistic nature of Virtue and Vice. In manifestation they are frequently intricate and indistinguishable, but radically and essentially they are in a state of infinite remotenes one from the other, and on this truth depends all the grandeur, inobility, and awfulness of human life. There can be no compromise between good and evil; leniency to a sinner must not tend to the smallest toleration of his sin. The application of this to the subject in hand will, we believe, be sufficiently clear to thoughtful readers. Where the novelist's lenient pencil evidently works on a firm ground of the deepest and surest principles of human life, all is well; but it is not so with our present author, and tile result we must regard as at least very questionable. We speak thus of Mr. Thackeray as of a high i and influential writer. and we speak with sincere and strong respect for his many admirable qualities; the greater is our desire to see an end of his coquetting between good and evil, bowing low to Truth with a smile or a wink to Fashion in the same moment - praising Pilgrim and Faithful, yet choosing to abide with the pleasant company in Nuditty Fair. ""The chronicler of worldly matters,"" lie tells u4 (Vol. I. p. 365), "" had best be chary of applying hard names to acts which young men are doing in the world every day,"" and so lie is; he talks of blacklegs, debauchees, scoundrels male and female, as "" merry Pagans,"" ""jolly rebels and repealers of the law,"" and is never without an Horatian turn in his moralisings, to the effect how pleasant those wicked days of our youth were, of which we must now in due course (or at least very soon) begin sincerely to repent us! There is more sweetness and soundness of feeling expressed in The Newcomes than in the author's previous writings; his love for good and innocent people is tender and very real; yet the spirit of the book is the same as that of its predecessors, as ""The Kickleburys,"" fur instance, which the Times once attacked for its general views of society, no less emphatically than it the other day eulogised the present production. Let us here take the opportunity to notice a fact which we are not alone in remarking, namely, the striking inferiority (as a general rule, to which there are biilliant exceptions) of the literary reviews of the Times compared with other departments of that famous paper. The best available intellects of the day one would expect to find engaged here; but feebleness, ignorance, and presumption, are the frequent characteristics of a Times review. In a recent article on James Montgomery-an article containing nothing of the least value, and utterly contemptible in point of style-Rousseau is shortly characterised as a "" frantic quack ;"" Coleridge's philosophy and Swedenborg's are both of them termed ""'enormous shamse;"" while, as a slight indication of the writer's familiarity with polite literature, we may mention that he spells the name of the celebrated Edinburgh Reviewer, Lord Jeffrey, thus, ""Jeffery,"" in each of the two instances where he has occasion to use it. Perhaps lie is the same accurate and refined gentleman who not very long ago succeeded in making his great newspaper the laughing-stock of Europe and America, by reviewing Conple's ""Positive Philosophy,"" in despite of title-pages and biographical dictionaries, and carrying the misnomer through his entire article. + Returning to the Newcomes, we have to observe that, like Mr. Pendennis's own history, it is an admirably well written book; the author's tolerant irony, half-pathetic sarcasm, manly tenderness, varied experience, play with soft lambency on every page. Yet the traces of hurried and (lesultory composition are sometimes visible, and the middle portion of the book, concerning "" the Queen of Scots "" and her body-guard, is heavy and superfluous. Mr. Thackeray would do better for his permanent fame, though perhaps worse for his i pocket, by planning his novels with more forethought and finishing them with more deliberation. A great artistic fault in the present work, as it appears to us, is that the Colonel's downfall has no relation to his character; to indicate such a relation truly, subtly, and effectively, ought to be a principal aim of the novelist or dramatist. In conclusion-what this author says of the selfishness of men and women is too true, and to trace and expose the taint through its most cunning disguises is a righteous and useful work; those who read with discrimination and balance may draw valuable instruction from Mr. Thackeray's pages; but, undoubtedly, here is only a part of the truth, and when this is displayed and philosophised about as though it were all, the effect cannot but be unwholesome and degrading upon a large part of the audience. Genuine unselfishness is also an element of human nature, and the examples of it in real life, and in the regions which great writers have the privilege of peopling, are powerful to elevate and purify those by whom they are contemplated. When there is exaggeration as to particulars, as there often is, on the part of him who displays or who contemplates such examples, it is an error on the safe side, a want of nicety in apportionment merely; the central fact that, to put it in the fewest words, ,lMan is the child of God, is infinitely great and important, and admits of no exaggeration. But the hard, material, unimaginative truth (so I called), which is supplied by shrewdness and ""knowledge of the world,"" is a most pernicious falsity. Let us never for a moment forget that the germs of the higher existence to which faith points' are in being and in progress in the present; and that we ought to regard our human nature and existence not only with pity and kindness and toleration, but with wonder, reverence, and devout awe. A grain of genuine imagination (for that power has its moral aspect) is a more enviable and valuable possession than a mine of shrewdness without it. NVe speak of Mr. Thackeray as of an author whose writings deservedly command a large and admiring audience, and will have their place among the English classics. We do not pretend to enter on an examination of their faults and merits, but merely to indicate a certain tendency in them which has impressed our minds in the perusal. That the same general impression will not result to every reader, we can easily admit, for our author is a man of true genius, and his mind works in various and liberal scope. Probably it is a mind not even yet arrived at its fallest maturity and culmination."

It is one of the misfortunes attendant upon the absence of an international copyright-law between this country and America, that our publishers seldom give us the chance of reading an American author in decent type and paper. The reason is obvious. The market is filledwith all manner of spurious cheap editions, that render such an effort much too risky. Hence it is that American literature, which-with all deference be it spoken-should not scorn adventitious aids, is generally associated with dirty grey paper, bad type, small size, and insecure binding. Let any one who ignorantly fancies that such things have no effect upon his enjoyment of an author read Romeo Juliet, published in the form of a dirty tract, which may be had in Holywell Street for twopence; let him turn to his own -large, clear, well-printed edition, and then say whether the poem does not seem to have acquired a new grace, and light, and sweetness that it did not possess before. We are glad to perceive, therefore, that Edgar Allan Poe unquestionably the greatest genius that America has yet produced-is at length offered to English readers in a handy and presentable form, with the accompaniments of clear type and good paper. But it was a bold notion to think of illustrating these wonderful poems. Failure might have been anticipated. at the beginning. It was a priori as impossible to translate the dream-like beauty of Annabel Lee into a picture as it was impossible to set the poem to fitting music; and we dare say a good many of our readers have had their fee outraged by hearing the mystically beautiful lines sung to the strumming of a piano. The illustrations to this volume are tolerable only where they are independent of the poetry e. g., one or two chaming little landscapes by Mr MacWhirter. But, to begin at the beginning, did ever anybody more wickedly burlesque a fine poem than Mr C. J. Staniland has done with the "" Raven."" Did Mr Staniland fancy that this was a comic poem ? We find a hideously ugly boy seated in an ann-chair, before a fire, the room being filled with ghouls and spirits that remind us of the mnag(,ic weene in Der Pieibchutz done iu a cuw!tlty theatre. What these tawdry devils have to do with the weird simplicity of the poem we are at a loss to make out.

Many reputations have been made and have passed since Bret Harte gave us ""The Luck of Roaring Camp""; and hardly one has stood the test of constant production like his.

By James Hannay, 1 Esq. With Twenty Illustrations.?Some of these twenty illustrations are gracefully fantastic. The biographical notice is perversely sentimental. The story of Poe's life was told by himself so largely and loudly to the public by the daily papers of America, that to attempt to colour over its shames with sympathy and apology is idle.? The poems, with their strange, unwholesome, unequal vigour (night-mare verses, if such things can be) speak for themselves. Their writer, apart from his works, had best be forgotten.LITERATURE. The Works of Edgar Allan Poe. Edited by John H. Ingram. Vols. I. and II., containing the Collected Tales. (London and Edinburgh: Adam & Charles Black, 1874.) With jnst so much of the author's works before us, it would be too soon to speak definitively of his character, either as a man or a writer; and hence, although Mr. Ingram's memoir is prefixed, duly enough, to the first volume, I do not think it falls to be considered here in any detail. Mr. Ingram has done his best to clear Poe's name from the calumnies of Rufus Griswold (a gentleman, grim by name, who makes so repulsive a figure in literary history, that he might well have been coined in the morbid fancy of his victim) ; but when all is said, it is not in tho power of man to make Poe altogether sympathetic. I cannot find it in my heart to like either his portrait or his character; and though it is possible that we see him more or less refracted through the strange medium of his works, yet I do fancy that we can detect, alike in these, in his portrait, and in the facts of his life as now most favourably told, a certain jarring note, a taint of something that we do not care to dwell upon or find a name for. The tales themselves are all before us in these two volumes; and though Mr. Ingram does not tell us whether they are there printed in chronological order, I fancy we shall not be mistaken in regarding some of the last stories in the second volume, as being also among the last he wrote. There is no trace, in these, of the brilliant and often solid workmanship of his better moments. The stories are ill-conceived and written carelessly. There is much laughter; bat it is a very ghastly sort of laughter at best?the laughter of those, in his own words, "" who laugh, but smile no more."" He seems to have lost respect for himself, for his art, and for his audience. When he dealt before with horrible images, he dealt with them for some definite enough creative purpose, and with a certain measure and gravity suitable to the occasion; but he scatters them abroad in these last tales with an indescribable and sickening levity, with something of the ghoul or the furious lunatic that surpasses what one had imagined to oneself of Hell. There is a duty to the living more important than any charity to the dead; and it would be criminal in the reviewer to spare one harsh word in the ?rpression of his own loathing and horror, lest, by its absence, another victim should be permitted to soil himself with the perusal of the infamous "" King Pest."" He who could write "" King Pest"" had ceased to be a human being. For his own sake, and out of an infinite compassion for so lost a spirit, one is glad to think of him as dead. But if it is pity that we feel towards Poe, it is certainly not pity that inspires us as we think of Baudelaire, who could sit down in cold blood, and dress out in suitable French this pointless farrago of horrors. There is a phase of contempt that, if indulged, transcends itself and becomes a phase of passionate selfsatisfaction ; so for the weal of our own spirits, it is better to think no more of Baudelaire or ""King Pest."" It is not the fashion of Poe's earlier tales to be pointless, however it may be with these sorry ones of the end. Pointlessness is, indeed, the very last charge that could be brought reasonably against them. He has the true story-teller's instinct. He knows the little nothings that make stories, or mar them. He knows how to enhance the significance of any situation, and give colour and life with seemingly irrelevant particulars. Thus, the whole spirit of 'VThe Cask of Amontillado"" depends on Fortunato's carnival costume of cap and bells and motley. When Poe had once hit upon this device ol' dressing the victim grotesquely, he had found the key of the story; and so he sends him with uneven steps along the catacombs of the Montresors, and the last sound we hear ont of the walled-up recess is the jingling of the bells upon his cap. Admirable, also, is | the use he makes of tho striking clock at Prince Prospero's feast, in "" The Mask of the Red Death."" Each time the clock struck (the reader will remember), it struck so loudly that the musn and the dancing must cease perforce until it had made an end; as the hours ran on towards midnight, these pauses grew naturally longer; the maskers had the more time to think and look at one another, and their thoughts were none the more pleasant. Thus, as each hour struck, there went a jar about the assemblage; until, as the reader will remember, the end comes suddenly. Now, this is quite legitimate; no one need be ashamed of being frightened or excited by such means; the rules of the game have been respected ; only, by the true instinct of the story-teller he has told his story to the best advantage, and got full value for his imaginations. This is not so always, however ; for sometimes he will take a high note falsetto; sometimes, by a sort of conjuring trick, get more out of his story than he has been able to put into it; and, while the whole garrison is really parading past us on the esplanade, continue to terrify us from the battlements with sham cannon and many fierce-looking shakos upon broom-sticks. For example, in "" The Pit and the Pendulum,"" after having exhausted his bedevilled imagination in the conception of the pendulum and the red-hot collapsing walls, he finds he can figure forth nothing more horrible for the pit; and yet the pit was to be the crowning horror. This is how he effects his purpose (vol. i. p. 214) :? "" Amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the well emu: over my soul like balm. 1 rushed to its deadly brink. * I threw my straining vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses. Yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. At length it forced?it wrestled its way into my soul?it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason. O for a voice to speak! oh horror! oh, any horror but this!"" And that is all. He knows no more about the pit than you or I do. It is a pure imposture, a piece of audacious, impudent thimble-rigging; and yet, even with such bugs as these he does manage to frighten us. You will find the same artifice repeated in "" Hans Pfaal,"" about the mysteries of the moon ; and again, though with a difference, in thc abrupt conclusion of "" Arthur Gordon Pym."" His imagination is a willing horse ; but three times, as you see, ho has killed it under him by over-riding, and come limping to the post on foot. With what a good grace does he not turn those failures to advantage, and make capital out ol'each imaginative bankruptcy ! Even on a critical retrospect, it is hard to condemn him as ho deserves ; for he cheats with gusto. After this knowledge of the stage, this cleverness at turning a story out, perhaps the most striking of Poe's peculiarities is an almost incredible insight into thc debateable region between sanity and madness. Tho "" Imp of the Perverse,"" for example, is an important contribution to morbid psychology ; so, perhaps, is "" The Man of the Crowd; "" "" Berenice,"" too,for ashorrible as it is, touches a chord in one's own breast, though perhaps it is a chord that had better be left alone ; and the same idea recurs in "" Thc Tell-Talo Heart."" Sometimes we can go with him tho whole way with a good , conscience; sometimes?instead of saying, yes, this is how 1 should bo if I were just a little more mad than ever I was?we can say frankly, this is what I am. There is ono passage ol' analysis in this moro normal vein, in the story of "" Ligeia,""as tothe expression of Ligcia's eyes. He tells us how he felt ever on the point of understanding their strange quality, and ever baffled at the last moment, just as "" in our endeavours to recall to memory something long forgotten, wo often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance, without being able in the end to reincmbrr; "" and how, in streams of running water, in the ocean, in the falling of a meteor, j.j tho glances of unusually aged people, in crrlaia sounds from stringed instruments, in certain passages from books, in the commonest sights and sensations of thc universe, he found ever and anon some vagne inexplicable analogy to the expression and the power of these loved^ eyes. This, at least, or* the like of it, we all know. But, in the general, his subtlety was more of a snare to him than anything else. ""Nil sapicntiac odiosius,"" he quotes himself from Seneca, "" nil sapicntiae odiosius acumine nimio."" And though it is delightful enough in the C. Augusto Dupin trilogy?it was Baudelaire who called it a trilogy?yet one wearies in tho long run of this strain of ingenuity; one begins to marvel at tbe absence of thc good homespun motives and sentiments that do the business of the everyday world; although the demonstrator is clever, and the cases in- structive and probably unique, one begins to weary of going round this madhouse, and long for thc society of some plain harmless person, with business habits and a frock coat, and nerves not much more shattered than the majority of his plain and harmless contemporaries. Nor did this exaggerated insight make him wearisome only; it did worse than that?it sometimes led him astray. Thus, in "" The Pit and the Pendulum,"" when the hero has been condemned, "" the sound of the inquisitorial voices,"" he says, seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution, perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill-wheel."" Now, it wants but a moment's reflection to prove how much too clever Poe has been here, how far from true reason he has been carried by this niminm acumen. For?the man being giddy?the "" idea of involution "" must have preceded the merging of the inquisitorial voices into an indeterminate hum, and most certainly could not have followed it as any fanciful deduction. Again, as before in the matter of effect, one cannot help fearing that some of the subtlety is fustian. To take an example of both sorts of imagination?the fustian and the sincere?from the same story "" Arthur Gordon Pym : "" the four survivors on board the brig Grampus have lashed themselves to the windlass, lest they should be swept away; one of them, having drawn his lashings too tight, is ready to yield up his spirit for a long while, is nearly cut in two, indeed, by the cord about his loins. ""No sooner had we removed it, however,"" Poe goes on, "" than he spoke and seemed to experience instant relief?being able to move with much greater ease than either Parker or myself"" (two who had not tied themselves so closely). "" This teas no doubt owing to the loss of blood."" Now, whether medically correct or not, this is, on tho face of it, sincerely imagined. Whether correct or not in fact, it is correct in art. Poe evidently believed it true ; evidently it appeared to him that thus, and not otherwise, the thing would fall out. Now, turn a page back, and we shall find (ii. 78), in tho description of the visions that went beforo Pym while thus bound, something to be received very much more deliberately. "" I now remember,"" he writes, ""that in all which passed before my mind's eye, motion was a predominant idea. Thus I never fancied any stationary object, such as a house, a mountain, or anything of that kind; but windmills, ships, large ""birds, balloons, people on honeback, carnages driving furiously, and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession."" This may be true ; it may be the result of great erudition in thc thoughts of people in such sore straits ; but the imagination does not adopt these details, they do not commend themselves to our acceptance, it is nowise apparent why stationary objects should not present themselves to the fancy of a man tied to the windlass of a dismasted brig; and, this being so, the whole passage, as art, stand* condemned. If it be mere causeless fancy (as it seems), it is fustian of the most unpardonable sort; if it be erudition,?well then, it may be erudition, bnt never art. Things are tit for art so far only ns they are both truo and apparent. To make what I mean clear: Mr. Buskin, in some one or other of his delightful books, quotes and approves a poet (I think it was Homer) who said of a brave man that he was as brave as a fly; and proceeds, in his usual happy manner, to justify the epithet. The fly, he tells us, is in very deed the most madly courageous of all created beings. And therefore the simile is good?excellent good. And yet the reader's instinct would tell him, I am sure, that the simile is a vile simile. Let him prefer his instinct before Mr. Ruskin's natural history. For, though it be based on what is true, this comparison is not based upon a truth that is apparent; it does not commend itself to our acceptance; it is not art. I have spoken at so great a length of these matters of method and detail, that no room remains to me to speak of the larger question?a question avoided also by Baudelaire on the same plea of want of space?why it is that these subjects interested Poe's imagination?a question difficult of solution, indeed, but not insoluble with time. Nor have I left myself room to speak of what is j perhaps still more important, the relation ' between Poe and his far greater and better compatriot, Hawthorne. That there is a consanguinity, that the two saw the world in a fashion not altogether dissimilar, that some of the short stories of Hawthorne seem inspired by Poe, and some of Poe's short stories seem to be an echo of Hawthorne?all this is beyond question ; but all this I can do no more than indicate. Nor should the reader be surprised if a criticism upon Poe is mostly negative, and rather suggests new doubts than resolves those already existing; for it is Poe's merit to carry people away, and it is his besetting sin that he wants altogether such scrupulous honesty as guides and restrains the finished artist. He was, let us say it with all sorrow, not conscientious. Hunger was ever at his door, and he had too imperious a desire for what we call nowadays the sensational in literature. And thus the critic (if he be more conscientious than the man he is criticising) dare not greatly praise lest he should be thought to condone all that is unscrupulous and tinsel in these wonderful stories. They are to be praised by him in one way only?by recommending those that are least objectionable. If anyone wishes to be excited, let him read, under favourable circumstances, "" The Gold Bug,"" "" The Descent into the Maelstrom,"" "" The Cask of Amontillado,"" "" The Oval Portrait,"" and the three stories about C. Auguste Dnpin, the philosophical detective. If he should then desire to read more, he may go on, but warily; there are trap-doors and spring-guns in these two volumes, there are gins and pitfalls; and the precipitate reader may stumble unawares upon some nightmare not easily to be forgotten'. One word on the services of Mr. Ingram. This edition has evidently been a labour of love with him. Let us hope, in the next two volumes which are to complete the series, he may extend some of his love and labour to the scraps of French, which Poe was so fond of scattering about his pages. There are some deplorable errors abroad in the two under present consideration?errors I should like to make clear to Mr. Ingram, some fine evening, over what he would call, or suffer his printers to call, Vkflacon of Glos de Vougeot.

Dr. Greenou gh, of Harvard Universitv, writes a brief introduction to this reprint and enumerates certain points which distinguish Poe s work from that ot some other American ariters.

T h e finding is a little indiscriminate, though it has a side of truth so far as Poe is concerned. We note further that, in I)r.

61,B4583,['6727320'],"LITERATURE. TifIq Ilandican : Beine Stories of Mine I Own People. By "";Rudyard Kipling. (Macmillans.) Mu. KirueG has gathered into a volume twenty-seven stories: the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as Mr. Kipling's finest work. The book is so characteristic, for good and bad, of its author, that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories. Eight of them, with certain limitations, are excellent: "" The Incarnation of Krishna Mulvaney,"" ""The Courting of Dinah Shadd,"" "" On Greenhow Hill,"" "" The Man who Was,"" ""Without Benefit of Clergy,"" ""Through the Fire,"" ""The Finances of the Gods,"" and "" Little Tobrah."" To these may be added the Preface. They deal with the famous triumvirate of privates, with the British army, and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character. Two stories, "" At the End of the Passage "" and "" The Mark of the Boast,"" are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness, weariness, fear, superstition, climate, work, and, to put it plainly, the devil, as shown by the experiences of Englishmen in India. Three more, ""' The Return of Inray,"" ""' Bubbling Well Road,"" and '' Bertran and Bimi,"" are )owerful stories of the horrible, without any mixture of mystery and impossibility. Three, ""The Mutiny of the Mavericks,"" "" The Head of the District,"" and "" Naingay Doola,"" have, more or less directly, a political moral wrapped up in them. Five more, "" The Amir's Homily,"" ""Jews in Shushan,"" "" The Limitations of Pambe Serang,"" ""The City of Dreadful Night,"" and "" The Dream of Duncan Parreness,"" are mediocre examples of Mr. Kipling's various manners; and of these, the fourth is the most striking. The remaining six, in my sincere and humble opinion, do not deserve publication: ""The Lang Men o' Larut,"" ""Reingelder and the German Flag,"" "" The Wandering Jew,"" "" Moti Guj,"" "" Georgie Porgie,"" and "" Naboth."" The volume ends with some of Mr. Kipling's best verses. This is, of course, merely a classification ma(le according to the mind of one particular reader, with his own tastes and prejudices. Among the stories which I think the worst, is one which many readers have ranked among the best. But, upon the whole, I think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention. The one great fault in Mr. Kipling's work is, not its "" brutality,"" nor its fondness for strong effects, but a certain taint of bad manners, from the literary point of view. He insists upon spicing his stories with an ill-flavoured kind of gossip, wholly irrelevant, and very offensive. For example: "" The Man who Was,"" an admirable story, full of that indefinable spirit, military patriotism and regimental pride, is spoilt by this pointless passage: "" And indeed they were a regiment to be admired. When Lady Durgan, widow of the late Sir John Durgan, arrived in their station, and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess, she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all, including the colonel and some majors already married, she was not going to content herself with one hussar. Wherefore she wedded a little man in a Rifle Regiment, being by nature contradictious; and the White Hussars were going to wear crape on their arms, but compromised by attending the wedding in full force, and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach. She had jilted them all -from Basset-Holmer, the senior captain, to little Mildred, the junior subaltern, who could have given her four thousand a year and a title."" I hate to mutilate a book; but I hope to read this story often: and, rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff, in a story otherwise splendid, I have obliterated the passage. Too often, in reading Mr. Kipling, we are forced to say, "" That would make a good spccial report,"" or "" That's a telling bit of war correspondence ; yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind. But the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal; and of a very inferior specimen. I do not say that the thing did not, could not, or should not, happen : I do say that Mr. Kipling, as an artist, one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work, commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial, without just cause. And from the frequeucy of his offence, in every book that he has written, it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence. Two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way : The talk rose higher and higher, and the regimental band played between the courses, as is the inunemorial custom, till all tonIgues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinner-slips, and the first toast of obligation, when an officer rising said, "" Mr. Vice, the Queen,"" and little Mildred from the bottom of the table answered, "" The Queen, God bless her,"" and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the Queen, upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills. That sacrament of the mess never grows old, and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of tbe listener wherever lie be by sea or by land."" What is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the Queen's pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances ? It sounds like the petty, ill-conditioned criticism of some cockney money-lender: it is a crying false note, coming just in that place. Again, "" toast of obligation"" and "" sacrament of the mess"" are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms. These things are fatal to the perfection of a story; and Mr. Kipling's taste for them is his worst enemy. But it may be observed, that they do not occur except when Mr. Kipling is dealing with English officers and civilians: his ""common"" soldiers and his Indian natives, under all circumstances and conditions, talk, and are treated by Mr. Kipling, without these petty offences against good taste. Ortheris and Mulvaney, Ameera and Khoda Dad Khan, in every mood or situation, are allowed by Mr. Kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones, which in his stories are the essential notes of the English gentleman in India. His officers and his civil servants, Orde, Tallantire, Hummil, Spurstow, Lowudes, Mottram, Strickland, and ""1I,"" one and all talk with a strained intensity, a bitter tone, a sharp concisoness, an abbreviation of epigram, a clever slang, which are meant to denote, partly their cultured intellects, and partly that sentiment of fatality and dogged endurance which Mr. Kipling would have us believe to be the invariable result of official work in India. The Empire, the Administration, the Government, become in Mr. Kipling's hands necessary and yet amusing powers, in whose service Englishmen are willing to toil and sweat, knowing that il n'y pals (1'omne necessaire, but content to go on, relieved by making cynical epigrams about life and death, and everything before, between, or after them. The consciousness of duty becomes the consciousness of a mechanical necessity: the sentiment of loyalty is caricatured into a cynical perseverance. Ono thinks of Dalhousie and of the Lawrences. Mr. Kipling has had experience of English life and work in India: his reader-, for the most part, have not. But I would ask any reader, who has known Engliih offlears and civilians, before, during, anl after, their In(dian service, whether he has found then quito s) brilliant or quite so ill-bred, quite so opigrammatic or quite so self-conscious, as these creatures of Mr. Kipling. Is it, that befoe leaving home, or while home on leave, or when done with India, they are natural Englishmen; but that an Indian climate, and a share in Iidian administration, turn them into m1iachines : men, who seem to talk like telegrams, and to think in shorthand, and to pose, each as a modern Atlas, helping to uphold the Indian Empire, and swearing pessimist oaths at its weight ? Mr. Kipling presents English rule in India for purposes of effective fiction, as a huge and ironical joke, or, to use one of his favourite words, as a "" grim "" comedy. In fact, whenever he gives us the views of life held by men of education and official responsibility, they are tho views expressed by his title, Lafe'8 JI(Hndicap.

62,B4665,['6727320'],"LITERATURE. TifIq Ilandican : Beine Stories of Mine I Own People. By "";Rudyard Kipling. (Macmillans.) Mu. KirueG has gathered into a volume twenty-seven stories: the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as Mr. Kipling's finest work. The book is so characteristic, for good and bad, of its author, that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories. Eight of them, with certain limitations, are excellent: "" The Incarnation of Krishna Mulvaney,"" ""The Courting of Dinah Shadd,"" "" On Greenhow Hill,"" "" The Man who Was,"" ""Without Benefit of Clergy,"" ""Through the Fire,"" ""The Finances of the Gods,"" and "" Little Tobrah."" To these may be added the Preface. They deal with the famous triumvirate of privates, with the British army, and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character. Two stories, "" At the End of the Passage "" and "" The Mark of the Boast,"" are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness, weariness, fear, superstition, climate, work, and, to put it plainly, the devil, as shown by the experiences of Englishmen in India. Three more, ""' The Return of Inray,"" ""' Bubbling Well Road,"" and '' Bertran and Bimi,"" are )owerful stories of the horrible, without any mixture of mystery and impossibility. Three, ""The Mutiny of the Mavericks,"" "" The Head of the District,"" and "" Naingay Doola,"" have, more or less directly, a political moral wrapped up in them. Five more, "" The Amir's Homily,"" ""Jews in Shushan,"" "" The Limitations of Pambe Serang,"" ""The City of Dreadful Night,"" and "" The Dream of Duncan Parreness,"" are mediocre examples of Mr. Kipling's various manners; and of these, the fourth is the most striking. The remaining six, in my sincere and humble opinion, do not deserve publication: ""The Lang Men o' Larut,"" ""Reingelder and the German Flag,"" "" The Wandering Jew,"" "" Moti Guj,"" "" Georgie Porgie,"" and "" Naboth."" The volume ends with some of Mr. Kipling's best verses. This is, of course, merely a classification ma(le according to the mind of one particular reader, with his own tastes and prejudices. Among the stories which I think the worst, is one which many readers have ranked among the best. But, upon the whole, I think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention. The one great fault in Mr. Kipling's work is, not its "" brutality,"" nor its fondness for strong effects, but a certain taint of bad manners, from the literary point of view. He insists upon spicing his stories with an ill-flavoured kind of gossip, wholly irrelevant, and very offensive. For example: "" The Man who Was,"" an admirable story, full of that indefinable spirit, military patriotism and regimental pride, is spoilt by this pointless passage: "" And indeed they were a regiment to be admired. When Lady Durgan, widow of the late Sir John Durgan, arrived in their station, and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess, she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all, including the colonel and some majors already married, she was not going to content herself with one hussar. Wherefore she wedded a little man in a Rifle Regiment, being by nature contradictious; and the White Hussars were going to wear crape on their arms, but compromised by attending the wedding in full force, and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach. She had jilted them all -from Basset-Holmer, the senior captain, to little Mildred, the junior subaltern, who could have given her four thousand a year and a title."" I hate to mutilate a book; but I hope to read this story often: and, rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff, in a story otherwise splendid, I have obliterated the passage. Too often, in reading Mr. Kipling, we are forced to say, "" That would make a good spccial report,"" or "" That's a telling bit of war correspondence ; yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind. But the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal; and of a very inferior specimen. I do not say that the thing did not, could not, or should not, happen : I do say that Mr. Kipling, as an artist, one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work, commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial, without just cause. And from the frequeucy of his offence, in every book that he has written, it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence. Two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way : The talk rose higher and higher, and the regimental band played between the courses, as is the inunemorial custom, till all tonIgues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinner-slips, and the first toast of obligation, when an officer rising said, "" Mr. Vice, the Queen,"" and little Mildred from the bottom of the table answered, "" The Queen, God bless her,"" and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the Queen, upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills. That sacrament of the mess never grows old, and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of tbe listener wherever lie be by sea or by land."" What is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the Queen's pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances ? It sounds like the petty, ill-conditioned criticism of some cockney money-lender: it is a crying false note, coming just in that place. Again, "" toast of obligation"" and "" sacrament of the mess"" are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms.

63,B2250,"['4372131', '9428028', '8485575']","REVII;WS OF BOOKs. OUR? MUTUAL FRIEN"".* MR. DICKENS has now been so long before the public, and his name is associated with so many triumphs, some of which were achieved before the present generation of young men and women was born, that he has already obtained the position of a classic, and we judge him by the standard of names consecrated by time. He has exhibited a degree of productiveness rarely seen except in combination with a marked and melancholy falling off from the freshness and power of early manhood. The collected editions of his works now spread over many volumes; the characters he has invented would almost people a town; and we might well excuse an author who has done so much, if we found in him some slackening of the creative force which has been at work for such a length of time. But Mr. Dickens stands in need of no allowance on the sooe of having out-written himselfL His fancy, his pathos, his hmour, his wonderful powers of observation, his picturesqueness, and his versatility, are as remarkable now as they were twenty yea ago. In some respects, they are seen to still greater advantage. The energy of youth yet remains, but it is united with the deeper insight of maturer years. Not that we mean to say Mr. Dickens-has outgrown his faults. They are as obvious as eversometimes even trying our patience rather hard. A certain extr vagnce in particular scenes and persons-a tendency to caricature and grotesqueness-and a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic, as if the author had been considering how the thiqwroulld "" tell "" on the stage-are to be found in "" Our Mutual Fried,"" as in all this great novelist's productions. But when a writer of genius has fully settled his style, and maintained it through a core of many yers-when his mind has pused beyond the period of pliability and growth, and -ca only deepen without essenthlly anging-it is the merest vanity on the part of a critic to dwdl at any great length on general faults of manner. There they are, mA there they will remamy, ws hat we will. The tender rind w~ein they were cut in youth has become hard bark ong ice, and the incisions are fixed for ever. To rail at them is simple w-a of time, besides implying a great deal of iatitude on the part of the railer. We shall therefore make but br allsi here to th characters of Wegg and Venus, who appeartous in he high- degree unnatural-the one being a mere phantasm and the other a nonentity-and shall pass on to a c eran of the ore solid.prts of the book, in which Mr. Dickens's old mastery over hum=a nature is once more made splendidly apparent. 1s n its author's previous fictions, we are almost oppressed by the frilness of life which pervades the pages of this noveL Mr. D~icmja oneof the most mysterious attributes of genius-the powner of reatng characters which have, so to spea, an overplus df vtality, passing beyond the limits of the tale, and ming itlf felti li actual, ext al t In the stories of inferior wntees the eseem to posst jsuffiient personality and presece todry on the purpose of the narrtive; one never thinks of them an Wpoying any existence at all outside the little tissue of events taun been woven for them. They ae goes whom the author has evoked out of iht and vauity to erform certain definite officS within the charmed circle of the tion to which they are attacbed; and when we step out of that circle at the conclusin of 4w ceremonies, they vanish again into not aness, ad we thin no more of them Such is not the case wit the concep tions of larger geniuses. Thee do not seem to belong wholly to the one set of events with which they are associated, any more than the men and women we actually kow pent themselves to our thoughts as the puppets of a definite train of circumstances. The creations of authors such as Mr. Dickens have a life of their own. We perceive them to be full of potential capacities- of madevelaped action. They have the substance and the freedom of awla exiatences; we think of what they would do under other conditions; they are possessed of a riniple of growth. Ctaiy, the-most amazing manifestation of this amng gift is tht wich o be fornd in the ply of Slakepeare ; but ull men of genius }ave it in a greater or degree, anhat strange and even awful Wmr is,perhap, the et test for distinguishing beteeeng aid talent. That Mr. Dickens poseus it to a remarkable extent, * bdifve few will be found to dipute. The chief charactei even of his earlier books dwell in te mind with extraordinary | thacity, sometimes quite apart from the plot wherein they figurn, which may be utterly fogott; and no writer of our time has furnished contemporary literature and conversationwi so many ibsjrative allusions. This ite fecundity is seen in ""'(tr Mutual Friend "" in undimin d strength. The book teems i m ,cteis, and throbs with action; but it may perk be that there is a want of wme one conspicu1ous fig u Uting over the rext, and affording a fixed centre to all this mmving -wealth of life. John Rokesmith must, we suppose, be regdd as the hero; but he is certainly not the chif character, nor {ho most interesting.

Indeed, the whole st of -old Harmon's be quest, and what arises out of it, stie w as being faulty.

We must confogs that in rGaina ""Our Mutual Friend from month to month, we cared very littie as to what became of old Harmon's property, excepting in asrfares the ultimate disposal of that sordid aggregation of wealth affectd the development of two or three of the chief characters. The.Ind explanation is a disappointment. The whole plot in which the deceased Harmon, Boffin, Wegg, and John Rokeemith, are concerned is wild and fantastic, wanting in reality, and leading to a degree of confusion which is not compensated by any additional interest in the story. Mr. Dickens seems to be aware that his tale is liable to this objection, for in the very interesting "" Postscript, in Lieu of Preface,"" which he has appended to the second volume, he says There is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction what are the commonest e eriences in fact. Therefore I note here, though it may not be at al necessay, that there are hundreds of Will Cases (as they are called) far more remarkable than that fancied in this book; and that the stores of the Prerogative Office teem with instances of testators -who have made, changed, contradicted, hidden, forgotten, left cancelled, and leftuncancelled, each many more wills than were ever made by the elder Mr. Harmon of Harmony Jail."" We do notfor a moment doubt that this is the fact, and it is not to the terms of Mr. Harmon's will that we object, but to the circumstances flowing from that source. That the son, John Harmon, known through the greater part of the book as John Rokesmith, should come baok to gland under the circunstances related, should disappear as related, should live for montbs at the house of his childhood's friends, the Boffins, without being discovered, and should then be suddenly found out without any sucint explanation; that Mr. Boffin should get entangled with a man Ie Wegg ; that, grantingthe entanglement, Wegg, with all his c should make his calcations with such transparent stupidity-fkig no account of the Dutch bottle which he has seen dug up by from the dust-heap, and which contains, as the reader all an foresees, the later will which nullifies the will relied on by We for forcn Boffin to give up half his property; that the 6oMe and insolent tatment of Rokesmith by Boffin, and the miserliness of the latter, maintained at all times, and people, should be a mere trick, concocted between the two 'b turn the regards of proud little Bella Wilfer towards John, ana to cure the young lady of her sordid aspirati a that all th, when the right moment arrives, should be verbally set forth, s those exlantion which we fid at the end of plays, wheni he characters ran themselves before the footlights, -make thei confessions, ad unravel the imbroglio; these are features In r.

"" Couldn't abear to make believe as I meant it! In consequence of which, we was everlastingly in danger with her. We venture to think that most readers will feel that the story loses in verisimilitude and interest by such a mode of winding it up. The termination of Mr. Dickens's novels is often hurried, and such is the case in the present instance. The complication of events does not work itself clear by a slow and natural process, but is, so to speak, roughly ton open. And, even before we are half through the book, the mystery concerning John Rokesmith is explained in an equally objectionable manner. Young Rokesmith, or Harmon, tells himself his own previous history, in a sort of mental soliloquy (in which a long series of events is minutely narrated), evidently for no other purpose than to inform the reader. It is surprising that so experienced a romance-writer as Mr. Dickens could not have devised some more artful means of revealing that portion of his design. Yet, notwithstanding these defects (which we have pointed out with the greater freedom, because such a writer demands the utmost candour from his critic), the story of "" Our Mutual Friend' is interesting for its own sake, even apart from its treatment; which, we need not say, is that of a master, if we except these points already objected to. We repeat what we said at the commencement-that, in conception and evolution of character, and in power of writing, this latest work of the pen that has so often delighted and astonished us shows not the slightest symptom of exhaustion or decline. Perhaps the most admirable of the dramatis personw, considered on artistic grounds, are Eugene Wrayburn, Lizzie Hexam, Bradley Headstone, and Bella Wilfer. The first of these characters is a consummate representation of a nature, originally noble, degenerating, under the effects of a bad education and of subsequent idleness, into a laughing indifference to all things worthy-into a gay and sportive disbelief in itself, in manhood, in womanhood, and in the world. From first to last, the conception is wonderfully developed, and the change that is afterwards wrought in Eugene's disposition is worked out without the smallest violence. In strong contrast with the good-natured levity of Wrayburn is the stern, self-contained, narrow, yet (within its contracted and mechanical limits) earnest, nature of Bradley Headstone, the self-educated schoolmaster. Liue Hexam is the cause of bringing these two men into dangerous contact. She is the daughter of a man who drags the river for anything he can get-dead bodies among the rest-and who is sometimes suspected of having more to do with the dead bodies than he would like to confess. The girl, - however, is a fine sensitive being, handsome, and of a deep, tender nature; and when Eugene Wrayburn sees her after the death of her father on the rver, he takes an interest in her fate, and has her educated. His interest deepens into love, yet he cannot brine himself to make an honest offer of marriage to one who comes of such humble and even questionable parentage. Bradley Headstone also is in love with Lizzie; and the way in which his impassive, artificiallyrestrained nature breaks up into raging fury under the combined influences of hopeless love, jealousy, and some pungent taunts which Wrayburn gaily flings at him, is exhibited by Mr. Dickens with marvellous power and truthfulness. The transformation of this pattern of all the decencies into a dark, haggard, self-tormenting evil genius, per tually dogging the steps of Eugene Wrayburn, and at length making a murderous attack on hi in a lonely place up the river, is one of the finest things in fiction. Bradley Headstone is a psychological study of the deepest interest, and, we are peruaded, of the profoundest truth. Natures like his, originally cold, and still further repressed by the routine of a dry and formal education, are no doubt especially liable to outbreaks of ungovernable passion when some great emotion at length sweeps away the old habits of self-controL Mr. Dickens has traced this with a sinjularly close and analytical eye, and nothing can be more tragic and impressive than the culmination of Bradley Headstone's wrath in the attempted murder of Eugene. All the preparations for that at, and all the acoessories in the way of scenery and atmospherical conditions, are managed in Mr. Dickens's highest style; and the mental state of a man about to commit the greatest of crimes has seldom been depicted with such elaboration and apparent truthfulness We are prepared to hear from a certain class of critics who can tolerate nothing beyond the civilities of everyday life, and who seem to think that great passions are among those vulgar mistake. of nature to which novelists should be superior, that this carcter is ""sensational ;"" but the genius that could conceive it has Dothilg to fear from such objectors. Very touching and beautifsl the character of Lizzie Hexam; but probably the greatest favourite in the book will be-or rather is already-Bella wilfer. She is evidently a pet of the author's, and she will long r m the darling of half the households of England and America. Pererse, petulant, wil, wrong-headed, not a little inclined at first to be selfish and >aney-loving, she is yet a bewitching little creare, and it is no surprise to find that in the end all the good in her impulsive nature bursts into efflorescence beneath the sunshine of a happy love. Of the less important characters of the book it is impossible to speak, they are so numerous; but reference shoeld be made to the lathetic sketch of Betty Higden and 1ittle Johnny, her gre andchild. That the poor old creature's pod defince of workhouse charity is true to a large number of ourm glialower clam, is but too certain from cases with which we are all familiar; and the sketch is more especially interesting as having drawn from Mr. Dickens, in the final words from which we have already quoted, a declaration of his views on the present administration of the Poor Laws: "" In my social experiences since Mrs. Betty Higden came upon the scene and left it, I have found Circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the Poor Law. My friend M1r. Bounderby could never see any differenoe between leaving the Coketown 'hands' exactly as they were, and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons. Idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance, and I have been called upon to admit that I would give Poor Law relief to anybody, anywhere, anyhow. Patting this nonsense aside, I have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties; the ote contending that there are no deserving poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather to the mercies of some relieving officers and some Union houses; the other, admitting that there are such pcor, but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do. The records in our newspapers, the late exposure by the Lancet, and the common sense and senses of common people, furnish too abundant evidence against both defences. But, that my view of the Poor Law may not be 'amk or misrepresented, I will state it. I believe there has been in England, since the days of the Stuarts, no law so often infimously administered, no law so often openly violated, no law habitually so ill. supervised. In the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution that shock the public and disgrace the country, the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanity-and known language could say no more of their lawlessnes."" We must also instance among the creations of this book the little deformed dolls' dressmaker (fantastic and semi-poetical, yet with a deep instinct of truth); her drunken father-a sketch in which tragedy and comedy are mingled in a way wherein Mr. Dickens is quite unrivalled; Bella's father, a beautiful specimen of a truly loveable nature; the Podsnaps and Veneerings, and the crew of rapscallions and adventurers, male and female, by whom they are surrounded-portraits admirable for the social satire they embody; Rogue Riderhood, and some of the other hangers-on about the river. We might almost mention the river itself as a character. It plays a most important part in the story, and always with great picturesqueness. We cannot refain, ere we conclude, from referring once more to the Postscript, for the sake of its allusion to an event in whidh at the time we were all deeply interested:"" On Friday, the 9th of June in the present year, Mr. and Do Boffin (in their manuscript dress of receiving Mr. ad Ms at breakfast) were on the South-Eastern Railway with in a terribly destructive accident.

By Charles Dickens. With Illustrations by Marcus Stone. 2 vols. (Chapman & Hall.) A new novel by the greatest novelist living is not to be dismissed with a few jaunty phrases of rapture, or of qualification; for a simple yet serious reason. Those who, with understanding, as distinct from that wonderment which belongs to the foolish face of praise, have followed Mr. Dickens throughout his career of authorship cannot fail to have perceived that time and success have not made him careless,?whether as concerns his art, his public, or himself. As little have they spoilt, or dimmed, or turned aside his quick sympathies, his power of minute observation, his keen desire to advocate what he deems right, his wondrous force of hand and colour as a painter in words. Every true and conscientious man becomes increasingly solicitous on these points with time and success. The boy may dash off a brilliant sketch as a matter of course: the ripe artist will ponder over his coming picture. But may he not ponder too long and over-solicitously ? This question, we fancy, may be asked with respect to ' Our Mutual Friend.' Only the other day ita author gave us that French story of 'Little Bebelle,' one of the most exquisite pieces of pathos in fiction, the value of which will be best tested by comparing it with Sterne's Shandy-isms. Only yesterday, out of a dingy street in the Strand, from no more promising place than a lodging-house, the artist by a touch brought to light a homely, loving fellow-creature, worthy to "" sit above the salt"" among the best of the best; Mrs. Lirriper?as real "" a being of the mind "" as Mr. Pickwick, as Mrs. Gamp, as the Micaivbers,?as any of the long line of living creatures called up by the novelist, whom we know intimately, in all their strength and weakness, and whose deeds and sayings have passed into household words. If, therefore, we say that, during its course of fragmentary publication, ' Our Mutual Friend' has raised more question than certain of its predecessors, the circumstance arises from the nature of the story, and not because the fountain of variety shows signs of exhaustion. None of the series is so intricate in plot as this tale. It would be wasted labour to detail or analyze a chain of events which every one has already handled. Enough to state our conviction, that the closest attention is required to hold certain of its connecting links. From the first number it was evident to us that the murdered John Harmon was not murdered, but had set himself down in the household of the wife allotted to him by a fantastic will, for the purpose of testing her real nature. The circumstances of the deed, which led to his shipmate Radfoot being mistaken for, and murdered with, himself, are mistily revealed in the long soliloquy during which he determines on the renunciation of his identity. Some incompleteness, referable to partial recollection, may have been an intentional stroke of art on the novelist's part?may belong to the nature of the catastrophe, but it produces an impression of uncertainty. Then, again, the complications of the story may have necessitated sharp turns and surprises, which bear unfavourably on some of the characters. We fancy the conversion of Bella Wilfer, the capricious beauty longing for wealth and emancipation from her portentous mother and shrewish sister, to be somewhat too sudden,?even though it did grow out of her dismal experience of the simulated avarice overgrowing Mr. Boffin. This avarice, again, however adroitly devised and minutely wrought out as a piece of masquerade, leading to a final surprise for which no one can have been prepared, has, of necessity, implied the introduction of some elements discordant with those of the character so forcibly conceived and broadly sketched. The honest, truthful Boffin of the Mounds, whose simple right-mindedness virtually overruled his wretched old misermaster who had the fortune to leave, might have been led by his desire to right what was wrong and to regenerate what was defective, to connive in the scheme of amending the coquetries of Bella, the oddly-designated bride ofthe great fortune; but his inability to carry such a long-drawn piece of subtle comedy through, we beg (respectfully to our great novel- ist) to question. And we are satisfied that bo great-hearted a man should not on any excuse of plot or plan whatsoever, or any desire to ""lead on"" a miserable knave to the full display of his greed and knavery, have been submitted to the degradation of the scene with Wegg, after the discovery of old Harmon's second mil, in the house of the anatomical curiosity-monger. That which belongs and befits a detective policeman, apt at disguises as Mr. Bucket of never-to-be-forgotten memory, sits ill on an honest, ignorant, affectionate creature, such as he is. And though we love Mrs. Boffin, the comfortable and instinctively-delicate woman (one of Mr. Dickens's most genial creations), with all our hearts, we cannot but feel as if we owed her a grudge for her connivance. Truth and nature are here strained, in subservience to the requirements of literary art. We fancy that the necessity of conducting an unusually large crowd of characters through a maze of unusual intricacy has told on other of the personages of the story. Harmon, its hero, is, by his position, betwixt light and dark, inevitably partially effaced. Bella, the coquetish daughter of Mrs. Wilfer the stupendous, is capitally touched in the cameleon hues of her character, and royally righted at last; but during a large part of the tale she keeps us in a state of perpetual uneasiness, hardly justifying the love she is described as inspiring. Then Lizzie Hexam, though not precisely a sketch, has not substance enough for the place she is expected to fill in the reader's interest. Lastly, we cannot conceive the possibility of a man so holy, humble, affectionate and beneficent as Riah the Hebrew on any grounds of compact, obligation or sophistry, lending himself, one hour after it was known, to the hypocritical wickedness of such a tyrant as Fledgeby, the usurer, the meanest creature (this is saying much) as yet created by the hand that painted the money-lenders in ' Nickleby'; and Brats, and Kroolc, and Fagin, and Uriah Heep. The explanation made by him at last to the little weird doll's dressmaker shows us that Mr. Dickens has felt the necessity of some explanation, which is insufficient to convince us. We cannot but be reminded by it of an awkwardness, somewhat similar, in Miss Edgeworth's ' Ormond,'?a tale expressly undertaken by her in atonement for what had been represented to her as too wholesale a depreciation of a people against whom "" every man has his hand."" Thus much by way of qualification,?or call it speculation rather,?concerning a novel which gains immensely by being perused without ""stop, let, or hindrance."" On returning to the characters, that of Bradley Headstone, the schoolmaster, dogged, sensual, unready;?his tremendous passions compressed by the responsibilities and respectabilities of his position, takes the foremost place among them as an original conception. Frightfully though he suffers, even though when he confronts Wrayburn, his poco-curante rival, there is a show of reason and of championship on his side, there is no possibility of any one's feeling a moment's pity on his behalf, so utterly is the masterdesire of his life rendered unlovable by the forms in which it is clad. There have been many murders, and many pictures of remorse in novels;?and none more powerful than the pages in which we were shown the wanderings of Bill Sykes, and the slinking home of Jonas Chuzdewit, after his bloody deed in the wood; but Mr. Dickens has exceeded even those in the scene where the wretched criminal, tortured by the rebuking consciousness of his having failed in his diabolical design, is dogged and dragged back to the fatal spot by his nideous confidant. Nothing can be mon masterly as a display of blank, inevitable retri- j bution and wretchedness. Redeeming touch ; there is none about Bradley Headstone ; even j the concealed love for him of the soft-hearted, I prim little schoolmistress, delicately indicated as it ia, fails to furnish it. To change the fancy,?the author of ' Pickwick' never revelled among richer whimsies than are to be found in the comic parts of this tale;?in the Veneering household, and the guests assembled by it. The mistress of the man- ; sion and of the camels on the dinner-table, with her readiness to weep, her stupid sentimentalities about "" Bilby,"" her inane admiration of the prancing gossip of that old mechanical harridan, Lady Tippins, because the same passes with her as a fashionable pearl of great price,?the portentous Podsnap, who knocks down argu- ; ment by British sentiments and laconic, insolent dogmatism,?the civil, misty, nobly-connected old Twemlow (who would be a true gentleman, every inch of him, were he not a j Little too promiscuously willing to sit at any- ; body's t'ea-st),? the pair of lawyers, Mortimer and Eugene (whose sincerity of attachment one for the other is not the worst point in the book),?the mun:rs (as they say on the stage) Boots and Brewer,?are all new people in print, whom every diner-out has met every , week of his life in private. The vivacity and > variety of this division of the novel are admirable. But when talking of dinners in 'Our; Mutual Friend,' we nui-t not forget the most , incomparable dinner of all, that of the newly- \ married couple, Bella and John, at Greenwich, for the sake of the sentimental waiter, ""the young man on liking,"" so ignominiously thrust aside by the arch-potentate in waiting, who conceived that he had alone a right to the solemn monopoly of the secret of the day. j We must stop, ? though touchesand traits rise , on us hythe hundred, justifying what has been said, that 'Our Mutual Friend' is one of Mr. Dickens's richest and most carefully-wrought books. If we demur to Wegg and to Miss Jenny Wren as to a pair of eccentrics approaching that boundary-line of caricature towards which their creator is, by fits, tempted, wecannot recall anything more real, more cheering, than the sketch of the Milveys,?clergyman and clergyman's wife, lx>th so unconscious in their self-sacrificing virtue and goodness, yet the two so capitally discriminated by the extra touch of zeal and briskness (and suspicion of the Jews) on the woman's part. It might be suggested that too much space is given to the impostorcouple, the Lammles, and their designs on Podsnap's poor, foolish little daughter; but, again, how capitally thrown in to the woman's part is its scrap of shame and of remorseful feeling! Her figure, ere she quits the scene, unconsciously sketching on the table-cloth with her parasol, is not to be forgotten, as marked by that attitude and occupation. Enough, then, has been said to indicate in what point of view we conceive this novel may be regarded, and to prove that, on its being read and read again, every lover of types of human character, every student of Art in fiction, every man who has "" humour"" in his soul, will find, each and all, enjoyment. If, as regards broad outline, there are former stories by Mr. Dickens which we prefer,?if, among his tales, we rank the highest ' David Copperfield,' which includes, so to say, neither plot nor surprise,?'Our Mutual Friend' must be signalized for an accumulation of fine, exact, characteristic detail, such as would suffice to set up in trade for life a score of the novel-spinners wno give us situations without motives, scenes without characters, words without thoughts, and the dialogue, not of real life, but of melo-drama.THE LITERARY EXAMINER. Our Mutual Friend. By Charles Dickens. With Illus- trations by Marcus Stone. In Two Volumes. Chapman and Hall. Latinised races accuse English writers of a disregard of unity in works of art, and yet there is no great English work of imagination that does not recognize it in a far higher degree than is involved in acceptance of the classical formula for securing an external unity in respect of time and place and action. We rightly hold the imagination capable of passing with ease over intervals of space and time, and although we recognize even more thoroughly than our neighbours the demand for unity of action, what we mean by that is not outward simplicity and singleness of plot, but a well-harmonized relation of all parts to one central thought; ideal unity that lies far deeper than any of those considerations on which the old triad of classic unities is based. Every great English work of imagination, every good work of art, all the world over, is, as it were, a crystallization of thought about some one central idea. Nowhere, perhaps, is the sense of this true unity so perfectly shown as in the literature of England. In Shakespeare, grave or gay, it is distinctly seen. Every turn of the light trifling in Love's Labour's Lost, every character of the play, blends with the rest in a poet's graceful jest over the taste of his day for idle ornament. In the plot nothing is done. All the ingenious rhyming of the courtiers agrees with the state of Don Armado with the j brave outside, who, being called upon to strip to his shirt and fight, owns that he has not a shirt to his back under all his bravery. In the Merchant of Venice tbe play crystallizes round the central thought of the relation between justice and mercy, law and gospel. In King Lear earthly sovereignty breaks like a bubble on the wind as it flies through the stir of the grand forces of Nature. In Julius Casar the central thought is the problem of government. The supreme sovereignty of Caesar, the philosophical republicanism of Brutus, the self-seeking republicanism of Cassius, and all other parts of the play, show, as it were, the different faces of the crystal of which all parts have their harmonious relation to the single point of thought. If we turn from Shakespeare to Fielding, in Tom Jones, broad as the canvas is on which that work is painted, and crowded as it is with various incident, there also we find every detail tending to ono centre, the idea of the relation of man to society. Jones and Biifil are types of the two opposite halves of the social world: Jones faulty but honest, his faults open and incurring blame; Biifil keeping the faults of a worse nature secret, giving a fair show to the worst acts and escaping blame. In the relation, of man with society open truth is contrasted with false seemiog; and the episode of the Old Man of the Hill is contrived to provide for the middle case of the man who cuts the knot of tiie social problem by avoiding conversation with his fellows. Mr Dickens invariably fulfils in his novels this condition of deep seated unity which has been always recognized in English art. All readers can feel that he does so, and some readers who have paid little attention to good literature have raised thereupon arguments upon the propriety or impropriety of ' writing with a purpose;' as tf any thing worth reading, anything worth seeing, anything worth hearing, were ever produced or uttered without the purpose to express a distinct individual meaning of some sort. There must be in every good novel, play, or poem, one true thought for the mainspring that keeps all ita wheels in action; and we must start from the mainspring if we would trace properly the movement of the works. In this novel of Our Mutual Friend the argument is of the soul of life smong the fictions of society. We are shown in tbe first chapter Lizzie Hexam, a true-hearted girl in a position as degraded as imagination can conceive without stain to her inner purity. She is bringing a pure heart to a revolting way of life; ber father supports a wretched home among scum of the riverside by fishing for drowned men. In this girl chiefly, but not in her only, we are, as the story grows, to see the radiance of the aoul of life. We turn from her and the deep social degradation of her outward life, at onoe, in the second chapter, to the other side of the book's argument, the fictions of society. These are typified throughout by the friends, collected round the dinner-table of the Veneering*. The Veneering* themselves have their root in nothing, being social Jonah's gourds under whose leaves (leaves of a dinner-table) prophets of society extend their legs as long as the gourd flourishes. There is Podsnap, the pompous, unimaginative oracle, who sweepa behind him what he does not choose to est, Tb**Twjethwir^ a*^wi)ps*fo/t?sV**W TImbs am Booti and Brewer, types * the teing * w*e * society whose thoughU ans be* foil* .Mfaaos of other men's ewmsjenf.

Of two friends, careless, thoughtless, and therefore half heartless, who had joined listlessly the circle of the Veneering*--, endured the flirtations of Lady Tippins, and by the foremost of whom?Eugene Wrayburn _evil was wrought for want of thought, that Eugene receives slowly the warmth of a true life into his heart from Lizzie Hexam, and at last makes her his wife. Eugene's comrade hears, as the book closes, the verdict of Society upon the deserter, aud he gets it from each member of the typical group about the Veneerings' dinner-table. But the last voice taken,?they bad almost forgotten to ask his opinion,?was Twemlow's, and it put the rest to silence; for among the mean and shallow fictions of society Twemlow brou-ht, boldly for once, as a true gentleman, his sense of the reality of the great soul of life. Within the bounds thus marked for the elaboration of tho main idea, there is everywhere the same essential unity with the liveliest variety of detail. There is a great heap of money in the centre of the story, made out of dust hy a dustman, and treated as a dust-heap in comparison with human truth and tender graces of the mind. There is a Bella Wilfer, whose character, at every period full of light and shade, is shown also in process of? development,?our literature does not contain a happier study of light girlish grace advancing, with no loss of charms, into a pure womanly earnestness. Bella, when young, believes that she is sordid. She has come out of a mean home into the daily relish of what wealth can buy; is guest and friend of Mr and Mrs Boffin, social nobodies, who happen, for a time, to sit on the gold heap with homely honest hearts that love of gold can never spoil. Then the Boffins join with Bella's lover, to whom really all the gold belongs, in plot for the girl's education and the fetching out of the true soul of life known to be in her. Boffin covers himself with glory,?and much mystifies the reader of the novel,? by appearing in the character of a man spoilt by wealth and turned into a greedy miser. Everybody knows how the story runs, and so we need not describe at length or quote any of its passages. We would only show that in this central plot also of Our Mutual Friend, as in the outlying incidents connected with it, the inner thought of the book ia still the same; is of the soul of life greater than all the fictions of society. To this design belongs the sharp contrasting of such characters as Mr and Mrs Boffin and Mr and Mrs Lammle; the story of the strong heart of Betty Higden, who showed qualities of heroism in avoidance of the workhouse ; the weak intellect with malice and greedy cunning in Fledgeby; the weaker intellect with love and the tender spirit of self-sacrifice in Sloppy. How full of a quaint generous humour again is the sketch of the doll's dressmaker, little Miss Wren, with her broken back and feeble frame, her precocious wit sharpened by trouble, in which the spirit of childhood casts its golden threads across the dull woof of her life of care, and whose kindliness is at times touched with a malice as of childish playfulness familiar with bitter years of trouble. Nobody who reads this book as a whole can fail to be struck with the ingenious arrangement and skilfnl conduct of the story. Bead piecemeal, it was satisfactory only to those who had faith in their author. The secret of Mr Boffin's little plot is so well kept, that while it was in action they who believed their old friend to be shown to them ss really spoilt by wealth, believed unwillingly, and sometimes may have rashly supposed that here the master's hand had lost its cunning. In fact, if we look back to those scenes in which Mr Boffin enacted the part of a miser, we shall be surprised to see how skilfully and freely the novelist scattered what, with the key to it all in our possession, we see clearly enough to be indications of the true state of the case. The wealth of wit poured over all the pages of this book would be an intellectual Harmon's estate, large enough to set on horseback every Wegg of a literary gentleman with a wooden head. We may say, if we will, that here we like and there we don't like any character or passage, but far above desire to criticize by the small way of personal comparison between our individual tastes and opinions and those bf our author is the keen enjoyment of bis genius. And, after all, there is the strictest justice in the heartiest appreciation of a liveliness of fancy that spends all its gaiety in quickening the honest sympathies of life, of a pathos that derives ita strength from a firm hold on the realities of life, a perception of character that seizes accurately types of men, presents vividly their distinctive characters, and all tinged with the observer's humour, that is to say, with his own character contained in the suggestions of them ? with ridicule onlv for that which is meanly false, scorn for all that is basely false, and innumerable touches of respect and fellow-feeling for every form of life tbat it, or honestly endeavours to be, frank and true."
64,B8286,['9446050'],"The Adventures of Philip on his Way through the World, Ac. y_w XOVELS. By W. M. Thackeray. 3 vols. (Smith, Elder & Co.) Mr. Thackeray must look to bis laurels. The world, whether it be the world of fine gentlemen or of innocent women?the world of the first or of the second table,?will at last get tired of being led down alley after alley of ""Vanity Fair.?The lamps in all the alleys are the same: the toys in the booths are the same: the haggard or humble people who tumble for mosey, or solicit custom for a livelihood, are the same. The ear cannot bear too long the drone of a hurdy-gurdy or the peal of an organ. Who has not wearied of a painter's model-face?of his chrome sky?of his grey wave?of his tree greener than grass or browner Utan burnt sienna, to be met with in our exhibition-rooms year after year? Who has not longed for something, if less mechanically true to Nature, at least offering some variety in form or colour ? Had ' Philip' been a first novel, the book might have commanded as many readers as had' Pamela,' when the Roxalanas of Kanelagh nsed to hold up a volume in their hands, byway of assuring rival SUUiras that they had got the new novel. Being something like the ?trent-, successor to the tale which installed (and most deservedly) its author as a first-class censor of manners, painter of life, and keen anatomist of the human heart, with all its breathings and its bleedings,?it may possibly meet with a more tepid welcome than any seventh or seventeenth work by so quick an observer, so well-read an author, so neat and manly a master of pure English as Mr. Thackeray ought to meet. No creator who produces much and rapidly can be always up to his own mark; but a Scott, even when he has to fight bankruptcy with palsy, in his old age, could not throw out his 'Fair Maid of Perth' without adding another figure to our gallery of real beings, in Harry the Armourer. It may be Erofoundly true that there is no hero without is speck, no villain without his temptation and his redeeming virtue, no good woman without her "" tempers,"" no virago without her passing spasms of goodness?that vulgar people are as essentially refined as many genteel ones, and genteel ones as intrinsically coarse as many vulgar ones,?but has not the world known as much, or as little, as this for the last eighteen hundred and sixty-two years? The episodes in the great chronicle of Time, however, vary ?the varieties of humour are endless; and among these things every real novelist will alwavs find sufficiently various material, whether he works up his public by an artfullycontrived plot, or holds them fast by developing some quaint character such as a Jonathan Oldbuck or a Sarah Gamp. In ' Philip' there is no intimation of novelty, save such as exists in the character of Nurse Brandon, with her stupendous love for the illegitimate son of the physician, whose lawful wife she was?her consequent self-effacement and her bad English. Some of her doings, however, are badly devised; as, for instance, her great achievement in overcoming the brute and the bully of the narrative by whisking chloroform into his face. "" Oh, my brother! were you to introduce a ""sensation effect"" like this into your everyday story of commonplace people, would not Pendennis have some sharp sarcasm to bestow on you?none the less stinging because it was thrown off with a poco-curante yawn ? Then, to set wrong to-rights?to turn the iron of a human lot into gold by such a fairy wand as a lost will delivered from the sword-case of a post-chaise by a providential overturn,?is surely an expedient on which bland moralists, like some authors we know, who professionally sneer at excitement and repudiate exaggeration, might find something to remark. In brief, if Mr. Thackeray's new book be subjected to the microscope, the result of such experiment may be referred to his own good sense and honest judgment. It is not well put together; there is a quiet carelessness in the style, a perpetual interposition of the author betwixt the reader and the characters, which tire and chill the interest. Mr. Thackeray can hardly write a chapter which does not contain some happily-fancied turn of language; but we wish that, when he writes again, he would not choose for characters a hero who is disagreeable, and a heroine who is merely pretty and loving, with a weak father and a horrible shrew of a mother, and a scheming, speculating hypocrite who ruins everybody?himself held in thrall by a sort of Fleet parson, gambler, sot and bully, and a vulgar publisher and his wife, who are not half so absurd in their breaking of English as the Twigg* in Hood's ' Tylney Hall,'?and a humane boarding-house keeper, the Afr*. Todgers of Paris, not so rich and real as her English contemporary,?and a heart-ess coquette who jilts the hero for money. The best-natured and most patient of men, or women, tires of keeping shabby company such as the above, and may be excused for hankeriiw after Alphonso the Brave and the Fair Imogene, or any other impossible Virtue or unmitigated Vice."

It is almost sad that this work of Bunyan should have come to be a story book for children; a delightful fairy tale indeed it is to them, with its giants and dragons, yet but little better than any other story of wild adventure; they can understand neither its teaching nor its pathos. There are few more pathetic figures than that of Christian, few portraits painted with greater perfection of style. How simply, yet perfectly, the story opens?"" As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a den, and laid me down in that place to sleep; and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, and, behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he? wept and trembled; and not being able longer to contain, he brake out with * lamentable cry, saying, ' What shall I do ?'"" Is not this the perfection of simplicity 1 It may seem unnecessary to write thus of "" The Pilgrim's Progress,"" but is it not one of the great unread books of the world 1 To illustrate a masterpiece is always a task of supreme difficulty, artist and author must be strangely in mental accord if success is to be attained. So far we have seen no finer illustrations of "" The Pilgrim's Progress "" than those of C. H. Bennett, but these of Mr. Byam Shaw equal them; the drawing of Christian, as pictured in the above quotation, at the outset proves Mr. Byam Shaw competent to carry out his undertaking; it is full of fine feeling, is well composed, well drawn, and the colouring sober yet strong. The same epithets may justly be applied to most of the plates, particularly to those of "" Christian before Discretion,"" "" The Jury,"" "" Hill Error,"" and "" Feeble and Ready-to-Halt Bring Up The Rear ""; but to make choice of very good out of so many excellences is scarcely fair.

66,B2674,['8949326'],"A Diplomatist's Wife in Many Lands. 2 vols. By Mrs. Hugh Fraser. (Hutchinson & Co.) Animated and rather indiscreet, these reminiscences should secure a wide public, more especially as beneath their sparkle there lies much sound reflection. Mrs. Hugh Fraser, who is the daughter of a well-known American sculptor, a sister of the accomplished novelist Marion Crawford, and the wife of an English diplomatist, has enjoyed an unusual upbringing. During a girlhood spent in Italy, she acquired an intimate acquaintance with society as it existed before the achievement of political unity, and she remains to this day an enthusiastic defender of the old order. Her arguments do not always carry persuasion, but it is well to be reminded that the conquered cause was by no means destitute of ability and devotion. It had also its quaint exercises of paternal authority. Thus Gregory XVI. displayed his zeal for morality by ordaining that the dancing girls at the opera should wear green Turkish trousers, whatever the rest of their costume might be, and by swaddling the figures on the tomb of Paul III. in cast-tin draperies painted to match the colour of the marble ! Officials, if Prince Massimo can be taken as a type, were not over-scrupulous:? "" He was for many years PostmasterGeneral, and utilized hh facilities to make a valuable collection. America was a long way off frcm Rome at that time ; and every letter that my people received from the United States had had the ste mps boldly cut out of the envelope before it was handed over to the postman. We get a pretty picture of priestly discipline in the Alban hills. "" The great preoccupation in the 'Castelli,' as the mountain villages are called, is to keep the girls out of harm's way; I have heard the preacher say to the women: 4 Never mind about the men; they were mado of different stuff to you ! They can be sometimes bad and sometimes good. But you cannot! A woman must be either an angel or a devil; there is no place between for her.'' "" The good priest, therefore, used to make them work in the fields in twos and threes, and he would count them at the entrance of the town when they returned to see that no girl was loitering alone. Mrs. Fraser does not pay compliments to those whom others would call the liberators of Italy?Victor Emmanuel, for instance, Farini, and Garibaldi. But we do not understand why a mystery should be mode of "" Garibaldi's Englishman."" His name was John Whitehead Peard; he was a member of a wellknown West Country family, and he died in 1880. Mrs. Fraser is definite, however, about that staunch champion of the Temporal Power, Cardinal Antonelli, whom she draws with vigorous strokes :? 44 In appearance he was a typical South Italian, small in build, dark-skinned, with piercing narrow black eyes that seemed to see everything and tell notliing of what was passing in the busy brain behind them. His face wes meant to be mobile, but usually wore a fixed smile which had become a part of his armour. He was a rapidly fluent talker, and at once took all the burden of conversation upon himself, evidently pleased with our naive admiration of the many beautiful things gathered round him in the room where he received us."" The Italian chapters in this book are, on the whole, the most interesting. But Mrs. Fraser seems to have a happy knack of making amusing acquaintances wherever she goes. She sits opposite a benevolent old gentleman at an hotel dinner, and he reveals himself as Edward Lear, the author of 'The Book of Nonsense.' A firm believer in ghosts, she has collected some gruesome stories about them ; and it appears that Julius Hare so excelled as a narrator in that vein that he made a cousin of hers faint away. In the second volume we are trans* ported to Peking, and confronted by the fascinating theory that there have been actually two Dowager Empresses, of whom the first died during the Boxer rebellion, whereupon the second, who had been trained for the purpose, promptly took her place. Mrs. Fraser's argument seems to be that the redoubtable lady was too wicked at fifty to have lived to be eighty, and that when eighty she looked as if she was not more than forty-five or fifty, and instead of being a tyrant had become most considerate. Be that as it may, she illustrates the pride of the Chinese by a significant story : after the looting of the Palace an officer offered to return some of the spoils to the Imperial family through the Chinese Ambassador. ""Take them away,"" exclaimed the Minister, ""they are desecrated, filthy?we never want to see them again."" Mrs. Fraser concludes with Vienna from 1880 to 1882. She does not spare the Court, and some of her stories about the Empress are a little unkind. She writes of the unfortunate, however, in a chivalrous spirit, notably of Benedek, the defeated at Sadowa, whom she considers to have been the victim of the incompetence of others, and who went to the grave without an attempt to exculpate himself. In taking leave of these agreeable volumes we may remark that it was Sir Henry Wotton, not Sir Thomas More, who defined an ambassador as "" an honest man sent to he abroad for the good of his country "" (p. vii.)."

Bradbury sad 1;u TInE completion of one of Mr. Dickens's monthly number books is to the critic what the termination of a year of great events is to the politiciat I the close of an epoch to the historian. The general reader may PAN fraO the perusal of the last chapter to the first chapter of some new work wilhdd endeavouring to harmonise and arrange the various impressions and emo""he has derived fromx the whole; but it is the duty as well as the plesas Of the critic to turn the completed globe round upon its axis, and tr i various lines as they converge towards the filial result. Even to him ho ever, the task is not easy. There is such an affluence of life in all Mr Dickens's books-so vast a rance of character and observation of the wold -so broad a canvas crowded with so many shapes and incidents-that te effect on the mind is not so much that of gllancing over a finished stor, that of looking at an epitome of life itself. If this involves some dege of imperfection in the mere matter of story-telling, it also miodeI M highest eIogy that can be pronounced oil j tiovolit w19QU Sppook .Di is the portryal of human nature and humian action. Air. Dickens i, the most dramatic of the novelists. lie reflects the whole round of life, from the richest and most refined circles to thle humblest and roughest; and looks with a penetrating eye, and with the intuition of intense sympathy, into all h depths of the human heart, all the secret nooks of the affections, all the crooked subtleties of villany, all the tanigled combinations of good and bad, which make us what we are. We do not exaggerate when we say that his enius possesses sonie poilnts of resemblance to that of Shakspeare-sorucig of' the very thing which, more than anything else makes Shakspeare the greatest of dramatic poets. It is not nierely t'at Dickens is himself a poet, a~nd in nothing so much as in his exquisite sensitiveness to those fine treads of analogy which conllect thle anliminate with the inanimate world, so that the still life of his scenes is constauitly mnade to reflect the (loiinant emotion of the characters, ill a manner which imay appear extravagant to matter-of-fact linls, but wlhich is woi(lerflully true to all who have ever felt emotion-it is not inerely thlat iiiany of' his characters have in them such a stronm and sclf existent vitality that they have already become 1)art of our actua experience, anld remain there like renieinbrances of our own life-it is not mertly that Dickens has adled phrases to the language, which are to be found in almost alny column of a newspaper you may takc up to read haphazard-it is not simply on these accounts that Dickens shows some a 'nity with Shakspeare, but niuch more on account of' that feeling of' universal sympathy with human nature which breathes through his pages like the 'broad and general' atmlosp)hlerc. lie soars above all considerations of sect, above all narrow isolations of erceil; andl, though a niorc deeply religious writer is not to be foundl, in all those elemnents of religion which rise eternally from thle niatural emotions of' love and reverence, lhe is never disputatiously theological or acadeiiiically dogniatic. Certain Universitybred reviewers, whose shrivelled souls cannott understand the fresh, spon. taneous efflorescence of genius, and who will accept no gold that does not come to them impressed with the college stamp, may affect to despise the large regard of Dickens; hut the world will recognise its great ones whether or not they wear the unitinrm of cap and( gown. As with his other works, so is it with Lit/le/ [irrit. The whole picture is quick and warm with lite. Passing from the hot southern flush and glare of Marseilles, in the opening chiapter, to the grimn old twilight house in London, with its haunting omysteries anrd uneasy secrets, in which MIrs. Clennam anrd Mr. lFlintwinch plot anid counterlp)lot-changwing from the dull prison rooms and yard, with their attendaiint poverty, made glorious by the divine light and love of Little l)orrit, to the stately palaces of Rome and Venice, glowing with the poinp of wealth-everywhere and unider all circumstances, the vitality of the conceptions asserts itself with all the supremacy of genius. A comitlete character will start before you within the compins of a tew lines; as in the case of the little Frenchiwonian of whom Mr. liorrit purcluses the gifts for Mrs. General, 0r in that of the Swiss bost whom Air. I)orrit alniost annihilates for a tfhncied slight, or in that ot the landlady of the Break of D)ay att Clialons. But these are the mere overflowings of thle cup. Te main chliaraeters are those to which we must chiefly look. And first of Al;. I)orrit. W%'hat awful truth and solenin voice of warning is there in tLat weak, selfish, pompous, insanely proud manl!proud and vain in his poverty, while descending to depthis of ieanness; flaunting his shabby family sctitclieon in the face of the visitors of' whom lie and pretending to a gentlemanly independence while his daughter t wheor nl, almost starves for him ; equally, but not more, proudl and vain when he suddenly becomes wNealthy, and fancies himself compelled to resort to miserable shifts to conceal his former state, which his daughter's devotion should have miade noble in his eyes; Proud and vain to the last, though, when the over-excitenient ot his changed lite topples over his reason and his health, he divulges in his mintal wanderings the fact ot' his previous poverty, and (lies with the shd(lowv of the Aazrshalsea upon hinm. Air. Dorrit is the very type of' flunkeyism ; and our time stan(ls in need of a lesson against that sordil viece. tit a nianly detestation of' servility is one of the most prominent elemenits in this tale. We see it again in the character of Mr. Alerdile, the swinrlhing speculator. Air. Ilerdle, it is well known, is a portrait from life; but it may be as well to recollect that lie is not merely a reflex of one individual. Ile is true to a very large, arid it is to be fered, an increasing, class; a class, of individuals not merely corrupt in themselves, but the cause of corruptioni in others. What matter that the Slerdles of' real life, like the AMerdle of Air. Dickens's fiction, are p9or in heart and brain--mere rattling husks of meni, with nothing inside but a few dead conventional ideas and pAhrases; what matter thft they are dull in thought, enibarrasseul in mali ner, constantly taking themselves iiito custody under their coat-cuffs wit]i that intuition of their own villany noted by ir. Dickens; what matter that they tremble before their butlers, and move about their drawing-roomins like icebergs that have preserved all their coldness and lost all their sparkle ? 'I'hey are rich, thougI by the ruin of others ; and Bar and Bisihop), Horse-Guards andl Treasury, obility and Commerce, bow down belfre them, till, as in the typical instance here portayed, ' tile shining wonder, the new constellation, to be followed by the wise men bringing gifts, stops over certain carrion at the bottom of' a bath, and disappears.' Another form of vorldly-iniii(le.(ness anrd filse pretence is exhibited in this romance in tile charac'ter ot 'Mr. (Caib, the Last of the Patriarchs.

These are toces, minute in themselves, but showing the finest wit and the deepes lede of character. W~e find the same courageous independence of thought one ore exhibited in the scorching satire directed against our ' Circumlocution o0ge' and ' Tite Barnacle' legislators. How much truth there is in that satir is shown by the fact of its being at once adopted by the popular mind. Against these shadows in the general picture-rendered still moe lowering by the blackness of the assassin Rigaud or Blandois-.the ood chaacters of the book come out like sunshine. There is little Dorritterse;f-one of Mr. L)ickens's most beautiful creations; and Clennam, the true pentleman and hi-h0souled. hero; and the noble-hearted, chivalric, half.witted John Chivery, mos~t pathetic in his hopeless love for Little Dorrit ; and the good natured, though noisy and flippant, Flora Finching (old Ctrby's daitr), not at all pathetic in her hopeless love for Clennan, though coming home to our sympathies in the thoroughly kind way in which she gives up Cleonm to Little lDorrit, as John Chivery bas given up Little Domt to Clennam; and Mfr. Pancks, the seemingly hard instrument of Mr. Casby in collectin the patriarchlal rents, but the final executor of poetical Justice on that chief of impostors, and the purely disinterested agent in reco g their for. tune tor the l)orrit family. 'These are the golden rays Mtlighten the story; the chief, of course, being Clennam and Little Dorit. From thoeo two characters, a soft, mild, grave, sad radiance streams fhm tbeginning to the end of the book. And, by a beautiful sense of poetical fitness, Lfttle Dorrit is brought back again to Clennam, after her long absence abroad, in the very prison and the very room where he had often been so great a fried to her, and where she is now to be so priceless a boon and agelical a comforter to him. And in the neighbouring church they are married, in the calm autumn weather which seems to typify their lives. WYe must confess to some disappointment at the explanation, towards the close of the book, of the mystery connected with Mrs. Clennam and dte old house with its strange noises. It is deficient in clearness, and doe not fulfil the expectations of the reader, which have been wound up to a high pitch. Indeed, the woof of the entire story does not hold together with suflicient closeness--a fault perhaps inseparable from the mode of publics. tion. The writing, however. shows all Mr. Dickens's singular union of close observation arad rich fancy. A few instances suggest themselves as e wurite. Of Jeremiah Flintwinch, whose head is always on one side, so that the knotted ends of his cravat dangle under one ear, and who has 'a swollen and suffused look,' we arc told that 'he had a weird appearance of having hanged himself at one time or other, and of having gone about ever since halter and all, exactly as some timely hand had cut him down.' The watch worn by the same old man was deposited in a deep pocket, ' and had a tarnished copper key moored aIbove it, to *hotw where it was mxk.' The garret bedroom of the old house contains 'a lean set of fire irons like the ske!eton of a set deceased,' nnd ' a bedstead with four bare atomio of poser, each terminating in a spike, as if for the diunal accov.rodatiox of *o&gm who htiyit prejer to ilrnale themselves.' Very poeticaL also, is the identfiation of the pent-up fire in Airs. Clennam's sick-room with the invalid herself. ' The fire shone sullenl)' all day and sullenly all night. On rare occasions, it flashed up pasionately as she dlid ; but for the most part it was Suppred, like her, and preyed upon itself, evenly and Slowly.' The light of this fire throws the shadows of Airs. Clennam, old Flintwinch, and his wife, Mistress Affiery, on a gateway opposite, like figures from a magic lantern. I As the room-ridden invalid settled for the night., these would gradually disappear: Mistress Affery's magnified shadow always flitting about, last, until it fnlly glided away into the air, as though she were off upon a withexcursoe. lThenr the solitary light would burn unebangingly, until it burned paebeor the dawn, and at last died unider the breati of Mistress Afery, as her shadow descended on it from the witch-region of sleep.' bhis is true poetry; but there are a thousand such touches in the book, as in all Mr. Dickes'as books, which ever) reader of cultivated pelceptions will perceive for himself. In Little onrrit, Mr. Dickens has made another imperishable addition to the literature of his country.Little Dorrit. NEW NOVELS. By Charles Dickens. Bradbury and Evans. Dark and Fair.

Against the annoyance of parting with our friend we have to set the gratification of our curiosity, revelling in the solution of some mystery which has tantalized it at intervals during the space of twenty months. The familiar green cover no longer makes its appearance, to be snatched at and eagerly read while the other serials and magazines lie neglected and uncut: but, on the other hand, we know all about it?-we are informed of the relationships, legitimate or illegitimate, of the dramatis personal?we have the satisfaction of feeling that the proper people are made happy, and that the murderer is detected and exposed. When we say that the above sentences, which describe with sufficient fidelity the reception which Mr. Dickens's novels have usually met with, are in no respect applicable to the case of "" Little Dorrit,"" we believe we are only giving a voice to the dissatisfaction which the story, even very soon after its commencement, began to excite, and which has been brought to a head hy its extremely lame and impotent conclusion. In a preface, which he vainly strives to divest of the air of an apology, Mr. Dickens assures us that he has more readers than ever. We are far from doubting the assertion ; we can only say that it proves very little, if any thing at all. The number of novel-readers increases so largely every year, that a great many inferior writers could make a similar boast. The material questions to ask are, Does Mr. Dickens keep his plat e in comparison with other novelists'? Are all his old subscribers faithful to him ? Is his present public an addition to, or in part a substitution for, his former onol Unless these questions can be auswered in the affirmative, we submit that the mere fact of an increased sale is no proof of real and enduring popularity ; least of nil of such a popularity as a man of Mr. Dickens's genius ought, if he does himself justice, to demand and receive at our hands. Mr. Dickens and his critics will respectively "" speak as they find:"" we can only say that, in a tolerably large and very miscellaneous acquaintance, we have found that the greater number of persons have either left off reading Little Dorrit after two or three numbers, or, if they have persevered to the end, have in the end unanimously condemned it. We will, hs briefly as possible, indicate the grounds on which we are, for the most part, inclined to agree with them. That Mr. Dickens's genius is wholly comic, and that his proper line is, to speak roundly, rather that of the buffoon than of the tragedian? a view frequently held, and set forth with remarkable ability in a recent number of Blackwood?is a proposition we are disposed wholly to deny. Those who would affirm it, consider Pickwick his greatest work, and every other of his tales inferior in proportion as it recedes from the Pickwickian standard. According to such critics, Mr. Dickens was bound to "" draw"" all the stable-yards in London for comic ostlers, and all the suburbs for humorous retired linendrapers and plethoric coachmen, before presuming to strike out a new line, and attempt to excite other emotions than those of laughter. He was to be ant Democritus aut nullv.s. These persons do not reflect that such a law, if applied to other artists who have done well, would have deprived the world of all the novels of Scott, and half the poetry of Byron and Goethe. ^Eschylus might have been told to stick to his ships, and not attempt to exhibit the Persians ns well as conquer them. If a man can make us laugh, the probability is that he can make us ciy ; indeed it is not unlikely "" Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast,"" that he cries himself much oftener than his friends imagine. Not to pursuethistheme beyond reasonable limits, we hold that Mr. Dickens was not only perfectly right to attempt something of an extra-Pickwickian nature, but that, moreover, he has succeeded in producing it. He has not only excited laughter, but teai-s and shuddering. Far from having retrograded because he ceased to confine himself to exhibiting the salient points of exceptional characters, the peculiarities of speech and gesture, and the rich absurdities which so often pass before us and are forgotten, he made decided and valuable steps as an artist and a describer of life, in bringing before us the pathos of the Old Curiosity Shop, the powerful and thrilling description which raises Martin Chvzzleunt above every similar chronicle of murder, and in sounding the deep moral abyss of meditated crime which in Bleak House opens before the recoiling eyes of Lady Dedlock. To have adequately grasped and embodied in fiction, not the oddities which arc peculiar to each, but the emotions which are common to all; and, while generalizing the latter sufficiently to excite wide sympathy, to have individualized them so as to accord with the idiosyncrasy of the characters by whom they were respectively manifested?is not a retrogression, but an advance, and one which lifts the author who makes it out of the comparatively low rank of comic writers, and sets him in the same category, at however great an interval, as Homer, Scott, and Shakspeare. And to "" expostulate "" with him for wiping the paint from his face, and scold him for aspiring to the high moral elevations on which he has so successfully tried his powers, is as sensible as to expect a coquette not to exercise her powers of fascination, or a soldier to box with his fists when he is armed with a revolver. Coincidently, however, with the exhibition of the remarkable creations to which we have adverted, Mr. Dickens has developed two characteristics which go far to neutralize the admiration which such great merits are calculated to excite. In the first place, the comic veiu, which flowed so abundantly in Pickwick, has in later works run with a weaker and a drier stream. Like the sherry in Leech's caricature, it has be- come ""a /udder and a thinner wine""?by the addition of much water and some other very unpleasant ingredients. His comic characters have become more and more exceptional, and iu some cases the emotion they create is simply that of disgust. They have every year less resemblance to human nature, and the amusement, if any, which they excite, is by degrees more dependent upon some quaintness of manner or speech (which might serve once or twice, but is reiterated ad nauseam whenever they make their appearance), and less upon that display of the inward nature which properly constitutes humour. Place oue of these hideous beiugs by the side of an earlier charaoter, and the contrast will be like that of passing from a stall at the Haymarket, when Buokstone is playing, to the grating of a cell in Bedlam. Imagine the family of the Smallweeds introduced to the genial society of Sam Weller, or even of the Bath footman ! They would have been kicked out instantly. And as for Mr. Weller, senior, he would have?sat upon them. These wretched creatures?and they are not the only instance in Mr. Dickens's later writings?exemplify another fault which seems io be growing upon him?that of choosing to describe people who are not so properly comic as fantastic, and as frequently remarkable for physical infirmity as for mental absurdity. Where is the fun of laughing at a dwarf, au idiot, or a paralytic ? or what purpose can be served by the exhibition, iu the same novel, of the hideous beast who slowly soddens himself with strong drink, and the nauseous chemical components of whose person stream down through the floor, to regale his fellow-lodgers after his spontaneous combustion ? Whether the promotion of good feeling between the different classes of society?the trump card of Mr. Dickens's school?be likely to be attained by his writings, is another very doubtful point. If he has succeeded in showing the upper class that there is a great deal of good in the lower, he has certainly shown the lower that there is a great deal of bad in the one above them. All his allusions to the higher ranks of society are distinguished by a spirit, not of satire, but of ill-natured sarcasm, which seems to be roused quite as much by mere differences of habits and manners, as by any deficiency in respect of moral qualities. Formerly he laid his task on all alike, and visited selfishness or cruelty with its due punishment, in whatever quarter it might be fouud. Now he exclusively appeals to the gallery, and tells them that all the virtues are to be found only south of the Thames and west of Tottenham Court Road? Extrema per illos, Justina, excedeus terris, vertigii fecit, and has left to their deserved fate the regions of Whitehall and Belgravia, utterly incapable of managing the business of the country, which should be exclusively intrusted to the hands of the virtuous shopkeeper and the intelligent mechanic. And this brings us to the second fault which we have mentioned as observable in his later works. In saying that it is absurd to require that a novelist should restrict himself to the delineation of one special part of humanity, we do not, therefore, imply that he is to rush blindly into a number of other subjects, which are not in themselves pectiliarly appropriate to fiction, and which, besides, are not to be understood by the light of nature alone. Now, Mr. Dickens, being gifted with a keen observation, ready sympathies, an effective style, and a good knowledge of certain limited sections of English life, has, on this slender stock of materials, set up latterly as a Social Reformer. There is in his works no evidence of any reading of the sort which is usually considered necessary for comprehending law, politics, or education; and there is no method of instruction, as at present practised, on which he has not bestowed some very telling and malignant sneers. Nor does he seem to have paid much attention to business, or to take much part in any of these matters, except as connected with charitable objects, in the promotion of which his bitterest enemy could not deny him to be meritoriously distinguished. In spite, however, of these very obvious deficiencies, he has come forward for the instruction of the public, and his views have found very general acceptance with the class of persons who take their politics from Punch, and never open a serious book, but are happy to raise their voices in any cry which their favourite novelist will suggest to them. Mr. Dickens is quite as destructive in his tendencies as Mr. Carlyle: but he is not quite so courageous. The author of Latter-day Pamphlets attacked the public offices when no one else thought of saying a word against them. Mr. Dickens prefers to kick an institution when it is down, or at least when it is being taken down to be mended. When some one else has scotched the snake, he comes and sets his heel upon it; but he is not the man to drag it out of its hole into the light of day. Enough, however, on this subject: were we to pursue it further we should only be going over the objections which have been already set forth, in our opinion with perfect justice, by the Saturday and Edinburgh Reviews, and which Mr. Dickens's sworn band of followers in the weekly press have been unable to controvert, except either by the clumsy adulation which a man with Mr. Dickens's sense of humour doubt- less appreciates at its true value, or by the same sort of swaggering impertinence by which they have tried to bully the public into posthumous admiration for their hero, the late Mr. Jerrold. The chief objection which, on our own part, we have to make to Little Dorrit is, that as a story it is insufferably dull, and that it does not contain a single character whom we can love, admire, or respect. The heroine herself, who is evidently meant to be an embodiment of all that is charming and meritorious in woman, has, we regret to say, failed to touch our feelings. She seems merely a fresh version of Esther Summerson, and, from her perfections, almost as remote from our sympathies as that very priggish character. We tire of hearing Aristides called just; and we would give the world for Little Dorrit to make a little mistake (short of a faux pas), or commit herself in some way so as to be brought down to the level of ordinary mortals. So muoh moral sunshine is wearisome; and, as Colton said of religion, we would die for it, fight for it, spend for it?anything but live with it. And, as has been acutely remarked by one of our contemporaries, *' her size"" is against her?she is made almost quaint. In this instance, "" the virtuous Marcia"" does not "" tower above her sex,"" aud the effect is detrimental to her. Her sister is almost preferable, notwithstanding her coquetry. It would have been only charitable to have given this young lady an opportunity of becoming something better: but Mr. Dickens, with his passion for stereotypes, gives her in marriage to one who is little better than an idiot, and over the rest of her life draws a veil, which no one who knows what this kind of marriage generally comes to will like to lift. Of the remaining characters, Mr. Dorrit himself is much the best. His meanness in adversity, and his contemptible insolence in prosperity, are excellently described. One of the best scenes in the b wk is the one where John Chivery brings his offering of cigars to the old man, who had been only too glad of such gifts in his Marshalsea state of existence, but with true snobbishness is now afraid of being compromised by communication with such a low fellow as "" youug John."" To the whole account, too, of Mr. Merdle's career the highest praise may be given. The accouut of his suicide, and the state of the public mind upon the occasion, is in Mr. Dickens's most finished and telling style. It is lucky that we have these characters aud scenes; for it takes a good deal to compensate for the exhibition of such a grotesque absurdity as Pancks, whose perpetual ""steaming"" is one of the nuisances of the book; and of such a hideous impossibility as Mrs. Clennam. We are, it is true, limier a certain disadvantage in criticising what this lady says and does, because we do not very clearly understand the narrative which is meant to explain her conduct; nor have we met with any one who does. Thucydides, in his darkest moments, was never more hopelessly obscure than Mr. Dickens has contrived to be, in the few pages where he professes to give the solution of the enigma on which we have been allowed to expend our ingenuity through so many previous numbers. We have heard of the old gentlemau who taught his grandson draughts till his pupil beat him; and we think that the author of the Dead Secret has set his master an example of neatness in the development of plot and of lucid explanation, when there is no longer any necessity for concealment, which the author of Little Dorrit would have done well to copy. In the latter work, we are distracted with a variety of threads which uever seem to converge, and tantalized so long with the mystery suggested in the outset, that we overstay our appetite for it; and it is then presented in such a form, that to make head or tail of it must require a far severer exercise of the analytical faculty than most novel-readers will care to undertake. Like the champagne which Mr. Albert Smith carried with him to the summit of Mont Blanc, it foams out in one unintelligible spirt, delivered in far too startling and hysterical a fashion for any thing like enjoyment. Mr. Dickens has never been eminent for the judicious management of his plots, having probably preferred to depend for success on brilliant execution and picturesqueness of characterisation. He seems to have written this story from month to month, and either uever to have clearly conceived the development of it beforehand, or, if he formed a plan, not to have cared to adhere to it. This practice, while it of course gives opportunities for working up any fire or railway accident that may occur in the interval, is not particularly favourable to the unity and comprehensibility of a novel. Whether Mr. Dickens has gained any thing by impressing into his service the fall of the houses in Tottenham Court Road, is a question which will easily be answered by any one who reads Little Dorrit a year or two hence, when the dust of that frightful accident shall have finally cleared off. For our own parts, we do not see any moral lesson in killing off your villain in a fortuitous manner, totally unconnected with any thing he has done, or means to do. Ii real life the wicked often go on "" flourishing like a green bay-tree."" Poetical justice disposes of them in some way appropriate to their crimes and pursuits. But to make use of a mere accident for this purpose, is to miss both the truth of realism and the satisfaction of romance. If Mr. Dickens has not met with his wonted success in appealing to our feelings of pity and terror, still less has he attained it by that exuberance of comic humours which has so often lightened the hearts and brightened the eyes of his readers. What there is of comedy in Little Dorrit must, we suppose, be referred to the characters of Flora, Mr. R's aunt, and the redoubtable Mr. Pancks. The latter is simply a bore, who comes on the stage, makes his accustomed grimace, and disappears. The ""aunt"" is in a certain way ridiculous, but after all affords only the same kind of amusement that is produced by the vagaries of a drunken man. Flora is a weak reproduction of Mrs. Nickleby, without Mrs. Nickleby's resemblance to nature. Even the names of the characters are hardly so happy as usual. What facetiousness is there in calling a woman "" Mrs. General""?a name simply unmeaning and absurd, with not even probability to recommend it? There is something too, ia the sound of "" Clennam,"" and "" Meagles"" which is positively nasty. The London Directory, which has so often assisted Mr. Dickens, might surely have supplied him with something more appropriate than these. In making the above remarks, we are not unmindful of the fact, that an author of established merit ought not, even when he makes a slip, to be visited with the castigation due to a mere pretender in literature. But there are one or two points in Little Dorrit which go far to disentitle its author even to this allowance. In the first place, while some of the best and oldest blood in the country was being lavishly poured forth in the Crimea, he waa unpatriotic enough to hold up the enemy with whom England was at war, as the model of all that England ought to imitate. In the next place, in the full face of the Robson and Redpath frauds, of peculation and adulteration in almost every department of trade and commerce, and in strange inconsistency with his portraiture of Mr. Merdle, he describes the middle and lower classes exclusively as the embodiment of all that is high-minded and straightforward in business. Probably all associations are liable to the same faults of divided responsibility and official insolence. If Mr. Dickens has found that railway companies, boards of directors and their underlings, and other public bodies of a similar description, are less obstructive and more courteous than the clerks at Whitehall, we can only say that he has been much more fortunate than the rest of mankind. In criticising his present work, we have, of course, judged him by the standard he has created, and the taste he has formed. Little Dorrit, which might make an inferior man famous, is very, very far below the merit of what its author has almost uniformly taught us to expect from him. In his present story, the author of Rockingham has produced a tale of less romantic interest than those by which he is already known ; but he exhibits greater oommand over his materials, more knowledge of his art, and, if possible, greater fluency of style. The plot is as follows :?Sir Charles Rockingham, a man of fortune and once of fashion, has retired to his estate in the country, in consequence of some disappointment, as to which we are not particularly informed. At the commencement of the story, he receives a letter from a female relative, proposing to make herself, and her daughter, Miss Lavinia Dieaway, his guests, in order that the young lady may be diverted from an undesirable attachment which she has formed for her cousin, Lord Walter Dieaway. The ladies arrive, and the ""lovely young Lavinia,"" having gained Sir Charles's sympathies by her gentleness and distress, is beginning to become a little reconciled to her separation, when her intimate friend Lady Camilla Dareall arrives, in company with Lord Walter, and establishes herself in Rockingham Hall. Their host, though subjected to a good deal of teasing by the lovers and their ally, manages to hold his difficult position between Miss Lavinia's mamma and the opposite p?rty with much success, and there appears some hope that the marriage will be allowed to take place, when it is suddenly broken off by the discovery of an intrigue, in which Lord Walter has been engaged with a fashionable London demirep. Lady Camilla and the faithless lover immediately depart for London, and the "" dark "" beauty is left to be consoled by Sir Charles. Whether he succeeds in this laudable attempt, or whether the truant admirer is recalled, and the "" fair"" Camilla installed as mistress of Rockingham Hall, are matters involved in considerable doubt at this stage of the story; and we shall consult the reader's chance of being interested, by leaving them unexplained, assuring him that the uncertainty is very ably kept up, till the exigencies of the closing third volume oblige it to be resolved in a manner highly agreeable to all parties concerned. The author of this novel has ventured on the difficult task of depicting fashionable people of the present day in their everyday habits and conversation; and though the machinery he has adopted for this purpose demands a good deal of faith at the outset, he must be said to have achieved a signal success. He has described the sayings and doings of persons belonging to a tyj? of which hundreds may be met with every day in the season, in a manner which sustains the reader's expectation from beginning to end on what seems a very slender stock of materials, aud keeps him amused by a stream of persiflage, which is always smart without lieiug positively witty, and is lively and piquant without ever approaching the confines of vulgarity. To take four persons :?one, a clever, high-minded, and amiable gentleman; one a beautiful and affectionate girl, but not possessing much character; one a fast young lady of the "" Kate Coventry"" order ; one a cool, vain, stupid, good-humoured, and impenetrable man of fashion, whose chief characteristic is an inability to j**onounce the letter r, and whose chief idea is his "" dwag;"" and to make them talk through the greater part of three volumes, so as not to bore or annoy a reader, but, on the contrary, to excite his curiosity and arouse his interest, is a great effort, and one which even men of more genius than the author of Rockingham would fiud it hard to accomplish. Dark and Fair, is in fact a genteel comedy, with connecting elucidations, in which the ""business"" that occurs between the nets is agreeably told. The actors are sot described, but made to exhibit themselves by what they say in a manner which is less common than it ought to be : and the peculiarity of Lord Walter's pronunciation is so managed as to have a surpassingly ludicrous effect. The bachelor, who enjoys the perusal of this amusing book over his evening cigar, will doubtless lose his heart to one or other of its heroines, and be apt to think that a drawing-room in which either ""Vinny"" or "" Cammy* should be the presiding spirit, might be a more desirable nest than even the luxurious smoking-room of his club. Barcliester Towers.?This book is a continuation of TM Warden; but it far surpasses its predecessor iu all the qualities which contribute to the goodness of a novel The Warden was the work of a man with much sense of humour, and a good deal of observation; but it resembled too strongly certain polemical stories which were fashionable a few years ago, and presented too wild a species of interest in the development of its narrative, to meet with the appreciation to which its merits would otherwise have entitled it. Barcheskr Towers is not liable to either of these objections; and the only drawback likely to affect its general popularity is the i'aat, that it is a continuation of another less meritorious story. Mr. Trollope is no longer polemical, except to a certain degree in favour of what is sometimes called the * high-and-dry** school of church orthodoxy. In other respects he wields a free lance, and exposes the absurdities and shortcomings, both of Tractarian and Evangelical divines, with a wonderful and almost wicked impartiality. The elements of interest in his present tale are more of the stamp usual in novels than was the case with Thc Warden. . Mr. Harding is less prominent, and love and matrimony in the person of the charming Mrs. Bold, widow, resume the supremacy which they are entitled to expect at the novelist's hands. The story is still concerned with the Wardenship of the Hospital; but the question of the appointment is complicated with that of another post for which there is an equally strong competition?that of husband to the fair Eleanor Bold. One suitor is the chaplain to the new Bishop of Barchester. Mr. Slope, a succulent evangelical parson, something like a young vicar of Wrexhill, whose object it is to obtain the wardenship for Mr. Harding, in order to ingratiate himself with his daughter. Mr. Slope would have the appointment in his own hands; but the bishop, Dr. Proud ie, is henpecked, and the appointment of warden Ls the battlefield o? which the superiority of Mrs. Proudie or the chaplain is to be decided. Mrs. Proudie's candidate is Mr. Quiverful, whose name expresses tl io conjugal fecundity which makes a post of ? 1500 a-year so desirable. In the pursuit of Eleaner Bold, however, Mr. Slope has two rivals; first, Bertie Stanhope, the lazy, clever, cool, impertinent, Italianized son of one of the canons of the cathedral, whose family have spent most of their lives on the continent, and are recalled into residence by the new bishop. Bertie's courtship is undertaken because he has tried various professions, aud that of consort seems to be the only one left open to him. He has not a bad chance in some respects; for one of his sisters, who is worldly and manoeuvring, makes herself the friend of Eleanor, while the other, who (like so many charming women) is separated from her husband, and endowed with all the equivocal fascination which that position generally implies, entangles Mr. Slope in an unlawful flirtation, and drives him as near to the verge of desperation as a low church clergyman can possibly go. Matters are in this state when a third admirer appears in the person of Mr. Arabin, a trained Oxford divine, who has been sent for by Mr. Harding's friends to counteract the influence of Mr. Slope. Were we dealing with any other novel, we should be satisfied with having told the story thus far, and take care not to forestall the reader's interest by pursuing it to the end. Mr. Trollope, however, tells us in so many words that he has uo objection to his conclusion being divulged, and himself in- dicates, long before the end of the third volume, the fate of the characters about whom we are most interested. He thus claims the high merit of being able to induce us to proceed by his mere manner of telling the story ; and we are able to say, that he has not claimed more than is his due. His neat, clear, and vigorous style, his sensible aphorisms, and general brilliancy of execution, are sufficient to draw a reader on, although he knows that the lady is far too good for such a creature as Mr. Slope to be allowed to carry off, and is given pretty clearly to understand that Mr. Arabin is at last to make a vacancy among the fellows of his college. Mr. Trollope's style frequently reminds us bf Thackeray, and his views of life are not unlike those which the great moralist is fond of inculcating. They are healthy, free from cant, and with a leaning to the domestic and comfortable side of human existence, not without the humorist's smile at its romantic aspirations and its prosaic realities. Mr. Trollope takes any thing but an ordinary novelist's view of life, or he would have taken care not to make his heroine a widow. It is not easy to feel enthusiasm about a widow, however delightful certain individuals of the genus may sometimes prove. Colonel Hamley has depicted a charming specimen in his Lady Lee; but half the interest with which we contemplate her arises from one being told that her first marriage has not been one of affection. Eleanor Bold, however, is described as having been sincerely attached to her first husband ; and this fact, coupled with her readiness to think of a second engagement so soon afterwards, rather detraots from the freshness which one naturally expects to belong to the central figure of a story like Barchester 2'owers. It will not be long, we hope, before Mr. Trollope favours us with another story, and then, perhaps, he will give the spinsters a turn. Mrs. Gore's novel of The Two Aristocracies is a great improvement on the last work from her pen, which we lately had the honour of criticising. A Life's Lessons, though not otherwise than a clever story, was in parts exceedingly dull, a fault which certainly cannot be charged on the present story; sparkling as it does with much of the ancient brilliancy which the writer of Cecil showed she could employ at need. Agnoscimns vetens vestigia flamtnos. Whether this pyrotechny is employed for an equally legitimate purpose, may be matter of more doubt. The "" two aristocracies "" are, of course, those of birth and wealth, and the tie which connects them is that of marriage. Mark Barneson, the son of an apothcary, is employed as clerk by a great iron-master, whom he succeeds in business, and one of whose daughters he marries. The other is ambitious, and marries a certain Lord Arden. Mark Barneson's daughter, at a later period, inspires a mutual attaohment in another nobleman, a younger son. The greater part of the book is taken up in delineating the rapacity of Lord Arden as regards his wife's fortune, and of the family of Miss Barneson's lover as regards hers; the middle class and manufacturing interest being for the most part represented as distinguished by probity and disintereduess, and the class to which Lord Arden belongs by the opposite qualities. Mrs. Gore seems to have been taking a leaf out of Mr. Dickens's book; but has outdone him in vituperation, aud fallen short of him in truth. For the imputation of official incapacity and offensive hauteur, as applied to the aristocracy, there is a foundation; for that of trickery and double dealing in money matters, we are persuaded there is none. With thin exception, and that of a country family whoso members are made scheming and disagreeable to an absurd and untruthful extent, the personages are probable, life-like, and well finished; and, though there is no hero, the book is unquestionably very readable and amusing. Its faults, in addition to what we have stated? which are of course matters of opinion?are, that there is no one person at once amiable and clever enough to excite really strong interest in his fate; and that, at an important crisis in the story, the dramatis personae are described as acting in a manner which we are morally convince! is contrary to all probability. Take, for instance, the following dialogue; say, whether, as regards the italicised portion, the actors are not made mere puppets:? "" I am not afraid,"" rejoined the young lady, looking him resolutely in the feice. "" Into this house Mr. FerrierTHE LITERARY EXAMINER. Little Dorrit. Bv Charles Dickens. Bradbury and Evans. Of all Mr Dickens's novels, Little Dorrit is pernaps me one that takes the highest aim. We are among those who read the first chapter eighteen months ago, and the last chapter but yesterday. During the publication of the tale in monthly numbers we have enjoyed it much and grumbled at it much. It is complete, aud what was dark is clear to us, what matter was confused we find As many arrows, loosed several ways, Fly to one mark. In this novel Mr Dickens has thought more of his single volume than of his twenty parts, resisting most completely the temptations which lead to the final hurt of many* a book published in fragments. Little Dorrit has been the less appreciated for this reason as fugitive reading, but it will be only the more appreciated as a permanent addition to our libraries. We do not hold it to be either Mr Dickens's best or his worst work, but, as we have said, we believe it to be of all others, as to its aim, the highest, and, we may add also, as to its manner of construction, the one that is most characteristic of his genius. Its aim, from which never a shaft diverges, is to 6how the beauty?even the sublimity?of a simple, unaffected, and unselfish doing of all duties, great and little; tbe ugliness and baseness of the qualities that are antagonist to this. Little Dorrit is the subject of the novel, and she means Duty, as in Spenser Una means Truth or Duessa Falsehood. The words Do It begin and end, possibly not by accident, her very name. Her character, the character of Duty, runs as a golden thread through the whole story. The tale is divided?no scheme could be simpler?into two parts, Poverty and Wealth. Through poverty and wealth the golden thread of Duty runs, ever the same. Little Dorrit is tried by endurance of the lowest depths of want, hopeless confinement in a debtors* prison, and is then submitted to the test of an abrupt change from want to wealth. The golden thread runs on without a break, without a bend. Little Dorrit is then tried with gold, and afterwards submitted to the test of an abrupt fall from wealth to poverty. She mounts up to heaven, she goes down again into the depths, but her soul is not melted because of trouble. The even line of Duty never is turned to the right hand or to the left. Then, again, we have in Little Dorrit's character the nature of Duty,?the forgetfulness of self, the thoughtfulness for others, the constant patience, the noiseless endeavour to be straightforward and right in little as in great things, and the habit of doing everything in the most kindly manner. Selfish relations do not weaken in her heart the filial tie. She is laughed at, patronised, nominally held in low esteem, but she wins more or less of love and reverence from all, and, in an hour of need, even those who affect to laugh at her rely upon the wisdom of her counsels. Around the path of Little Dorrit, whose life shows us how duty is done, are grouped illustrations of the way in which it is left undone. There is the Circumlocution Office, specially bent on tbe solution of its problem, How Not to Do lt. There is Mr Merdle, doing nothing in the world of commerce, yet contriving to amass a fortune?but no stable fortune?by the fcfce of selfishness, by pushing his way on, rather than working it on, totally regardless of all claims of duty. There is Mr Casby, doing no duty in life, but subsisting blandly on a reputation for benevolence, while he can get even extortion done on his behalf by a paid deputy. There is Mi ss Wade, doing no duty in life, but tormenting herself with a selfish delusion by which she is made useless to society. There is Tattycoram, needing the same wholesome lesson, and receiving it at last in homely words of truth from Mr Meagles. There is Mrs C len nam, wasting her years as a victim to that intense form of selfishness which gets from a misread Bible justification of its evil passions, and professes to leave duty undone in the name of God. There is Henry Gowan, a painter who gives no toil to his calling, a man who has no purpose before bim, who is not to be made happy by the fairest gift of fortune, and upon whose married life there may well come the shadow of Blandois of Paris. As Little Dorrit represents in the book the Angel of Duty, so in Blandois we have the Demon ol Selfish Idleness. His smile that is a sneer, and his white bands that never have been applied to labour, are the con stantly recurring emblems of his character in passages o persons! description. He is a gentleman for whom others must work, to whom others must give way, who regards none ss certainly as Little Dorrit regards all. If Little Dorrit be the Una, he is the Duessa of the tale. We do not mean for a moment to assert that in writing this novel, or sny other of his novels, Mr Dickens bas proposed to himself to construct an allegory as complete in all details as that of sny book in Spenser's Faerie Queene. Upon that principle no novel of modern life could possibly be written. But Mr Dickens, as most readers have felt, is st once poet and story-teller. Many of his paragraphs happen indeed to be really written in good verse, though it is not in metre that their poetry consists. It was not metre that made a poem of the tale of the Old Curiosity Shop, or of that portion of Dombey and Son which told the life and death of little Paul. From other English novelists we think that Mr Dickens may hereafter he distinguished as the one writing most habitually with the temper of a poet This it is, in no slight degree, which gives their peculiarity to nearly all the characters he paints. They are personifications, and as such their names pass constantly into our common speech as pleasant equivalents for the particular qualities they represent. A particular form of hypocrisy in a man is expressed by calling him a Pecksniff, ora particular form of worthlessness in a statesman is expressed by calling him a Barnacle. Of the sins of a class Mrs Gamp is an emblem ; Mr Bumble is an emblem of another thing, and MrMerdle of another. In the same spirit a common abuse in statesmanship, being seized and idealised, is reproduced under the type of the Circumlocution Office. Every one of these personifications is to be taken, rather as one of the elements of truth reduced to its pure state by the chemistry of genius than as the ordinary compound truth which enters into every-day life. Of course one may complain of a chemist who experiments on oxygen that it is air with the nitrogen improperly left out; and so one may complain of Mr Dickens's sketch of the Circumlocution Office, that it shows only half the constitution of the air in Downing Street. In the same way too, nearly all his characters may be pronounced monstrosities, for nearly all the elements of which the world is made, when seen alone, can be seen only as monstrosities in nature. We do not complain of the chemist for delighting us when be reduces to their essence a few compounds of dead matter, nor need we complain of the poet?or the novelist who chances to do poet's work?when he also reduces to their elements a few compounds of life. In Little Dorrit we have the most perfect example of that principle of personification upon which, consciously or unconsciously, Mr Dickens generally constructs his characters, and even his incidents and plots. Very often there is connected with each some typical circumstance, such as the sneer and the white hands of Blandois, the pomposity and weakness of Mr Dorrit's '? hum "" and "" ha,"" or the idea of a steam engine in reference to Mr Pancks, who is a machine in Mr Casby's hands, full of repressed energy (by reason of the too much pressure he at last explodes); in all personification this is a common and indeed a necessary and inevitable practice. We are not sure also whether the same impulse which caused Spenser to personify folly and vice under so many grotesque and monstrous forms is not that which has compelled Mr Dickens to create such dwarfs and dragons as a Quilp, a Smallweed, and a Flintwincb. We have called attention only to one point in discussing Little Dorrit, the point from which we believe that a reader will best see the entire picture on the artist's canvas. And we are tempted now to illustrate a part of what we have been saying by reference to a point of similarity between two very different works, Mr Dickens's Little Dorrit and the Newcomes of Mr Thackeray. When the story of the Newcomes was appearing in its monthly parts, very few readers could keep their attention fixed upon its purpose; the author seemed almost to have no purpose, and to be drifting about weakly with his characters. There were not a few who gave up the reading of it in despair. But tbe work being once collected and read as a whole, proved to the surprise of many readers to be most remarkable for unity of plan ; to be a novel in which Mr Thackeray bad taken the deepest and the truest views of life, and in which he bad been working out, with an unfaltering skill, a single lesson. Its theme was Marriage, and in no chapter did the author lose sight of his purpose to contrast the right with the wrong foundations of domestic life. That which had appeared like want of concentration in a detached part was found to belong intimately?as words broken out of the middle of a sentence may belong?to the simplicity and clearness of the whole. The likeness between Little Dorrit and the Newcomes in this one respect is obvious enough. Very lightly let us touch upon one other consideration. We have said that Little Dorrit is to be regarded as the most characteristic of the works of Mr Dickens, meaning thereby that it is the best example of tbe way in which his novels are constructed. We need hardly remind any reader that it is characteristic also in a higher sense. The spirit of the author's life is in his story. What Englishman does not know bow the fame won by the brilliant sport of genius in Sketches by Boz and Pickwick filled ito author's heart, not with a weak self-worship, but with a deep sense of duty to be done. From the moment when his name became a name to conquer with, Mr Dickens has made only one use of its great influence. As novelist, as journalist in every honest way, he bas steadily and day by day, to the best of his knowledge and the utmoet of his talent, been maintaining what is good, attacking what is evil, and bent wholly on the '\ doing of his duty.

Blackwood and Sons. It is worth while to inquire why one of the cleverest books of the day should be nearly the most tedious. There is more evidence of the author's natural wit in The Mill on the Floes than there was in 'Adam Bede,' and a good natural wit is the first qualification of a story-teller. It may be, however, that the cleverer book is at a disadvantage even in its cleverness. Ostendere, not ostentare, is an ancient warning. The wit that shot up naturally in the former works of this writer, and that was as pleasant in the ' Scenes from Clerical Life' as in ' Adam Bede,' having been lately shut up in a hothouse of too fervid praise, is forced into excess of blossoming. Throughout The Mill on the Floss strain is evident. It is an honourable strain to meet the utmost praise with the utmost deserving. We know no example of a writer of genius forced into unnatural display of power who is more free than George Eliot from all meanness of affectation. Over-elaboration, then, may be one cause of the tediousness of the book. Charming sketches of child-life in former writings had received the commendation they deserved, and so the first three hundred and sixty pages of The Mill on the Floss are spent on minute painting of a boy and girl. The old praise is more than justified, but the justification is attended by no small waste of the reader's patience. Even as girl and boy Maggie and Tom weary us. As they grow up they are made to weary us so much that, by the time the story ends, we are most grateful for the suddenness with which-when it is not to be supposed that one person remains who could bear to read about them any longerthey are both sent to the bottom of the Floss. The catastrophe, though as a matter of art unsatisfactory, precisely satisfies, if we may generalise our own sense of relief, the feeling of the reader. Let us say at once that we do not overlook the art with which, by stray indications in the. course of the book, the end is foreshadowed; that we duly appreciate the legend of Ogg the son of Beorl, that we' do know why Maggie in her love-making is represented as having become clever at rowing, and so forth. We do not even complain of the suddenness and rapidity of the close, although that may seem a fault by contrast with the long drag of the previous narrative. We have no wish to urge the technical objection that the actual manner of the destruction of Maggie and Tom is impossible in nature, obvious enough as the fact is that two floating bodies, whatever their relative size, being borne on a current would be i borne at the same rate, so that the one floated in advance | if propelled even by the strength of a child must distance 1 the other. The more serious fault of the catastrophe is part of the main fault of the book, and we shall have to 1 discuss that presently. It is the minor defect of excessive !I elaboration that concerns us now. I In no part of the work is this over-elaboration so unsatis-!: factory in its result as in the endeavour to maintain high credit for perception of the secret springs of character. This credit, we think, was never fairly earned. There is in The Mil on the Floes a very great profession of such insight; for example, when Mr Riley strongly recommends to Mr Tulliver the Rev. Walter Stelling as a tutor for his'! son Tom, having no very strong motives for doing so, no less than five pages are occupied with a detailed analysis of the small reasons that may have worked together in his: mind to affect the manner of that recommendation, and all,' that is said in those five pages could have been better ex I pressed in a paragraph, if not in one sentence. It is, indeed, in this feature of the book only that there is room for the charge of a censurable affectation. George Eliot here! appears as a quick-witted writer, whose most laboured effort does not contain one possible character that is more than a sketch-who is clumsily wrong in every main feature of a story that is to be regarded as a copy from real life, and who is cleverly wrong in a very great number of those ingenious remarks, meant to express knowledge of life and character. Take, for example, the suggestion with regard to Maggie of the "" knowledge of the irreversible ""laws withiu and without her, which, governing the habits, ""becomes morality, and developing the feelings of submis-; ""son and dependence, becomes religion."" The saying looks profound, yet what could be more inadequate than to define religion, the highest energy of life, as a mere sbmision to irreversible laws? Surely such a writer, if clever, enough to be self-conscious, can hardly claim to be considered an anatomist of human nature. Minute study of such art-manufacture as the Dodsons might almost be compared to the deliberate handling of the scalpel over the rag-carcase of a fifth of November subject. And tedious as the Dodsons are, how much exquisite humour has been! pent on the elaboration of them ! We only say that it is no anatomy of life at all. It is a waste of lace and jewellery in the dressing up of scarecrows. But thgeat faul at o r book a VW pet mwe at its td that w v ma have bow the intention of the writer, it p en li s a n without a clue. As r 1wa of amto iating great and sall ideas is rpoucd i a dilute form through half a dozen charaters for the of poor-Witted provincial life, is one of the plagues of the Dodsons, and beaks out even in Bob Jakin, who is one of the least incomplete and impossible in th. dory; so the mechanic in another of Mr Dihkens's novels, whose view of life was that "" it's aw a muddle,"" has his axiom reproduced as if it were the one truth to be found by penetrating to the core of our humanity. If the story of The Mill on the Floss has any central principle at all, this passage from one of its clog chapts (in which the italics are ours) will express it: The great problem of Ihe Bayinxg rEdit bdtwepenao axd duff is clear to no man who is capable of apprehedin it: the question, whether the moment has come in whic a has llen below the possibility of a renunciation that will carry any efficacy, and must accept the sway of a passion against which he bad struggled as a trespass, is one for which AwveS so matr-boy tha4 Willf all cam. The casuists hase become a byword of reproach; but their perverted spirit of minute discrimination as the shadow of a truth to which eyes and hearts are too often fatally sealed: the truth that moral judgments must remain false and hollow, unless they are checked and enlightened by a perpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the individual lot. To comment upon this passage is to comment on the tone of the whole book. There is no "" shifting relation between "" passion and duty ;"" whoever apprehends such a relation is below and not above the average of human wisdom. In the words of One by whom we were taught the unity of truth and the simplicity of the divine law that can be applied as easily to conduct by the peasant as by the philosopher, we have "" a master-key that will fit all cases."" It is not used to unlock the difficulties of life as they are untruly presented in this novel. Old Tulliver dies worldly honest, cherishing his hatred, and his last words are said to be, "" This world's ... too many ... honest man ... "" puzzling . . ."" Maggie, the heroine, for whose passionate life we are prepared from the beginning, abandons a sentiment of love, slow and long in its growth, for a sudden passion of mere lust towards a man who displays only coarse animal love for herself, and this under surrounding circumstances that are designed to aggravate the shame. The author does not seem to perceive how despicable the heroine at last becomes, and how little sympathy is to be won for her tortures and her doubts, for her conflict of duty with passion, that did once in the course of her life acquire the help of some ascetic teaching from Thomas 'a Rempis, but that never attained to the application of the first principles of Christian life which are the common ground possessed alike bay Christian of every name. A knot is tied by lust-unless it be his account of the contents of Buckland's ' Bridgewater Treatise' there is nothing else to account for Maggie's sudden love of Stephen-and the only solution of the difficulty is such shallow comment as the sentence we have quoted illustrates, followed immediately by a letting loose of the floodgates to drown with Maggie and Tom all further consideration of the puzzle. As it is with the book as a whole, so it is with the characters presented in it. The Bible appears once or twice in the story as a thing to lay a hand upon and curse by. There is one reverent allusion to the Christian doctrine of tolerance in association with the doctrine of the story that provincial life is utterly intolerant. As a social picture the tale may have been meant indeed to display the narrowness of life in country places. But here also it is not true. The scandal of a little town it needs no penetration to remark upon. True depth of penetration would rather have been shown in pointing out how the warm human heart beats even in country towns as in the capital; how mere an accident, though a too obvious accident, is that restriction and localization of talk which is here represented as the core of human life ""a narrow, ugly, grovelling ""existence"" among the people of St Ogg's. Truer and cleverer than this novel, even as a picture of the outside littlenesses of provincial society, infinitely truer in its recognition of the minds to which they are but as a dress, was Mrs Giskell's "" Cranford."" The merit of the Mill on the Floss, as of George Eliot's former books, lies mainly in shred feminine humour and a quick perception, not of the depths and mysteries of life, but of what is quaint and noteworthy in its externalS. To these qualities value is usually given by a wholesome, unaffected style that will express truthfully the lights and shadows of the writer's feeling. An occasional defect in the style we are tempted to attribute to interpolation. In speaking of Adam Bede we hinted a suspicion that it contained touches by a male as well as by a female hand. We cannot easily believe that it is the graceful writer of the main part of the MdiU on the Flos who describes young Philip at the piano as an "" amorphous bundle,"" who speaks with cumbrous jest of a servant-maid scrubbing a table as "" suffering a waste of tissue by evaporation;"" compares "" a shiny deposit of dust "" on clothes to "" tablets ""prepared for writing upon ;"" speaks of Wakem's ' pa""renthetic vindictiveness towards the uncomplimentary 1""miller;"" and of Mr Tulliver's faculties ' renewing ""their strength from getting a footing on this demonstra"" tion of the senses ;"" ends a chapter with a similitude about the "" nidus of seeds,"" with "" an apparatus of "" hooks "" to get hold of very ""unreceptive surfaces;"" avoids naming rabbits humorously, but unnecessarily, by calling them "" the more familiar rodents;"" with more of the same sort of dulness. If it be not that another hand is answerable for passages aMd phases, em ad ee part of capte, in the book that are as Cape in dsey, Vatican wie mixed with paLernin, we must suppose the author of the Mil on thw Fit to be Hl eto attack of feebleness in wit, and apt to lSpee into a clumsiness of style inconsistent with the power y displayed. But if there be, as we prefer to suppose, a Itu let it be remembered that suc spoiling of a good thing is worse than injudicious, clue as juguar Faenwmr. We have been slow to direct attention to the faults ol the MiUo the FoaM , and having done so we can only Part fom the author with a cordial recognition of her gSius, and with the confession of a belief that among the ,emal novelista of our day only Min Bronte and Mrs (skell occupy a higher place than she is likely to retain. We shall be as quick to praise her next work as we have been slow to censure this, if she do not again weary us by presenting to the world artificial men and womenas disjointed pieces of a puzzle to be wrongly put together, and then swept off in despair.He Mill on the Floss; Novels and Romances. by George Elliot (Blackwoods.)?The authoress of "" Adam Bede"" has been aptly compared to a Dutch painter. Her writings belong essentially to the minute and truthful school of art, and very often do not escape the accompanying drawback, that, for the sake of minuteness and truth, grace, refinement, and even dramatic effect, are ruthlessly sacrificed. The result is, that the characters painted with such wonderful accuracy are disgustingly coarse, and, what is worse in an artistic scene, the incidents described with so much painstaking vere-similitude are trivial and uninteresting to a lamentable degree. This fault, dimly perceptible even in "" Adam Bede,"" has become unpleasantly conspicuous in the ""Mill on the Floss."" The characters are drawn with the microscopic accuracy of a photograph. But when we have got them, there is nothing either in themselves or in what they do which can excite any serious sympathy in their peculiar traits and personal fortunes. The scene of tbe story is laid in the vicinity of some tenth rate town, of semiagricultural, semi-commercial character, through which passes the Floss?which the reader discovers, somewhat to his surprise, to be a tidal river, rather prone to inundation. All the personages of the tale belong to the lower station of the middle, or the upper station of the lower class. They are millers, small farmers, or engaged in retail business: the constituents, in short, of that numerous section of the industrious community among whom, fifty years since, a sort of rugged honesty constituted the chief virtue, but whose coarse grain has, by the recent spread of education, become overlaid with a thin veneer of refinement To this class ?the Tulliver and Dodson families, who supply nearly, the whole series of dramatis persona) to the novel, intrinsically belong. The pere Tulliver is the centre figure of the book, and his wife, whose constant boast it is to "" have been a Dodson,"" brings the story into contact with numerous scions of that strongly marked but highly commonplace family. The Tullivers at the outset own the "" Mill on the Floss,"" and are well to do in the world; but during the course of the tale lose their property, and sink into sad destitution through the too eager prosecution of a lawsuit by Mr. Tulliver. The worthy pair have two children, Tom and Maggie, the former inheriting the practical tastes and also the obstinacy of his father; the latter acquiring, no one can tell how, but certainly from no family source, a truthful and somewhat romantic disposition, accompanied by that "" strong necessity for loving "" which is the cause of so much happiness or misery, as the case may be, in actual life, and constitutes one of the chief desiderata in the heroine of a novel. Through the first volume we have described the development of these characters in the boy-and-girl stages? described with wonderful truthfulness, and rendered highly entertaining. There is also a good deal about various members of the Dodson family; and the authoress shows her miraculous talent of eharacter-painting by the perfection in which individuality is stamped and preserved upon each of a rather numerous group, although not one of them rise above the level of the most ordinary commonplace, or possesses any more distinctive characteristics than those arising from the exhibition of small vanities and petty jealousies, and microscopical grievances towards other scions of the ""Dodson"" stock. At the end of the volume a lawsuit, . which has for years been the nightmare of the Tulliver existence, ends in an adverse verdict. Old Tulliver is now ruined, and sold up. The Mill on the Floss passes to other owners, its new proprietor being Lawyer Wakem, his opponent at the trial, and whom Mr. Tulliver regards professionally and personally as an agent of the Evil One, and declared enemy, not only of himself specially, but of mankind in general The series of motives which induce the obstinate old man to remain as manager in the mill that once was his own, is traced with admirable art, and a true insight into the depths of the human mind is evinced when he is made to swear in the same breath, and write on the fly-leaf of his family Bible, his determination to serve his old enemy honestly, and yet hate him eternally. This vicissitude of fortune produces its natural effect upon the character and the career of Tom and Maggie. But the story henceforth becomes highly distressing, and we will not carry our analysis any further; suffice it to say, that while Tom achieves some practical successes, Maggie gets into various difficulties and entanglements. She turns ascetic, under the erroneous impression that voluntary suffering is the source of happiness; falls in love with the intellectual qualities of Philip Wakem, the deformed son of their lawyer enemy, and of old Tom's schoolfellow, and with the personal qualities of Stephen Guest, the son of an enriched manufacturer with whom the Dodson family are somehow connected. In vacillating between these rivals, Maggie contrives to bring misery upon both, and involves in the misfortune her own cousin and. friend, Lucy, who has been almost engaged to Stephen. In the third volume a new set of characters are introduced, the small gentry of the cathedral town of St Oggs. But by this time space has become valuable, and it is necessary to hurry forward the incidents which led up to the final catastrophe. This is brought about by a heavy flood on the Floss?this river from the beginning being described as disagreeably prone to inundation?in which Maggie and Tom are swept away together. The conclusion is essentially melodramatic, and so also is most of the "" business,"" to use a stage term, by which it is introduced On the whole, we are obliged to say that the authoress of "" Adam Bede "" has, in her present novel, not made a step in advance. Admirable in parts, the "" Mill on the Floss "" is a failure on the whole. In comparing the book before us with its predecessor, we subject it, no doubt, to a severe test The sweepings and after-thoughts of a work like "" Adam Bede,"" might furnish forth more than one novel which Mudie would patronize, the public read, and the oritics approve if written by any other author. The gleaning of the grapes in Ephraim may be better than the vintage of Abiezer; but the superiority furnishes no excuse for laziness or negligence in the Ephraimite husbandman.LITi ER:I1-.xI It RI'v 18U 1[ l R. 7AT .1!ill oft the Floss. r- _ . - _ By GLORG.E ELIoT, authleer f "" .0Adam Bede. 3 vols.

The riglit word iq ardw'ys put in the hia plawe ; the exact phrase chosen which suits tke cClon. It m scareny fair to give the plot of a story, ad the only euse for such a proceeding is when a Six is expected, and there being no room for eztracta, the only thing to be done is to outline the attors creation. There is to occasion for ,ed a eowue in the present instance, yet for the sike of diaking the extracts better understood and appreciated3 we may remark that the dramatis per. onD of the tale are Mr. Tulliver, the owner of the miu, Mrs. Tulliver, his wife; their son, Tom, arid a daughter Maggie. The latter is the heroine of the story, and a most interesting character. There ar several other persons; but the main interest is concentrated in these. Mr. Tulliver's views with respect to his son, are thus graphically giaen: What I want is to give Tom a good eddication as'll .be bread to him. That was what I was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave th' academy at lAdyday, I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer. The two years at th' academy 'od ha' done well enough if I'd meant to make a miller and a farrier of him, for he's had a fine tight more schooling nor ever I got; all the leanin' my father ever paid for was a bit o' birch at one end, and the alphabet at th' other. But I should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard, so as he might be up to the tricks o' these fellows as talk fine, and write with a flourish. It 'ud be a help to me wi' these law-suits and arbitrations, and things. I would'nt make a dowi,right lawyer o' the lad, I should be sorry lor himl to le araskill, but a sort o' engineer, or a surveyor, or an auctioneer and valyer, like Riley, or one o' them snar. s'd busineLes as are all profits and no outlay only fur a big chain, and a high stool. They're pretty nigh all one, and they're riot far off* beih' even wI' the law I believe, for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i' the face, as hard as one cat looks another. He's nonie frighted dt him. Mrs. Tulliver has not the same ambitious view s as hcr husband, for the boy. She thinks more of the commissariat part of the establishment, and has her doubts about ""{ the washing and mending a' iis clothes.""'' These indistinct doubts lead to tie suggestion on her part of all educational prGceedings being being restricted to the limits of the carrier's cart. Mrs. Tullwer is in excellent sort of person, but not uncomfortably troubled with intellect, or intellectual aspirations, but although her character, on the whole, is natural perhaps, she is at times nade very absurd, by having absurdities put into her mouth. And here we would, illustrating the remark by a specimen of the lady's conversation, notice one very great defect in this writer's dialogue. For the sake of effect, ishe makes her characters say things they never would ! sy--utter nonsense, in fact, which is meant to Pas for fun. Ihe following has nothing droll in ir, but is simply ridiculous. She says, after disCussing the interesting matter of airing sheets Well, Sir. Tulliver, I've put the sheets out for the best bed, and Kezia's got 'em hanging at the fire. Tbey are'nt the best sheets, I should repent buying em only they'll do to lay us out in. An' if you wa X die to Wlorrow -Mr. Tulliver, they're mangled beau- tif, an' aU ready,* as l a o'bO sit'ad b a pleasure to Iay 'eg out; an' the t te r ' the Mig oak eiwn chest, at thleabck ; ae as I hoald trust anybody to look 'em out but myifL Now all that is simply absurd. Pooeople dol't look on the solemnity of death with snob pti feelgs. It is silly. Facetious dialoge s not the forte of the writer. She makes Mrs. Tulliver a buffoon, and puts words into her mouth for the express purpose of being lahed at. The pupose is transparent. Other authors d e e t do the same. The poor people of 8ir Walter's novels are true to nature; they ar not mad as surd. The droll, is a very different style, only at. taimed perhaps, by Dickens or Anthony Trollope, now a-daYs. These are supremely droll in their lighter passages. When writers of an inferior calibre try to be droll, they become either noen.sical or vulgar. But in contradistinction to the above solfioqy on the sheets, we subjoin the following good description of the child Maggie: ""' You talk o' cuteness Mr. Tulliver,"" sbe obervedl as she sat down, 1""but I'm sure the child's half an idiot in some things, for if I send her uwtair to fetch anything, she forgets what she's gone for, a erhaps u'll sit down on the foor in the sunshine, an"" praft her hair, an' sing to herself like a Bedlam catbr' all the while I'm waiting for her downstairs."" Maggie is apparently a "" good for nought."" She hates dressing herself, and brshing her hair, and nenataess or tidiness of any kind; but bhc loves tihe country, at.d the eountry fowen.; and readiiig too, in quecr old books; Maggie is very fond of reading. And half her time she spends Wranlering along the bank-s of tbe mill-stream studying nattare, and the othcr half in an old attic, studyingr her books, to which we sball 'refer present lv, and also in another ocpation also for future consideration. Mrs. Tulliver is in despair about Maggie. She prophesies that she well never come to any good; but will meet with some unexpected disaster in the way of drowning, or other catastrophe. She tried to impress Maggie with a sense of her own unworthiress, and advccates patchwork as a fitting means of useful occupation. On one occasion, when Maggie has, as usual, been wvaiileiing on the banks of tbe mill-stream, and has returned in a h-opeless state of desbabille, her mother delivers the foliowing admonitory letum. "" 0 dear, 0 dear, Maggie,"" says Krs Tulliver, "" what are you thinking of to throw your botsnet down there? Take it upstairs, there's a good gal, an' let your hair be brushed, an' put your other pinafore on, an' go on with your patchwork like a lady."" Maggie's answer is philosophical: It's foolish work,"" sid Maggie with a to of ht r mane, "" tearing things to pieces to s*w 'em tgether again."" Then as to aggie's books; to whie we have referred. Her library appeared to be nther extensive nor well chosen, LDefoe's Histo of the Devil, being one of the collection, and a very great fah vorite, moreover. She had Banyan's Pilgrim's Progress, too; but she liked tk pictesbier than the lettepress of this latter work. As to the lettI r s, its chief recommendation seems to have been that ""tbere's a deal about the devil in it."" This uuamiable personage, and Maggie is a firm believer in his personality, is her favourite study. ""I'll shew you a picture of him,"" blie says to Mr. Riley, one of her father's friends. I'll show you the picture of him, in his true shape as he appeared to Christian-the body all black you know.-(Tom bad coloured it in' his holidays)-and the eyes red, like fire, because he's all fire inside, and it shines out at his eyes. The philosophy of this writer has been highly and deservedly eulogisedi; but she is not invariably correct. The following is untrue. She says: Plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivatice, in order to compass a selfish end are nowhere abundant, but in the world of the dramatist. That is the first mistake. The world teems with selfish and deliberate plotting. It may be of a very small and putty Lin:d, but there it is. Only wYben the plotting assumes a larger aspect, is it recognised. The craft of the monarch, who, by chicanery tries to annex a country to his crown, is akin to the cunning of the farmer, when lie seeks to hurt his iicighibour, and add a few fields to his farm. ILoIok through the whole gradations of societj. In every degree there is plotting, covetousness, and deliberate contrivance, and always, of ccurse, for a selfish motive. Enter into doniestic life, either high or low; there also, in a diFerent form, will the selfish policy be found. Neitlher is the authoress's context to this assertion correct. The reason on which she bases her argument, is, that : Plotting covetousnef, and deliberate contrivance, demand too intense a mental action for many of our fellow parishioners to be guilty of them. We don't agree to that. Cuinihig is the most contemptible of all trades, because it is the easiest. Then as to the dramatic villain being the only one, where this intense mental action is observable, we can but say, that the dramatic villain has always seemed a most transparent personage to us, growing out of Dothilnl, and perhaps relapsing into the szune element again. In the following p~assage, too, she is wroig. It is easy enough to Upoil the livesof our neighbours without taking so much trouble; we can do it by lazy acquivscence and lazy o:nission,, by trivial 1ilsities, fur which we hardly know a reason, by small frauds neu. trahistul by IWall extravagancits, by maladroit flatteries, and clumisily improvised insinu;ztio-s. That we dun't believe. Our neighbour's don't tiouble themselves enough about us to have tbeir lives ""'spoiled "" by these trifles. Tbere must be -ome tangible aiad poilive * rong donc and felt. People are not so .Sensitive as to be seriously hurt by lazy acquiescence, and lazy onmissioll. Thie fol. lowing account of the rebellious Mvegie is admi. rably drawn. 'The writer excells in- the delineation of children. Maggie has been annoyed by her ziothti's refusal to allow her to acconpanv leer father to the school for the purpose of brinog Tom borne. Mrs. Tulliver is trying to redue e to subjec;ion and cleanliness by the judicious &P plication of moral advice, and map and water Maggie proves refracturv M1aggie suddenly rushed from under her hanes, and dipped her head in a basin of water standing near, in the vindictive determination that there should be to more chance of curls that day. ""Maggie, Maggie,.. exclaimed Mrs. Tulliver, sitting stout and helpleas with the brushes on her lap, "" what is to become of you if you're so naughty ? I'll tell your Aunt Glegg and your Aunt Pullet when they come next week, and they'll never love you any more."" The eloquence of her mother however, makes uo impression on Maggie, who takes refuge iii fiiglt. Maggie was out of hearing, making her way toward, the great attic that ran under the old high Pitched roof, shaking the water froul under her black locks a, she ran like a skye-terrier escaped from his bath. This attic was Maggie's favourite retreat oil a wet day, wilh the weather was not too cold; here ishe fretted out all her ill-humnours, and talked aloud to the worm-eatrn floors, and the worm-eaten shelves, and the dark rafters festooned with cobwebs; and here sihe kept a Fetish which she punished for all her inisfortuneL This was the trunk of a large wooden doll, which once stared with the roundest of eyes, above the re(ldest of cheeks, but was now entirely defaced by a long caree of vicarious suffering. Three ziils driven into the head comminemorated as many crises in Maggie's idne years of earthly struggle, that luxury of vengeance having l'een suggested to her by the picture of Jatl destroying Sisera in the old Bible. The last nail bad been driven in with a fiercer stroke than usual, for the Fetish on that occasion represented Autit Glegg. But immediately afterwards Maggie had rejfected, that if she drove so many nails in, she wou!d not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt when she knocked it against the wall, nor to comfort 4t and make believe to poultice it, when her fury was abated. for even Aunt Glegg would be pitiable when she had been hurt very much, and thoroughly humiliated so as to beg her niece's pardon. Since thein she had driven no more nails in, but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating her wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys that made the square pillars supporting the roof. ''lTe character of MJaggic is beautifully drawn from beginning to end; although some of the in. cidents which are related of her are too abruptly told, and arc scarcely within the range of proba. bility ! her flight to the gipsies, for instance, an episode of neither point nor purpose, introduced fur no special reason, and containing no special I ser ice. This author does not excel as a mere stoir teller. The construction of her tale is not artistic; it is in the graphic pictures that the merit I of tle work consists. The following remarks, for instance, on an acute sorrow, are truthful and exchilctit: There is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies the first shocks of trouble, just as an acute pain is often a timnulus, and produces an excitenent which is transient strength. It is in the slow keen life that follows, in the time when sorrow has become stale, and has no longer an emotive intensity that counteracts its pain ; in the time when day follows day in dull unexpectant saneness, and trial is a dreary routine; it is then that despair threatens; it is then that the 1esrcmlhtorv himv r -of the soul is frit, and the eye ad ear are strtikiid Pifter some unlearned secret of our ;*~oce, which shall give to endurance the nature of ,stisfation. Agin, her remarks about needy People, are Agood: There is a chill air surrounding those who are down in te world, and people are glad to get away froin tem as from a cold room; human beings, inere men adwomen without furniture, without anything to offer ye, wbo have ceased to count as anybody, present an bangsiog negation of reasons for wishing to see them, or of subjects on which to converse with them."" That is unfortunately proved to be the truth by the evpcrience of misfortune. The following is admirable. It refers to a strong nud assailingt temptation, and the ileed of resistil., it. We read:I it is the moment when our rosolution seems about to beconie irrevocable, when the fatal iron gates are about a to elose Ij)otn u1S, that tests our strength. Then, after hour; of lear reasonin, and firm conviction, we snatch at any sophiitry that will nullify our long struggles, jand W1r19 US the defeat that we love better than vie'lnx ahivc are fair speciinens of the s ylc of tie bot;. As we have said before, we don't care Ha) much !or the mere construction of the story ; its princj'al iaterest lies in its nmany deep and beautifally expressed thoughts.OUR LIBRARY TABLE. TE OMILL ot1 ON_ TFLOFis.- -Every critic Ioti a IV Ib v', -1 ""- - ln aKO who takes upon himself the modest tasK O[ praising this book will feel inclined to begin by comparing it with"" Adam ofede."" When an author has made a stand'rd of excellenc for himself, everything: that be writes subsequently is naturally referred to that standard, even' though he may bave laboured to open fresh ground, and to develope a talent entirely news "" The Mill on the Floss,"" however, tog distinct enough in its characters and its story from the preceding novel is yet so lik it general tone of thouglt, and in the picturs life which it represents' that cornasw a fair tureen the two books becomes in this means of criticism. In ""The Mill on the Floss,"" then, we have a more complex book than "" Adam Bede."" There are many more personages, each of them individualized without exaggeration; there are cross-purposes and conflicting motives and passions to a far greater degree than in the other simple drama; the time through which the chronicles extend is longer; the chief actors are presented to us, not fully formed, but as children, whose temperaments we are to see modified by circumstances, whose characters wve are to see gradually unfolded and perfected. Much more artistic labour has been bestowed on this book than on ""Adam Bede."" The working-out of Maggie, from the child hungty for love to the woman who triumphs in her selfrenunciation at the most difficult moment, was, surely, a greater mental toil than the conception of lietty. with her immobile animal nature, and her unchangeable selfishlness. '[he four Dodsonsisters, each distinct, all unmistakably of the 1)odson family, were, surely, not so easily conceived and sustained as the one Mrs. Poyser. We tind snore artistic labouir here, and unfailing success; but, on the other hand, we feel that, with all this greater comparative cleverness, the hook does not enthral us as "" Adam Bede"" (lid. ''he seal of omnipotent genius, though present. and to l)e found 1))y those who seek for it, does not manifest itself to readers of all kinds and classes so readily, compelling instant acknowledgment and homage. Maggie, notwithstandirig her life-like development from child to womnau, and the varying lights of passion and of \\'ill under which she is exhibited to us, never gains that objective existence which letty possessed-never quite frees herself from the leading-strings which George Eliot holds in his plastic hand. Not one of the D)odson-sisters, however distinct they be from each other, attains to the tangible humanity of Mrs. Po)yser. * * T'I'e book resolves itself into the history of a brother and sister-Tom and Maggie Tulliver.t The scenes between the two children at I)orl-I cote Mill, the quarrels over jam puffs and reconciliations over plum-cake, the domineerings of 'i'on, and the submissive but exigent love of Maggie, will come home to the heart of everyone who can remember having once been a child, with a child-brother or sister. rrhe dispositions of the two children are very different. Tom is mnatter-of-fact, full of common-sense anld quliet determination. He has a strong and clear apprehension of justice; but the ""to dicnion"" with him, as with so many people, is simply what he sees to be just and right as regar(ls the conduct of others. lie constitutes himself the judge, and suffers tio appeal against his judgment. Conscious of his own strong w'ill and rectitude of purpose, he has no suspicion that he is incapable of fathoming the tendencies and motives of others, and of weighing their actions in impartial scales. He takes his place as judge by right; he never doubts his prerogative; he never site in judgment on himself, or balances the short-comings of others against short-comings of his own. Within the narrow range of his circle of sight he sees very acutely and distinctly, and performs the duties which lie manifestly therein with a power and virtue that cannot be surpassed; but he brings all with whom he has to! deal within these narrow limits, and arraigns them there, being unable to conceive of any regions beyond. Maggie, on the contrary, has the wide vision which finds itself bounded only by those clouds of mystery that hang about the horizon of this mortal life. She is always reaching out towards that far distance for something better and greater and more true than she can grasp in the actualities immediately around her. She craves, with an unsatisfied hunger, for appreciation, for admiration, for love; she searches vainly in the hearts of her kindred for exquisite sympathies which have no place there; she feels herself imprisoned and fettered by the sordid circumstances which encompass her, ann longs for unattainable delights of beautiful sounds and sights and thoughts. She has none of ''om's clear, logical perception of near things. In her interpretation of them she is alnost always wrong; she is al. most alwvays doing Rvhat she should not, and discovering her error when it is too late, and repenting with bitterest imagining. of what might have been and what will be. She is dreaming when she should be acting. She forgets to feed Tom's rabbits, and lets them starve to death; while, for every insect that she neets she invents some story investing it with human feelings and attributes. Facts are less real to her than her own fancies. A quaint picture or a fragment of a book, such as the examples in the Latin grammar, suggests more to her than the everyday sights and incidents of common existence. '[he misfortunes of the family which introduce ''om to that life of strenuous exertion for which lie is especially fitted by nature, sadden the position of poor Maggie yet more. Her hopes, her intense longings for ap preciation and for outward enjoyments congruous with her keen sense of beauty, die away. After much miserable wrestling with her fate, she arrives at that stage of self-renunciation where starved natures so often find a refuge. 'T'hen Philip Wakem re-appears upon the scene, and Maggie is roused from her torpor to enjoy some months of happiness, ending in worse misery. Poor Maggie is never in conformity with the circumstances in which she is placed. T'hat which should be the long-wished-for blesssing always turns out the direst curse. She has not that happy limitation of perception that Tom has, and is continually directing her conduct according to the feelings and the will of others. Her father and brother hate Philip Wakem, and Philip Wakem loves her; while (still further complexity!) she does not love Philip Wakem. Then, again, in the case of Stephen Guest, the conflicting interests are yet more irreconcilable. Her fate is always at war with Maggie Tulliver. Out of her trials and weaknesses, however, she gathers a majesty of strength, in comparison with which Tom's sober rectitude sinks into insignificance. Her sense of justice unfolds itself into the very opposite of that which rules her brother, seeking its sanctions, not in herself, but in those' for whom she has to renounce herself. * * e * In the contrast of the characters of this brother and sister consists the main idea of the book. That both are admirably conceived and consummated no one will deny. Tom is the more artistic creation, though he is much less interesting than Maggie. In any other hands but in those of George Eliot, Tom would have be come a cruel, selfish monster, or a man of highest wisdom. No author is so impartial as George Eliot. He plants the failings and the virtues of his characters with equal freedom from prejudice, with equal tenderness. He never contrasts the good qualities of a person with the bad for the purpose of antithetical etlect, but makes good and bad run into each other and intermix, as a water-colour artist blends his colours on the paper. There are no rigid outlines in nature, no harsh, crude oppositions of light and dark, or of primaries and their complemnentaries, but infinite gradations of shade and harmonies of colour. This, George Eliot sees in its full significance. He never forgets that vices are but virtues in excess or defect; and that the extremes, while they are negations of each other, are nevertheless connected by an indivisible bond. He never forgets that practically these absolute extremes are to be found nowhere in human nature, any more than the absolute mean, of which if we were capable we should cease to be men and should become divine. * * * This Tom Tulliver is e to use a bad word) the most objective character in the "" Mill on the Floss,"" thus coming iato comparison with the Hetty of ""Adam Bede."" 'The hard narrowness of Torn is as foreign to the temperament of the author ab Hetty's animalism. If we begin to surmise how such characters are conceived, we find the process to be one of denudation. I'he creator of [Jetty has to throw aside the inoral and intellectual parts of his nature; the creator of Tom has to limit his sympathies within a prescribed circle of narrowest radius. This denudation is a very different matter to that imaginative process which ordinary novelists use when they raise their personages from wonted middle-class life to the peerage, or push back their Smiths and Joneses of to-day into the middle-ages. The danger in drawing such I characters as 'rom and Hetty is always lest thel denudation should be carried too far. Hettys might easily have become wholly ppetitive, AD`( I thus have lost her humanity: Tom might easily have become a monster, having no sympathies t whatever. * * * * In Magie it seems to I us that we can trace a strong resemblance to I the Janet of ""Janet's Repentance."" If we a were sure that George Eliot's characters bad f their germ in reality (as we firmly be- I lieve all of them to have, more or less), i we should at once pronounce thatthe same 8i person sat for the portrait of both heroilues. e Mqaggie is exhibited under circumences very T different to those which surround Janet, ma and the tempeftnents of the two are distinct fi enough; but the likeness is, to our eyes, striking. If there be some unconscious person whom George Eliot has taken as the first idea of Janet or Maggie, probably her environmentsc are very different from thos e of eiter. Still, the resemblance between certan scRepe of nthe CI Mill on the Floss,"" and ofe "" wankt'srepenthne"" Cin is close. As the two womewn wal thr oughO theli scornful, finger pOIntinl the ~~30~ng clrgyliai, we see in them one is, the consoihng Cho l- Eliot's pitying eyes dr have rested in those vry streets. M 'm The original talent for apposite metaphor which le was displayed so forcibly in Mrs. Poyser, we an fnd again in this book, though not as the *l specialty of any character. The descriptions of :h the ""emmet-like"" life of the Dodson sisters, lt their husbands, and their friends, are of the io same kind as those in ""Adam Bede,"" the fresh o- raciness of which took admiration by storm. ad But this I)odson race has its own peculiarities, is which are defined with an inimitable cleverness. (e The shrewdness and stinginess and pretension, r- the conceit of blood, the belief in family maxims, e- the notions of what constitutes respectability, re the cruel hardness, the feeling of clanship-these r- and other points are set before us with a r- masterly precision. In the chapter headed ro A Variation of Protestantism Unknown to re Bossuet,"" we have an analysis of the moral and 7e religious condition of this class of people, d which we would gladly quote, did space permit. !r The distinction between the Dodsons and .- Tullivere-the ""richer blood"" of the latter, g their germs of ""generous imprudence, warm n affection, and hot-tempered rashness"" as coma pared with the selfish, shrewd egotism of the r Dodson character-is drawn with the nicest - discrimination. ' * * * In the third e volume the style of society changes. We mount higher in the social scale, and get among people e better educated, and no less original. Mr. e Stephen Guest is an average young man, having i stronger passions, perhaps, than most young men would care to own to. But then he is provincial. In him, as in the Arthur of "" Adam M Bede,"" we may detect (now that we flatter ourlselves that we know the secret of the author. ship) signs of the writer's sex. The love scenes between him and Maggie are written with a pas. sionate truth that well exhibits the other phase of George Eliot's power, and contrasts marvellously with the Dutch painting of the Dodson class. Great care is taken to keep Stephen Guest out of the category of villanous tempters and seducers. He is lamentably weak, but not wicked aforethought. The crisis of his running away with Maggie arises from accidental farourablenes of circumstances, not from design on his part or agreement on here. There are no villains in these books of George lFliot's. We find in them no unpardonable sinners whom poetic justice dooms to an ill ending. * * * * The last scene, in which Tom and Maggie, after long estrangement, meet upon the swollen river, and die together, fidy gives a sad ending to this sad story. _ J. A.The Mill on the Floss. By George Eliot. 3 vols. (Blackwood & Sons.) ' The Mill on thc Floss' will not, we think, obtain tne same acceptance as 'Adam Bede.' It is not that there are traces of exhaustion, but the present work bears tokens of haste; it lacks the fullness of a work written in calm leisure. The echo of the old success has not had time to subside, and the authoress seems to have been haunted by a spirit of emulation with her own shadow,?the ever-present obligation of being equal to herself. There is a pervading sense of hurried unrest and of ambitious striving to write, not out of the heart, but with a desire to reproduce the effect of Mrs. Poyser's sententious sayings and Lisbeth Bede's querulous maunderings. The characters of the four sisters, who had all been "" Dobsons,"" and had a "" way in their family,"" are cleverly drawn, but they verge on caricature, and there is a great deal too much about them. They are like favourite actors presuming on old favour to make their jokes and by-play too prominent. The authoress shows skill in the way in which lier characters are made to reveal themselves by their own words and acts without any formal description beyond a few decisive and masterly touches. There is power to unravel the contradictions of human feeling and insight into the tangled complications of human relationships and eloquence to utter what the heart has been subtle to conceive ; but with all this, and in spite of occasional vigorous scenes and delineations, the sense of haste and unrest gives a coldness and crudeness which make the work like fine fruit plucked before it is ripe. The heroine, Maggie, is the best drawn character in the book; it is subtly conceived, and it is original, worked out by the authoress with a skilful and loving hand. Tom Trulliver, her brother, is an excel lent companion picture, and thc two natures are well contrasted. Maggie is, however, tho most elaborately worked out. Her imaginative, passionate nature, with its desires to do right, and its touching failures,?the resolute heart, the imperfect judgment, ? tho treacherous, sliding, imaginative affections,?the battle of life, begun and carried on in thc vain trust in her own unassisted strength,?the weariness with the ""greatness of the way"" which overwhelms her, and her utter weakness against the illicit affection that creeps into her heart, making her guilty of the cruellest wrong and treachery to her dearest friend,?the misery brought on all connected with her,?the feeble but constant struggle of her better natuic against the magnetic insidious influence of passion,?the final blind, desperate effort with which she breaks away and returns broken iu heart, tarnished in good fame, with the certainty of having made tho irrevocable misery of all she loved best,?with her own misery greater than she could bear, and a desolate life before,?nothing saved from the wreck of her young life except the consciousness that she broke loose from her temptation, and at the eleventh hour escaped back into the right way; ?this is all worked out with a power and pathos that is very beautiful. The love described is not of a nigh nature. Stephen Guest, whom she attracts from her cousin, is a commonplace handsome young man ; he yields to the attraction of a remarkable-looking young woman with scarcely a struggle. The reader is bidden to accept it as a case of elective affinity ; it is mere personal attraction, a passionate inclination, which swallows up honour, duty, humanity, ties of kindred and friendship; it is the essence of selfishness, but the struggle is not the less fierce in Maggie because it is ignoble, nor is the temptation less because rt is base, ? and whatever the reader's indignation may be, or his'sympathy with Lucy, the sweet, generous, forsaken maiden, or with Phillip, the betrothed husband and devoted friend of Maggie, the whole episode is so skilfully wrought that all his other feelings will be merged ?In tho milder grief of pity. The history of Mr. Trulliver, and his sorrows and difficulties, have an interest of their own, and Mrs. Trulliver, his wife, is another version of Mrs. Nitkleby. We have abstained from giving any outline of the story of 'The Mill on the Floss,' because we did not wish to forestall the reader's interest, and a mere outline would hardly give a fair notion of it. If wc seem severe in our judgment, it is because we judge tho authoress by the standard of her own capability. We do not consider ' The Mill on the Floss'equal to 'Adam Bede.' The authoress has not given herself fair play. There is the old freedom of hand, but tho workmanship is neither so delicate nor so elaborate as in the'Clerical Scenes' and 'Adam Bede';?neither is the story, as a story, at all comparable to 'Adam Bede' for interest, or for artistic treatment."
69,B5641,['6691507'],"The Land of Pearl and Gold. By Alexander Macdonald, F.R.G.S. (Blackie and Son, Ltd., ios. 6d. net.) This is a very attractive collection of breezy tales of prospecting, mining, and travel in and on the coasts of Australia, in New Guinea, and other islands. Pearl is given precedence of gold in the title, but in the text there is only one tale of pearl fishing, and that is nearly at the end. But a pearl is the lady of all gems, and so the title is in the best of taste. Place aux dames! Mr. Macdonald tells these sixteen tales in the first person, and there is not one that is dull. He delineates his characters with force and sympathy, and we quickly make friends with many of them. "" Mac,"" the huge Scotchman, is his constant henchman, as loyal as he is self-assertive, as tender-hearted as he is fierce. Morris, the gentlemanminer and "" new chum,"" whose nerves are so unstrung when his mate, "" the Shadow,"" lights a detonating-fuse in a shaft that he jumps for the rope by which he and Shadow are to be hauled into safety, and so pulls down the windlass-barrel. But, having seemingly doomed himself and comrade to destruction, his nerve is good enough again, and he digs below the burning fuse and cuts off its connection with the charge (see ""The Golden Promise Mine ""). "" The Warden "" is a resident magistrate who holds the wildest valley of New Guinea in the hollow of his hand, being feared by cannibal natives and worshipped by pioneer miners to the extent that their first preoccupation was to avoid any action which might involve him with his seniors?happily a no uncommon type among those in whose hands lies the honour of the Empire at its outposts (see "" Men of the Yodda Valley""); and there are many others whom the reader will not forget. Though many fortunes are made in the gold and other mining fields, too seldom, alas ! does the pioneer or bona fide miner slam the cream. He has many dangers and difficulties to overcome?physical, dangers of fatigue, fever, and thirst. The enmity of the aboriginals, the wile of the mining Chinee, these produce a stirring tale in "" White, Black, and Yellow,"" when threatening black men, preparing a great corroboree are attracted to the camp of no less hostile Chinamen, and one enemy disperses the other. But the canteen-keeper and the sharper are almost the worst enemies of all, and the tactics by which a good find must sometimes be secured to the pioneer is humorously told in "" How we Held Mackay's Find."" ""On a Colonial Coaster,"" which tells of of a voyage round Australia, sounds a little improbably rough and haphazard ; but "" A Sugar Expert"" deserves notice. A mining engineer is pressed into visiting the sugarplantations of the Bardekin Delta, and spends a bewildering two days amid hospitality and culture, resource and cultivation. He finds sugar and sago, pineapple and vineyards, all thriving, and a planter who invents anything from a shower-bath to a flying-machine, and whose steam sugarcutter is to solve the great difficulty of labour; for the Kanaka is no longer to be admitted, and white labour unions are fast making planting a losing game. A blank cheque is offered the miner for a report as a "" sugar expert,"" which is never filled in. Mr. Macdonald describes scenery with an artist's pen, and he is nowhere happier than in "" The Pearling Grounds,"" when he donned the diver's dress and went down to a coral reef: I stood in the midst of a magnificent marine forest, where graceful coral branches intertwined with less material tendril growth. The fronds of the coral palms trembled as if in a gentle, breeze, and the more robust growths swayed slowly to and fro."" And so we will leave Mr. Macdonald, but well above water. "" The Land of Pearl and Gold "" will be always a welcome companion to those who like to read of men doing man's work in the wilds."
70,B4333,['2464013'],"Memoir of Nathaniel Hawthorne; with Stories Uow first publisled in this country. By H. A. PAGE. London: IH. S. King. ""I xom of Nathaniel Hawthorne"" is hardly the right title to stand conspicuously at the head of this volume. Of the whole volume, the latter part, containin- thd stories, is the more important; of the former part, criticism is a more important-at least a more bulky-ingredient than biography. I do not mean to say that Mr. Page's criticism is bulk and no better. On the contrary, it is the criticism of a good intelligence, and of an intelligence improved for this purpose by what is evidently a warm natural sympathy with the object to which it applies itself. I think Mr. Page's style might be mended; but he has many sentences which define acutely the genius of the master whom he celebrates. And he is probably right in thinking that there is more of an inner biography to be got out of an attentive and sympathetic study of Hawthorne's writings, taken especially in reference to the circumstances and genesis of each, than out of any other materials we are likely to get. Why, then, say "" Memoir?"" since it was Hawthorne's expressed wish that no formal memoir of him should be written, and since, if the matter that is usually implied by that word, Mr. Page has little mora to add to what has been mentioned in the sketch of Mr. Fields, and those portions of the "" Note-Books "" to which it has been thought fit to give publicity ? Why not rather say "" Study ?"" That, I think, would be the truer title. There is a good deal, then, in Mr. Page's preliminary study to give us a closer view of this reserved spectator of society, a better understanding of his ganius as one in which a logapy of weird traditions out of the past-that, together with an imagination naturally prone to weird and mystical constructions of nature and man-wero united with a firstrate power of positive penetration and practical insight into his fellow creatures. The positive penetratin and practical insight are employed in the services of the mystifying imagination, and by them its constructions acquire a strange reasonableness, a reality facing towards both worlds. By long brooding and meditating a mystical conception, in the light of a psychological science that has its roots in real observation, a bridge is built between the world of magic and the supenal -nay, the world of allegory and abstraction itself-and the world of sense and touch. It is upon this bridge that the creations of Hawthorne's genius dance with those gestures, and that reality in strangens which so haunt and impress the imagnation. Besmdes seizing clearly on this particular point, the present essayist is inten throughout in his observations on Hawthorne's ways of work, and the action and reaction of his genius and its successive roundings. Of the stones collected from Iagazies, and brought together for the first time for English readers in the other part of the volume, ' Mother Rigby's Pipe ' is an ehtertaining instance of the writer's witchwife vein in story-telling, applied to a purpose of rather sweeping sarcasm against his kind; 'A Virtuoso's Collection' isa capital piece of ingenious historical inventory, showing an extreme readiness in marshalling the resources of knowledge and memory on a bauney parade; the Canal Boat is quito in Hawthorne's finest vein of character and landscape description: they aL!I it is needless to say' bespeak one of the masters who in his English, has sce;: d cllasical with the most case, who has had his thought or image the most c'e:erly lIefore him for as mystical as it might be, and found with the least uncertainty the word to fit it with the most precision and grace."
71,B6910,['4693237'],"MONTHLY REVIEW OF LITERATURE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN. Gaston de Blndeille, or the Court of Mharu III. keeping festival in Ardxen, a Rolwe, by Mrs. RaddiffA 1826. -In the memoir of Mrs. Radcliffe prefixed to the present volumes, there is so comprehensive and, altogether, so judicious a panegyric upon her peculiar genius, that nothing remains for subsequent eulogy. ITe breathing generation of men and women have rendered to her romances the homage of their deep and ineffacable interests, and our expectations turned with an almost childish longing towards this, her farewell effort, anticipating, as we did, a re-awakening of those ancient and hallowed feelings which waited upon St. Aubin and Emily, and Provence and Languedoc, and the Apennines, and the midnight airs of, as was insinuated;' departed spirits. Alas, alas! Gaston de Blondeville is but the sad application of dimmed and fallen faculties to a decidedly lower attempt than even her earliest powers would have stooped to. The writer of the memoir lauds her boldness in bringing forward, as she does, a realghost, upon the presumption that small and shadowy causes, under her hands, having produced such exquisite effects, the accumulation and realization of extraordinary agencies must of necessity elicit a resuit proportionably magnificent, or more. But this opinion every reader of Gaston de Blondeiille must feel to be erroneous ill fact, and we are quite sure it is equally so in theory. The effect of any kind of writing depends both upon the quality of the actual specimen compared with other specimens in the same department of literature, and al80 on i the aptitude of readers for excitation in that particular department. Now, we know i that this aptitude varies in great degrees i from time to time with regard to all emo- i tions which are of a secondary or associated i nature. The primary ones, themselves- i love, hate, ambition, jealousy, avarice, have f their entrances and exits in-the breast; but - C these ruling emotions of the soul occupy so I large a space in the basis of all characters, c that they are usually and readily excitable Ad again under situations apparently the most t disadvantageous to their production; and a after even the fullest development, require li but a very brief suspension to recruit their d forces. But with the lesser and secondary t and artificial tastes, those associations which ti are no more than the re-action of some Si individual's peculiar constitution and talents t] Upon the taste of the age, when these have 1( Swayed the public mind for a while, and v run their epidemic couse, are felt no more a! for a long, a very long period, like measles Ii and small-pox, &c. _w.:-those who have once fallen under their contagion are no b longer obnoxious, certainly not in thi same hi degree, to the same influence.

How, then, will they suffer the present monsters? a ghost on horseback, amidst and close to myriads of beholders of all sizes, and ages, and sexes; now here, now there, eluding mortal grasp, and deluding mortal eye; nobles, knights, ladies, servants, monks, priests, sentinels, beset in all their paths by the importunate infernal, who solicits, as plain as gesture and unwearied perseverance can speak, their aid in bringing a murderer to justice. These worthy persons, however, one and all, are far more afraid of the secular than the spiritual arm, and not one of them has virtue or nerve to boldly help the demon in his persecution of a royal favourite. The old plea of- magic was urged against the genuineness of the ghost, and that plea alone was of weight sufficient to discredit the otherwise damning proofs of guilt afforded by the spectre. Here was a dilemma for the authoress, and she found no escpe-for, like the Egyptians of old, whatever ghost did was supposed imitable by man; but the end must come, sooner or later, and the accused lord's sudden death, and subsequent re-appearance and confession of the crime to his royal master, bring the long-resisting mind of the king to conviction, who believes, at last, with about as much reason as he had before disbe. lieved. It is needless to sketch the story. Every body has either read it, or, from the shakng head of some friend who has read it, no longer haa the wish. Descrptiow of ps- geantries occupy nearly the whole; no plot, no entanglement, no love. The question, is Sir Gaston (le Blondeville guilty of the murder or not?-it's an old murder-is the sole point, to which all is made subservient; and the reader's sympathy, coitrary to that custom which carries our hopes and fears along with the persecuted individual, goes in the present case with the persecuting ghost all the way, from frst to last, until be has fairly hunted downI his game. A glimpse-a casual flash of her olden power of description, comes here and there across the heavy monotony; the different aspects of Warwick Castle, by the setting sun, by moonlight, breathe of Mrs. Rad* cliffe again. Yet, on the whole, we gaze with unfeigned sadness upon this moinument of mental decline. All her own peculiar witchery is put to shame when the real sDrite ampeareth."
72,B3513,['8534275'],"THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE. The Return of tlie Native. By Thomas Hardy. Smith, Elder and Co. There are many indolent readers who, when they open a novel, like to plunge into a lively conversation or an exciting scene at once, and lav down the book impatiently if their interest is not aroused on thc very first page. To these Mr. Hardy's book will appear dull, because they will not read far enough to be interested. But persons of a more patient disposition will be well rewarded for thc task, which, we are compelled to admit, is not quite an easy one, of mastering the long descriptions of the groud, ""bonthy, furzy, briary, obsolete country,"" in which the scenes of this story are laid. Wc J warn intending readers not to be alarmed at the verbose eccentricity which distinguishes its opening chapters, nor to be repelled by the uncouth language, often closely verging on coarseness, in which the conversation of the natives of Egdon Heath is carried on. The obvious imitations of Victor Hugo are confined to the opening chapters, or, at any rate, reappear only at rare intervals throughout the work, while the intimate acquaintance with, and real affection for, the suiToundings of his tale displayed by the author almost reconcile one to the repeated and prolonged emphasis with which he dwells on them. The book is not crowded with characters, as is too often the case in modern novels. Only three women, Mrs. Yeobright, her niece Thomasin, and Eustacia Wye, and three men, Wildeve, young Yeobright, and the Reddleman, have anything to do with the development of the drama. Of course there are other characters, but, although some, like Christian's, are fresh, well drawn, and very amusing, they play no part whatever, and only serve to fill up the background. The result of the skilful handling of these few persons is a concentration of interest, steadily increasing tc-' wards the middle of the third volume, after which, unfortunately, the sudden and unexpected removal of the two most interesting, because most inexplicable actors, leaves the stage blank and bare. It is not usual for authors to kill off half their dramatis personce long before the book ends. But from Mr. Hardy we cannot expect anything usual; on the contrary, the originality and freshness of the work is such that these very qualities at first prevent our perceiving its full strength. When, after eleven months in London, we first reach a remote Alpine valley surrounded by weird rocks and cold glaciers, the strangeness of our surroundings will, for a few hours, not allow us to enjoy their full beauty. So it is with the "" Return of the Native."" There is no heroine in it, and nobody at all like anybody of whom we have read before. Nor is there, as far as we can make out, any hero. One wedding takes place in the first volume, another in the second, and a third at the end of the book; but the first two are not at all satisfactory, and .we suspect that no one will care much about the third. The Reddleman, who acts throughout as the deus ex machind is, apart from his redness, which is inseparable from his business of selling dye, the only character whom we think we have met before under the garb of a supernaturally intelligent amateur detective. We do not propose spoiling the pleasure which attaches to the unknown and unexpected by betraying the plot, but it may fairly be objected to the slender framework of the tale that, if its conclusion had been pleasanter, it would have lost none of its interest, and would have been a great deal more satisfactory. It appears to us that Mr. Hardy had gradually become tired of working out the singular characters of Eustacia and Wildeve, and, not seeing how to get them out of the inevitable mess into which no unnatural events but their own innate weakness brought them, had killed them off to get rid of the difficulty. Such an expedient, if expedient it be, is unworthy of the author, and we are convinced that a little more patieuce would have been well bestowed on the third volume. Again, Clyni hardly betrays his tendencies with sufficient explicitness to permit us to feel that the course of life he at last adopts is quite natural; notwithstanding our sympathy both with him and with his lofty aim, we feel that he was made for something greater, if not better. And the interest the author arouses for Thomasin is, we believe, much milder than he expected; for it is evidently his wish that we should be satisfied with the quiet happiness she obtains, while in reality we are perfectly indifferent to it. Eustacia is so obviously Mr Hardy's favourite that she becomes ours also. We are therefore disgusted with her misery in the second half of the novel and disappointed with her sad end. Notwithstanding these imperfections, which are perhaps not faults, but only idiosyncrasies of the author, the book is one which deserves a better fate than merely to be skimmed and then thrown aside. Not only is it far, very far, above the ordinary three volume novel, but (and this is much higher praise) many parts of it will bear reading a second time, and will then be better appreciated than at the first hasty perusal. The ""Return of the Native"" makes us expect very great things from Mr. Hardy if he will only work slowly and patiently."
73,B2163,['8448312'],"THE LITERARY EXAMINER. A Tale of Two Cities. By Charles Dickens. With II- lustrations by H. K. Browne. Chapman and Hall. This novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the author's genius are employed upon the conduct of the story. In this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand, and is not excelled by any English work of fiction. The subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of tbe great French Revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect. If the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke, he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury. But in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes, while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation, he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household. The story is all in all, yet there is nothing sacrificed to it. It is as truly the Tale of Two Cities as it is tbe touching history of Doctor Manette and Lucie his daughter. The pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for tbe distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction. Except Mr Stryver, who is necessary to the full expression of the character of Sydney Carton, and the slightly sketched family of Jerry Cruncher by the help of which Jerry himself is cunningly defined, there is not a person in tbe book who is not an essential portion of the story, there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward, not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book. Mr Dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius, that penetrates with a quick instinct through tbe outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth. Even when he has succeeded least, the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt. In this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view. There are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting, deep as is the interest awakened by the Tale of Two Cities. In most of Mr Dickens's works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won. Here we especially admire the energy of genius, the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose, the abiding force of the impression that is made. The skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of Doctor j Manette during the life following his release from a long ? burial rn tbe Bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate. The detail is original in its conception, yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth. We may recal as one example of the manner of tbe book, the art with which tbe echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in Doctor Manette's j quiet street corner, near Soho square. A little group sits unI der tbe plane tree in the garden, on a sultry summer afternoon. . Darnay, the future husband of Lucie, the inheritor, as it j will appear, of tbe curse upon those by whom the Doctor ! had been buried alive, has by chance struck heavily upon ! the hidden chord that yields the key-note of the story. The I Doctor starts, but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof, and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling. The 'slow coming of the storm, the hurrying of the echoes, the I bursting of the tempest, blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest tbe greater storm of wbich tbe first drops , had then fallen. This is artifice, but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet, and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line, the force of poetry is added to the book. We are inevitably strengthened by a work Hke this, in the conviction that Mr Dickens's place hereafter in our literature will be in the first rank of the poets who have not expressed themselves in verse. What intensity of life and truth is in tbe picture of the dawn of revolution contained in the story of the Marquis's journey to his country seat before his assassination. Saint Antoine and its wretchedness have been described. Red wiue bas been spilt at a wine-shop door, and gathered from tbe mud by a gaunt wolfish people, with their human sympathies among themselves, but grim and ominous with the red stains upon their hands and mouths, when they are first shown to us. We have seen the silken courtiers, to whom these people are as dogs, bound by no ties of love among themselves. The Marquis bas left tbe reception room of Monseigneur, devoting him to the devil. He has run over a wretched man's child, and offers gold for its loss, as if it had been but a whelp. Swinging by tbe chain under his travelling carriage, goes one, as a passer-by afterwards said, "" whiter than the miller, all covered with dust, white as a "" spectre, tall as a spectre,"" who, at the hill-top before the village, leaves him to plunge down the steep side. The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped ia crimson. "" It will die out,"" said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, ""directly."" In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off. But there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village at the bottom of tbe hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a churchtower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects, as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near home. The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at tbe fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed. Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women, their choice on earth was slated in the prospect?Life on the lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag. Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions' whips, which twined snake-like about their head* in the evening air. as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him. He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years. This is bis last converse with the outer world: The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they might not have been so fortunate. The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise ""beyond, was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill. Gradually it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the Furies, quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips ; the valet walked by the horses; the courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dim distance. At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground, with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied the figure from the life?bis own life, maybe?for it was dreadfolly spare and thin. To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage. "" It is you, Monseigneur ! Monseigneur, a petition."" With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face, Monseigneur looked out "" How, then! What is it ? Always petitions!"" "" Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester."" "" What of your husband, the forester ? Always the same with you people. He cannot pay something ?"" *' He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead."" "" Well! He is quiet Can I restore him to you ?' "" Alas no, Monseigneur ! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor grass."" ""Well?"" "" Monseigneur, there arc so many little heaps of poor grass?"" ""Again, well?"" She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door ?tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch. "" Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want"" ""Again, wen? Can I feed themT u Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband* name, may \ be placed over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will | be quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of tbe | same malady, I shall be laid undw some other heap of poor grass. I Monseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much , want Monseigneur! Monseigneur!"" j The valet had put ber away from the door, the carriage had broken n into a brUk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left fg far behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly ^ diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau. i * Distinctly present to the taney of the writer must have 11 g ly | been that scene of the taking of the Bastille which is here is j made present to the dullest wit by a few powerful touches. of which every one belongs aa closely to tbe story of Doctor Manette as to tbe history of France. Here, again, is a little picture of Saint Antoine after it had been out all day, and, among other work, had wreaked its vengeance upon "" Foulon, who told the starving people 44 they might eat grass."" Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children, wailing and broadleas. Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in common, afterwards supping at their doors. Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of most other sance to wretched bread. ^ Yet, human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children; and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and hoped. It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its | last knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in husky tones, while fastening the door: "" At last it is come, my dear f ""Eh well!"" returned madame. "" Almost!"" How admirable is the picture of the rise of power io the Doctor, when the day comes that makes the great horror of his life a means of blessing to his child, by giving him influence as a Bastille prisoner, over the storm that threatens shipwreck of her dearest hopes. He relapses when a second wave, against which all bis skill is powerless, breaks over her head, aud the knot is at last solved by Sydney Cartou. The exquisite poetry of the touches, which detail to us j the manner of his sacrifice, with the honour and trust ?[ of an innocent girl to strengthen him in his last moment, is worthy to be the close of a tale nobly sustained to the latest word. A few touches here and there may be in excess ; we are hardly content, for example, that it should occur to Miss Pros?, at a critical moment, to compare Madame Defarge *s eyes to bed winches ; but these faults, natural to au active fancy, are very few and very slight in the work now before us. lt is written throughout with an energy that never wanders from its aim, a strength that uses with the subtlety of genius the resources of a studied art."
74,B6862,"['6721267', '8736364']","LITERATURE. More Leaves from the Journal of a Life in the Highlands, from 1862 to 1882. (Smith, Elder, & Co.) It is impossible to regard this book otherwise than with feelings of respect, and that not merely on its author's account, but because it is exactly what it professes to be. The twenty years with which the Journal has to do was indeed an eventful period. It was marked by such important incidents as thc Franco-German and Russo-Turkish ""Wars, not to mention the many minor campaigns in which our own armies were engaged, and the grave political complications which from time to time presented themselves. But with these matters the Journal is altogether unconcerned. It deals solely with the Queen's life in the Highlands; and, though it is quite natural that her Majesty's subjects should wish to know what were the Queen's thoughts and feelings about things and people outside the narrow limits thus laid down, we certainly cannot find fault with the almost absolute reticence which is preserved throughout the volume upon all questions of national importance. Such silence seems to us to bc as discreet as it is rare; and, as there is nothing in the title of the book which is calculated to mislead, we are unable to justify a disappointment in which we do not share. Having said so much, we shall bc understood when we add that the most remarkable thing about the book is that there is nothing very remarkable in it. It records no thrilling adventures. A carriage accident, an arrival without bag or baggage, a near chance of being benighted upon the mountain side?these are almost the only "" situations"" which the Journal offers to its readers. The interest of the book is, if we may use a much-abused phrase, subjective rather than objective. ""We look through it at the writer, and are brought face to face with her. As a rule, diaries which record anything more than bare facts betray tho self-consciousness of their authors, and make us feel that we are only so far taken into confidence as may bo necessary to produce a certain effect. An art which strives to look like artlessness is their commonest characteristic. And the special value of the Queen's Journal is its genuine simplicity and perfect candour. In these pages she is no longer the lofty abstraction of royalty who lends dignity to a pageant but otherwise is hedged about with a divinity through which it would be profane to penetrate. Here we are permitted to look upon the woman rather than the monarch, and to repay with sympathy the sympathy which she is so ready to extend towards her subjects. It is sometimes asked, with some little jealousy, why the Queen is so fond of Scotland. This book answers the question. It is because there, and especially in the Highlands, she can gratify that intense love of nature which she possesses, and which shows itself in keen appreciation, not merely of wild and beautiful scenery, but also of characters and modes of life as yet in somewhat of their primitive simplicity. The Queen, too, is?as she confesses with evident pride?a descendant of tho House of Stuart, and for her each scene she looks upon recalls some romantic incident in connexion with the fortunes of her ancestors. Heredity asserts itself, Mr. Galton would tell us, in this particular, but not in this alone. For we arc insensibly reminded of King George III.?"" Farmer George ""?when wo read the Queen's account of ""juicing the sheep "" and the interest she took in the more familiar operation of clipping. But, although the Journal recounts the Queen's participation in many simple pleasures (and none seem too homely for her enjoyment), there is throughout her diary an undertone of sadness which the writer never attempts to conceal. Visits paid to old friends and old places bring back the memories of a happier past, and the very warmth of affection with which the Queen speaks of and treats those, whether gentle or simple, who have attached themselves to her seems like the yeanling of an empty heart for a consolation still denied. But we are, perhaps, intruding upon matters with which the reviewer has no concern. The book is emphatically one to be read rather than criticised, and cannot fail to deepen thc respect and sympathy already felt towards its author. Charles J. Robinson.More Leaves from the Journal of a Life in \ 0f the Highlands, from 1862 to 1882. Btf LITERATURE ^] tn (Smith, I crQ Elder & Co.)"" ' ' j th From a purely literary point of view there ! he is not a great deal to say of the Queen's new j th hook. Its style is of the simplest, and it al has the charm of naturalness which belongs ' al to simplicity. The story is told without effort ? w or affectation of any kind, and produces its j tc effect entirely by tho force of sincerity. Her ? Q Majesty is probably a sympathetic rather ' S than an acute and dispassionate observer, , A1 and everything that she sees is seen through , o sentiment. That the sentiment itself is tl always pure and often elevated is a reason I why these records of home life in the royal C circle will find a responsive echo. Otherwise o the experiences recorded are not altogether 1< such as would of themselves impart to this h interesting volume a distinctive character, t The book tells the story of the widowed life t of a queen. It affords touching glimpses a of a chilling isolation of personal position, i which is none the less real because in the t nature of things it must be rare. But it is e its simple human interest that gives the ( hook its strongest appeal. The reader rises < from its perusal with the feeling that he i has learnt something more of the good | i woman by whom it was written?that, above all else, he has seen her in that hour of desolation which comes to many good women, and must be borne by all to whom it comes. ""How will the Queen bear it?"" was the question everywhere asked on that early morning twenty-two years ago, when the tolling of the bell of St. Paul's after midnight carried the mournful intelligence that an hour earlier the Queen's consort had died at Windsor. This book contains the answer to that question. Its tone is one of calm resignation brightened by peaceful and confident hope. Of the Queen's personal character tlie volume contains, naturally enough, many indications. That character is here as elsewhere seen to be eminent in womanliness. Without being deficient in fibre and with abundance of volition it loves best to trust to a higher strength and lean on a firmer will. It was so in those early days of her sovereignty when Lord Melbourne told the Queen in a fatherly way that no woman, whatever her position, could Eve happily I for long without a man's arin?*tb rest on. And when, by the bereavement of 1861, the support of her husband's strength was withdrawn, the Queen turned for solace to that daughter whose fortitude during her father's sufferings and subsequent motherly devotion find a fitting record hero. This womanly trait is obviously a key to the Queen's intimacy with Dr. Norman Macleod, to whose guidance amid many difficulties and consolation in many troubles she has offered tho tribute of an I abundant gratitude. A keener sense of humour might have modified some of these reminiscences. Occasionally, however, a smile betrays itself behind the record of a solemn incident, as when we are told that Principal Campbell's prayer was very trying, because very long, on the day of the unveiling of tho statue of the Prince Consort at Aberdeen, when it rained in torrents. In other places the manifest sincerity saves everything. The book contains some few indications of the Queen's taste in literature. We gather that she is a warm lover of Scott, and this passion probably came to her through her husband from his and her grandmother, the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg?a remarkable woman, of a powerful, energetic, and almost masculine mind, whose pleasure it was of an evening to tell Scott's stories | to Prince Albert and his brother. The ? Queen herself appears to be familiar with Scott?especially, perhaps, with his poetry. j We are told that Brown gave her a copy of the poems of the Ettrick Shepherd, and that she found them full of beautiful things. It is said in various places that Lady Churchill read after dinner ; but except in one instance, of no special moment, we are left in ignorance of the books. This is to be regretted. Tho anxiety to avoid controversial topics, which has wisely restrained the Queenfrom almost all allusion to political affairs, need hardly have operatedin restraining her from all mention of the literature that has cheered her leisure. A similar silence is observed with respect to the Queen's tastes in the arts. Wo have heard elsewhere that she took lessons in singing from Labluche, and that the attained to marked proficiency as an executant on the pianoforte. That her skill with the pencil is at least such as to enable her to seize the broad features of a landscape, the illustrations to the present volume bear evidence. It is scarcely conceivable that one who possesses such attainments should be destitute of opinions on artistic questions. Nor would the expression of these opinions havo been foreign to the revelations of domestic lifo which it is tho sole business of the book to present. But while a certain reticence must have been judicious and necessary respecting artists in many walks who might be irritated by the preference shown to a rival, it is surely a loss that we are deprived of all mention of those who are beyond that infirmity, and about whom the Queen: must have thought and written frequently. The following passage on a visit to Abbotsford is full of the kind of interest of which we could almost wish that the book had yet more:? ""Another twenty minutes or half-hour brought us to Abbotsford, the well-known residence of Sir Walter Scott. It lies low and looks rather gloomy. Mr. Hope Scott and Lady Victoria (my god-daughter and sister to the present Duke of Norfolk) with their children, the young Duke of Norfolk, and some other relations, received us. Mr. Hope Scott married first Miss Lockhart, the last surviving grandchild of Sir Walter Scott, and she died leaving only one daughter, a pretty girl of eleven, to whom this place will go, and who is the only surviving descendant of Sir Walter. They showed us the part of the house in which Sir Walter lived, and all his rooms?his drawing-room with the same furniture and carpet, the library where we saw his MS. of 'Ivanhoe,' and several others of his novels and poems in a beautiful handwriting with hardly any erasures, and other relics whiclx Sir Walter had himself collected. Then his study, a small dark room, with a little turret in which is a bust in bronze, done from a cast taken after death, of Sir Walter. In the study we saw his journal, in which Mr. Hope Scott asked me to write my name (which I felt it to be a presumption in me to do), as also the others. We went through some passages into two or three rooms where were collected fine specimens of old armour, &c., and where in a glass case are Sir Walter's last clothes. We ended by going into the dining-rcom, in which Sir Walter Scott died, where we took tea."" In this connexion it may be mentioned that when the Queen's uncle and early guardian Leopold, King of the Belgians, travelled in Scotland as a solace for his bereavement on the death of the Princess Charlotte, he was for a few days the guest of Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford. While there his pride of descent peeped out in a curious way. An aged Scotch divine alluded to the fact that tho king was descended from Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony, who was one of the first to embrace the principles of the Reformation and to become a protector of Martin Luther. Thereupon Leopold said that he felt more honoured by tho mention of this circumstance than by anything that had been said of him and his family during his stay. The relevancy of the story will be felt by those who have been arrested by what the Queen herself says in these ' Leaves' of the strong Protestant basis which she rejoices to find in the larger religious bodies of Scotland. Her Majesty s love of the Highlands is too well known to require illustrative comment. That she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale, cloud and mist, that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder, and their brighter and sunnier effects, is obvious enough. Above all things the Queen's nature-worship is healthy, and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently* haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when, according to Carlyle, Goethe was the first to say, "" Come, let us make a description."" It will be remembered that the passages of the Queen's book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her Majesty's visits to poor Highland women. There was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old ""bodies"" to say just what was uppermost and not what was "" fut,"" and to talk to tho Queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman. The present volume contains two such peep** into Highland life, and the one we quote f>resents us with tho last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure, widow Grant: ""On Sunday, August 22, 1869, I went to see old Mn. Grant, whom I was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows, and her poor feet r used upon cushions, very much altered in her face, and, I fear, dying of dropsy. On August 20 I again saw her, and gave her a shawl and pair of socks, and found the poor old soul in bed, looking very weak and very ill, but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way. I took her hand and held it. On the 27th she died. On the 28th I stopped at her cottage and went in with Louise and Leopold. We found all so clean and tidy, but all so silent. Mrs. Gordon, her daughter, was there, having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her ; and then she lifted the sheet, and there the poor old woman, whom we had known and seen from the first here these twenty-one years, lay on a bier in her shroud, but with her usual cap on, peaceful and little altered, her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death. She had on the socks I gave her the day before yesterday. She was in her eighty-ninth year."" Probably the most enjoyable of these ' Leaves' are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the Highlands. Here is a sketch of the ""'juicing of the sheep"":? ""At a quarter to twelve I drove off with Louise and Leopold in the waggonette up to near the ' Bush' (the residence of William Brown, the farmer) to see them ' juice the sheep.' This is a practice pursued all over the Highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter, lt is done to preserve the wool. Not far from the burnside, where there are a few hillocks, was a pen in which the sheep were placed, and then, just outside it, a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap, and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other; one man (James Brown, my shepherd, tho elder brother, who came up on purpose to help) took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs ; and then William and he, holding them by their legs, dipped them well in, after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened, and here they had to remain to dry. To the left, a little lower down, was a cauldron boiling over a tire and containing the tobacco with water and soap ; this was then emptied into a tub, from which it was transferred into the trough. A very rosy-faced lassie, with a plaid over her head, was superintending this part of the work, and helped to fetch the water from the burn, while children and many collie dogs were grouped about, and several men and shepherds were helping. It was a very curious and picturesque sight."" More pathetic is the following :? ""Tuesday, June ll, 1872. '? Brown came in soon after four o'clock, saying he had been down at the waterside, for a child had fallen into the water, and the whole district was out to try and recover it?but it must be drowned long before this time. I was dreadfully shocked. It was the child of a man named Rattray, who lives at Cairn-na-Craig, just above where the new wood-merchant has built a house, and quite close to the keeper Abercrombie's house, not far from Monaltrie Farmhouse in the street. At a little before five, set off in the waggonette with Beatrice and Janie Ely, and drove along the north side of the river. We stopped a little way beyond Tynebaich, and saw the people wandering along the riverside. Two women told us that two children had fallen in (how terrible), and that one "" had been gotten?the little een ' (as the people pronounce 'one'), but not the eldest. They were searching everywhere. While we were there, the o'.'l grandmother, Catenach by name, who lives at Souttar Hole, came running along in a great state of distress. She is Rattray's mother. We drove on a little way, and then turned round. We heard from the people that the two boys, one of ten or eleven and the other only three, were at Monaltrie Burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below Mrs. Patterson's shop, passing under a little bridge and running into the Dee. This burn is generally very low and small, but had risen to a great height?the Dee itself being tremendously high?-not a stone to be seen. The little child fell in while the eldest was fishing ; the other jumped in after him, trying to save his little brother ; and before any one could come out to save them (though the screams of Abercrombie's children, who were with them, were heard) they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the Dee, and carried along. Too dreadful ! It seems, from what I heard coming back, that the poor mother was away from home, having gone to see her own mother who was dying, and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one. We drove back and up to Mrs. Grant's, where we took tea and then walked up along the river side, and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back ; but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching: amongst them was the poor father?a sad and piteous sight?crying and looking so anxiously for his poor child's body. "" Wednesday, June 12. "" Drove up to the Bush to warn Mrs. William Brown never to let dear little Albert run about alone, or near to the burn, of tho danger of which she was quite aware. She said her husband, William, had started off early at three this morning. Some people went down to Abergeldie and as far as the Girnoch to search, and others were up and below the castle. No word of the poor child being found. All were to start early to search."" That the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying, for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the Queen's domestic life. In truth, her Majesty's participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment. So long ago as the year of the Queen's accession the Marquis of Londonderry, writing to the Duke of Buckingham, said: ""I hear Melbourne says, in all his numerous conversations with the Queen, ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection."" Thia fact her Premier seems to have stated with some surprise; but probably the last of her seven subsequent Premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience. That these ' Leaves' contain much moro about Mr. John Brown than about Lord Beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise. The book is exclusively a record of home life, and in the domestic circle the Queen's personal attendant was obviously a more important person?as contributing more to her comfort?than even the most admired of her first ministers. Naturally enough, Brown became essential to the Queen, whose health, sorely tried and weakened, stood moro immediately in need of such simple-minded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy. It is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of Brown's robust independence and simple usefulness. We do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kind-hearted and devoted servant, whose discretion and faithfulness were rewarded by gratitude and even friendship. _"
75,B8377,['8771275'],"Vassili Verestchagin, Painter, Soldier, Tra- teller: Autobiographical Sketches. 2 vols. Illustrated. (Bentley & Son.) Mr. F. H. Peters has translated these sketches "" from the German and the French,"" a process which may partly account for the fragmentary character of two extremely readable and spirited volumes. The sketches begin with the author's sixth year, and conclude with reminiscences of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877. Madame Yerestchagin occupies a large portion of the book with an account?which is most characteristic and cleverly written, and by no means overcharged with admiration for the English ? of her journey with her husband through India. In the gentleman's narrative we have him as he sees himself, while the lady supplies a picture which does not differ materially from her husband's portrait. The artist's love for colour and energetic motives, which was manifest in the pictures he exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery, is displayed on every page. Travelling through Central Asia as an attache of General Kaufmann, M. Yerestchagin enjoyed peculiar privileges; and he bears emphatic testimony to the decrease of slavery under the dominion of his countrymen, not only in the territories they have annexed, where slavery is forbidden, and where the markets no longer exist, but in the neighbouring states, where the natives believe, "" not without reason, that the Russians may come any day and pay them a visit, and mercilessly release the slaves, as they always do wherever they go."" Domestic castigation, much affected by the natives, is less rife than of yore. ""The end of the world is coming,"" cried our author's landlord, with a gesture of despair. "" How so ? "" "" Why, what else is one to expect when a husband may no longer correct his wife ? If you beat her, she threatens to go to the Russians."" In fact, the unpatriotic ladies appeal to Caesar, not often in vain. They do not seem to be innocent of intrigues and gossip?vices which, according to the traveller, are due to the degraded social state of creatures who are confined to merely animal functions, and disfigured physically by the labour of a beast of burden. In Central Asia the townswomen are worse off than in Persia and Turkey, but the nomads are freer. One of the most interesting and remarkable sections of this book is devoted to the public displays of dancing boys (tamasha), which occur at the feast of Beiram. It is too long for extract, but will be found on pp. 105110 of vol. i. The complex and comprehensive system of pauperism obtaining at Tashkend, in Central Asia, is almost worthy of a subsidized Irish parish. The account of it is followed by notices of opium-eaters among the Sarts, not materially different from what we know. The Kirghiz falconers are a most picturesque set, and they carry their birds?golden eagles, the text calls them?hooded with leather, and upon their hands; they cast them off in the mediaeval fashion, and use them to kill foxes. Hawks are employed in a similar manner. How Russia has crept upon China is shown in many passages of the book; in none more clearly than the following. The South Tarbagotai detachment of 130 Cossacks (largely armed with flint muskets dating from the beginning of the century) and two guns was in 1870 on the frontier near the little river Bachty. This frontier was very like what farmers in Surrey and Hampshire whose land abuts on common land felicitously call "" a rolling fence."" The detachment was originally quartered in Urdshar, "" whence it has moved gradually forward till it has reached its present station, and has thus extended the Russian frotier by about 100 versts. Between 1850 and 1860 many districts in the neighbourhood of Urdshar still belonged to the Chinese; now they have not a single acre of land within a radius of 100 versts. Thus Russia grows from day to day; nay, from hour to hour."" "" But if it goes on growing like this,"" adds M. Yerestchagin, drily, ""the consequences will be serious."" Here is what our author saw of the results of the Mohammedan rebellion against the Chinese Government in the region of Tchugutchak :? "" Presently large clumps of trees were visible in the distance on both sides of the road, marking the farms, of which there were many round Tchugutchak. About two versts outside the town we Baw several ruined houses and chapels; the paintings on the walls were still uninjured. Some splendid old trees were still standing, but quite dead, for the irrigation canals are silted up and the soil is quite dry. In the town similar sights meet the eye. Wonderful groves and avenues, the work of years, are sometimes completely destroyed or going to decay. As you approach the town it is hard to believe it is empty ; you cannot help hoping to meet some human being, if it be only a robber. But not a soul is to be seen anywhere. The houses are for the most part uninjured, and likewise the paintings on the walls and the wooden latticework of the windows. Potsherds and fragments of articles of every conceivable kind were lying all about?vessels of iron and clay of all sizes, a quantity of copper coins strung on a string, dresses, caps, plaits of hair, shoes of all sizes? the clumsy Bhoes of Dunghans and Calmucks side by side with the miniature slippers of Chinese women. 1 put a pair of extraordinarily small slippers in my pocket as a memento. But, above all, skulls are to be seen lying about everywhere. The town is like a vast tomb, and the whole impression it produces is terrible. I wandered about for a whole day in B.'s company, and then for several days alone, without being able to accustom myself to this stillness as of the grave, and to the sight of all these streets, chapels, theatres, and squares standing for ever empty. The gate of the fortress, which the besiegers had blown in, is still tolerably strong. Near the gate is to be seen the entrance into the subterranean gallery by which the besiegers, after a long and tedious siege, made their way into the fortress. Then came a merciless butchery, in which no one was spared. Skulls and bones lie literally in heaps against the walls here and all around the fortress; at many points, e. g., by several of the gates, the skulls were piled up to a great height. In the fields round the town, too, lie skulls ; as far as the eye can reach, skulls, and skulls, and again skulls. The wolves and the jackals have already done their work ; the ravens are still engaged in picking the bones clean for the sun and rain to bleach. One of the farms in particular which lie nearest the town abounds in bones. A body of Calmucks, fifteen thousand strong, came this way to help the besieged ; but a force of only a few hundred Dunghans fell upon them, drove them back, and killed them to the very last man. What wonderful energy on the part of the insurgent Mohammedans, what cowardice on the part of the Chinamen ! I had enough to occupy me; from the governor's palaoe to the simple little houses of the common people, all the dwellings were habitable, all were painted, all decorated with paintings, sculptures, bas-reliefs, flowers, dragons, <6c. Theatres of an original construction, Buddhist temples in which some colossal idols were still intact (though the Mohammedans evidently showed great zeal in overthrowing these and breaking them in pieces), seemed almost to be waiting for the people to throng in to their prayers and their amusements. For three whole weeks I lived with one Cossack and one Tartar in a wretched cabin outside the walls of the fortress, and every day from morning till evening I roamed about, looking at everything, drawing and painting. Occasionally a wild goat would stray into the courtyard where I was painting, stand transfixed with astonishment, and then rush off at full speed across the steppe."" Making ample allowance for M. Yerestchagin's professional love of effect, and his characteristic delight in strong local colours, here is a picture?one of many in which this book abounds?painted in words by himself. By quoting it we allow the author to illustrate himself, his travels, his taste, and his literary art. The picture, supposing it to be wholly veracious, is not more terrible than that which the chroniclers of the doings of the Northmen in what is now France and Belgium relate of the condition of various cities which are almost within sight of our own shores?Tournay, for instance, which lay desolate for a generation (a.d. 880-911) because the Seople, dreading the sea-kings, fled to Foyon and left Tournay empty. M. Yerestchagin's numerous cuts, mostly figures and portraits designed to illustrate the physical character of the people he met while travelling, are very good indeed, and nicely engraved."

77,B2597,"['8592699', '6672445']","LITE-tATURE. DANIEL DERONDA. Daniel Deronda. By George Eliot London: W. Blackwood and Sons. We know not which to admire most in * Daniel Deronda '?the profound moral earnestness which could create two such characters as Gwendolen and Daniel Deronda, or the giggling flippancy wbich could place at Deronda's wedding feast "" the entire Cohen family, with the one exception of tho baby, who carried on her teething intelligently at home."" In none of George Eliot's novels have her sense of humour and her conviction of the supreme duty of earnestness come so flagrantly into conflict as in the present. One cannot lay down tho last volume of ' Daniel Deronda' without some tribute of astonishment at tho vast range of the author's powers. It is possible to regard her last novel either as a sermon in disguise or as an impartial picture of existing phases of English society?a great work, of course, in either view. On the whole, perhaps, one's impression is that in * Daniel Deronda' George Eliot is a preacher and teacher in the first place, and a novelist in the second. The purely pictorial purpose in this, as in others of her novels, is subordinate to the ethical. In * Daniel Deronda,' strange as it may seem in the production of such a humorist, the dominant motive, as revealed in the last volume of the work, is a protest against the vanity and frivolity of the time. In its last pages, instead of an invitation to .esthetic or humorous reverie, we seem to find a trumpet-call to young men and maidens?to young men to take example by the noble gravity of Daniel Deronda, and to maidens to take warning by the frivolity of Gwendolen Harleth and its tragic consequences. A protest against low, sordid, personal aims; an incentive to a higher, worthier, more aspiring and humane life; such would seem to be the ruling intention of 'Daniel Deronda,' wrought subtly into a humorous picture of things as they are, which may satisfy tho flaunting Gallio to whom the enthusiasm of humanity is merely one among its many diverse qualities. The earlier volumes of the work gave little hint of tho elevated strain which predominates in the later volumes, and the full earnestness of the author's purpose was not certain till the very last, and even then it is open to argument for the subtle mind. This says much for tho success with which George Eliot can subdue herself into the attitude of dramatic impartiality, even while she retains as a governing idea in her work that it should, as a whole, point somewhere, teach some lesson, have some aspiration towards the infinite. All through the skilful dissection of Gwendolen's heartlessness, which seems to leave not a nook or corner in ber being unsearched and unexhibited, exposing the most secret and unacknowledged of her little vanities, we are left to speculate as we may upon the phenomenon. We feel as if we were present at a lecture in social pathology, by a most skilful professor of the social microscope. This creature, a product of the generation, is dissected before us, and put piece by piece nnder the glass; wo look on, peep in our turn through the instrument, and admire the skill of the anatomist as she flourishes her keen knife. Whether the structure is a diseased or a healthy structure, Professor Eliot does not say till she has anatomised it to its minutest filaments. But, having completed her pathological lecture, she next proceeds to indicate what an abominable perversion of nature this creature is, and how it is possible to reform it into the likeness of something nobler. Several times in the course of the lecture she has drawn marked attention to a certain rudimentary part of the creature, an undeveloped organ. "" Note this; I will return to it another time."" In tho course of tho exposition, we have become deeply interested in this organ, and by-and-by our curiosity is gratified. We aro shown how the whole nature has been perverted by the starvation of this part, and by what means it is possible to nourish it till it attains its proper strength and restore the natural balance of the system. It seems as if George Eliot had feared lest the baser tendencies of the age should take heart and flourish from the discomfiture of the nnworldly aspirations of Dorothea and the ridiculous collapse of the ambitions of Casaubon, and had resolved to concoct an antidote in the careers of Gwendolen and Mordecai to show the danger which sometimes attends calculating selfishness and light-headed conceit, and the sweet reward which sometimes waits npon disinterested enthusiasm. There must be hundreds of girls more or less like Gwendolen among George Eliot's readers, and the exposure of her shallow frivolous aims is meant to make them ashamed of themselves, and to lift them into a higher conception of their duties and destinies. Perhaps if George Eliot had thought fit to make this lesson to the girls of the period more than a gentle hint, she ought to have increased Gwendolen's punishment, for after all Gwendolen comes very comfortably out of her troubles, being left with two thousand a-year and a developed conscience, and free to marry, if she chooses, a hearty handsome young cousin, whose addresses she had slighted in her unregenerate days. But then Gwendolen's crime, after all, was girlish giddiness and thoughtlessness, and the justice of the circulating library is completely satisfied if her heart is softened, and her wicked husband is drowned. If Grandcourt had turned np again, or if he had left her as poor as she was when she came to him, her fate would perhaps have been a moro terrible warning, but it would have been too miserable; besides that, if sho had been left in physical misery, we could not have had tho same assurance of the reality of her moral regeneration. If Gwendolen is a warning to the girl of the period, Daniel Deronda is equally an example to the young man of tho period, in the gravity and loftiness of his aims. Our flippant youth would probably call him a visionary or a prig, and would jeer at his relations with Gwendolen as impossible ; and their judgment of his impossibility would probably be right if he were meant as a type of our own race. His grave meditative nature, his profound composure and self-control, his steady persistent passion, are eminently Hebraic, and are meant to be so. He is an illustration of an element in our complex insular life that is not of indigenous origin. It is an influence, too, to which, in our earnest moments, we are not incapable of yielding ourselves, and with the healthiest of results. There is a something in it, also, ""which is repellent to the average common sense of Englishmen. That something is well expressed by Sir Hugo Mullinger, an admirably drawn type of the cultivated English squire. I have long expected something remarkable from you, Dan ; but for God's sake, don't go into any eccentricities! I can tolerate any man's difference of opinion, hut let him tell it me without getting himself up as a lunatic. At this stago of tho world, if a man wants to be t;ik?n seriously, ho must keep clear of melodrama. Don't misunderstand mo. I am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account. I only think you might easily bo led arm in ann with a lunatic, especially if he wanted defending. You have a passion for people who arc pelted, Dan. I'm sorry for them, too; but so far as company goes, it's a Kid ground of selection. Still Sir Hugo does not quarrel with Daniel Deronda for his Innacy; ho respects his earnestness, and here again he is typical of his countrymen. By far the most wonderful part of ' Daniel Deronda,' its chief claim to admiration as an achievement, is its picture of the Jews, its exemplification and analysis of different forms of Jewish life, some of them not so estimable as Deronda and Mordecai. We have spoken of the Cohen family in noticing previous numbers of the work. In the last volume there is a notable addition to the gallery in thc portrait of Lapidoth, Mirah's father, who verities her presentiments by suddenly arresting her one clay in the street as she is walking homo from giving some music-lessons. Ho is one of the most perfectly drawn and lifelike figures in thc book. Who has not seen him with his ineffaceable air of jauntiness, duo to his small hands and feet and the bushy locks that escape from under his hat ? Thc look of impudent suavity, the result of a habit of courting favour while accepting disrespect, is a look which lives of social struggle have stamped npon the features of many of the Hebrew race. The interview between this glib unconscionable vagabond, who has something of the character of Charles Mathews's Awful Dad, and the son and daughter from whom he has been so long separated, is very finely conceived. There are very few students of human nature who would have conceived the idea of making Lapidoth's impudence break down in so hysterical a way beneath his son's stern rebuke ; or who, having done so, would have made the fit of repentance so transient that he is making capital of his tears before they have dried on his cheek. The humour of Lapidoth's subsequent attempts to make himself agreeable to Mordecai and Deronda, and of the irksomeness of his feigned industry, is exquisite. George Eliot shows due regard for the requirements of the comic muse in getting rid of the old knave so lightly. Among the minor characters in * Daniel Deronda ' there are many charmingly delicate and truthful studies, but perhaps the finest and certainly not the least difficult of all is Lapidoth. When we think of all that there is in 'Daniel Deronda' we are much more disposed to admire the stupendous genius of the work than to regret the absence of any of the qualities of the novelist. Still, wThen wc look upon the novel merely as a work of art, we must admit that it has deficiencies. It is a subepidermic, subcutaneous kind of art; the figures are too much like elaborately dissected specimens laid out upon the table of a professor of psychology. It is not to be deniedt hat the novel has in many passages a tendency to dulness, and that dulness comes from the action of the story and the portraits of the characters being too much overlaid with professorial comment. The novel is not a work of art pure and simple, but a novel mixed up with an elaborate running criticism of all its parts. There is a want of courage in George Eliot; she cannot leave her characters to explain themselves. She must always be telling us why they do this and say the other thing, what principles of their nature they are illustrating. She is too professorial, too much like a professor who bores the average members of his class by overanxiety to take the dunces along with him. Nevertheless, she is a great writer, a great genius, and, if the homage which she receives is sometimes misdirected, no one will contend that it is excessive in its sum total.LITERATURE. Daniel Deronda. By George Eliot. (Edin- burgh and London: W. Blackwood & Sons, 187G.) Independently of its interest as a mere story and as a vehicle for reflections, Daniel Deronda is eminently interesting, because it presents in a fresh and brilliant light tho merits as well as the faults of its writer? merits and faults which are here sharply accentuated, and are not, as is too frequently the case, blurred and confused by the wearing of the plate. Both classes of peculiarities should be by this time pretty well known to the student of English letters. On the one hand, we are prepared to find, and we do find, an extraordinarily sustained and competent grasp of certain phases of character ; a capacity of rendering minute effects of light and shade, attitudes, transient moods of mind, complex feelings and the like, which is simply unparalleled in any other prose writer ; an aptitude for minting sharply ethical maxims; and a wonderful sympathy with humanity, so far, at least, as it is congenial to the writer. On the wrong side of the account must be placed a tendency to talk about personages instead of allowing them to develop themselves, a somewhat lavish profusion of sententious utterance, a preference for technical terms in lieu of the common dialect which is the fitter language of the novelist, and a proneness to rank certain debateable positions and one-sided points of view among the truths to which it is safe to demand universal assent. To this black list must be added some decided faults in style. In discussing a book which is in everybody's hands, it will be well to show how the above points are brought out, and how they affect the general merit of the book, rather than to indulge in superfluous description of the plot. In the matter of character, then, wo find two signal triumphs of portraiture. Tlie part of Gwendolen Harleth is throughout an overwhelming success: and the minutest and least friendly examination will hardly discover a false note or a dropped stitch. Her self-willed youth; the curious counterfeit of superiority in intellect and character, which her self-confidence and her ignorance of control temporarily give her; her instant surrender at tho touch of material discomfort ; the collapse of her confidence in the presence of a stronger spirit; the helpless outbursts of self-pity, of rage, of supplication, which follow that collapse ; the struggle between blind hatred and almost equally blind glimmerings of conscience ; the torrent of remorse and final prostration of will?are all imagined with a firmness, and succeed each other with an undoubted right of sequence, which cannot but command admiration. The husband is almost equally admirable ; indeed, one's admiration is here increased by the perception that the hand which is so faithful is distinctly unfriendly, and that the author would like ns to detest Grandcourt. Yet there is not the slightest exaggeration in the portrait, as he appears before us, acting with strict politeness to his wife, in no way violent towards ber (if we except the occasional use of somewhat forcible language), and employing, for the purposes of his refined tyranny, nothing stronger than the methods of "" awful rule and right supremacy."" If he should appear to anyone all the more detestable, it may be suggested that it is difficult for any husband to extricate himself handsomely from the position of being hated by his wife and having that hatred confided to a bewitching rival. The more study we give to these wonderful creations the better we like them, and an additional interest is impai'tcd by the discovery that Gwendolen is at heart a counterfoil of Dorothea, animated by an undisciplined egotism instead of an undisciplined altruism, and by the fanaticism of enjoyment instead of the fanaticism of sympathy. It might even suggest itself to a symmetrical imagination that tho soul of Casaubon clothed with the circumstances and temperament of a fine gentleman would animate just such a personage as Grandcourt. But these nro fancies. The point of present importance is that tho interest of the story undoubtedly tends to centre in these two admirable characters and is unfortunately not allowed to do so. Of the third (according to tho author's design, the first) personage wo cannot speak as we have just spoken. The blameless young man of faultless feature who clutches his coat-collar continually; who at the age of some twenty years wished "" to get rid of a merely English attitude in studies ;"" who, in the words of his best friend, was disposed "" to take an antediluvian point of view lest he should do injustice to the megatherium ; "" of whom it was impossible to believe, in the still more graphic words of the friend's sister, "" that he had a tailor's bill and used boot-hooks;"" who never does a wicked thing, and never says one that is not priggish?is a person so intolerably dreadful that we not only dislike, but refuse to admit him as possible. Only once, perhaps, is he human?when he persuades himself on all sorts of ethico-physico-historical grounds that he should like to be a Jew, solely becauso (as that very sensible woman his mother, the Princess, discovers at once) he wishes to marry a fascinating Jewess. We cannot accept as an excuse for the selection of this "" faultless monster "" as hero tho pleas put forward in the book that it is only tho "" average man "" and the "" dull man "" that will not understand him, and that the average man is not very clear about tho ""structure of his own retina,"" and the dull man's "" dulness subsists, notwithstanding his lack of belief in it."" In the first place, the cases are not parallel: for, though the average man may know very little about the structure of his retina, he can tell a real eye from a glass one well enough. And, in the second place, tho dull man may fairly retort, "" If you are a great novelist, make me believe in your characters."" In this dearth, or rather distortion, of central interest, the minor characters do not help us much. They are far less individual, and far less elaborate than is usual with George Eliot. Daniel Deronda does not supply a fifth to join the noble quartette of Mdmes. Holt and Cadwalladcr, Poy ser and Glegg. Sir Hugo Mullinger, with Hans Meyrick and his sister Mab, makes a shift to fill up the gap, but it is but a shift. Lapidoth, the unwelcome father, is chiefly welcome to us, the readers, because ol' the happy boldness of the incident which finally unites the lovers. Mordecai we must not, we suppose, call a minor character, but of him more hereafter. There is no lack in these volumes of thc exqtxisite cabinet pictures to which George Eliot has accustomed us. Tho account of Gwendolen's ""grounds of confidence: "" the charming etching of tho waggon passing Pennieote Keeto ry; tlie scene of thc first ride with Grandcourt; Gwendolen, nfl cr Klesmer has crushed her hopes of artistic success, and again immediately before she at last accepts her lover; the wonderful sketch of Grandcourt ""sitting meditatively on a sofa and abstainingfroiu literature;"" Deronda in the synagogue; the stables at the Abbey ; thc waiting at Genoa for the Princess ; and lastly, Gwendolen's retrospect of Ofleiulonc ?are all effects ofthe finest in this kind. But this good gift and other good gifts have been somewhat repressed, as it seems t o us, in order that certain tendencies not so excellent in- themselves, and very much the reverse of excellent when inordinately indulged, might have freer play. No one can read Daniel De rt nt da without perceiving and regretting thc singular way in which the characters are incessantly pushed back iu order that tho author may talk about them and about everything in heaven and cart li while the action stands still. Very sparingly used this practice is not ineffective, hut the unsparing uso of it is certainly bad, especially when we consider in what kind of language these parabases or excursus are expressed. We cannot away (in a novel) with """"emotive memory"" and ""dynamic quality,"" with "" hymning of cancerous vices *' and keenly perceptive sympathetic emotivencss."" with "" coercive types "" and "" spiritual perpetuation,"" still less with hundreds ol' phrases less ([notable because bulkier. Xo doubt many of these expressions are appropriate enough, and they are all more or less intelligible to decently-educated people. No doubt tho truths of science, mental and physical, are here, as elsewhere in our author's works, rendered with astonishing correctness and facility. But it appears to us that the technical language of psychology is as much out of place in prose fiction as illustration of its facts is appropriate. In philosophy, in politics, in religion, in art, a novelist, when he speaks in his own person, should have no opinion, should be of no sect, should indulge in no argot. If we are dissatisfied with tho Jewish episode which is so remarkable in this book, it is not merely because it has supplied temptations to indulge in psychological disquisition. We do not in the slightest degree feel "" imperfect sympathy"" with Jews, and we hold that Shylock had the best of the argument. But the question here is whether the phase of Judaism now exhibited, the mystical enthusiasm for race and nation, has sufficient connexion with broad human feeling to be stuff for prose fiction to handle. We think that it has not, and we are not to be converted by references to the ""average man."" The average man has never experienced the passion of Hamlet, of Othello, or of Lear; he is not capable of the chivalry of Esmond, of the devotion of Des Grieux, of the charity of the Vicar of Wakefield. But he has experienced, and he is capable of, something of which all theso sublime instances are merely exalted forms. Now the "" Samothracian mysteries of bottled moonshine"" (to borrow a phrase from Allon Locke) into which Mordecai initiates Deronda are not thus connected with anything broadly human. They aro not only "" will-worship,"" but they have a provincial character which excludes fellow feeling. Poetry could legitimately treat them; indeed, many of Mordecai's traits may be recognised, ?as we think, moro happily placed?in tho Sephardo of The Spanish Gypsy. They are, no doubt, interesting historically; they throw light on the character and aspirations of a curious people, and supply an admirable subject for a scientific monograph. But for all this they are not the stuff of which the main interest or even a prominent interest, or anything but a very carefully reduced side interest, of prose novels should be wrought. It is hardly necessary to say that this dissatisfaction with tho manner and scale of his appearances does not blind us to the skill applied in the construction of Mordecai. Probably no other living writer is capable of the patient care with which these intricate and unfamiliar paths aro followed; certainly no other is master of the pathos which half reconciles the reluctant critic. If tho thing was to be done, it could hardly have been done better, assuredly it could not have deen done with greater cunning of analysis or in a manner more suggestive. We should have no right to complain that to the simplicity and passion whieh characterise the subjects and situations of the author's earlier books there has succeeded something more complex and analytic in the present: it is a time-honoured transition, and one which has before now yielded excellent results. But in reality the transition is not in this case great, because the subject-matter really remains the same although there may be somewhat less directness of treatment. The book is little more than a fresh variation on the theme which has informed so much of George Eliot's work, which lurks even in the Scenes of Clerical Life, which is hardly in abeyance in Adam Bede, which is tho professed motive of The Mill on the Floss, of The Spanish Gypsy, and of Romola, which gives charm to the slightness of Silas Mar uer ? to wit, the excellence of obeying the instigations of kinship and duty Hither than the op. posing instinct, ""All for Love and the World well Lost."" Perhaps the motive has hardly depth and volume enough to bear such constant application. But this is matter of opinion. The matter of fact remains, that we have once more presented to us in the contrast between Gwendolen's misery and the prosperity of the sleek Deronda the same moral as we had in Hetty's catastrophe, in the fate which punished Maggie Tulliver's partial declension from the standard, in the ruin and disgrace that sprang from Duke Silva's passion, in the degradation and death of Tito Melema; tho same theories which led to the sympathetic selection of Felix Holt for a hero and of Dorothea Brooke for a heroine. The moral, and the standard, and the theories aro doubtless of a fine severity, and deal deserved rebuke to tho lax pleasure-seeking which has been considered a vice at all times, and is not openly considered a virtue even yet. In tho illustrations of these doctrines the author has again given us admirable portraits, and much exquisitely-drawn surrounding. But perhaps she has also once moro illustrated the immutable law that no perfect novel can ever be written in designed illustration of a theory, whether moral or immoral, and that art, like Atticus and the Turk, will bear no rival near the throne.

These are pleasant and pungent characterisations of the literary celebrities with whom Mrs. Lynn Linton in her earlier days was personally associated. Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Lewes, and Thornton Hunt are among the number, but the picture of Walter Savage Landor is the one on which most readers will dwell. As a girl she lived with him, ras his adopted daughter, knew him in all his moods, and loved him, as she tells us, with her whole heart and soul. Therefore she saw him more truly and judged him more justly than any other could do, reading the inner nature of the man with the clear insight of an intelligent affection. The Thackeray and Dickens and Hunt sketches are appreciative, the Lewes disapproving, the George Eliot unsympathetic. George Eliot's was not a nature to attract other women. It lacked delicacy, softness, and feminine interest in life's minor details. The fact of her having a more wide, commanding, forceful, and self-sufficient intellect than any other Englishwoman that ever lived gave her books their lasting pre-eminence (though fashion has pushed them aside for the moment), but detracted from her charmat least for her own sex and for many of the other. Evidently Mrs. Lynn Linton did not like her. Her judgment may be the less reliable on that account, but her impression is none the less interesting. It is a relief to hear a frank human opinion instead of the somewhat conventional compliments usual in printed reminiscences. Mrs. Lynn Linton's papers bear the hall mark of sincerity. We have read every word of the little book with the keenest interest and pleasure, and strongly recommend it to all in search of an hour's light and yet informing reading.MY LITERARY LIFE By Madame Edmond Adam (Juliette Lamber). (T. Fisher Unwin, 8s. 6d. net.) This is the second portion of the memoirs of a woman who perhaps beyond all others has kept alive the Gallic tradition of spirituality, wit and culture, and has transmitted to our days not a little of the keen literary atmosphere of Paris during the Empire. Madame Adam had exceptional opportunities of meeting practically all the interesting folk, political, literary, musical and artistic, from the sixties to the present day; and, being gifted with an extraordinarily retentive memory and a quite exceptional skill in reproducing actual conversations, she has given us in this most interesting book lifelike sketches of extremely fascinating personalities. We meet here with George Sand, Edmond About, Gustave Flaubert, Jules Simon, Prosper Merimee, SteBeuve, Beranger, Gounod, Liszt and, above all others, that wonderful woman Madame d'Agoult, who, more than any one else, helped to shape and form the at first somewhat hazy ideas of the writer of these memoirs. With an artistic cunning which is as .rare as it is admirable, Madame Adam has fashioned her recollections into a form which has all the fascination of a novel combined with the alluring veracity of a series of pictures of real men and women. Her own life-story, romantic enough in itself, is subordinated to the relation of the life-stories of those about her who helped to make the history?political, social and artistic?of the time. As a result the most brilliant epoch of Parisian intellectual activity is described from the inside with tact and discretion, and moreover with a literary ability whioh is as charming as it is unique. Madame Adam's introduction to Meyerbeer; her impressions of Wagner when he first dawned on Paris; her remarks about Madame d'Agoult's daughters Cosima and Blandine, who married respectively Hans von Bulow and Emile Ollivier ; her confirmation of the generally understood report that Gounod sold "" Faust"" to Chondans for ten thousand francs; her comparison between Berlioz and Wagner: "" The only revenge that Berlioz took of bis non -success was to make the Parisians admire the old masters such as Gluck, from whose genius he drew his inspiration, whereas Wagner, amid his greatest triumphs, was jealous of the smallest success of others""?all these and a thousand other touches of actuality go to make up an entirely delightful record of real men and women, told, too, with that inimitable charm which would seem to^be denied to all save to the most cultured of Frenchwomen. The story of the founding of Madame Adam's celebrated salon, which for many years was such an im- portant factor in French politics and literature, especially the latter, concludes with Daniel Stern's (Madame D'Agoult) remark: "" My dream for you, little Juliette, is that you should have a salon, quite small, very select, with the traditions of mine,"" and there follow a dozen succinct suggestions as to how a salon should be founded and worthily maintained. Altogether this is a most delightful, inspiring and informative book, worth all the recent volumes of memoirs put together; the translation is quite excellent; in fact, it does not read like a translation at all.

Wa have before us seven numbers of a work which has attracted no little notice in the world of wit, and which certainly deserves the serious attention of all laughter-loving mortals. These memoirs contain some account of the adventures of Mr. Pickwick, the founder, and Messrs. Tupman, Winkle, and Snodgrass, three of the members of the club, in search, not of the picturesque, like Dr. Syntax, but of information concerning men and manners, for the instruction and edification of the members of the society. Of course the story is merely a frame-work in which to exhibit pictorial representations of the incidents which befel these gentlemen in the course of their travels. The comedy is interspersed with some occasional touches of tragedy, which we do not think by any means so felicitous in their execution as the lighter and more humorous parts; and for poetry, at least poetry of a serious character, we recommend the author of these papers to eschew it for ever. To borrow the words which he has put into the mouth of the supposititious creator of the lines on the "" Joy Green,"" when called upon to recite his offerings to the muse, ""It's a very slight affair, and the onlv excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it is, that I was a young man at the time."" The style of ideas brought into fashion bv Monk Lewis, and sustained for a time by the vigorous pen and wild imagination of Barry Cornwall, has long since been forsaken under the influence of returning good taste, and consigned to the "" tomb of all the Capulets ;"" and young poets should recollect that the uneven lines of Thomas Moore are excused only by their exquisite matter, or by the kWill which h. rendered a deformity of metre pleasing to the ear, as a skilful composer will enhance the value of his harmonies by the occasional interposition of the harshest discords. But such liberties with the rhythm of verse may only be taken by the lofty spirit of genius or the practised band of long-tried ingenuity. Having thus blamed what we consider blameable, it is but just that we should offer our meed of praise. The scenes from life are sketched with considerable graphic power and rich humour, showing an insight into the mechanism of human actions, and a knowledge of the workings of that incomprehensible cause, the mind, which give a more interesting character to the fun and frolic of these racy pages than if they were mere farce unseasoned with the sharp relish of a strong satirical vein. A scene in mimicry of the tranquil and digtified proceedings of a certain great house, not a hundred miles from Westminster-bridge, is well worthy of perusal; and in short, if we were to particularize all that is good, we should give the numbers of all the comic chapters; and if we were to select a specimen of every variety of merry jest, we should reprint half of the contents. We give one extract, which will serve to initiate our readers into the mysteries of the Pickwick Club, and refer them to certain little monthly numbers which are displayed in green coats in the majority of the booksellers' shops we have passed for some time since. It should not be forgotten that the illustrations of the earlier numbers proceeded from the pencil of the waggish Seymour, but since his lamented and premature death they have been of course transferred to another operator. The portion we have chosen is a description of the chain of untoward circumstances by which Mister Weller, boots of the White Hart in the Borough, lost his chance of inheriting his father's wealth. "" My father, Sir, vos a coachman. A vidower he vos, and fat enough for anything-uncommon fat, to be sure. His missus dies, and leaves him four hundred pound.

By Charles Dickens. WIT 10lluations in colour by C. E. BROCK. Harrap. 15s. WE are glad to see this new edition of "" Pickwick "" with Mr. Bruck's bright and effective illustrations. Mr. Pickwick with Mrs. Bardell in his arms and Mr. Winkle extruded into the cold of the Crescent at Bath are good examples of the artist's skill in detail. Mr. Pickwick's figure and face were fixed by Seymour, and no one has departed far from his conception, but in the other characters there is a chance to improve on "" Phiz "" which has been taken. He made figures either notoriously fat or notoriously thin. His Sam Weller looks at least forty, and the same may be said of Alfred Crowquills, which appeared in a pirated American edition. Here Winkde and Snodgrass look more like real persons of some character. The List of Characters is useful, but by no means complete. As Dickens's Preface is printed, why is his Dedication to Talfourd not included also? It was a tribute to a friend both from the public and the private point of view, and reprints should give it.Tke Posthumous Papers of ike Pickwick Chtk.

We give, meanwhile, the author's su^lementary sketch of the present condition of some few of the weuknown persons to whom we have just made allusion :? Mr sad Mrs Winkle halag folly received into favour by the old gentleman, were shortly afterwards installed in a newly-t uilt house, not half a mile from Mr Pickwick's. Mr Winkle being engaged ia the city as agent or town corespondent of his father, exchanged his old costume for the ordinary dress of Englishman, aad presented all the external appearance of a civilised Christina everaJlerwarda. Mr aad Mrs Saodgraas settled at Dingley Dell, where they purchased and cultivated a small farm, more for occupation than profit. Mr Snodgrass, being occasionally abstracted and melancholy, is to this day reputed a great poet laong his friends and acquaintance, although we do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief. We know many celebrated characters, literary, philosophical, and otherwise, who hold a high reputation on a similar tenure. Mr Tupmaa, when his friends married and Mr Pickwick settled, took lodgings at Richmond, where he has ever since resided. He walks constantly on the Terrace during the summer months, with a youthful and janty air, which has rendered him the admiration ofthe numerous elderly ladies of single condition, who reside in the vicinity. He has never proposed again. Mr Bob Sawyer, having previously passed through the Gazette, passed over to Bengal, accompanied by Mr Benjamin Allen, both gentlemen having received surgical appointments, from the East India Company. They each had the yellow fever fourteen times, and then resolved to try a little abstinence, since which period they have been doing well. Mrs Bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentlemen with great Boat, hut never brought any more actions for a breach of promise of marriage, er attorneys, Messrs Dodson and Fogg, continue in business, from which thev realise a large income, and in which they are universally considered among the sharpest of the sharp. Sam Weller kept his word, and remained unmarried for two years. The old housekeeper dying at the end of that time, Mr Pickwick promoted Mary to tbt situation, oa condition of her marrying Mr Weller at once, which she did without a murmur. From the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been repeatedly seen at tha gate of the back garden, we have reason to suppose that Sam has some family. The elder Mr Weller drove a coach for twelve months, but being afflicted with the gout, was compelled to retire. The contents of the pocket-book had been so well invested for him, however, by Mr Pickwick, that he had a handsome independence to retire on, upon which he still lives at an excellent public-house near Shooter's hill, where he is quite reverenced as an oracle, boasting very much of his intimacy with Mr Pickwick, and retaining a most unconauerable aversion to widows. Mr Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house, employing his leisure hoars in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club, or in hearing Sam Weller read aloud, with such remarks as suggested themselves to his original mind, which never failed to afford Mr Pickwick great amusement. He was much troubled at first by the numerous applications which were made to him hy Mr Snodgrass, Mr Winkle, and Mr Trundle, to act as godfather to their offspring, but he has become used to it now, and officiates as a matter of course, lie never had occasion to regret his bounty to Mr Jingle, for both that person and Job Trotter' became in time worthy members of society, although they have always steadily objected taratara to tha scenes of their old haunts and temptations. He is somewhat infirm now, but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit, aad may still be frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the Dalwieh Gallery, or enjoying n walk about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine day. Ha is known by nil the poor people about, who never fail to take their hats off as he passes with great respect; tbe children idolise him, nnd so indeed deas the whole neighbourhood. Every year he repairs to a large family merry-making at Mr Wardle'a; on this, as on all other occasions, he is invariably attended by the faithful Sam, between whom and his master there exists a steady aad reciprocal attachment, which nothing but death will saver. A preface which touches on some of the difficulties the author has had to contend with in his undertaking, and a dedication, are given in tbe last number. Tbe dedication is to Mr Serjeant Talfourd "" mm a slight and roost inadequate acknowledgment of the inestimable services he is rendering to the literature of his country, and of the lasting, benefits he will confer upon the authors of this and succeeding generations, by securing to them and their descendants a permanent interest in the copywright of their works.""The Posthumous Papers ofthe Pickwick Club. Edited by Boz. JNo. VIII. Chapman and Hall* We continue to read these papers with great admiration of the easy, original, and unaffected powers displayed in them. We should be ungrateful if we passed by the appearance of a new number without a word of notice and welcome. There is no flagging in this number before us. Every stroke of the writer's humour, the most common or the most careless, tells to a desired effect; and that rarely mastered distinction between thc power of embodying the serious and the ludicrous, is thoroughly mastered here. We should say that the grave passages of the number even excel the Comic, tn the heart-rending calamities of common life, as in its side-splitting oddities and humours* the writer bids fair to show himself unrivalled. The number opens with an impassioned rhapsody by a mysterious old law-clerk, on the many miseries that have darkened the dingy old Inns of Court. Mr Pickwick stares at him in silence. The old gentleman resumes with a leer :? "" Look at them in another light: their most common-place and least romantic : What fine places of slow torture they are. Think of the needy man who has spent his all, beggared himself, and pinched his friends, to enter the profession, which is destined never te yield a morsel of bread to him. The waiting?the hope?the disappointment?the fear?the misery?the poverty? the blight on his hopes, and end to his career?the suicide perhaps, or, better still, the shabby, slip-shod drunkard. Am I not righi about them, eh ?"" And the old man rubbed his hands, and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject. Mr Pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity, and the remainder of the company smiled, and looked on in silence. "" Talk of your German universities,"" said the little old man?"" Pooh, pooh! there's romance enough at home, Without going half a mile for it ( only people never tb ink of it."" "" I never thought of the romance of this particular subject before, certainly,"" said Mr. Pickwick, laughing. "" To be sure you didn't, "" said the little old man, a of course not As a friend bit of it.' said he. He died one morning_w ?, his outer door. Fell with his head in his own letter-box, and there he lay for eighteen months. Everybody thought he had gone out of town."" "" And how was he found at last ?"" hundred Mr Pickwick. "" The benchers determined to break his door open, as he hadn't paid any rent for two years. So they did.

And away went the coach up White, ^pel, to the adnuratioa ofthe whole population of that pretty densely-poputated fluarter. u Kot a wary aice neighbourhood this, Sir,"" said 8am, with the touch of the hat ehich always preceded his entering into conversation with his master. u It is not indeed, Som, replied Mr Pickwick, surveying the crowded j ?j|hy street through which they were passing. ? It's a wery remarkable circumstance, Sir,"" said Sam, "" that poverty and oysters always aeems to go together. u l don't underataad you, Sam,"" said Mr Pickwick. a What I mean, Sir,"" said Sam, "" is, that the poorer a place is, the greater call there seems to be for oysters. Look here, Sir; here's a oyster stall to efery half-dozen houses?the street's lined vith 'ern. Blessed if I don't think that ven a man's wery poor, he rushes out of his lodgings, and eats oysters in reg'lar desperation. ? To be sure he does,"" said Mr Weller senior, "" and it's just the same vith pickled salmon!"" * Those are two very remarkable facts, which never occurred to me before,"" ?aid Mr Pickwick. "" The very first place we stop at I'll make a note of By this time they had reached the turnpike at Mile End; a profound silence prevailed, until thev had got two or three miles further on, when Mr Weller senior, turning suddenly to Mr Pickwick, said? ** Wery queer life is a pike-keeper's, Sir."" ? A what ?"" said Mr Pickwick. "" A pike-keeper.' ? What do you mean by a pike-keeper ?"" inquired Mr Peter Magnus. "" The old *un means a turnpike-keeper, gen'lm'n,"" observed Mr Weller, in explanation. .... ?Oh,"" said Mr Pickwick, "" I see. Yes; very curious life. Very uncomfortable."" ? They're all on 'em, men as has met vith some disappointment in life,"" said Mr Weller senior. "" Ay, ay ? "" said Mr Pickwick. "" Yes. Consequence of vich, they retires from the world, and shuts themselves up in pikes; partly vith the view of being solitary, and partly to rawenge themselves on mankind, by takin' tolls."" N Deat me,"" said Mr Pickwick, "" I never knew that before."" "" Fact, Sir,"" said Mr Weller, "" if they was gen'lm'n you'd cali 'era misanthropes, but as it is they only takes to pike-keepin'."" All this is excellent, but the wit of Boz, excellent as it is, has not exhausted this subject of Turnpikes. He may return to it with some effect. We look upon it as only another strong proof of tbeir misanthropical turn for annoying and disappointing mankind, that they are specially called Trusts, because they all declare "" No Trust."" It is malice and false pretence. The elder Mr Weller acquits himself through the number in a manner infinitely worthy of his esteemed aad ingenious son. We will close our extracts by quoting his touching farewell to Sam, when he is obliged to resume the reins for London :? ? pm a goin' to leave you, Samivel my boy, and there's no telling ven I shall see you again. Your mother-in-law may ha' been too much for me, or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o' the celebrated Mr Yeller o' the Bell Savage. The family name dependa wery much upon you, Samivel, and I hope you'll do wot's right by it Upon all little piata o' breedin', I know I may trust you as veil as if it was my own self. So i've only this here one little bit of adwice to give you. If ever you ?no matter and pison to say to that. Pison yourself, Samivel my boy, pison yourself, and you'll be glad on it afterwards."" With these affecting words, Mr Weller looked steadfastly on his son, nnd turning slowly upon his heel, disappeared from his sight."" We see in this the foreshadowing of some deep and pathetic interest or other, and wait impatiently for the ninth number of the Papers of the Pickwick.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwickian Club. Indited by Bo/,. And The Library of Fiction ; or, lui utily Story Teller. Boz marches on triumphantly, and has completely taken possession of the ear, and of the hearts, too, of his countrymen. His fifth number is .joyous in the scenes of a contested election, and the honest wonder and indignation ol' the great Mr. Pickwick at the venality he witnesses are charming. The contents of the ** Story Teller "" this month are all good, and two of the pieces are original, the one ""Jesse Chile,"" by Miss Mitford, and "" the Alchymist,"" by Mr. Harvey. This is really a great advance upon the last. Hoing thus, this periodical cannot fail to do well.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club ; containing a Faithful Record of thc Perambulations, Perils, Travels, Adventures, and Sporting Transactions of the Correspotiding Members. Edited by Boz. With Illustrations. The public have now had a full dozen of these papers, and they are cager for a dozen more. They seem to increase in interest and ability as they proceed. Instead of flagging, they grow more uproarious in their fun, and more rich in their drollery. We like this number the best of any that have yet appeared, still it has a striking fault; and we shall take this opportunity of reading Master Boz a friendly lecture in public, that we are quite secure he would not submit to in private. When he brings his scenes home to us in their familiarity of every-day life, he should always be not only strictly possible, but even probable. Thus, if an artist choose to paint a dragon or a chimera, we give him a little latitude as to his proportions, and the free use of his colours ; but should he choose to paint a pig, it must be a pig, and nothing else but a pig that he paints, or we shall pronounce his attempt a failure. The trial scene, that makes the interest of this volume, is as familiar to his readers, as is the appearance of a denizen of the sty ; and everybody who reads it knows, badly as much of our judicature is conducted, that the verdict was not possible from the evidence produced. This is a pity, inasmuch as it has no- thing to do with the humour of the proceedings. If it were necessary for the following out of the story, that the venerable and much-to.beidolized Pickwick should be wrongfully cast in damages, the evidence against him should have been made stronger?the misconception could easily afterwards have been explained away. However, ull this may not have struck the million. But we will still maintain that, however wild may be the fiction, or rampant the humour of a literary production, all the groundwork upon which it is erected, such as the face of the country, the manners of the time, and the operations of public institutions, should be strictly in accordance with truth.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, containing a faithful Record of the Perambulations, Ptriis, Travels. Adventures, and Sporting Transactions of the Corresponding Members. Edited bv Box. With Illustrations. Boz iroes on triumphing, and has again proved to the world that the comic muse is not yet quite defunct. The seventh number of this Pickwickian risibility has more than rivalled the preceding six. The sporting excursion on the 1st of September, which was undertaken with all the strength of the club, still more strong in its adjutant, Sam Weller, is one of the best things of the sort that we have ever read. The impounding of the dignified leader in a barrow, among the pigs and the asses, in the Tillage receptacle for the wandering, is a happy hit, and, though a most powerful, still a most probable one. For quiet humour, and keen satirical acumen, the interview with the lawyers is really not to be stirpassed. The next number promises us a rich treat. Wo are just admitted into the vestibule, with the folding-doors partially opened, that are to disclose some rich scenes?upon which we are impatient to enter.Posthumous leapers of the Pickwick Club; containing a Faithful Pecord of the l\ramhnhttions, Perils, Travels, Adventures, anil Sport- ing Transactions of thc Corresponding Me min rs. tl'!i.l. III........ Edited by Boz. v\ itu illustrations. Very good, this number the eleventh, indeed. Sam Weller improves upon acquaintance. The world never saw drollery and wit offered to them before in a form so singular. The renowned Mr. Pickwick is, himself, the legitimate successor to Don Quixote ; indeed, he is the cockney Quixote of the nineteenth century, and instead of armour of iron, he is encased in a good coating of aldermanie fat, and instead of spear and sword, has his own powers of declamation with which to go forth to do fearful hattie upon the swindler, the wrong-doer, and the oppressor of the innocent. Wc wish that the humorous Boz would call to mind that the knight of La Mancha was really the victim of a veritable flame. We should like to see Mr. Pickwick confess to the soft impeachment. This gentleman's attendant has the process of mollification already going forward in his heart;?we trust that it will not ascend to his head, but that he will make love with the same effect that hitherto he does everything else. Wc know of no publication that is productive ot more genuine amusement than these Pickwickian papers.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club. Edited by Boz. No. IX. Chapman and Hall. This is the best Pickwick we have had. The humour is broad, rich, and effective as usual; and there are sharper and nicci touches of character. The sketch of "" George Nupkins, Esquire,"" the Magistrate ol Ipswich, with all its accessories, is done to the life. This gentleman receives information of a duel, in which tbe amiable Mr Pickwick is found to be involved *? u It's a most extraordinary thing,"" said the astounded Magistrate. ?

"" This lady, Mr Jinks, has come here to give information of an intended dael ia this town."" Mr Jinks, not exactly knowing what to do, smiled a dependent's smile. a What are-you laughing at, Mr Jinks ?"" said the Magistrate. Mr Jinks looked serious instantly. "" Mr Jinks,"" said the Magistrate, ""youVe a fool, Sir."" Mr Jiaks looked humbly at the great man, and bit the top of his pen. ""Yoe amy see something very comical in this information, Sir; but I caa tell yoe this, Mr Jinks, that you have very little to laugh at,"" said the Magistrate* Tba hBeery-looking Jinks sighed, as if he were quite aware of the fact af-bia fevmw very little indeed to be merry about; and, being ordered to rn may's informatioa, shambled to a seat, aad proceeded to write it Mr Jinka ia a likeness of exquisite reality; touching* and even painful for its troth, while contributing most richly to the humour Of tho eeene. Mr drummer, an elderly gentleman in top boots, who forme tho Constabulary of Ipswich, is another most exact portrait;?he appears upon the scene at an interesting moment, having owly jost ouelled a great rebellion of the scholars of the lomat day-schooi hi' the town, who had conspired to break the windows of aa obnoxious apple-seller:?

Crummer proceeds with bis warrants to tho hotel of the Pickwickians, and insinuates *.himself into their presence:? Mr Grummer's mode of proceeding was professional, bot peculiar. Hie first act was to bolt the door on the inside; his second to polish Ms head and countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief; his third to jAocO his hat, with the cotton handkerchief in it, on the nearest chair; and rn* fourth to produce from tbe breast-pocket of his coat, a short truncheon sui uJowuted by a brazen crown, with which he beckoned to Mr Pickwick with a grave aad ghost-like air. Mr Snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence. He looked steadily at Mr Grummer for a brief space, and then said, emphatically?a This is a private room, Sir?a private room."" Mr Grummer shook his head, and replied?"" No room's private to his Majesty when the street door's once passed. That's law. Some people maintains that an Englishman's house is hit castle. That*s gammon."" A scene of great spirit and humour follows, which ends in Mr Pickwick's obeying thc laws of his country, and entering a sedan-chair with Mr Tupman for the purpose of being earned before the Magistrate. 8am Weller attempts a rescue, but after sundry great achievements of personal prowess, is himself made prisoner, and brought with the other offenders into the presence of inflamed and outraged Justice in the person of Mr Nupkins :? ** What's your name, fellow ?"" thundered Mr Nu pk ins. ** Yeller,"" replied Sam. "" A very good name for the Newgate Calendar,"" said Mr Nupkins. This was a joke : so Jinks, Grummer, Dubbley, all the specials, and Muzzle, went into fits of laughter of five minutes' duration. "" Put down his name, Mr Jinks,"" said the magistrate. ? Two L's, old feller,"" said Sam. Here an unfortunate special laughed again, whereupon the magistrate threatened to commit him instantly. It's a dangerous thing, laughing at the witkaa; man, in these cases. "" Where do you live ?"" said the magistrate. "" Yare-ever i can,"" replied Sam. "" Put down that, Mr Jinks,"" said the magistrate, who was fast rising tate a rage. "" Score it under,"" said Sam. "" He is a vagabond, Mr Jinks,"" said the magistrate. "" He is a vagabond on his own statement, is he not, Mr Jinks ?"" ""Certainly, Sir."" * "" Then I'll commit him?I'll commit him, as such,"" said Mr Napkins. "" This is a wery impartial country for justice,"" said Sam. ""Tnere ain't a magistrate going, as don't commit himself, twice as often as he commits other people."" At this sally another special laughed, and then tried to look so tuperoatu* rally solemn, that the magistrate detected him immediately. An inimitably humorous passage ensues in which it appears eer* tain that the Inst named unlucky special must have been committed, . only that Mr Jinks, who is the Magistrate's adviser (having bad k legal education of three years in a country attorney's office), whispers the Magistrate that bc thinks it wouldn't do, and so Mr Nop. kins makes a speech and says that, in consideration of the special's family, he shall merely reprimand and discharge him* Poor Mr Jinks afterwards saves the "" tremendous"" Mr Nupkins from Anally committing Mr Pickwick without a hearing. That illustrious maa is permitted to speak :? "" First,"" said Mr Pickwick, sending a look through his spectacles, under which even Nupkins quailed. u First, I wish to know what I aad my frteed have been brought here for ?"" "" Must I tell him ?"" whispered the magistrate to Jinks. "" I think you had better, Sir,"" whispered Jinks to the magistrate^ * "" An information has been sworn before me,"" said the smgistrate, "" that it is apprehended you are going to fight a duet, ead that the other atae, Tapsssn, is your aider and abettor in it.

At thw little expreesioo of opinion, Mr Jinks smiled again-rather more feebly thea before?and edged himself, by degrees, back into his own corner. A picture of tbe private life of Mr Nupkins is subsequently given, in the same subtle apprehensiveness of character. There are no touches in a picture by Hogarth, more true to nature than these extracts we have given.

This is, beyond a doubt, the most original and amusing series of comic sketches that have been published in our time; and we are inclined to think the present number, so far as they have gone, the best of them. The jest is kent up with excellent breadth of humour, and a most studied insight into the niceties and peculiarities of character. Scene after scene is worked out as if on the spur of the occasion, without much appearance of any previous bias or ultimate purpose, but always broadly and powerfully, and from a rich rein of comic invention. The style continues racy and unaffected. The writer reminds us frequently, in his ingenuity, in the vivacity of his talents, in the wonderful local truth of his pictures, and in the general accuracy of his observation and humour, as well as in the ease and animation of his manner, of the elder English comedies and farces. He has a share of the ludicrous invention of Vanbrugh, and touch of the higher powers of Wycherley. The number before us opens with a serious imputation on the character of Mr Winkie, whose friendly attentions to Mrs Pott, the wife of the redoubted Editor of the Eatanstrill Gazette, were remarked upon in a previous number. As Mr Winkle is sitting in Mr Pott's breakfast room, in all the unconscious simplicity of perfect innocence. Mr P. enters and calls him a "" Serpent."" Mr W. very naturally supposes this to be a piece of pleasantry. We recommend what follows to the reader, in the hope that none of our contemporaries will suppose its allusions levelled at them :? "" Pleasantry, Sir !"" exclaimed Pott, with a motion of the hand, indicative of a strong desire to hurl the Britannia metal tea-pot at the head of his visitor. u Pleasantry, Sir !-but no, I will be calm: Fwill be calm, Sir;"" and in proof of his calmness Mr Pott flung himself into a chair, and foamed at the mouth. "" My dear Sir,"" interposed Mr Winkle. "" Dear Sir !"" replied Pott. "" How dare vou address me as dear Sir, Sir ? How dare you look me in the face and do it ?** "" Well, Sir, if you come to that,"" responded Mr Winkle, "" how dare yon look me in the face, and call me a serpent, Sir ? "" Because you are one,"" replied Mr Pott. ? Prove it, Sir,"" said Mr Winkle, warmly. ? Prove it."" A malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor as he drew from his pocket the Independent of that morning; and laying his finger on a particular paragraph, threw the journal across the table to Mr Winkle. That gentleman took it np, and read as follows :? "" Our obscure and filthy contemporary, in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough, has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life, and to refer, in a manner not to be misunderstood, to the personal affairs of our late candidate?aye, and notwithstanding his base defeat, we will add, our future member, Mr Fizkin. What does our dastardly contemporary mean ? What would the ruffian say, if we, setting at naught, like him, the decencies of social intercourse, were to raise the curtain which happily conceals his private life from general ridicule, not to say from general execration ? What, if we were even to point ont, and comment on, facts and circumstances which are publicly notorious, and beheld by every one but our mole-eyed contemporary?what if we were to print the following effusion, which we received while we were writing the commencement of this artiele, from a talented fellow-townsman and correspondent :? "" ? LINES TO A BRASS POT. "" < Oh Pott! if you'd known How false she'd hare grown, When you heard the marriage hells tinkle; You'd have done then, I vow, What you cannot help now, And handed her over to W * ? ? * V "" ? What,"" said Mr Pott, solemnly?"" what rhymes to * tinkle,' villain ?"" "" What rhymes to tinkle ?"" said Mrs Pott, whose entrance at the moment forestalled the reply. "" What rhymes to tinkle ? Why, Winkle, I should conceive;"" and saying this, Mrs Pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed Pickwickian, and extended her hand towards him. The agitated young maa would have accepted it, in his confusion, had not Pott indignantly interposed. "" Back, Ma'am?back,"" said the editor. "" Take his hand before my very face ln "" Mr P*!"" said his astonished lady. "" Wretched woman, look here,** exclaimed the husband* "" Look here, Ma'am?< Lines to a brass Pot,' Ma'am. ' Brass pot;'?that's me, Ma'am. * False she'd have grown ;'?that's vou, Ma'am?you."" With this ebullition of rage, which was not unaccompanied with something like a tremble, at tho expression of his wife's face, Mr Pott dashed the current number of tho Eatanswill Independent at her feet. "" Upon my word, Sir,"" said the astonished Mrs Pott, stooping to pick up the pantr. "" Upon my word, Sir."" Mr Pot winced beneath the contemptuous gate of his wife. He had made a desperate straggle to screw op his courage, but it was fast coming uasorewed again. There appears nothing very tremendous in this little sentence, ? Upon my word, Sir, when it comes to be read; but the tone of voice io which H was delivered, and the look that accompanied it, both seeming to bear reference to some revenge to be thereafter wreaked upon the bead of Foti, produced their full effect upon him. Tho most unskilful observer could have detected, ia bis troubled coootemsnee, a readiness to resift* has WeUaugtoa boots te say eftdeat substitute who would have consented to stand ia them at tbat moment.

"" He must hare been a very ingenious young man, that, Sam,"" said Mr Pickwick, with a slight shudder. "" Just was, Sir,"" replied Mr Weller, continuing his occupation of emptying the basket, "" and the pies was beautiful"" We began by describing an imputation on the character of Mr Winkle, and we regret to say that, before the number closes, Mr Pickwick himself plays some opening passages in the part of defendant in an action for "" breach of promise."" His visit to the office of Messrs Dodson and Fogg is inimitably told:?the sketch of the clerks is finished adunguem. But we must pass these, and also the sharp lineaments of Captain Boldwig, and likewise the choice spirits assembled at the Magpie and Stump, for the purpose of introducing the father of Mr Weller, and the scene of his affectionate recognition. Sam and Mr Pickwick have turned in for a few minutes to a house of refreshment, by way of relief from thc toils of a verv anxious afternoon:? m* The room was one of a very homely description, and was apparently under the especial patronage of stage coachmen; for several gentlemen, who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession, were drinking and smoking in the different boxes. Among the number was one stout, red-meed, elderly man in particular, seated in an opposite box, who attracted Mr Pickwick's attention. The stout man was smoking with great vehemence, but between every half-dozen puffs he took his pipe from nis mouth, and looked first at Mr Weller and then at Mr Pickwick. Then he would bury in a (juart pot, as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving, and take another look at Sam and Mr Pickwick. Then he would take another half-dozen puffs with an air of profound meditation, and look at them again. And at last the stout man, putting up his legs on the ?eat, and leaning his back against the wall, began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all, and to stare through the smoke at the new comers, as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them. At first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped Mr Weller's observation, but by decrees, as he saw Mr Pickwick's eyes every now and then turning towards lum, he began to gaze in the same direction, at the same time shading his eyes with nis hand, as if he partially recognised the object before him, and wished to make quite sure of its identity. His doubts were speedily dispelled, however; for the stout man having blown a thick cloud hom his pipe, a hoarse voice, like some strange effort of ventriloquism, emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his throat and chest, and slowly uttered these sounds?"" Vy, Sammy."" "" Who's that, Sam? "" inquired Mr Pickwick. "" Why, I wouldn't ha' believed it, Sir,"" replied Mr Weller, with astonished eyes. "" It's the old 'un."" "" Old one,"" said Mr Pickwick. ? What old one ? "" "" My father, Sir,"" replied Mr Weller. "" How are you, my ancient?"" And with this beautiful ebullition of filial affection, Mr Weller made room, on the seat beside him, fbr the stout roan, who advanced, pipe in mouth and pot in hand, to greet him. "" Vy, Sammy,"" said the father, "" I han't seen you for two years and better.*' "" Nor more you have, old codger,"" replied the son. "" How's mother in law ? "" "" Vy, I'll tell you what, Sammy,"" said Mr Weller, senior, with much solemnity in his manner, "" there never was a nicer woman, as a widder, than that 'ere second wentur o' mine?a sweet cretur she was, Sammy, and all I can say on her now is, that aa she was such an uncommon pleasant widder, it's a great pity ahe ever changed her condition.

Even the engravings are infinitely inferior to those of its Pickwickian brother.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club. By ""Boz.'* (Nos. 1 to 6.) Chapman and Hall. As a lively caricaturist, the author of these papers may take rank with some of the best comic writers in the language. In hitting off the eccentricities of life, few have excelled him. His style is fresh and racy, and has all the stamp of an original spirit. Tbe reader will thank us for the extracts we are about to make, if he bas not already had the good fortune to meet with thc papers themselves. The idea worked out is that of a "" faithful record of the perambulations, perils, travels, adventures, and sporting transactions"" ofthe corresponding members of a cockney club, founded by Mr Pickwick, "" for the promotion of science, thc advancement of knowledge, and the diffusion of learning."" The corresponding members consist of thc illustrious founder himself, whose character is sustained throughout with a very romantic gravity, and of Messrs Tupman, Snodgrass, and Winkle, who are respectively distinguished by admiration ofthe fair sex, a taste for poetry, and a sporting turn. The different parties play upon one another's failings, and into one another's hands?thc plot of their adventures is kept up with infinite liveliness, bustle, point, and interest?and many neb sources of the truly ludicrous are opened. Tne nature of Mr PickwicVs observations on the various towns that are visited, may be gathered from an abridgment of what he says on Stroud, Rochester, Chatham, and Brompton.

A superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic; but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity, it is truly gratifying."" Our next extract is an admirable picture of a family party. The travellers have been invited to the house of a good-humoured country gentleman, Mr Wardle. Some strokes of character in the following description of the scene of their reception, are truly excellent for humour, force, and reality:? A very old lady, in a lofty cap and faded silk gown?no less a personage than Mr Wardle s mother?occupied the post of honour on the right-hand comer of the chimney-piece; and various certificates of her having been brought up ia the way ihe should go when young, and of her not having departed from it when old, ornamented the walls, in the form of samplers of ancient date, worsted landscapes of equal antiquity, and crimson silk tea-kettle holders of a more modern period. The au ut, the two young ladies, and Mr Wardle, each vying with the other in paving zealous and unremitting attentions to tbe old lad}', crowded round her easy chair, one holding her ear-trumpet, another an orange, and a third a smelling-bottle, while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows, which were arranged for her support. On the opposite side, sat a bald-headed old gentleman, with a goodhumoured benevolent face?the clergy noan of Dingley Dell; and next him sat his wife, a stout blooming old lady, who looked as if she were well skilled, not only in the art and mystery ot manufacturing home-made cordials greatly to other people's satisfaction, but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own. A little hard-headed, Ripstone pippin-faced man, was conversing with a fat old gentleman *n one corner; ana two or three more old gentlemen, and two or three more old ladies, sat bilt-upright and motionless on their chairs, staring very hard at Mr Pickwick and bis fellow-voyagers. ""Mr Pickwick, mother,'* said Mr Wardle, at the very top of his voice "" Ah!"" maid the old lady, shaking her head; "" I can't hear you."" "" Mr Pickwick, grandma !"" screamed both the young ladies together. "" Ah !"" exclaimed the old lady. ""Well; it don't much matter. He don't grasping the old lady's hand, care for an old 'ooman like me, I dare say."" u I assure you, Ma'am,"" said M r Pickwick, and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance; "" I assure vou, Ma am, that nothing delights me more, than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family, and looking so young and well."" 44 Ah !"" said the old lady, after a short pause; "" It's all very fine, I dare ssy; bot I can't bear him."" u Grandma's rather put out now,"" said Miss Isabella Wardle, in a low tone; ** but she'll talk to vou presently."" Mr Pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age, and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle. ? Delightful situation this,"" said Mr Pickwick. u Delightful!"" echoed Messrs Snodgrass, Tupman, and Winkle. ? Welt, I think it is,"" said Mr Wardle. ? There ain't a better ipot o ground in all Kent* Sir,"" said the hard-headed man with the pippin-face; ""there aint indeed, Sir?Fm sure there ain't, Sir ;*' and the hard-headed man looked triumphantly round, as if he had been very muck contradicted by somebody* but had got the better of him at last. 44 There ain't a better spot o' ground in all Kent*"" said the hard-headed man again, after a pause. u 'Cent Mullins' Meadows,"" observed the fat man, solemnly. u Mullios' Meadows !"" ejaculated the other, with profound contempt. ^ Ah, Mullins' Meadows,"" repeated the fat man. "" Heg'lar good land that,"" interposed another fat man. "" And so it is, sure-ly,"" said a third fat man. <( Everybody knows that,"" said the corpulent host The hard-headed man looked dubiously round* but finding himself in a minority* assumed a compassionate air, and said no more. "" What are they talking about ?"" inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters, in a very audible voice; tor, like roany deaf people, she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself. "" About the land, grandma."" "" What about the land ??Nothing the matter, is there ?"" u No, no. Mr Miller was saying our land was better than Mullins' Meadows."" ** How should he know anything about it ?"" inquired the old lady indignantly. u Miller's a conceited coxcomb, and you may tell him I said so Saving which, the old lady, ouite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper, drew herself up, and looked carving-knives at the hard-headed delinquent. "" Come, come,"" said the bustling host, with a natural anxiety to change the conversation?u W hat say you to a rubber, Mr Pickwick ?"" "" 1 should like it of all things,"" replied that gentleman; "" but pray don't make up one on my account."" "" Oh, I assure you, mother's very food of a rubber,"" said Mr Wardle; ""ain't you, mother?"" The old lady, who waa much lass deaf on this subject than on say other, replied ia the affirmative. In his efforts to please hts visitors, Mr Wardle is careful to consult their various tastes. He proposes rook-shooting to the sportloving Winkle, and the following scene is the result. The "" Alt boy*9 who figures in it, we should observe, is a most felicitous creation. He is a very Daniel Lambert of a boy, in fat and Isxiness. He goes on errands fast asleep, aad snores sa he waits at table:? -Thia ii tba psacn,"" said the old giotlomoo, ponsmy oller a ssw io oa a veone of trune- Tho ieJbnoetioo woe eee*ceesary; for the eawiag sf tho aacoaacioas rooka saflektatlj ieaHeatsd their I gentlemen Issi sm aaa oa tbs gi*s?J, sad lossie* tte stow. ttsy msm*r essa M^lhehwfc* i emi ss bo oosha, tba forans rf Mr and Mt WJetde if yisral is tbs oJsUain, The fol i wbieb goasaaame ba waa obi mi to eal, kai topmsttt tlmpossieoltyrf ?j Imhi.

Mr Winkle stepped forward with an air of determination and resolution; and Mr Tupman looked out from behind a tree. The boy shouted;?four birds fler out Mr Winkle fired. There was a scream as of an individual?not a rook ?in corporeal anguish. Mr Tupman had saved the lives of iaoumerablc unoffending birds, by receiving a portion of the charge in his left arm. The various incidents that arise out ofthe visit ofthe Pickwick. ians to the borough of Eatanswill are told with excellent whim and shrewdness. A little high-dried attorney, Mr Perker, adviser to the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, is happily sketched. He has placed "" twenty washed mea9' at Mr SI um key's door on the day of the election, for him to shake bands with, and six children in arms for him to pat on the head, and enquire the age of? There was a moment of awful suspense as the procession waitad for tht Honourable Samuel Slumkey to step into his carriage. Suddenly the crowd ut up a great cheering. "" He has come out,"" said little Mr Perker, greatly excited; the mort so as their position did not enable them to see what was going forward. Another cheer, much louder. "" He has shaken hands with the men,"" cried the little agent. Another cheer, far more vehement. "" He has patted the babes on the head,"" said Mr Perker, trembling with anxiety. A roar of applause tbat rent the air. "" He has kissed one of 'em !"" exclaimed the delighted little man, A second roar. "" He has kissed another,"" gasped the excited manager. A third roar. ?

The wood-cut illustrations are excellent Where this author places himself under the imputation of coarseness it is only by that amount of sympathy with some portions of his subject, without which he could not enter into, or describe, as he does so thoroughly, the ludicrous eccentricities of life. Humour cannot always be refined.Thc Posthumous Papers of thc Pickwick Club, containing a Faithful Hecordofthc Perambulations, Perils, Travels, and Adventures, of the Corresponding 3/embers. Edited by Hoz. With Four Illus- trations by Seymour. This, like the publication above, also goes on well. The Stroller's tale is ns true to the life as it is melancholy. The dying Stroller has been well illustrated by Seymour. This number tells us it was his last?that he was employed upon it when the fatal mania overtook him. It is a heartrending subject, that engraving, and too exciting for the sensitive and over-wrought nerves of misery. Might it not have been the one drop ot bitterness that made the poor artist's cup of anguish overflow, and thus incite him to pour out his life wantonly with it ? When a wretch is balancing on the edge of a precipice, small is the weight that will precipitate him down the abyss. Let us leave this painful subject. The present number is very good, and the description of thc review graphic. We have been also much entertained bv the adventures and misadventures of that brigade of the club that went foraging on horseback, and in a chaise, or the hospitality of thc hearty and honest Mr. Wardle. We think that the latter gentleman's Fat Boy is a little too sleepy. It is, however, a good conception. Mr. Pickwick himself is, as the nurse of Juliet says, ""A'man of wax?a mould?a bright light among his brethren."" We hope, notwithstanding the ominous word ""Posthumous,"" that bc is not quite dead?buried, at least, in oblivion, he never will be. We hope some day to view him in all the vigour of vitality, and in his own improper person."
80,B368,['2449598'],"FICTION THE EXQUISITE PERDITA. BY E. BARRINGTON. Harrap. 7s. 6d. IF anyone thinks that the historical novel is dead, a perusal of the works of the lady who writes under the name of "" E. Barrington"" should undeceive him. The author of these romances has a rare power of visualizing the past combined with a decided talent for dialogue and command of literary expression. Though she may, perhaps, be charged with looking at life very largely from the standpoint of her own sex, she does not make the mistake of so many clever women in treating the man as a mere foil for the portrayal of female activities and excellences. In her latest book, a masterly study of sentimentality, the reader's interest will be almost equally divided between the actress who became the first mistress of George IV, as Prince of Wales, and Sheridan, who are represented as half in love with one another. Some of the best work is in the earlier chapters, where the brilliant dramatist and Drury Lane proprietor is shown cajoling Garrick to prepare Perdita for a stage career, and shielding her from the advances of would-be admirers, whilst combating his own inclinations. Skilful use is made of the personality of his adorable wife, Reynolds's ""St. Cecilia,"" in warding off undesirable complications, and the latter's own pathetic situation affords an effective underplot. The sordid worthlessness which was hidden under the showy splendours of the prince who wooed the young actress as "" Florizel"" is relentlessly brought out, and the exposure, though couched under the form of fiction, is more sound historically than recent attempts to whitewash him by pseudo-biography. Some of the later episodes of the book, though remarkable as tours de force, notably the scene between Perdita and the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland (the real villains of the piece), are scarcely so convincing; and the relations here depicted of the discarded mistress with Charles James Fox cannot be pronounced more than plausibly credible, though some colour may be lent to them by the popular belief. The curious in biographic fiction may contrast with the treatment of the Perdita episode the equally remarkable study on the same theme by the late Stanley Makower, if they can obtain it. G. LE G.

81,B78,"['6154538', '8691846']","Sense and Sensibility. By Jank Ai sten. Richard Bentley, New Burlington Street. This reprint of Miss .fane Austen's excellent work forms No. XXIII, of the Standard Novels. The best critique of the work itself will be found in thc well-written preface; but as we wish all to read that, anti the novel too, that read our notice, we shall make a few brief but sincere remarks of high praise upon the publication before us. This novel we have always held to be one of the best, if not the very best, of its class. Chaste, yet witty, it can boast of excessive purity without tininess, turns morality into loveliness, anti proves religion to be the very highest state of mortal enjoyment. This work is the voice of innocence*?low, vet beautifully distinct, from its excessive sweetness, anti so persuasive, that we feel assured it can come only from the seclusion where vice has never dared to enter; and where it fails to make a proselyte, it must fall upon a heart unwin thy to enjoy what is beautiful, anti unable to appreciate what is virtuous.THE LITERARY EXAMINER. Sense and Snsibility. By Miss Austen. Standard Novels. Vol. xniii. Bentley. There we few works of fiction so acceptable in re-publication as the novels of Miss Austen. They never weary; their interest is sever lost; for, as in the prints of Hogarth, we find fresh matter for admiration upon every renewal of our acquaintance. Her fables ore of the simplest construction; her incidents in the common course of things; and her characters are only extraordinary in the truth of their delineation. The story she tells in all her works is the story of human nature in its most familiar phases. There are no exaggerations, and no deficiencies, and it is by the completeness of the view of character that the fulness of the effect is produced. The persons described are such as we meet every day in society, but wb have never seen their peculiarities in connexion with their causes of action-the one illustrating the other-and, moreover, most people in the world are so much occupied with themselves, that they are unable to make very accurate observations on their associates. Self is a great disturber of the observing faculties. In Miss Austen's novels the scene is before us with all the reality of the world, and, free from the engrossment of acting a part in it, we discover points of interest which a divided attention had overlooked. The common-place characters of the town and the village are the characters which Miss Austen makes of interest by making them thoroughly understood. In the story before us what an example of the worthless is Mr. Johii Dashwood-not the worMhless in the common acceptation of the word, implying positive vice, but the worthless, negative of worth, of which common character Miss Austen has evinced a perfect comprehension, and presented various illustrations. Mr. John Dashwood is incapable of a generous sentiment or a benevolent action, but he is a rigid ol)server of all the laws of the world, and we know full well that so really despicable a man would pass as a very pattern of propriety,-a model man. He has a wife all selfishness and worldliness, who draws the pale of humanity round her own house, to whom he looks up (as he must to some one, being of a parasitical genus) with veneration, consecrating all her foibles, and a(lmirilngly magnifying her littleness. For one trait:-The brother of this paragon marries beneath him, (as the world calls it, though, in this as in many other cases so described, the match was an equal one, for two narrow souls were attracted by the sympathy of meanness, and literally contracted to each other,) the feelings of Mrs. John Dashwood upon this trying occasion are described as follows by the adoring husband-we think we hear the man speak'as we read the letter, and the very breaks are full of nature, and denote the emphasis of his selfish concern:-"" Your sister has suffered dreadfully-in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome. Poor Fanny! (Mrs. John Dashwood,) she was in hysterics all yesterday. But I would not alarm you too much. Donovan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution e(lual to any thing. She has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel! She says she never shall think well of any body' again; an(l one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived,' &c.-(Sense and Sensibility, p. 228.) How exquisitely true to the sort of nature described is that unconscious satire -"" She has borne it all unit the fortitude of an angel ! She says she never shall think well of any body again.', Angelic being! Mrs. Ferrars is another excellently drawn character; one of those creatures cankered with wealth, the tyrants of the moneybox, the capricious despots of the last will and testament, who make slaves of expectation, and torment with fears of disappointment, and cause the interested hopes of their death to be fraught with miseries and abasements during their lives. Her merit considered, her perfection in one style, Miss Austen is the worst appreciated novelist of her time. She laboured under the disadvantage of ihaving the inferior stamp of circulating-library popularity put upon her works, before the superior judges had become acquainted with them, and recognized their high degree of excellence. The Quarterly Review (to its honour be it remembered) was the first critical authority which did justice to her merits, and after the grave had closed over her unconscious and modest genius. It is remarkable that Scott, who noticed with praise many inferior authors, never mentioned Miss Austen, perhaps because she was not an inferior author, perhaps for the same reason that caused Sir Walter to consider Fielding's incomparable satire, Jonathan Wild, only as a story. The present judicious blication is we see to be followed by "" Emma,"" "" Northanier Abbey."" "" Mansfield Park,"" and ""Persuasion,"" but suely it cannot be intended to omit "" Pride and Prejudice,"" which s at once the best and the most popular of the Austen Novels."
82,B4498,['9226586'],"The Countess Cosel: a Romance of History of I the Times of Augustus the Strong. By Joseph J. Kraszewski. Translated and edited by Count S. C. de Soissons. (Downey & Co.)?Of the 312 works, chiefly novels, produced by the Polish writer Kraszewski, we believe ' The Jew' is the only one which up to this time has been translated into English. The present story, however, has enjoyed great popularity among the author's countrymen, and it has been translated into both French and German. Perhaps the best thing which Kraszewski has left is his story of 'Jermola the Potter,' which first appeared in 1857, anticipating by four years ' Silas Marner,' which it greatly resembles. This was an extraordinary coincidence, for it is certain that the English author was unacquainted with the writing of her Polish contemporary. Of the present work we may say that it is lively and carries the reader along with it. The portraits of Augustus II. and his great rival Charles XII. are vigorous, and their supposed meeting at Dresden is dramatically conceived ; but the Polish king is such a thorough scoundrel that we cannot make a hero of him. We grow tired of him and his female favourites, and are sorry that the Countess Cosel, as she was called, should have fallen under his influence. The picture of the orgies of her drunken husband with Augustus and his revellers is repulsive. She is divorced, only to fall into greater misery after a brief triumph, and ends her days in prison. The poor Pole Zaklika, who loses his life for her, is an interesting figure. The book is illustrated with portraits, and deals with an epoch which is not very familiar to the English reader, who probably does not know much about Augustus the Strong and his skill in twisting horseshoes and bending iron bars, as the one preserved in the museum of St. Petersburg testifies. It must be confessed that Kraszewski had a great deal of skill in story-telling. He was a clever man all round, and has left some good poetry. Perhaps we may remind our readers that by order of the German Government he was arrested at Dresden on a frivolous charge of treason, and detained for some time in the fortress of Magdeburg. He died at Geneva, March 19th, 1887."
83,B4422,['2464013'],"Memoir of Nathaniel Hawthorne; with Stories Uow first publisled in this country. By H. A. PAGE. London: IH. S. King. ""I xom of Nathaniel Hawthorne"" is hardly the right title to stand conspicuously at the head of this volume. Of the whole volume, the latter part, containin- thd stories, is the more important; of the former part, criticism is a more important-at least a more bulky-ingredient than biography. I do not mean to say that Mr. Page's criticism is bulk and no better. On the contrary, it is the criticism of a good intelligence, and of an intelligence improved for this purpose by what is evidently a warm natural sympathy with the object to which it applies itself. I think Mr. Page's style might be mended; but he has many sentences which define acutely the genius of the master whom he celebrates. And he is probably right in thinking that there is more of an inner biography to be got out of an attentive and sympathetic study of Hawthorne's writings, taken especially in reference to the circumstances and genesis of each, than out of any other materials we are likely to get. Why, then, say "" Memoir?"" since it was Hawthorne's expressed wish that no formal memoir of him should be written, and since, if the matter that is usually implied by that word, Mr. Page has little mora to add to what has been mentioned in the sketch of Mr. Fields, and those portions of the "" Note-Books "" to which it has been thought fit to give publicity ? Why not rather say "" Study ?"" That, I think, would be the truer title. There is a good deal, then, in Mr. Page's preliminary study to give us a closer view of this reserved spectator of society, a better understanding of his ganius as one in which a logapy of weird traditions out of the past-that, together with an imagination naturally prone to weird and mystical constructions of nature and man-wero united with a firstrate power of positive penetration and practical insight into his fellow creatures. The positive penetratin and practical insight are employed in the services of the mystifying imagination, and by them its constructions acquire a strange reasonableness, a reality facing towards both worlds. By long brooding and meditating a mystical conception, in the light of a psychological science that has its roots in real observation, a bridge is built between the world of magic and the supenal -nay, the world of allegory and abstraction itself-and the world of sense and touch. It is upon this bridge that the creations of Hawthorne's genius dance with those gestures, and that reality in strangens which so haunt and impress the imagnation. Besmdes seizing clearly on this particular point, the present essayist is inten throughout in his observations on Hawthorne's ways of work, and the action and reaction of his genius and its successive roundings. Of the stones collected from Iagazies, and brought together for the first time for English readers in the other part of the volume, ' Mother Rigby's Pipe ' is an ehtertaining instance of the writer's witchwife vein in story-telling, applied to a purpose of rather sweeping sarcasm against his kind; 'A Virtuoso's Collection' isa capital piece of ingenious historical inventory, showing an extreme readiness in marshalling the resources of knowledge and memory on a bauney parade; the Canal Boat is quito in Hawthorne's finest vein of character and landscape description: they aL!I it is needless to say' bespeak one of the masters who in his English, has sce;: d cllasical with the most case, who has had his thought or image the most c'e:erly lIefore him for as mystical as it might be, and found with the least uncertainty the word to fit it with the most precision and grace."
84,B3772,['6717705'],"Oo)rr the Teaps. By the Author of "" The I Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table."" (Sampson Low.) DR. HOLMES in the manSions of British aristocrats felt himself "" at home,"" but his truest admirers preferred to meet him at the famous breakfast-table. These will now gladly welcome him again "" over the teacups,"" where lie discourses genially and wisely of men ard manners. It is unnecessary to draw comparisons between his present conversations and those which, some thirty years ago, made him famous. That he "" feels he has something he would like to say "" is his sufficient justification for the present work, and there are plenty of people on both sides of the Atlantic who will listen to him gladly. We may, however, note in passing that the always genial Doctor is now, if possible, more genial than ever. Even his old friend the New England deacon is not held up to ridicule. Among the characters that assemble around the tea-table are two of our old familiar friends: the Autocrat himself*-now known as the "" Dictator,"" though he dictates very little and, indeed, takes, ostensibly, only a small part of the conversationand the Professor. All the rest of the old company have departed, and given place to new and not uninteresting guests. Among these is, of course, a doctor who is one of the parties in the slight love-romance that runs through the book. That much of the talk relates to old age is natural enough, seeing that the author has now completed his eighty-one years and is not anxious to conceal the fact. He seems to regard himself at this stage of life with something of the curious scientific, or semi-scientific, interest which hitherto he has always manifested with reference to external things. He studies his sensations, and notes the gain and the loss-being quite alive to the privileges as well as to the imonveniences connected with his time of life. Ie is of opinion that ""4 old age is infinitely more cheerful, for intelli- gent people at least, than it was two or three thousand years ago. It is our duty, so far as we can, to keep it so. There will always be enough about it that is solemn, and more than enough, alas! that is saddening. But how much there is in our times to lighten its burdens ! If they that look out at the. windows be darkened, the optician is happy to supply them with eyeglasses for use before the public, and spectacles for their hours of privacy. If the grinders cease because they are few, they can be made many again by a third dentition, which brings no toothache in the train. By temperance and good habits of life, proper clothing, well-warmed, well-drained, and wellventilated dwellings, and sufficient but not too much exercise, the old man of our time may keep his muscular strength in very good condition."" Dr. Holmes is by no means an enthusiastic admirer of ""1the good old times."" le believes in the things and the men of to-day. If the match were possible, he says he would be prepared to back Mr. Gladstone for a hundred shekels against Caleb, ""that overconfident old Israelite,"" to ""cut down and chop up a cedar of Lebanon."" About many other topics which interest him Dr. Holmes takes the present opportunity of discoursing. He is somewhat severe on the persons he styles ""braintappers ""-those ""literary operatives who address persons whose names are well known to the public, asking their opinions or their experiences on subjects which are, at the time, of general interest."" The object with which the brain-tapper puts his questions may, lie admits, be a purely benevolent and entirely disinterested one. But this is not always the case. In many instances the brain-tapper "" is acting much as those persons do who stop a physician in the street to talk with him about their livers or stomachs or other internal arrangements, instead of going to his office and consulting him, expecting to pay for his advice. Others are more like those busy women who, having the generous intention of making a handsome present to their pastor, at as little expense as may be, send to all their neighbours and acquaintances for scraps of various materials, out of which the imposing 'bedspread' or counterpane is to be elaborated."" Akin to the ""brain-tapper "" is the writer of unnecessary communications, who desires to express admiration, or to seek information, or to procure an autograph. Dr. Holmes confesses he has encouraged this vice. He was willing to answer all correspondents as long as he was able; but at length it became necessary to give notice that the letters, books, and pamphlets which reached him were too numerous to be attended to. If he undertook to read and answer them all, he would have little time for anything else. It is gratifying to receive them, no doubt. ""When large numbers of strangers insist on claiming one as a friend on the strength of what he has written, it tends to make him think of himself somewhat indulgently."" Dr. Holmes hints at the difference that exists between the written and the unwritten answers to correspondents, and remarks that ""1the hypocrisy of kind-hearted people is one of the most painful exhibitions of human weakness."" He gives a few specimens of the ""unwritten answers,"" of which one may be quoted by way of example:"" Think the lines you mention are by far the best I ever wrote, hey'? Well, I didn't write those lines. What is more, I think they are as detestable a string of rhymes as I could wish my worst enemy had written."" Dr. Holmes concludes his present series of papers with the hope that he may yet meet his readers "" in the now and then of the future."" We hope so too, for many years to come. lie has given us his views about old age and the world in general, from the standpoint of eighty years. 'We shall hope in due time to learn how he regards them at ninety. WVALTER LEWIN"

It waS jiidiciatis to open with that one of BULWER's novels which hats preserved the highest place in public estimation, althouKh for our own part we mu ch prefer that which has proved the least popular, namely, T/e Lat ojf the Barons, a composition of a loftier class than any the author had previously uttempted, and whose comparative failure is a problem we are unable to solve, unless it be indeed that it was too good for the circulating libraries. Be this as it may, Rienzi has continued to grow in esteem, and is almost as much in de. mand at the libraries now as it was when first published. In the present form it may be possessed for little inore than the price at which it is to be borrowe(l, printed very bemutifully, on the best paper, neatly put into cloth boards, and illustrated with an engraving. Besides these attractions there is a preface by the author, written specially for this edition, in which he states that his aim was to adhere to history strictly in hisfact-, and through this medium of fictitious personages to endleavour to exhibit the causes of those facts. The theory is ingenious, and lie has not been unsuccessful in working it out. IRienzi, the Last of the Tribunes. MK. BULWERS RIENZI. By the Author of "" Eugene Aram,"" *? Last Days of Pompeii,"" &c. &c. Whokvkr looks upon any of Mr. Bulwer's works of fiction as the mere vehicles of amusement, does that author great injustice, and himself, unconsciously, a great wrong. All bis novels and romances have been produced, not to exemplify a single moral, but to elucidate a theory, work out a principle, or establish a science. To a superficial observer, the last clause of the preceding sentence may seem a strong one; and appear to give Mr. Bulwer more credit for deepseeing views, and ultimate results, than even himself will lay claim to. But this is not so. In his several works he has endeavoured to instruct mankind in?what ought to be to mankind their primal consideration?the relations of men to each other. In bis lighter novels he has given us enduring and searching lessons on the social scheme, as circumscribed by a particular circle, or a single country. In this, his latest work, 44 Hienzi, the Last of the Tribunes,"" he bas deeply and despondingly expatiated, and made new discoveries on the most difficult, the most debated, and the all-important science of government. In imparting wisdom to his countrymen and to the world, in the many volumes that he bas written, be bas become profoundly wise himself, with a wisdom that has brought a melancholy over the high aspirations of his soul; and which has given, at times, a scarcelyperceptible tint of misanthropy to his reflections. Whilst his mind is open to every generous sentiment, and his admiration and applause the free homage of every virtuous individual, he begins to despise and despair of mankind in the mass. He begins to understand? what we have long known?that, as yet, public virtue is like the clove sent forth from the ark on the face of the troubled waters. She cannot, from the overflowing seas of iniquity that cover the earth, find anywhere a resting-place. In the progress of knowledge she has certainly found an olive-branch?a token of the subsiding of the waters. But to the present era we see that the past affords no lesson, and the future gives scarcely any hope. Even in Mr. Bulwer's sanguine mind, the Utopian dreams of patriotism, and his faith in the public good, brought about by public virtue, are fast fading away, and are rapidly giving place to a conviction that sharp realities only will urge man on over bis worldly course, regardless of public honour, wildlyextended views, or the general wed: almost every page in the work licforc us, furnishes proofs of this feeling growing upon him. Verifying his own doctrine, the man speaks out eloquently in the author. He will soon cease to be a political partisan, soon cease to believe in aristocratic Whig honesty on the one hand, or to court the most sweet voices of the seldom washed on the other. Literature will snatch him away from the disgraceful broils of faction, and placing him in the Temple of tbe Muses, he will there find his legitimate station, his just triumph, and his deserved immortality. As a literary conqiosition, 4fc llienzi, the Last of the Tribunes,"" may be classed as a familiar prose epic ; whether we regard the unity of its action, the eloquence of its diction, or the high and the melancholy truth which it so beautifully enforces. The story o|>cns with a loving and quiet scene between the elder llienzi, the hero, and a gentle being, his brother. In this interview the character of ('ola, the predestined Tribune, is made to display itself very naturally and forcibly. His is a mind of great imaginings, imbued deeply with classic learning, and panting after the regeneration of Home. Ile is also proud of his illegitimate lineage, derived from an Emperor of Germany, at that time the representative of all that was left of the once universal empire. At this period, the city is distracted and devoured by the two contending factions of the Colonna and the Orsini, nearly equal tn strength and rapacity, though the former has a little the advantage, in being only less Irarbarous than its rival. To the Colonna, Cola llienzi lias attached himself, imitating in a graceful manner thc conduct of the elder Brutus, though not to the extent to which that patriot is recorded to have went. Ile, Cola, descended only to a witty buffoonery. What he really thought of the men, whose festive honours he enlivened by his facetiousness, may be gathered from the following indignant burst. "" * The Colonna !' said ('ola, with a bitter smile ; * the Colonna?the pedants!?They affect, dull souls, the knowledge of the past, play the patron, and misquote Latin over their cups ! They are pleased to welcome me at their hoard, because the Roman doctors call me learned, and because nature gave nie a wild wit, which to them is pleasanter than thc stale jests of a hired buffoon. Yes, they would advance my fortunes? but how ? hy some place in the public offices, which would fill a dishonoured coffer, hy wringing, yet more sternly, the hard-earned coins from our famishing citizens! If there he a vile thing in the world, it is a plebeian, advanced hy patricians, not for the purpose of righting his own order, hut for playing the pander to the worst interests of theirs. Ile who is of the people, hut makes himself a traitor to his hirth, if he hecomes a puppet for these tyrant hypocrites to lift up their hands and cry?' See what liberty exists in Rome, when we, the patricians, thus elevate a plebeian I* J)id they ever elevate a plebeian if he sympathized with plebeians? No, brother; should I he lifted above our condition, I will he raised hy the arms of my countrymen, and not upon their necks."" At that time, the deceived patriot had faith in plebeian virtue. The reader will also perceive the bitterness and the depth of the remark on that most plebeian of all ambitions, the wish to rise by making oneself the tool, or the parasite, of a patron, is here properly characterized ; and shows the first dark dawning in the author's mind of the miserable light of one dismal truth of our fallen nature. After this sweet interview with his brother, over which is spread that well-sustained classicality that no living author knows so well bow to give to his subjects as Mr. Bulwer, the pair separate?the elder to muse over the miseries of his fallen city, and to cherish vague* hopes for her resuscitated glory; the younger, with his heart light with innocence, seeks the cheerfulness of his home. In his way he is met by a band of the Orsini. They unhesitatingly make him their captive guide to direct them to some purpose of rapine; and, as he is thus brutally urged on with the marauders, a stronger force of the Colonna put this band to flight. The poor unarmed boy flies vyith he fugitives* being distracted with a very natural terror; and just is his brother appears, and he shrieks out, "" Save me ! save me !"" to Jola; 44 Mercy! mercy!"" to his relentless pursuer, Martino di Porto, the as U>la one of the Colonna, thrusts him through with his lance from back to breast. Hienzi falls on his knees before Stephen Colonna, the head of the house, and exclaims with all the pathos of a love made wretched?4< It is my brother, noble Stephen, a boy, a mere child !? the best ?the mildest! See how his blood dabbles the grass!? back, back?your horse's hoofs are in the stream ! Justice, my lord, justice !?you are a great man !"" Justice is readily promised by the old chief, who supposed that the assassin was an Orsini; but when he finds that the assassin was a kinsman, the following scene, so characteristic of the times, occurs. "" * My poor youth,' said the old man, compassionately, ? you should have had justice against the Orsini, hut see you not this has been an error ? I do not wonder you are too grieved to listen to reason now. Wv must make this up to you."" "" * And let this pay for masses for the hoy's soul; I grieve me much for the accident,' said the younger Colonna, flinging down a purse of gold. ' Av, see us at the palace next week, young Cola?next week. My father, we had best return towards the boat; its safeguard may require us yet.' '? 4 Hight, Gianni; stay, some two of you, and see to the poor lad's corpse ;?a grievous accident! how could it chance ?' ** The company passed hack the way they came, two of the common soldiers alone remaining, except the hoy Adrian, who lingered behind a few moments, striving to console Hienzi, who, as one bereft of sense, remained motionless, gazing on the proud array as it swept along, and muttering to himself, 4 Justice, justice ! 1 will have it yet.' 44 The loud voice of the elder Colonna summoned Adrian, reluctantly and weeping, away. 4 Let me he your brother,' said the gallant boy, affectionately pressing the scholar's hand to his heart, ' I want a brother like you.' *' Hienzi made no reply ; he did not heed or hear him?dark and stern thoughts, thoughts in which were the germ of a mighty revolution, were at his heart. He woke from them with a start, as the ""soldiers were now arramring their bucklers so as to make a kind of bier for the corpse, and then burst into tears as he fiercely motioned them away, and clasped the clay to his breast till he was lite rally soaked with the oozing blood."" From that moment. Cola's patriotism became nerved by revenge, his whole soul rose at once in eternal hate against the nobles; and rigidly and amply did he pay them back the devastation they had committed on his own race. lt is not our purpose to follow the hero through the slow development of his plans, his sagacious blinding of the aristocracy to his designs, and his veiled and astute cultivation of the good opinion of the working classes. Here we may remark a singularity in this romance, significantly indicative of a change in Mr. Bulwer's political opinions. The only truly noble, great, and good character, that he brings upon this exciting stage of action, is a patrician, Adrian, a branch of the Colonna family. Of the women, as they take the colouring of their minds from the men, we need say nothing. But of all the male characters, (with the exception of Adrian,) llienzi among the rest, are such as to make us loathe our common nature, llienzi's character is heroic, but it cannot be called good; great, but incomplete ; such an one as might create a faithful adherent, but not one whom a pure mind would rejoice to hail as a familiar friend. His author attempts to justify him from the imputation of that weakest of all weaknesses?an affectation of the puerility of holiday pomp. The very entertaining of such gilded hollowness argues pretension ; and wherever there is pretension, there is innate feebleness in some point of character. We do not think that llienzi was justified in this foolish expense of wealth on the score of keeping up his popularity ; for, though it flattered the citizens upon whose good will his power was solely found, in the end it undermined his strength with them, as well as brought about the necessity of taxation ; and attempted taxation did, at last, shed his blood in the very midst of his former idolaters. One almost uninterrupted colour of black villany, and of weakness, worse even in its consequences than villany itself, is spread over the dramatis pcrsoncc of this intellectual work. From the pope to the meanest official in religion?from the statesman to the lowest Jack in office ?from the general of armies to the degraded follower of the camp, all, all are miserable rascals. There is no repose for the mind of the reader except in the one character that we have mentioned, and in that of his betrothed Irene, the gentle and beautiful sister of the Tribune. Finely has the author castigated, and held up to immortal scorn, the Roman working classes, and the democrats. Ile describes them, and describes them truly, as being as ambitious, as revengeful, as cruel, as selfish, and as weak as the nobles, with all their vices made hideous by meanness the most disgusting, and sordidness the most revolting. For these frequent, and not too highly coloured pictures, conservatism will be eternally grateful to the author. Let us now suppose llienzi to have expelled the nobles from Rome, or made them reside there as simple quiet citizens, demolished the fortifications of their strongholds, hung up some of their number for what were looked upon formerly as mere casual occurrences, a few murders or so, cleared the roads of banditti, brought profitable trade, and overflowing plenty within the walls, and administering justice with mercy, seemed to have chained peace within the city by the rosy bonds of brotherly love between man, and in man?llienzi has done all this; and now let us look at Mr. Bulwer's picture of democratic gratitude. The greasy plebeians have grown fat under the beneficence of his sway. Their store-houses are full of merchandize, and their purses full of florins. All looks well and prosperous within their city. But at the far off papal court of Avignon, the nobles are again making a demonstration; and the pope?O these popes !? have excommunicated the Tribune, because he bathed in the same stone bath as the heathen emperor, Constantine. Well?one hundred and fifty freebooters, in the pay of the patricians, steal into the city, and for- tify themselves in one of the dismantled strongholds of the Colonna. Only one hundred and fifty ! But we anticipate. To repel such an attempt as this, the citizens' benefactor wanted a little money?only a very little tax?hear how the demagogues now handle their former idol. 44 Meanwhile as the decliiiiiur day closed around the litter and its troop, more turbulent actors in the drama demand our audience. The traders and artizans of Home at that time, and especially during the popular government of Hienzi, held weekly meetings in each of the thirteen quarters of the c itv. And in the most democratic of these, Cecco del Vecchio was an oracle and leader, lt was at that assembly, over which the smith presided, that the murmurs that preceded the earthquake were heard. ""?So/ cried one of the company?Luigi, the goodly butcher, ' they say he wanted to put a new tax on us; and that is the reason he broke up the Council to-day ; because, good men, they were honest, aud had bowels for the people: it is a shame and a sin that the treasury should he empty."" 44 4 I told him,' said the smith, 4 to beware how he taxed the people. Poor men won't be taxed. But as he does not follow my advice, he must take the consequence?-the horse runs from one hand, the halter remains in the other.' 44 * Take your advice, Cecco ! 1 warrant me his stomach is too high for that now. Why he is grown as proud as a pope.' 44 * For all that, he is a great man,' said one of the party. 4 He gave us laws?he rid the Campagna of robbers?filled the streets with merchants, and the shops with wares?defeated the boldest lords and fiercest soldiery of Italy-* 44 4 And now wants to tax the people!?that's all the thanks we get for helping him/ said the grumbling Cecco. 4 What would he have been without us??we that made can unmake.' 44 4 lint/ continued the advocate, seeing that he had his supporters? 4 Hut then he taxes us tor our own liberties ' 4* 4 Who strikes at them now?' asked the butcher. 44 ? Why the Barons are daily mustering new strength at Marino ' 44 4 Marino is not Home/ said Luigi the butcher. 4 Let's wait till they come to our gates again?we know how to receive them. Though, for the matter of that, I think we have had enough fighting?my two poor brothers had each a stab too much for them. Why won't the Tribune, if th the he be a great man, let us have peace All we want now is quiet.' 44 4 Ah!' said a seller of horse-harness, 4 let him make it up wi Barons. They were good customers, after all.' "" 4 For my part,' said a merry-looking fellow, who had been a gravedigger in bad times, and had now opened a stall of wares for the living, * I could foi give him all, but bathing in the holy vase of porphyry.' 44 4 Ah, that was a bail job,' said several, shaking their heads. 44 4 And the knighthood was but a silly show, an it were not for the wine from the horse's nostrils?that had some sense in it.' My masters/ said Cecco, 'the folly was in not beheading the Barons when he had them ail in the net, and so Messere Baroncelii savs. (Ah, Baroncelli is an honest man, and follows no half measures !)?it was a sort of treason to the people not to do so. Why, but for that, we should never hive Inst so many tall fellows by the gate of San Lorenzo' True, true, it was a shanie ; some say the Barons bought him.' And then,' said another, 4 those poor'Lords Colonna?boy and man ---thev were the best of the family, save the Castello. I vow I pitied them. 44 4 But to the point,' said one of the crowd, the richest of the set, 4 the tar is the thinj. The ingratitude to tax us. Let him dare do it!' "" * (Mi, he will not dare, for I hear that the pope's bristles are up at last; so he will only have us to depend upon !'' Here is satire over which the most bigotted Tory might gloat with rapture. It is of no use saying that these men are merely degraded Italians. Here they are not acting as Italians, but as sons of human nature. It is from thc unchanging soul of man that the picture is drawn ; the colouring is dismal, but it is correct. Would the large and fashionable furnishing ironmonger of our metropolis act more heroically than the huge Roman smith, Cecco del Vcecilio? Mr. Bulwer knows he would not. Would the west end purveyor of meat (the word butcher is obsolete) be more ready than Luigi, to whet his knife in defence of a newly-acquired liberty ? Or is there a rich radical vestryman of Marylebone, who would behave more nobly than the richest of thc set of the Roman crowd. No?a few hundred, or it few thousand of years, make but small change in the common impulses of humanity. Again we thank Mr. Bulwer for this picture. But the finishing stroke is still to be put to it. The hundred and fifty mercenaries are in the heart of the city, the Tribune has just been excommunicated by the pope's emissary, llienzi harangues the Roman populace, in order to inflame them to arms, to drive out this handful of robbers. In his harangue he tells them that he will go and stand with his few attendants before thc holding of the barbarians, that his trumpet shall sound three times, and that, if at the third blast, they do not rise and hasten to his banner, and to the attack, he will abandon them to the fruits of their ingratitude and cowardice, and to the tender mercies of the barons. Ile departs, and then one of the demagogues in the crowd thus begins :? "" ' Look you, my masters,' said he, leaping up to the place of the Lion, ' the Tribune talks bravely, he always did, hut the monkey used the cat for his chesmits ; he wants to thrust your paws into the fire ; you will not be so silly as to let him. The saints bless us ; but the Tribune, good man, gets a palace and his banquets, and bathes in a porphyry vase ?the more shame on him?in which San Sylvester christened the Emperor Constantine: all this is worth fighting for; but you, my masters, what do you get except hard blows, and a stare at a holiday spectacle ? Why, then, if you beat these fellows, you will have another tax on the wine, that will be your reward !' "" * Hark,' cried Cecco, * there sounds the trumpet,?a pity he wanted to tax us.' 44 * True,' cried Baroncelli, (there sounds the trumpet, a silver trumpet, by the Lord ! Next week, if you help him out of this serape, he'll have a golden one. But go?why don't you move, my friends ? 'tis but one hundred and fifty mercenaries: true, they are devils to fight, clad in armour.from top to toe; hut what then??if they do cut some four or five hundred throats, you'll heat them at last, and the Tribune will sup tin1 merrier.' 44 * There goes the second blast,' said the butcher. ? If my old mother had not lost two of us already, 'tis odds, but I'd strike a blow for the bold Tribune.' "" ' You had better put more quicksilver in you,' continued Baroncelli, 4 or you'll be too late. And what a pity that will be !?if you believe the Tribune, he is the only man that can save Rome. What, you, the finest people in the world?you, not able to save yourselves !?you, bound up with one man?you, not able to dictate to the Colonna and Orsini! Why, who heat the Barons at San Lorenzo? Was it not you? Ah ! you got the buffets, and the Tribune the moneta ! Tush, my friends, let the man go ; I warrant there are plenty as good as he to he bought a cheaper bargain. And,?hark ! there is the third blast; it is too late now !' 44 As the trumpet from the distance sounded its long and melancholy note, it was as the last warning of the parting genius of the place; and when silence swallowed up the sound, a gloom fell over the whole assembly. They began to regret, to repent, when regret and repentance availed no more ; the buffoonery of Baroncelli became suddenly displeasing ; and the orator had the mortification of seeing his audience disperse in all directions, just as he was about to inform them what great things he himself could do in their behalf. 44 Meanwhile the Tribune passing unscathed through the dangerous quarter of the enemy, who, dismayed at his approach, shrunk within their fortress, proceeded to the castle of St. Angelo, whither Nina had already preceded him ; and which he entered to find that proud lady with a smile tor his safety?without a tear for his reverse."" And this ends the first reign of the Tribune. Many arc thc adventures that llienzi in his self-imposed exile undergoes, and many, and highly-wrought, and beautiful, are the incidents that befall the other characters of this exciting story, which even to glance at we have no space. The eternal city, after its Tribune's departure, becomes saturated with the blood of lier children ; faction expels faction?massacre avenges massacre?till Heaven, either in vengeance or in mercy, in order to put a stop to the intercommunion of murder, pours down the vials of her wrath, and enacts the destroyer. The plague, in its inconceivable destructiveness, hushes the voiles of all the contending factions in the not-to-be-broken silence of death. In this part of the work the eloquence of Mr. Bulwer often arises into sublimity. But we wish not to be mere panegyrists. Let us hurry over a mass of events, and a long period, also, when time is chronicled by actions. The pope and his advisers find out, that if Rome is to be preserved to the church, it can only be brought about by thc instrumentality of the banished, and now imprisoned, Tribune. His fetters are knocked off?he is relieved of the bann of his excommunication, and clothed in the senatorial robe, he goes again to govern Rome. Adversity now seems to have perfected his character. The same prosperity follows in his steps?the barons are again humbled, and Rome, if not again quiet, is again happy. Ami now wc come to the bitterest commentary on democracy that was ever formed to open the eyes of a deluded world. A tax is again necessary. A revolt of the free and good citizens of Home is the consequence. We shall not adv crt to the bye-play introduced by Mr. Bulwer, in order to make his finale more dramatic. The Tribune advances to address the infuriated mob. Thus closes the eventful scene of the man who would /te the friend of the mere people. Mark, it is a liberal?almost a radical that describes it. 44 Then from earth to heaven rose the roar?4* Down with the tyrantdown with him who taxed the people !' 44 A shower of stones rattled on the mail of the Senator,?still he stirred m't.

His persuasion of his own "".Mi,lcrlul powers of eloquence il hr could but he heard, inspired him yet with hope; he stood collected in his own indignant, hut determined, thoughts;?but the knowledge of that very eloquence was now his deadliest foe. The leaders of the multitude trembled lest he should bc heard ; 4 and, doubtless,' says the contemporaneous biographer, 4 had he but spoken, he would have ''hanged them all, and the work been marred!' 44 The soldiers of the Barons had already mixed themselves with the throng?more deadly weapons than stones aided the wrath of the multitude?darts and arrows darkened the air; and now a voice was heard shrieking?4 Way for the torches!' Heil in the sunlight they tossed and waved, and danced to and fro, above the heads of the crowd, as if the fiends were let loose amongst the mob! And what place in hell hath fiends like those a mad mob can furnish ? Straw, and wood, and litter were piled hastily round the great doors of the Capitol, and the smoke curled suddenly up, beating back the rush of the assailants. 44 Hienzi was no longer visible, au arrow had pierced his hand?the right hand that supported the flag of Home?the right hand that had given a constitution to the Republic.

Ile sat down ; and tears, springing from no weak and woman source, but tears from the loftiest fountain of emotion?tears that befit a warrior when his own troops desert him?a patriot when his countrymen rush to their own doom?a father when his children rebel against his love,?tears such as these forced themselves from his eyes, and relieved, hut they changed his heart! 44 4 Enough, enough/ he said, presently rising and dashing the drops scornfully away ; 4 I have risked, dared, toiled enough for this dastard and degenerate race.

Now was the time !?he passed the flaming door?the smouldering threshold ;?he passed the outer gate unscathed?he was in the middle of the crowd. 4 Plenty of pillage within/ he said to the hy-standers, in the Homan patois, his face concealed hy his load?'

The concealing load was torn from his head?Hienzi stood revealed ! 44 c I am the Senator !' he said in a loud voice. ' Who clare touch the Representative of the People?' 44 The multitude were round him in an instant. Not led, but rather hurried and whirled along, the Senator was home to the Place of the Lion. With the intense glare of the bursting flames, the grey image reflected a lurid light, and glowed?(that grim and solemn monument!) ?as if itself of fire ! 44 There arrived, the crowd gave way, terrified by the greatness of their victim.

We said this was written by a liberal, almost a radical. WTe unsay our words, for the epithet now must be impossible. The very assassin that struck this cowardly, this ungrateful blow, was the most upright of all the demoeraticafparty. The moral is plain enough?any who run may read. lu the hand that struck the blow, Mr. Bulwer is elucidating a principle, not detailing a tact. This stroke at democracy is gratuitous. The smith is a fiction of story, but an everlasting truth of principle. Mr. Bulwer despairs of the human race?and so do we, for generations to come. Tliey were not formed for self-government. The majority should, because as yet tliey are only fit for it, influence, not control, nor cv cn elect their governors. Democratic liberty is the illusion of generous minds. How then could Mr. Bulwer have escaped it? Ourselves were cai ried away by it. We have been miserably undeceived. When reform was at first agitated, and the Bill promulgated, we hoped great things tor the nation?wc thought we saw a new light dawning upon mankind. What now has the country gained by it? What the world ? The reins of government have passed into other hands, but I hey are held the more tightly, and the lash is applied the more incessantly. In mere form?in the babble of theory, the commonwealth appears to be more free; but actual oppression, in every present tyranny, gives proof to the contrary. These are not words of mere declamation. One half of the population, at least, cannot hold themselves secure of not being at some one time within the scope of the poor laws. Over the whole of these, Whig oppression grins horribly. Into how many circles have not the hateful commissioners of this government extended? They have already destroyed all local corporations. They are not a far distant, and almost an abstract grievance, that flourishes only near the person of a despot, or in the hotbed of a court; but it casts its withering shades over our very hearths. But wc dare not trust ourselves to descant upon this very galling subject. Wc can only congratulate Mr. Bulwer upon this highly elaborated and conservative production, one that we trust will do as much good to mankind as it does honour to his refined, subtle, and powerful intellect. As a literary composition, it would justify any, and even contradictory praises. It is at times sweet and solemn, severe and gay_ eloquent always, poetical often. It leads away the heart a willing captive, while it appeals to the judgment with the force of logic, and leaves upon us the conviction that we have been inspecting the leaves ??! .: brok, the title of which should be. 44 An eternal truth/Rienzi, the Last of thc Tribunes. Ey tin Author of ' Eugene Aram.' [Second Notice' Last week, when, at the eleventh hour, we were unexpectedly called on to oller some, though fe xv, remarks on this new romance, xve felt that it was a service of haste and hardship; yet now, when we hilve abundant leisure, and are only required to state the results of a deliberate judgment, we do not find the difliculties much less perplexing. To string together high-sounding words and gay epithets, is i'.ir more easy than to praise xvith discrimination and understanding. If xve have been chary of commendation, and extreme in raising objections to some of Mr. Bulwer's former works, we were mainly influenced by the high estimation in which we held his natural powers and endowments, and ourproportionntc impatience of any blemish xvhieh should prevent their coming to full and perfect maturity. Now, however, the days of reservation arc over. Mr. llulwer has cast off the egotism and the petulance, which distinguished and marred his carly writings, lt would seem as if the very air which breathes over lands of classic song and story bad allayed the fever of a spirit made sensitive and scornful perhaps by too close a communion with the narrow world around bini, and, leaving all its energy and poetry in their first freshness, bad subdued its irritability?we hope for ever! Thus, while we only regarded his earlier novels as indication.1!?however superior to the mature productions of most men?we look upon his two last?upon the present one especially?as complete and excellent. We have indeed read' llienzi' with equal prideuud pleasure,?for what further may we not expect from him who has already done so much to justify the diviner nature within him, and in place of exhausting the stores of his mind with short-sighted thriftlessiiess, appears to be increasing and enriching them every day by nev and precious acquisitions! lt will not surprise ns, however, if the romance before us do not rise at once to the popularity of its predecessors: it is too high-toned, too exquisitely finished in its texture, to be thoroughly appreciated at a liv-t, and perhaps hasty, perusal ; and it contains no characters so fascinating as the blind flower-girl of Pompeii, and the relined joyous Grecian lover?the manly-hearted all'ectionate Lydon,?nor scenes xvhieh comic up in gorgeousness and breathless interest to those xvliich clo.-e that brilliant romance. Not that picturesque characters are here wanting, as witness the Provencal Knight and his lady-love Adeline?sweet thoughts of whom beguile the last earthly hours of his lawless ambitious career?neither is ' Kien/i' deficient in scenes : those of the Plague in Florence are of fearful power; and there is, to judge by our feelings, something of rivet- ing interest in thc fate which dogs the hero to the last moment of his life?implied rather than traced out?in tho few scattered fragments of incident, which, however, siro sufiicieiit lo remind us that tho story is laid in those days when auguries, and conjurations, and portents had not quite lost their ancient authority, lint, beyond all these, and above them, is the mind which has animated tho author in delineating the hero?a mind too huge and deep to bo fully comprehended ;tt a first or ii second glance. Mr. bulwer has done wisely iu leaving the properties of feudal life, comparatively speaking, untouched; we are ""a thousand strong'' in those who know how to marshal processions, and equip knights, anti order banquets. Neither is it very difficult lo collect from old chroniclers such fragments of costume and dialogue as may make our modern puppets look like tho proud paladins aud bright ladies of any given century. Hut it required a master genius to trace out thc career of such a spirit as Rif uzi's. Mr. Bulwer has thrown himself upon the task boldly, and discharged it nobly. The events of the Tribune's lifo have been followed with exactness:?one of them, revenge for the assassination of his younger brother, as an enduring spring of his ambition, wo would have touched somewhat moro lightly : neither is it historically proved. Then, how distinct and characteristic aro tho pictures shown us of patrician and plebeian life!?of the Orsini and Colonnas, and, best of all, llien/.i's wife, glorious alike in her sumptuous and haughty pride, and in tho passionate love she hears to her husband,?ii love which sweetens his private hours, redeems his fortunes, and leaves him nor, in the hour of deatli and desolation, without a joy and a consolation?and of Ceeco del \ cecilio, tho burly smith, with his obstinate, ignorant, enthusiastic liberalism: and the yet moaner crew who cheer on their deliverer, and then "" turn again and rend him,"" so soon as he refuses to ho their instrument, its well as their leader.

"" We are perplexed what passage to choose next. Kienzi's vigil of arms is excellently well described, but it is hardly separable from the rest of the story ; and the description of the tremendous pestilence, already made immortal by the pen of Uoccaccio, is too ghastly to be welcomed in our columns. Here is a glowing procession scene: Kienzi's return after bis seven years of captivity :? ""All I'mnc was a-tir!?from St. Angelo to tile ('aiu'ol, window-, balconies, roof-, were iToxvili-.l with animated thousands. Only here mal there, in the Millen quarters of the Colonna, the ?

""'Ay,' said another, a little niau with a shrewd, restless eye,?' they say truly ; I saw him take leave of thc Legato.' *-* Every eye was turned to tho last speaker ; he became at once a personage of importance. * Yes,' continued the little niau with an elated and pompous air,?' as soon, d'ye see, as bc had prevailed on Messere Brettone, and Missen* Arimbaldo, the brothers of Fra Moriah*, to accompany him from Perugia to Monte Fiascone, ho went nt once to the Legate D'Albornoz, who was standing in the open air conversing with his captains. A crowd followed. 1 was ono of them ; and thc Tribune nodded at me?aye, that did ho !?and so, with his scarlet cloak and his scarlet cap, he faced tho proud Cardinal with a pride greater than his own.

Not in the Hush of that hour were visible, on his glorious countenance, the signs of disease and care: the very enlargement of his proportions gave a greater majesty to his mien. Hope sparkled in bis eye?triumph and empire sat upon his brow. The croxvd could not contain themselves; they pressed forward, each upon each, anxious to catch the glance of his eye, to touch the hem of his robe. He him-elf xvas deeply affected by their joy.

"" We were half inclined to give the banquet of Walter de Montreal, but there is a scene towards the close of the story, which has moved us yet more strongly, and, as the catastrophe is already familiar to our readers, we shall not forest al their pleasure, by showing them how nobly it is managed.

He arrayed himself in tho mail, leaving only his head uncovered; and then taking, in his risjht hand, from the wall, tho great C. on talon of Rome, returned once moro to the hall.

"" Then from earth to Heaven rose the mar?. ' Down with the tyrant?down with him who taxed the people !' '? A shower of stones rattled on the mail ofthe Senator,?still he stirred not. No changing muscio betokened fear. His persuasion of hu own wonderful powers of eloquence, if he could but be heard, inspired him yet with hope. He stood collected in bis own indignant, but determined, thoughts;?but the knowledge of that very eloquence was now his deadliest foe. The leaders of the multitude trembled lest he should be heard ; ' and, doubtless,' says the contemporaneous biographer, ? had he but spoken he would have changed them all, and the work been marred: ""Tho soldiers of the Barons bad already mixed themselves with the throng?more deadly weapons than, stones aided tho wrath of tho multitude_darts and arrows darkened the air; and now- a voice xvas heard shrieking?'

Several prints were pinned up unframed,?among them that grand national portrait-piece, ' Barnum presenting Ossian E. Dodge to Jenny Lind,' and a picture of a famous trot, in which 1 admired anew the cabalistic air of that imposing array of expressions, and especially the italicized word,' Dan Mace names b. h. Major Slocum,' and ' Hiram Woodruff nam es g. m. Lady Smith.'?'Best three in five. Time: 2.40, 2.46, 2.50.' * * I say, Governor,? broke in the young man John,?them hosses'll stay jest as well, if you'll only sat down. I've had 'em this year, and they haven't stirred.?He spoke, and handed the chair towards me,?seating himself, at the same time, on the end of the bed. You have lived in this house some time??I said, ?with a note of interrogation at the end of the statement. Do I look as if I'd lost much flesh ?? B?id he,?answering my question by another. No, ?aid I;?for that matter, I think you do credit to 'the bountifully furnished table of the excellent lady who provides so liberally for the company that meets around her hospitable board.' [The sentence in quotation-marks was from one of those dis- interested editorials in small type, which I suspect to have been furnished by a friend of the landlady's, and paid for as an advertisement.] * * It a'n't the feed,?said the young man John,?it's the old woman's looks when a fellah lays it in too strong. The feed's well enough. After geese have got tough, _' turkeys have got strong, V lamb's got old, 'n' veal's pretty nigh beef, 'n' sparragrass's growin' tall 'n' shm 'n scattery about the head, 'n' green peas are gettin' so big 'n' hard they'd be dangerous if you fired 'em out of a revolver, we get hold of all them delicacies of the season. But it's too much like feedin' on live folks and devourin' widdah's substance, to lay yourself out in the eatin' way, when a fellah's as hungry as the chap that said a turkey was too much tor one 'n' not enough for two. I cant help lookin' at the old woman. Corned-beef-days she's tolerable calm. Roastin'days she worries some, 'n' keeps a sharp eye on the chap that carves. But when there's anything in the poultry line, it Reems to hurt her feelins so to see the knife goin' into the breast, and joints comin' to pieces, that there's no comfort in eatin'. When I cut up an old fowl and help the boarders, I always feel as if I ought to say, Won't you have a slice of Widdah??instead of chicken. The young man John fell into a train of reflections which ended in his producing a Bologna sausage, a plate of'crackers,' as we Boston folks call certain biscuits, and the j bottle of whisky described as being A 1. Under j the influence of the crackers and sausage, he grew ! cordial and communicative. It was time, I thought, j to sound him as to those of our boarders who had I excited my curiosity. What do you think of our young Iris??I began. Fust-rate little filly;?ho , I said.?Pootiest and nicest little chap I've seen I since the schoolmarm left. Schoolma'am was a , | brown-haired one,?eyes coffee-colour. This one has i J got wine-coloured eyes,?'n' that's the reason they i : turn a fellah's head, I suppose. This is a splendid - I blonde, ? I said, ? the other was a brunette, I Which style do you like best ? Which do I like ' I best, boiled muttoh or roast mutton'??said the I young man John. Like ""em both,?it a'n't the ,. j colour of 'em makes the goodness. I've been kind j of lonely since schoolma'am went away. Used to like to look at her. I never said anything particular to her, that I remember, but-1 don't know whether it was the cracker and sausage, or that the young fellow's feet were treading on tbe hot ashes 1 I of some longing that had not had time to cool, b j but his eye glistened aa he stopped. I suppose she s I would'nt have looked at a fellah like me,?he said, t I ?but I come pretty near tryin'. If she had said, . Yes, though, I should'nt have known what to do ? with her. Can't marry a woman now-a-days till il ' you're so deaf you have to cock your head like a e I parrot to hear what she says, and so long-sighted y j you can't see what she looks like nearer than arnTsn j length. Here ia another chance for you,?I said, s ?What do you want nicer than such a young lady l, as Iris ? It's no use,?he answered.?I look at them d girls and feel aa the fellah did when he missed t- catching the trout. T'ood 'a' cost more butter to is cook him 'n' he's worth,?says the fellah.?Takes il j a whole piece o'goods to cover a girl up now-a-days. n I I'd as lief undertake to keep a span of elephants,? ?> j and take an ostrich to board, too,?as to marry one of 'em. What's the use? Clerks and counterjumpers a'n't anything. Sparragrass and green peas a'n't for them,?not while they're young and tender. Hossback-ridin' a'n't for them?except once a year,?on Fast-day. And marryin' a'n't for them. Sometimes a fellah feels lonely, and would like to have a nice young woman, to tell her how lonely he feels. And sometimes a fellah,? here the young man John looked very confidential and, perhaps, as if a little ashamed of his weakness, ?sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagon,?a kind of a little Johnny, you know;?it's odd enough, but, it seema to me, nobody can afford them little articles, except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything, and the folka that are so poor they .don't want anything. It makes nice boya of us young fellahs, no doubt! And it's pleasant to see fine young girls sittin', like shopkeepers behind their goods, waitin', waitin', and waitin', 'n' no customers,?and the men lingerin' round and lookin' at the goods, like folks that want to be customers, but hav'nt got the money!"" We return to the deformed gentleman, into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until Death opened the door,?that we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room, and the Professor's speculations on the same. These, if not wholly new, are neatly put, and give a fair idea of Dr, Holmes when he is bent on philosophizing :? "" I have never yet crossed the threshold of the Little Gentleman's chamber. How he lives when he once gets within it, I can only guess. His horns are late, as I have said ; often, on waking late in the night, I see the light through cracks in his window-shutters on the wall of the house opposite. If the times of witchcraft were not over, I should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises. Sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor, that makes me shiver to hear it,?it sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then. Occasionally I hear very sweet BtTains of music,?whether of a wind or stringed instrument, or a human voice, strange as it may seem, I have often tried to find out, but through the partition I could not be quite sure. If I have not heard a woman cry and moan, and then again laugh as though she would die laughing, I have heard sounds so like them that?I am a fool to confess it?I have covered my head with the bedclothes; for I have had a fancy in my dreams, that I could hardly shake off when I woke up, about that so-called witch that was bia great-grandmother, or whatever it was,?a sort of fancy that she visited the Little Gentleman, ? a young woman in old-fashioned dress, with a red ring round her white neck,?not a necklace, but a dull stain. Of course you don't suppose that I have any foolish superstitions about the matter,?I, the Professor, who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any man's bead! It is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies. A man not only believes, but knows he runs a risk, whenever he steps into a railroad car; but it doesn't worry him much. On the other hand, carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary country-village, and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago, and there are rumours of ugly spots on the walls,-the old man hung himself in the garret, that is certain, and ever Bincethe country-people have called it' the haunted house,'? the owners haven't been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noises,?so it has fallen into sad decay, and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof, and the clap-boards have turned black, and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear, and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shaking,-take the man who didn't mind the real risk of the cars to that old house, on some dreary November evening, and ask him to sleep there alone,?how do you think he will like it? He doesn't believe one word of ghosts,?but then he knows that, whether waking or sleeping, his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images. It is not what we believe, as I said before, that frightens us commonly, but what we conceive. A principle that reaches a good way, if I am not mistaken."" Here are some verses out of the book of "" Iris,"" which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic:? UNDER THE VIOLETS. Her hands are cold; her face is white; No more her pulses come and go; Her eyes arc shut to life and light;? Fold the white vesture, snow on snow, And lay her where the violets blow. But not beneath a graven stone, To plead for tears with alien eyes; A slender cross of wood alone Bhall say, that here a maiden lies In peace beneath the peaceful skies. And gray old trees of hugest limb Shall wheel their circling shadows round To make the scorching sunlight dim That drinks the greenness from the ground, And drop their dead leaves on her mound. When o'er their boughs the squirrels run. And through their leaves the robins call. And, ripening in the autumn sun, The acorns and the chestnuts fall, Doubt not that she will heed them all. For her the morning choir shall sing Its matins from the branches high, And every minstrel-voice of spring That trills beneath the April sky, Shall greet her with its earliest cry. When, turning round their dial-track, Eastward the lengthening shadows pass, Her little mourners, clad in black, The crickets, sliding through the grass, Shall pipe for her an evening mau. At last the rootlets of the trees Shall And the prison where she lies, And bear the buried dust they seize In leaves and blossoms to the skies. So may the soul that warmed it rise! If any, born of kindlier blood, Should ask, What maiden lies below? Say only this: A tender bud, That tried to blossom in the snow, Lie3 withered where the violets blow. A fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round tho breakfast - table of the Transatlantic Mrs. Todgers, or to reveal what untied the knot, and cleared up the mysteries of the boarding-house. The book will not be read for its narrative; but it may be taken up again and again, and its pages paused over, for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain. Mr. Prentice is a humorist of a different kind from Dr. Holmes. He is a painfully diffident American editor, one of a class distinguished for their modesty. For something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers; living thus before the public in the columns of those journals. He has collected them all?to forestall others in doing so,?not because he thinks such collections praiseworthy, at least by other men. Some of them, he says, made the Louisville Journal famous, or at any rate notorious; and were exceedingly offensive to individuals, whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature. One merit of the collection in Mr. Prentice's eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own,? original, ? representing the editor himself. Thus he embalms, as it were, some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity. American museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the Yankee Yorick, or lend it out to evening parties, as was done with that of George Frederick Cooke; but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of Prentice's head and its contents, when he was young. Of the more youthful head, with its quips and sharp sayings, PrenticeYorick is manifestly proud, albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing. The world had its Menagiana after the wit was dead, and half a hundred other Anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed. Now-a-days, the initiation has been made in the States for a man to read his own Ana, set up his own statue, chiselled by himself, burn incense to and under his own nose, and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic Figaro, "" Que les gens d'esprit sont betes I"" In all the Anas hitherto published, the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine. The flashes are those of a thunder-cloud; the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning, ? spontaneous; bright effects of natural causes,?words that burn, titterings among contending wits, where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains, and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest. Not of these are the Prentice sayings. They were composed or invented by elaborate process, ?the joke not being the consequent ot' a pre- cedent, but this latter being made for the sake of the former. Thus Mr. Prentice gives us, frequently, only bottled lightning. He maintains, nevertheless, with all the pertinacity of Dennis, that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august Louisville Olympus. "" To express a thought, or a fancy, or a conceit moro conveniently,"" says the trans-oceanic joker of jokes, ""I have put the words into the form of a dialogue, purporting sometimes to be between two politicians, sometimes a man and his wife; but such paragraphs are not less my own, nor less original, than the rest."" Mr. Prentice's own description will thus best characterize the manner of his wit. Give him his time?only let him think?and at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible, if you will only have patience ! This process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent; and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve "" his 'prentice han'"" in this respect, we cannot do better than refer him to the ""Guepes"" of M. Alphonso Karr. Bad, however, as some of these jokes are, that same ""'prentice han'"" is not altogether unskilful?though thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master. The following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work, and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith. Here are half-a-dozen of the smart things whichthe author deems worthy of handing down to posterity:? "" The editor of the-asks if he shall write our life. Exactly as he pleases. Perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura, as iu living such a one as his own."" "" The Louisville Democrat announces the melancholy fact that Gen. Cass has been slain ' by the jawbone of an ass.' Does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death?"" '' A lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses, but she shouldn't break the peace."" "" The earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman; and yet, at one season, he always harrows her bosom, and at another plucks her ears.*' "" An editor in the West boasts that his enemies will find him ' a young David.' Very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaim?Goliar."" ""Several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of Mt. Vernon. Ah, ye miscreants, the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon Washington's.'' "" We know a beautiful girl, who would prove a capital speculation for a fortune-hunter of the right sort. Her voice is of silver, her hair of gold, her teeth of pearl, her cheeks of rubies, and her eyes of diamonds."" The playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality ; for instance :? "" Yesterday the junior editor of the Democrat called upon the senior editor of the Journal to welcome him back to Kentucky. The senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chair?full grown, minus two legs?to sit in ! To sit in! To tumble out of! which he did without an effort. No bones broken, andmatters compromised.?Louisville Democrat. Well, you and the chair had four legs between you, which certainly should have been enough to stand upon. If you insist that we gave you the fall, you must at least admit, in justice to our magnanimity, that we didn't hit you after you were down."" These folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling:? "" The editor of the New Hampshire Patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives. Ah, yes; but, when he dies, will not the fat be all in the fire!"" ""The editor of the-says he almost scorns to deny our charges, 'they are so utterly ground- less.' We believe he generally scorns to deny ' groundless' charges. He prefers confining hima^f to the denial of true ones."" "" The editor of the SouUiern Democrat wants to know what makes us so smart. If we are smart,, it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid ?cant help it."" ""A democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down. No doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well."" The subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented joke,?where there is a lack of truth as well as of wit:? ""An English paper says that a superbly oma* mented whip was one of the presents made to the Princess Royal of England on her late wedding-day. We are not told whether the bridegroom, upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride, looked scared or not. The richest part of the whip was the butt?so we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either."" There are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the Republican wit for the unchivalrous Irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour. Here are some of them:? ""John Mitchel says, in his Southern Ciiizen,thsX this country ' needs a rattling war.' She certainly does not need any more rattling Irishmen."" ""John Mitchel, the Irishman, is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the Hon. John Bell in the U.S. Senate. He is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with Macbeth, 'stop that dreadful Bell.'"" We thought the quotation was from 'Othello'; but they have probably a new Shakspeare in Louisville. The sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words. Again:? "" John Mitchel, who made his escape from Botany Bay, should remember that wheu he abuse* fugitive slaves, he abuses himself."" "" John Mitchel is by this time in Europe. We are rid of him. If he could have had his way, we should Ijave been rid by him."" The ladies, of course, come in for a large share of our wit's notice :? "" The more our ladies practise walking, the more graceful they become in their movements. Those ladies acquire the best carriage who don't ride ia one."" ""A graceful correction.?'The proper study of mankind is woman'?Punch. Woman is certainly wonderfully constructed; we have always loved to study her and get her by heart. Our first lessons were delightful, but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive."" ""A Kentucky editor says that among other presents, the ladies have sometimes given us scissors. Oh, yes, some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors, accompanying the gift with the old motto?' we part to meet again.' Let those beware who, like our ugly neighbour, would come between."" "" A Miss Way advertises that she will debate woman's rights with a Kentucky lawyer in that city, after which she will make a grand balloon ascension from Congo Square.?Exchange. Does she propose to take the Kentucky lawyer up with her? Or does she mean to throw him sky high in the argument and then go up after him in her balloon?"" ""Brigham Young says, in one of his late manifestoes, that' the great resources of Utah are her women.' It is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi* resources."" The last of the half-dozen, and the concluding maxim in the book, may be profitably read on both sides of the water:? "" Oftentimes the ' fastest' young women an th* most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption."" With these specimens of the Prenticeana, our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean, and how it is appreciated by the maker of it. We will only add, that he has annexed a very great number of "" Joe's,"" committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general, ready to take all that is worth having, and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers.The Poet of the Breakfast Table. SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1872. LITERATURE By Oliver Wendell Holmes. (Routledge & Sons.) We have had the Autocrat and the Professor, and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the Poet, and again instructs the world, and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour. We cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded. It would have been as well, perhaps, to have ended by a grand display of fireworks; but the Poet, like the Autocrat and Professor, has his own way with his own means, and ends tranquilly. The Breakfast-Table Series is now complete. Its fault is its extreme length. The Poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closely-printed pages of prose and verse. If he leaves pleasant memories, they are also somewhat confused. ""Ne quid nimis"" is as useful a maxim as ""Pas trop de zele."" The Poet gives us too much of one thing; and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely, that such excess is good for nothing, he leaves, with his memories of pleasure, sensations of fatigue. There are fourteen persons at the Breakfast Table. The opposite ends are occupied by the Landlady and the Capitalist. On one side are the Poet, the Scarabee (a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined), a Man of Letters, a Master of Arts, a Young Girl (who writes stories for periodicals, and who is called Scheherazade), and ""the Lady."" On the other side are Dr. B. Franklin (no connexion with the older owner of the name), the Astronomer, the Member of the Haouse (as the Legislator calls himself), the Registrarof Deeds, the Salesman, and That Boy. The last-named is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community. He turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted; though, perhaps not so often as he is wanted, and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden pop-gun when people are getting prosy, which, whether it gives forth only a report, or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull, is entertaining and neverintrusive ?quite the contrary. In this company, the Poet speaks as he likes, and makes his companions speak after the same fashion?that is to say, after his own humour, and not according to their own natures. They are, however, not out of character ; but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself, he is, of course, not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries. The Poet, nevertheless, is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings, and with doings to match. The following are among very numerous examples :?"" It ain't just the thing to grease your ex with the ile of vitriol; the wheel of progress will soon stick fast, if you do."" Again : "" It is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle. Cotton Mather was miserable all his days, I am afraid, after that entry in his diary, ' This day, Dr. Sewele was chosen President, for his piety.1"" We may observe, by the way, that there are two prejudices which seem immortal. Americans believe that there are no hs in England, and Frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs ! However, we could match the good-looking Landlady of the Poet's boarding-house, from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out, ""with an unmistakable expression, conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood, to the effect that while there is life there is hope.'' The daughter of this lady is quaintly said ""to have married well to a member of th*3 postmedical profession, that, namely, which deals with the mortal frame, after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave."" Among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the Order of Things, and who remarks, "" I hope to do some sound thinking in Heaven,?if I ever get there !"" Fanciful, too, is the division of one-story, two-story, and three-story intellects. The first is described as a fact-collector, and nothing more; the twostory men are those who compare, generalize,? and reason; but the three-story individuals are men of imagination, and are far-sighted. They have skylights over their miuds, through which illumination reaches them from Heaven. The ground-floor men have only stores of books, and cannot be said to know how to use ?further than lending?them. We approve of the Old Master's criticism on returning from a concert, although it seems to have been borrowed. ""I don't like your chopped music, any way. That woman, ?she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societies?Florence Nightingale, ?says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks, and the music you jpow/ieZ out isn't. Not that exactly, but something like it. I have been to hear some music pounding."" After describing the concert, with much humour, he adds:?"" 'I like to hear a woman sing, and I like to hear a fiddle sing, but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvils!?don't talk to me, I know the difference between a bull-frog and a wood-thrush, and?' Pop! went a small piece of artillery. . . . That Boy was in his seat, looking demure enough!"" The Master refers to a ""line of anxious and conscientious effort, which I saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us; the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our Great Organ,?that Himalayan home of Harmony which you are to see and then die, if you don't live where you can see and hear it often."" There is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests; namely, "" I thank God that a great many people believe a great deal more than I do. I think, when it comes to serious matters, I like those who believe more than I do better than those who believe less."" There is no doubt that this is a general feeling. We endorse the sentiment, as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words : "" It is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs, if he does it so that others may make anything out of it. If he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists, he may as well let it alone."" In quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the Breakfast Table, we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water. Nevertheless, the smoothness, polish, and cleanliness of the pebble, after all, indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly, and that it may be good to taste now and then, but not altogether to drink by pailfuls, or to live upon, to the exclusion of other liquids. The character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the Young Girl, who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper, the Weekly Bucket, ""which has no bottom, and it is her business to fill it."" The poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions, passions, mysteries, plots, and graces of style, in stories always ending and always beginning, for the wages of a maid-of-all-work, and no recognition or thanks from the public :? "" Poor little body! poor little mind ! poor little soul! She ia one of that great company of delicate, intelligent, emotional young creatures who are waiting, like that sail I spoke of, for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms, ?love, the right of every woman,... and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench, a chain to fasten them to it, and a heavy oar to pull day and night."" The Poet thinks the toiling Scheherazade of the Weekly Bucket never had a lover, "" or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion "" as she does in a ""fantasia"" from a story of hers, 'The SunWorshipper's Daughter,' which she wrote for the Bucket. Here is a sample :? Kiss mine eyelids, beauteous Morn, Blushing into life newborn ; Lend me violets for my hair, And thy russet robe to wear, And thy ring of rosiest hue Set in drops of diamond dew ! Kiss my lips, thou Lord of Light, Kips my lips, a soft Good Night: Westward sinks thy golden car, . Leave me but the evening star, And my solace that shall be, Borrowing all its light from thee ! We may now rise from the Breakfast Table, leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at that well-furnished board."

88,B6106,['8625569'],"Maru Lyndon; or, Revelations of a Life: an Autobiography. New York, Strange & Towns- I end; London, Low & Co. | This is a story written by a woman as a protest against the social grievances of which, as she conceives, women have an especial cause of ? complaint:?these are the legal tyranny of husbands, and the difficulty for a woman to obtain '? cheap and easy divorce. This being the text, I it is not difficult to imagine that the authoress ' makes out a strong case of special pleading. j Mary Lyndon, the heroine, is a strong-minded woman,?many, many degrees ''above proof;"" ! she is also a victim and a martyr to all j the complicated distresses that can torment ' a susceptible female; but out of them all '' she comes forth triumphantly an "" emanci? pated woman,"" offering herself as an example ; and a leader to her sex. For our own part, we ! must confess, that upon closing the book we had j come round to the verdict of the sagacious Old1' ham jury, on the trial of a man for killing his ' j wife, ""that he had served her right."" Most ' ' readers will, we fancy, feel unfeigned compas! sion for Mr. Albert Hervey, who, for some sin [\ in a previous state of existence, is sentenced to become the husband of Mary Lyndon. The authoress is not without talent, but she chokes i ; all sympathy in her readers by the hard, arro( ' gant, dogmatical, self-complacency with which ' \ she puts herself forward. The book is written ' , in the worst style of American bad taste,?full , ; of pedantry and fine writing. The story is one j that, simply told and written in a better spirit, P might have been made not only interesting but profitable, for it touches upon many deeply ., j interesting points in the secret and social life of women; but, as it stands, it is only redeemed from being absurd by being detestable. The heroine begins with her early childhood, and goes through all the miseries that can beset a child, for the purpose of shoving how ignorant, foolish, and bigotted were all the people placed in authority over her. They treat her wrong? they feed her wrong?they clothe her wrong? they teach her wrong,?and she has to find herself in every thing; in fact, from her own account of herself, she seems to have been sent into the world like a bottle of patent medicine, labelled and attested to cure every imaginable female complaint, social or physical. Dissatisfied with the religious teaching she receives from her parents, she becomes a Quaker; and going to visit some Quaker friends she receives an offer from a man to whom she conceives a violent antipathy at first sight, and accepts him. Her account of the matter is, that "" his friends pleaded and besought her to marry him,"" and m "" a whirl of persuasions, that literally made me dizzy, I consented.My time was well nigh come, when Fate met me in the path of life, and I fell on my face and worshipped. A young man, such as I had seen in my daydreams, was introduced to me by Hervey. I loved,?and I awoke to the consciousness of living death. The hours I spent with my friend, whose sphere was a constant beneficence to me, were white-winged moments, such as make our ideal of Heaven: my heart sprang to him, as the flower lifts its petals to the warm sunlight."" In spite of this, she keeps her engagement, and marries Hervey,?and "" does her duty"" by him in a style that would make any husband's blood curdle in his veins at the prospect of what might have been his lot had the gods given him such a wife! She of course, as a pendant to her own portrait as a model wife and victim, paints her husband in conjugal colours that rival the superfluous blackness of an illustrious personage who must not be named to ears polite. After a while she separates from him, gives lectures at a Lyceum, and takes up a highly platonic attachment to an exquisite transcendentalist, "" with a face fair and beautiful as a babe's, ?his complexion was the rose and lily shining through a skin that was the transparent medium of hereditary scrofula.He stood radiant as the rose and pearl of a sea-shell?the blessed moon raining her silver sheen on his waving and golden hair?his broad forehead shining with unearthly lustre?his beaming eyes looking up as if in most calm and wise and loving worship.I said, ' I hope you have had a pleasant evening.'?' All evenings (he replied) are pleasant in the depths of being, when we feel our oneness with the Infinite,'"" &c. &c. The conversation continues much longer in a similar strain,?he ""looking into her being with the spell of a sweet and serene strength"";? mesmerizes her, we suppose, as she adds, ""calmly and silently I seemed to settle into the inmost of my life, till I rested as on the downy bosom of bliss""!! This remarkable man dies. The lady's husband wishes her to return to him, but she declines, as it would hurt her conscience ""to be a legal harlot"": she therefore remains ""a sad, separate wife,"" emancipates herself at last from all the limited liabilities of the female sex, and takes a regular degree as a homoeopathic physician, practising the watercure also, by which she obtains at length money, fame, and, strangely enough, respectability;? she blooms out also into a celebrated authoress; and discovers, in a highly distinguished editor, the ideal husband who would be necessary to the completion of her moral being; and, after the interchange of more than a hundred pages of love letters, which are all given at full length, finally, she resolves to obtain a divorce, if she can, from her husband; and if she cannot, to live with the man of her choice ""as his wife without the legal sanction"": however, to save the ""punctuaties,"" as the Chinese call them, the original husband applies for a divorce; and she, telling Mr. Vincent that ""if her love should ever lead her from him she must go,"" and, making a few other stipulations, consents to appoint ""a day for the ceremony"";?and the book concludes amid the same profusion of fine words and self-complacent arrogance which prevail in the beginning. If women can only be ""emancipated"" at such a cost of all that is ""pure, lovely, and of good report,""?of all that has ever been regarded as having "" any virtue or any praise,""?both men and women will, we trust, decline to pay the price."

We are at a loss whether to praise Miss Wakeman for vividness of imagination, or for a photographically accurate description of a real life. Did tLis charwoman, with her magnificent patience and loya:ty to her children, ever really exist ? After all, it does not greatly matter. In the pages of this book at least she is absolutely real. Her's was a sad &tory, far sadeer than she knew. But she never repined, and accepted what she took to be the ineritaLle, with that fatalism which is not uncommon among the poor. Miss Wakeman writes sympathetically and yet fairly, condemning nothing and condoning nothing. She has given us a notable book, notable even at a time when slum literature is rather running to seed. The Autobiography has no ""purpose,"" no sociological creed to expound. It is simply a faithful picture of life among a certain class of those who are, half cart lessly, half contemptuously, styled "" the poor."" The book is so good, that it is a pity that phonetic enthusiasm has led Miss Wakeman to write buch words as Iprivilij."" This morbid craving for accuracy at all costs provokes us to point out that a charwoman would hardly speak of being II conversant with the clarsses.""The Autobiography of a Charwoman. As Chronicled by Annie Wakeman. (Macqueen.) There is an obvious difficulty suggested by the form of composition of this volume, and it is not easy to distinguish between the autobiographer and the chronicler. The subject is the life and experiences of a metropolitan charwoman, one Mrs. Dobbs. Her history is told with very little restraint and much dialogue; and the narrative throughout is expressed in a form which is meant to represent the cockney dialect. There is a considerable amount of talent devoted to the composition, but it would be hard to say that it represents successful literary exertion. It may be conceded that the character described is a peculiar one, that with many good points it illustrates some quaint ethics, and that moral shortcomings are associated with much amiability and gentleness. But there is some sense of fatigue in reading the volume, aud it can hardly be thought that the charwoman's life has received the most appropriate or interesting form of expression. The book may, however, be spoken of as a curious variety in fiction, and as one which merits attention."

The author of ' Tim' has many friends. Weak or strong, 'Tim ' was a sympathetic book, the book of a man who would deal gently with human kind, especially with the more fragile, sensitive specimens of it. Just such another is this new story, but the materials and situations are entirely different. ' All That Was Possible' deals very fearlessly with a difficult subject, and though not a great, nor even a remarkable book, there is at least one strong thing about itthe proof it gives that the absence of prudery need abate no jot of refinement. There is so little story in it-there is only a situation, and its, perhaps, natural outcome-that it would be hardly fair to reveal it. It is enough to say that the heroine, whose letters to a friend tell all there is of it, is a woman who has known many difficulties, and has had what is known as a "" past."" Mr. Sturgis's point of view is that it has not coarsened her, that she remains, or rather grows more and more, a woman of sensitive, aspiring nature. But the past dogs her footsteps, then drags her back, and will not let her come into social line with those who are in no way her moral superiors. It is a pathetic picture. What Mr. Sturgis's intention was, in giving this extract from her life, we cannot pretend to say decisively. But assuredly it was not to cry judgment on the sinner, or triumphantly to show how the doors of respect must inevitably and for ever be shut on her."

(Trubner and Uo.) -'eat species of American humour which finds its chief exponent in Max Adeler is, in 'Being a Boy,' diluted down to a strength and flavour suitable to childish palates. The book before us treats of the ordinary episodes in the life of a New England boy much in the style ofI 'Out of the Hurly-burly,' and is similarly illustrated with a running commentary of theatrical sketches andl marginal pictures. It is intended to be humorous, but the humour is somewhat languid, as witness one or two spebnimens:-"" Nothing could make a boy, who cared anything for his appearance, feel flatter than to be run over by the broad tire of a cartwheel.

And who that has striven ardently, and laboured honestly, has lived in vain, if it be only for a brief morning hour .'""' The following sketch of various classes ""f women is drawn to the life:? "" Some amongst us there aro to whom life has been a rough soil; they go through it without being loved, and, what is worse, without being able sincerely to love any one. The frostiness of thc air around them chills thc warmth in their breasts; they become bitter and hard ; and as they can produce no flowers, they turn themselves into rods. They cannot leave virtue and beauty at peace, and they quarrel with beauty and weakness. Let us hope that by the light of a moro friendly sun, the tree of their life shall put foi th new buds, and thal they shall receive and give forth gladness. Others there are, iind they are many, whom nature has Modally provided foi ; tiny are good and amiable; they love virtue ; but the world and temptation, unwise counsellors, and their own hearts' weakness, make them fall. The best heall becomes soiled by unworthy desires and low pleasures. Fallen angels! many are there anion*, them who weep bitter tears over the grave of their own innocence, and these may one day arise in renewed virtue. Others there aro who overlay its h-.*s with flowers and mirth; over these weep the angels of heaven. .Many chers are there also whom lianne ?iud fortune made for temptation, but friendly stars have kept watch over them. Their hearts were early attached by a jure love, and a protecting home closed around them liken Midsummer bower. Theil joys and their sorrows are alike innocent, and all their intercourse? with their fellow creatures is peaceful. No one hates thom, and, what is more tranquillizing, no one loves them more or differently to what the Cospel permits. They live loved and honoured, and general opinion calls them patterns iind examples, lint these quietly happy one*, these untried ones, how often do they pass heavy judgments on those who, in an atmosphere ditferent to their own, have fio/en their hearts, or scorched their wings. They fancy that they have a light to despise them; and yet it is possible, after all, that they aro in no way superior to then), except in being happier. Others also are there, thank (ind !? and my heart warms in thinking that 1 know and love such?who, neither step-children nor favourites of nature and fortune, tempted or not templed bylife, resemble each other nevertheless in this, that they never let anything dim the celestial mirror in their souls. Pure themselves, and hating all evil, yet they pity and purdon those who sin. A heaven of pure compassion lies in their glance, and through it only does the guilty one read his judgment. (Sood, true, wise, patient, alfcctiouate, they do not permit themselves to be disturbed by human weakness or severity: they go tranquilly on their way ; iliey have a light within them that guides them, and that warmly, beneficently beams around them. They understand how to compassionate those sorrows they have themselves never felt; and when they stiller, they can yet smile joyfully on others. Like the hird of paradise, they hover onwards over the earth, without disfiguring their wings with its dust, and by their loveliness they entice others to follow on their heaven ward dight. And now hack again-well ! but I had nearly forgotten thc fifth and most populous class of women, and thus, with them, nearly shut myself out of the creation. I do not know how j better to designate them than as ' the hannie.*.*.' We, its members, aro as numerous iis the potatoe, and come, like it, all over the vvoild. We are the world's household fare, and the world would go on badly without us. We fill the room, and yet deprive nobody of a place; we neutralize the warring elements of life, which without us would destroy one another. We are produced by the ju.-te milint, and this our element we seek to diffuse over the world. We call exultation folly, and Sappho a mad-woman. We go to church and to the opera, and don't wish to he much noticed. We take from life exactly what life will give us, iind are contented; we put our houses in order, salt our meat according to established rule; speak moderately good or ill of our neighbour, think only its much as is necessary, and beat down the price of every thing that is much praised or greatly in demand ?in one word we are what arc called 'cipud people,"" and keep the world in equipoise. We sing best this J good song? Tralliiln, tfiillnlii, trallii, trail; Tiiilliila. triillitla, trallom !"" The following scene between Adelaide and lier betrothed vvill give the reader an insight into the character of both :? "" When these amiable women were gone, Count Alarik said: 'The impression made hy personal beauty, is generally acknowledged ; I am the hist who would wish to deny the beneficent inlluence of beauty on the mind, its bewitching power on the heart, hut what works equally with this, and deeper and more beneficially, aro the qualities we hiive just had an opportunity of admiring in Mrs. L. and her daughters, That fine proportion in thc development of the powers of the soul, that clear uiiderstaniiin.:, that precision and order in tho expression and di livery of opinions which instantly muk"" them coii,pr.hen*ii>!ca;'.d clear, these make on mc an impre* mn, c-unl to that of beaut v ; ti:i* colouring of the sou!, it is true, reveals itself clovver, but at the mme time il is not s:> pciishiib!e as that of the body.' And so saying he looked at Adel,lido, whose beautiful under-lip poi,tefl pettishly. * To be very beautiful is a temptation,' continued Count Al.uiis. 'One is s.i ea-ily led in youth to think that in one""* appearance one possess, -s a tie isiire, rich enough to give happiness lo a whole hie. The world moves so joy fully, so pleasantly for tho young beauty, so that it is diilicult for her to seize the seriousness of lifo.' 'And why this seriousness, why must it bc so important to st he it .' asked Adelaide. ' l?ecau*e a human being is called to something more than being merely a flower or ii butterfly ; as such, it is possible to please, to charm, to call forth approbation ; but never esteem nor true love,' Ade!.lid.* looked oppressed, and furs rose to lier eyes. - J.if,. ;,- so pleasant!' said she. ' Cod has given us joy and Iil'e ; why shall we rn i enjoy his gifts? Ah, let us, let us be joyful '.' ' Life has higher ;ind weightier interests.' said Count Alarik with deeper earnc-tness, 'iind which but ill agree with a thoughtless enjoyment of its pa*sing pleasures."" 'There are,' said Countess Augusta,'weighty and important duties to be performed ; man must nut live for himself alone -* 'What do you mean, then,'asked Adelaide earnestly, half anxious, half laughing, * with your importance and your duties ? Is it something out of the llomau history that one must resemble, to be ii human being?' * * Count Alarik looked at lier with an extraordinary emotion. She stretched her hand to him with the nio.-t engaging charm, and said : ?Let me be glad in life and in death! Cod is good; he intends good to us all in joy as in sorrow ; . why should we not ho glad ? Let me not see this gloomy seriousness!"" Count Alarik did not answer ; he pressed the snow white hand to his lips, followed Adelitide with his eyes during the whole evening, but remained silent and thoughtful. Adelaide was grave for a moment, but soon returned to her usual liveliness, and laughed, sung and played with the little ones.'' The description of ii Swedish spring, and its awakening influence on nature and cn man, isa pleasant and life-like picture :?? "" It is spring in the north, and all the town-dwellers iire bidden iis guests to the rural festivity.

Little is known, however, of her personal history, and it is to be regretted that her English translator has not taken the trouble to collect a few particulars concerning the life of an author who occupies so remarkable a position. We believe Miss Bremer was born to affluence; but troubles have fol leu heavily on her family, and reduced her in the spring of life to a state of dependence upon her friends, who move in the best circles of the capital. Her genius has thus been prompted to exertion by adversity, and many touching allusions to her own circumstances may be found scattered through her productions. She resides chiefly at Stockholm. Tlie secret ot her success lies in that truthfulness ?>f delineation which, whatever form it takes, or in v. hat ever manner it makes itself manifest, is always si'.ru to strike home to the heart of a people. She m\es nothing to art, and everything to the depth aud seriousness of a resolute purpose. She is the least .skilful ol all living novelists. She has no notion of consiructiiii' a narrative on anv inlellig;i;.e principle of arrangement; she never dreams of < >mhveiing a series (tl*incidents in natural sequence. Willi her, the end arul aim of thc design is to work out thoronuhly and sincerely the whole passion of the subject h fore her, without embarrassing her progress willi any reference to what has gone before, or what is likely to follow. How she succeeds in raising tho edifice and finally roofing it, must be a grave puzzle to the 'aesthetic' critics of Germany ; for she may be fairly compared to an architect uho builds a house without scaffolding. Vet her looks arc, nevertheless, solid and symmetrical in relation to their ultimate object, and, like all truths lound*.*] in strong feelings and fixed conviction, have an innate energy in them that overrules criticism. Her novels are not. novels of plot or costume, hut of character and observation. lier knowledge of human nature is profound?ol' human nature as it is dewhmed in the world, and acted upon by worldly influences. She paints society with a wisdom rarely brought to bear upon domestic scenes; and she unveils with such clearness and courage the mixed emotions that throb beneath the surface, that the reader derives from the reality of h.-r pictures a sort of artificial experience of life. The volumes before us contain two talcs, or, more properly, a family chronicle divided into two parts. The faults which were so prominent in Miss Brewer's former publications are even more conspicuous in this The interest is broken up and distributed amongst a gre.it variety of persons; the narrative is a progress through a succession of events rather than a compact story; the individuals who move in it are strongly contrasted, and some of them are drawn in sheer wilful excess ; in the matter of plot there is a tendency to extravagance and* romance which is strangely irreconcilable with the good sense and cultivated taste of the author ; and if we add that there is too much German mysticism, and too much of that so-called art-enthusiasm which deals so largely in loose abstractions as to bc nearly unintelligible, we shall have discharged our conscience of every grain of objection that has settled upon it during a careful perusal of these volumes. But how large a balance of praise remains to oe counted up! The minute fidelity of the details; the vivid distinctness with which every mental struggle and secret emotion is traced; the moral beauty and womanly purity which steadily illuminate thc narrative; and thc calm Christian philosophy out of which all its earnest lessons of truth anil justice, and resignation, and serene wisdom, arc drawn, must receive implicit admiration on all hands. The style, occasionally perhaps a little too florid, is generally eloquent and appropriate; and, much as she crowds thc scene with figures, Miss Bremer possesses beyond any other living writer of her cUss, the power of realizing to the imagination every individual she introduces. There is scarcely a single person in her tumultuous groups that does not stand out palpably in his lning lineaments. The President's Daughters occupies only the first volume. Nina, the youngest of the family, engrosses the remaining two. The President is ""a widower with four daughters, and we are introduced on the very threshold of the narrative to this fair household, on whose fortunes the whole story revolves. The narrator is tbe governess to whose charge the orphan* are consigned. "" The first wat a tall, thin figure, with a remarkably plain countenance, and stiff and unpleasing demeanour. She curtseyed coldly and reservedly, and was presented by her lather as * Edi*.' * Adelaide' mas then named, and a yoong, lovely creature .approached me, and beaming with smiles, blushingly embraced me. I thought I had never seen anything more bewitching. ??? Chickens! chickens! my little chickens. Nina and Mina!' now exclaimed the President, and lifted in his anas two of tbe sweetest little beings in the world. Lighthaired, Mae-eyed, rosy-lipped, omlcately-formed were they; and so like each other, that in the bsginoina I could not possibly distinguish them. I was enchanted wah these | lovely ttttlc chSldreo, aad desired nothing more tata to make scqitaiaftance with them. The President did all thal 4?esaMs?**lssj skis afc***; ts* tivy ***** gravely and bairne ts* sstsasksra, sjsylrtsflssfessiftji*^ feat* legged, stiff-armed figures, which I cut out of cards, mediators between us. At sight of these the little ones began as it were to thaw, and presently I wag covered with their carts, their dolls, and their castles, as well as being informed, in confidence, that they thought mv nose very large. "" In the meantime I paid attention to the President, who was conversing with his two elder daughters. Adelaide related to her father the events of the day?the dinner company and the dishes. Edla added a remark or two, and even sometimes upon her sister's words. The President marvelled much at the mixture of * chicken and cauliflower.' For my part, I could not take my eyes from Adelaide; she struck me as indescribably beautiful and pleasing. Her countenance was more round than oval; the forehead high and finely arched; the nose small and exquisitely formed, whilst a"" pair of large dark blue eyes beamed with joy and good-heartedness, and the roses of health tinged both her lips and her cheeks. Her smile, nay, her whole manner, was such as we ascribe to a cherub. She was ot* middle height; her figure finely moulded and her carnage noble ; her neck, her arms and hands, dazzlingly white and of the most perfect form. Her head, which""was adorned with rich chesnut-brown hair, she carried a little thrown back, which gave her an appearance of haughtiness, nay, almost of arrogance ; nor was this contradicted by her manner, however softened that might be by an expression of sincere sweetness and good-will. Beside this brilliant figure her sister showed like a shadow, and I suspected that it was her own sense of this which made her so gloomy."" The foundations of the subsequent interest are visibly laid in these portraits. Kdla, plain, reserved, and melancholy, has no share in her father's affections. The worthy President is a man of conventions, and, without being conscious of an injustice, is devotedly fond of the beautiful Adelaide. A morose spirit is gradually engendered in the heart of the neglected Edla, and from ont; step to another,! the distance between her and lier father widens into distrust and aversion. Passing over a long interval, let us come to the sequel. It is evening; the company juc assembled in the drawing-room; and Adelaide has just sung a song about * Home.' The subject is a dangerous one. 44 * A home !' said Count W. softly, as he crossed his arms on his breast and bowed his head ;4 a home, with a beloved wife?it is in truth a heaven!' 444 Yes,' said the President, * and with an amiable daughter, who in everything seeks to please her father, and provides so tenderly for his comfort and enjoyment.' 44 The tone in which this was said, and the sharp glance he cast upon Edla, caused ali eyes to turn upon her. She coloured violently. I am certain that the President immediately repented his hasty and unfriendly words ; but what was said, was said, and Edla's embittered feelings ro.e hastily to a decree which I should have thought with her to be impossible. She turned to Count Alarik and said : 44 4 You have compared home to a heaven, do you know what else it may resemble ?' 44 lie looked questioningly upon her, and she continued: ?4 A house of correction.' 44 I shuddered at these bitter words. The President started so that the tea was shaken out of his cup. Count Alarik regarded Kdla seriously and reproachfully. 44 Kdla continued with violent excitement: * There is an overseer, and there are prisoners. The fonner assigns work to the latter, and when they neglect it, he punishes them. He exacts the fulfilment of duties, but gives neither the tenderness nor the joy which makes* duty light. But why complain of it V she added casting up a glance full of anger and despair, * the lesser life is but a counterpart of the higher, and home is an image of the world's order.' 44 i Miss Kdla!' said Count Alarik warningly. 44 The President was violently affected, but restrained himself, and turning to Count Alarik, said with a specious calmness?4 Is it not wonderful, my dear Count, that man so often embitters his own days, and then complains impatiently at the suffering he has himself causer) .' My late \ wife--' (the President became moved, as he almost always did when he named her); * poor Frederica made me ! s the happiest of husbands ; if she had lived she would like- i \ wise have made me a happy father, for she would have |, taught her daughters that mildness and concession which j alone can gain love; she would have taught them to deserve . ^ a father's tenderness, who desired nothing better than to see all his children happy around him, and to clasp them a to his bosom/ I? "" The President was moved, and evidently ready for reconciliation. Not so Edla; the long pent-up poison of bitterness was boiling up in her. 444 Love alone/ she said, * wins return of love. That father who gave his child life and did not give it tenderness, and does not give it joy, has no right to make any claims.' ""'No right?' said the President with warmth, and too excited to be able to weigh his words. ' No right! But vou! you can never be wron<*, you must always he right, but it I have no right to claim from you some compliance and obedience, I have at least a right to free myself and my house from discomfort and disquiet For the last three years you have not given me one single joyful day ; you have yourself evidently shown that you despise your father's counsel, and dislike his house; if in future this does not become other than it has been heretofore, then it is best that?that we part!' ""' It will then be my affair,' said Edla coldly and growing pale,' to give place. I shall soon no longer give discomfort or disquiet to any one.' "" She arose, laid aside her work, and was about to go. Count Alarik seised her arm. ' Child !' said he softly,* no precipitance! Miss Edla, you are wrong; bethink yourself!' 44 She stopped and looked wildly at him. ' What shall I do?' she asked. M* Yon have been wrong. Confess it Beg your father's forgive neaii' M * No I* saki abe violently, as she sought to disengage her arm; bat Count Alarik held it fast, and eondncting her aside, spoke earnestly to ber in a low voice."" # The bitterness of ?dla*s life is now converted into a shape of real suffering.

"" 4 You !' said the President, not without bitterness,4y? have more important things to attend to;?remain you wiri your studies, your books, your Plato.' 44 Elda was hurt, and made a movement as if to draw herself back ; but conquering herself, she weut near, and begged with tearful eyes : 44 4 Let me go with you?let me take care of papa! I will willingly leave everything for that.' 44 4 I do not exact,' said the President coldly,4 such great sacrifices from my children ; I do not ask that they should leave their pleasures for my comfort. I did so before,perhaps ; but I have seen I was wrong. Remain you wuk your books, Edla.' 44 This moment was decisive. I trembled for fear thr Edla's wounded feelings might prevent her from making a new trial on the President's heart; I feared that this moment would for ever divide father and daughter from each other. But Edla drew herself a little farther off, and said mildly? ??4 And if my books admonish me of my duty ? And i that goodness papa has shown me has made this duty dearer to me than everything else?' She stopned; the President said nothing. ""41 shall not ask more,' she continued ; ' I shall not be obtrusive. Papa does not love me, and I know that I have not been in the right?I hare not deserved to be loved; but?but I would if I could make up-.' She stopped again. 44 * The fault has been mutual, Edla,' said the President with cold friendliness. ' I have no right to expect love from you, when I have not made you happy; and it would be egotism of me were I now to avail myself of what your sentiment of duty offers.' 444 Oh, this is hard?very hard!' said EdUwithdeej pain, but without bitterness. She drew herself back, and was about to leave the room. . 44 4 Edla!' called the President hastily, as he turned and stretched his arms towards her; 4 Edla, my child.con* here!'

93,B3331,['4416811'],"MARY BARTON.* IT has seldom fallen to our lot to read a work written with more earnestness of purpose, or more feeling than ""' Mary Barton: a Tale of Manchester Life."" It excels in pathos and descriptive power. There may not be the little touches of humour or the sly insights into nature of Charles Dickens, there is not the child-like simplicity of Andersen, but there is surpassing energy and vitality. It is a painful book to read, but it is also impossible to do so without being benefited by the perusal. *Mary Barton: a Tab oat M chester Life. In 2 vols. Chapman and Hall. Every scene is indeed a touch of nature, almost sanctified by its wholesome truthfulness. The meeting of the friends in "" Green Heys Fields,"" the earnest self-willed John Barton, the future Chartist, an intellect struggling against poverty and want of proper information. George Wilson, a working man, yet in his own way a philosopher and a philanthropist; the two wives weeping and condoling for one poor sheep that has gone astray, a pretty pert young maiden. the heroine Mary, and her lover, hard-working, steady, and "" gallant"" Jem Wilson; ""gallant 1"" the reader will exclaim, can a workman be gallant ? yes, read that most stirring scene of a fire in a factory, in which Jeni Wilson saves so many lives at the peril of his own, and gllantry will not be denied to rude coarse men, akin to that of any knight's most glorious deeds. A tea-party of the poor, pleasantly sketched, is followed by a scene full of pathos, the sudden death of Mrs. Barton. One of the ties which bound John Barton to the gentle humanities of earth being thus loosened, he became more obstinate in his aversion to the rich, and his gloom and his sternness became habitual. The authoress professes to have nothing to do with political economy or the theories of trade, she says that she merely wishes to impress what the workman feels and thinks, but she allows the discontented to murmur in prolonged strains without an attempt to chasten the heart or to correct the understanding. Barton rails at all capitalists as being so only through the toil of the poor. This would be staunch communism. There surely must be capitalists or the condition of the poor would be worse than ever. We are told in Scripture that the poor shall never cease out of the land, but we are also told that their expectation shall not perish, and that those who trust, shall be fed and be delivered out of affliction. Further than this we are told that the person of the poor should no more be respected than that of the rich should be honoured, and while it is sinful to oppress and a duty to assist, so also to the poor that will not hear rebuke, their poverty is their destruction. While the father gets more and more involved in Chartist plots, Mary engages herself as an apprentice to a milliner in a little street leading off Ardwick Green, and where she is seen and admired by Harry Carson, son of the opulent mill-owner. The interest of the rivalry of the working-engineer and the young gentleman, is, however, for a time absorbed by passing scenes descriptive of the sore afflictions of the poor. The cellar to which Barton and Wilson repair to carry comfort to a starving family-three or four little children rolling on the damp, nay, wet brick floor, through which the stagnant, filthy moisture of the street oozed up; the fire-place empty and black; the husband dying of typhus, the wife crying in the dark loneliness of the dying man s lair, is appalling in its horrors. These poor people have strange superstitions, too, in the midst of their trying afflictions. Wilson carried home the typhus to his own home, and two children fell victinms to the infection. One is already gone. ""1 Is there any chance for the other one, think you ?"" inquired Mary, who had come upon a Samaritan errand of rather rare occurrence, since she had now the affections of a young gentleman. Alice shook her head, and told with a look that she believed there was none. She next endeavoured to lift the little body, and carry it to its old-accuistomed bed in its parent's room. But earnest as the father was in watching the yetliving, he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead, and sprang gently up, mid took his deadamumbl baod a h in his arm with tender strength, and cred.hm afsid of wakening him. The other chiM Pe logr, louder, with more of effort. Wemun get hDaway from his mother. He cannot die whilst she's wish1 shim.' ""Wishing him ?' said Mary, in a tone of inquiry. Ay ; domoy know what wishing - means ? There's none can die in the am of thoewbo are wishing them sort to tay on earth. The soul o' them s holds them won't let the dyling soul go free; so it has- a hard struggle for the quiet of death. We mun get him away fra' his mother, or he'll have a hard death, poor lile fellow.r So without circumlocution she went and offered to take the sinking child. But the mother would not let him go, and looking in Alice's face with brimming and imploring eyes, declared in earnest whispers, that she was not wishing him, that she would fain have him released from his suffering. Alice and Mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child, whose struggles seemed to increase, till at last his mother said with a choking voice, "" May happen yO'd better take him, Alice; I believe my heart's wishing hiim a' this while, for I cannot, no, I cannot bring mysel to let my two childer go in one day; I cannot help longing to keep him, and yet he sha'not suffer longer for me.' She bent down, and fondly, oh! with what passionate fondness, kissed her child, and then gave him up to Alice, who took him with tender care. Nature's stnrggles were soon exhausted, and he breathed his little life away in peace. Mary, in the pride of her new conquest, discards the young engineer, and refuse his offer of marriage only to repent a moment after, and that so bitterly that she follows up one refusal by another, and loses both lovers at the same time. She is the more confirmed in her resolve in respect to Henry Carson, as he intimated that his intentions had not at first been of an honourable character. The pith of the story hangs upon the events which follow upon the dismissal of the two lovers. The fallen Esther warns Jem Wilson that a fate similar to hers awaits Mary, and in an attempt to prevent this the workman assaults his young master. Not long after this John Barton, worked up to madness by his false notions of the relation of master and workman, shoots Henry Carson with Jem Wilson's gun. The young engineer is tried, and only saved by an alibi. The manner in which Mary Barton declares her preference for the prisoner then at the bar, is a most effective scene. The old man acknowledges his guilt to the father of young Carson, who, at first full of revenge. is at the conclusion made to feel that those who are strong in God's gifts are meant to help the weak, and that a perfect understanding and complete confidence aud love may exist between masters and men- the interests of the one being the interests of all."
94,B2562,"['9027810', '6653685']","The Legend of Jubal, and other Poems. SATURDAY, MAY 16, 7874. LITERATURE GEORGE ELIOT S POEMS. By George Eliot. (Blackwood & Sons.) There are certain developments of the genius of George Eliot for which verse is the only satisfactory medium. Artistic longings and fancies such as abound in 'Romola' and * Middlemarch' can scarcely find adequate expression in prose. In the march of verse and in the effect of recurrent sounds there is something which aids as much the writer in the development of his thought as the reader in its appreciation or retention. Not seldom the continued labour of the author imparts to his work a grace and a significance beyond his expectation, that come upon him almost as a surprise and a revelation. Where no such result is obtained there is a pleasure in the task of polishing to the utmost poetic utterances, which combines the glad service of the worshipper with the mother's delight in attendance upon her offspring. Since the success of the 'Spanish Gypsy' bas shown that verse in the hands of George Eliot is a serviceable and manageable instrument, there is little cause to wonder it is again adopted. The poems in the volume now published deal with that aspiration which takes, in different natures, the form of music, devotion, love. For such themes poetry is the fittest medium. In welcoming George Eliot once more as a poet, however, and in expressing sympathy and admiration for her present production, we are far from implying that we should like to see a large portion of her effort directed to verse. Her case is analogous to that of Scott. No one will now contest the value of Scott's ballad romances. While, however, in his own days Scott had in poetry rivals and superiors, in prose fiction his supremacy was unchallenged. In like manner, the appearance of a poem from George Eliot is a matter of interest, while that of a novel is an affair of highest literary importance. The four principal poems in the volume have already appeared in print in various magazines, English and American. All have a measure of resemblance in the lesson they enforce. In 'The Legend of Jubal' and in 'Armgart' aspiration developes itself through music; in 'Agatha' it finds its utterance in a life of devotion; and in ' How Lisa loved the King' it blossoms into love. After his departure from the presence of his offended God, Cain built a city, in which his offspring dwelt, unaware of the curse of death that was upon them. Idly they laboured, -as a maid who weaves Her hair ia mimic mats, and pauses oft Aud strokes across her hand her tresses soft, Then peeps to watch the poised butterfly, Or little burthened ants that homeward hie. Time was but leisure to their lingering thought, There was no need for haste to finish aught. Accident first revealed the presence in their midst of the grim spectre of death, and a change came over the scene. Each man, feeling the insecurity of his tenure now that ""Death was Lord of Life,"" strove to snatch t?e passing hour. And Work grew eager and Device was born. Chief workers among those stung into activity were the sons of Lamech, in whose family death had made first inroad. Jabal, the eldest son, learned ""to tame the lowing kine,"" to nurse the ""star-browed calves,"" and ""soothe the silly sheep.'' Tubal ""yoked the fire"" And made it roar in prisoned servitude Within the furnace, till with force subdued It changed all forms he willed to work upon. Meanwhile, listening to the clanging symphonies of the beaten and resonant metal, Jubal heard -some melody, Wherein dumb longings inward speech bad found. Long he brooded over the sweet and mingled sounds,? The fluctuant changes of the spoken word. #?*?*? The mother's call, the children's answering cry, The laugh's light cataract tumbling from on high; The suasive repetitions Jabal taught That timid browsing cattle homeward brought; The clear-winged fugue of echoes vanishing; And through them all the hammers rhythmic ring. The result of his meditations was the birth of the lyre. Alone among the hills he practised, until his hand obtained a mastery over the chords. At length, one holiday-tide, he ventured to prove before his companions his new gift. Absorbed at first in this unexpected response to the "" strange thirst"" within them, "" the fateful growth, the unnamed discontent,"" the listeners sat in silence, until the twin sister of music sprang into being:? The youths and maidens both alike long-tressed, By grace-inspiring melody possessed, Rose in slow dance, with beauteous floating swerve Of limbs and hair, and many a melting curve Of ringed feet swayed by each close-linked palm : Then Jubal poured more rapture in his psalm, The dance fired music, music fired the dance, The glow diffusive lit each countenance, Till all the circling tribe arose and stood With glad yet awful Bhock of that mysterious good. Subsequently, Jubal, having taught to others his new-found art, travelled to where ""Eastward the hills touch heaven,"" and remained away until most of those who had known him were dead. He returned to find cities where he had left pastoral valleys. Memory of the benefits he had bestowed survived, however, and the people on the day even of his return were holding a feast in his honour. When the weary grey-haired wanderer claimed to be the Jubal whom they worshipped, the minstrels rose and beat him with their flutes for irreverence, and he who had given mankind its most priceless boon, sought the "" screen of thorny thickets,"" where, alone and untended, he died, cheered only by visions of Song. The close of this striking amplification of the suggestion thrown out in Genesis resembles closely the notion, German in origin, we believe, upon which Mr. Wills founded his ' Man of Airlie.' 'Agatha' depicts the grave, placid, and beneficent existence of a woman, ""halfgrandame and half saint,"" repaying by prayers the assistance she obtains from the villagers among whom she dwells. Prayer to her is a "" way of singing,"" Just as the nightingales pour forth sad songs. Not too sure is Agatha that her intercessions are of much avail:? Nay, I cannot sing : My voice is hoarse, and oft I think my prayers Are foolish, feeble things ; for Christ is good Whether I pray or not,?the Virgin's heart Is kinder far than mine ; and then I stop And feel I can do nought towards helping men. Her simple life, sanctified wholly to the service of her faith, and her warm and gentle creed, that "" would have young things merry,"" are touchingly depicted. 'Armgart' is a dramatic sketch, showing the dominion of the artistic passion over the breast of the singer, who can hold thousands spell-bound by her song, aud the defeat and collapse which follow when, after a brief period of triumph, the voice gives way, and the priceless instrument is worthless. Just as devotion in 'Agatha' and the sound of the lyre in ' Jubal' suffice for all expression of emotion, the voice of Armgart is adequate to all utterance.? "" Poor wretch!"" she says, of any murderess? "" The world was cruel, and she could not sing: I carry my revenges in my throat; I love in singing, and am loved again."" The fretfulnesses, vanities, and anxieties of the artistic temperament have seldom been depicted more forcibly than in this poem. They are subjugated, however, by the absolute "" possession"" which Armgart's art exercises over her nature. Her reasons for rejecting the suit of Graf Dornberg are well given, and the study of artistic fervour and feminine wilfulness is fine as it can be. Armgart's address to the doctor, whose drugs, while curing her illness of throat, have ruined her voice, is thoroughly impassioned:? Yes, thick, thick, thick ! and you have murdered it t Murdered my voice?poison'd the soul in me, And kept me living. You never told me that your cruel cures Were clogging films?a mouldy, dead'ning blight? A lava-mud to crust and bury rae, Yet hold me living in a deep, deep tomb, Crying unheard for ever! O your cures Are devils' triumphs : you can rob, maim, slay, And keep a hell on the other side your cure Where you can see your victim quivering Between the teeth of torture, &c. The lesson of patience Armgart learns at length from the resignation of her musicmaster, an old composer, whose philosophical calm stands in effective contrast with the tumultuous effervescence of youth. ' How Lisa loved the King' catches happily the spirit and something of the note of Provencal song. It transports the reader to a court like that of King Rene, and to a world to which the Golden Age is restored, where Arcadian dreams are realized, and where all pleasures are permissible since all desire is virtuous. What song is to Armgart, music to Jubal, and devotion to Agatha, love is to Lisa, and the manner in which utterance is given to her aspiration is very fanciful and delicate. Of the new poems in the book, * A Minor Prophet' is our favourite. Here George Eliot is on her own territory of humour. Nothing can be cleverer than the opening description; nothing deeper, more subtle, more sympathetic, and more significant than the application. The poem commences? I have a friend, a vegetarian Beer, By name Elias Baptist Butterworth, A harmless, bland, disinterested man, Whose ancestors in Cromwell's day believed The Second Advent certain in five years, But when King Charles the Second came instead, Revised their date and sought another world: I mean?not heaven but?America. A fervid stock, whose generous hope embraced Tbe fortunes of mankind, not stopping short At rise of leather, or the fall of gold, Nor listening to the voices of the time As housewives listen to a cackling hen, With wonder whether she has laid her egg On their own nest-egg. Still they did insist Somewhat too wearisomely on tho joys Of their Millennium, when coats and hats Would all be of one pattern, books and songs AH flt for Sundays, and the casual talk As good as sermons preached extempore. Equally admirable is the description of Elias, in whom ancestral zeal is modified by "" Transatlantic air and modern thought,"" with -hair Brushed back to show his great capacity? A full grain's length at the anglo of the brow Proving him witty, while the shallower men Only seem witty in their repartees. Not that he's vain, but that his doctrine needs The testimony of his frontal lobe. The Millennium of Elias will be reached when men are all vegetarian and practical Science and civilization will bring about the day when "" dogs will all be moral"" and all "" the uglier breeds will fade from memory,"" when Wart-pigs with tender and parental grunts, Wombats much flattened as to their contour, Perhaps from too much crushing in the ark, But taking meekly that fatality ; The serious cranes, unstung by ridicule ; Long-headed, short-legged, solemn-looking curs, (Wise, silent critics of a flippant age); The silly straddling foals, the weak-brained geese Hissing fallaciously at sound of wheels? All these rude products will have disappeared Along with every faulty human type. By dint of diet vegetarian All will be harmony of hue and line, Bodies and minds all perfect, limbs well-turned, And talk quite free from aught erroneous. Sadly our author thinks of the consequences of such a state of affairs. Endowed with that sympathy and pity for error, and that respect for failure, which are the rarest, most unmistakable, and least regarded attributes of the highest genius, she falls into a strain of regret for those who, living in those perfect times,? Will not know half the dear imperfect things That move my smiles and tears?will never know The fine old incongruities that raise My friendly laugh; the innocent conceits That like a needless eyeglass or black patch Give those who wear them harmless happiness; The twists and cracks in our poor earthenware, That touch me to more couscious fellowship (I am not myself the finest Parian) With my coevals. A noble moral indicated iu the line,? Our finest hope is finest memory, ?comes as the close of a poem which, by its gentle teaching, its fine sympathy, and its sad irony, moves one highest admiration. * Brother and Sister' is a tender poem, with some delightful descriptions of rustic scenery, forming an appropriate frame for poetical thought. ' Stradivarius' shows the nobility of art in its mechanical portions even. 'Tis God gives skill, But not without men's hands: He could not make Antonio Stradivari's violins Without Antonio. ?So speaks Stradivarius himself. 'Two Lovers' is in motive a little like the Laureate's poem of 'Circumstance.' 'Arion'gives finely the legend told by Herodotus. The volume in all poetic respects is an advance upon the ' Spanish Gypsy.' In those qualities which, without being indispensable to poetry, supplement and elevate it; in largeheartednesSjtenderness, and humour, it is worthy of the author of ' The Mill on the Floss.' It cannot fail to advance its author's reputation, bringing her nearer our sympathies, as well as placing her higher in our admiration.LITERATURE. The legend of Jbal and other Poemis. By I GeorgeEliot. (London: Blackwood& Sons.) IT is always instructive when a great painter turns sculptor, or a great musician turns dramatist, or a great poet turns novelist, or, as in the present case, a great novelist turns poet; there is always something fresh to be learnt about the powers and the im. pulses of the artist, which have to find a fresh channel for themselves; there is always something to be learnt also about the limits of the old channels, which no longer seem enough. This is so especially in the case of such a personal spontaneous genius as George Eliot, all whose writings are necessary to the complete expression of herself, with whom we are entirely safe from mere echoes of other writers, which express nothing except an over-ambitious sympathy. Even shortcomings have their meaning and their interest when they are visibly due not to any defect of training or elaboration, but to the habitual predominance of other faculties than those which are most helpful to the work in hand. A great thinker cannot wait while fancy and emotion grow up into thought; the thought must always be there; and sometimes the fancy and emotion grow over the thought luxuriantly, and sometimes, though the overgrowth is always healthy, the thought shows through. In the Spanish Gypsy there was a constant incongruity; the whole conception was poetical, and verse was obviously the only appropriate vehicle for the most dramatic movements of the story; but there were long intervals where the action flagged or was positively pushed aside by commentaries and dikcassions, or was overlaid by ornament; and it was hardly a compensation that the commentaries were an overflow of intellec. tual sympathy with the situation, and that the ornaments showed how much diligent and refined observation had fed the writer's imagination of the scenery. The present volume is on a smaller scale than the Spanish Gypsy or most of the author's works in prose, and it contains at least one poem, the eleven sonnets entitled "" Brother and Sister,"" which is all but perfect-more delightful, if possible more classical, than the parallel passages in the Mill o0& tVw Floss. In the novel there is no doubt more human, more concrete individual reality, but in the poem we gain what is even more precious, an unbroken ideal medium, in which what is harsh and grotesqcue is wholly suppressed, in order that what is permanent and beautiful and memorable may appear unalloyed. Nearly every sonnet contains gems like these:""I held him wise, and when lie talked to me Of snakes and birds, and which God loved the best, I thought his know""ldgo marked the boundary Where men grew !iixad, though angels knew the rest."" "" all at home were told the wondrous feat, And how the little sister had fished well. In secret, though my fortune tasted sweet, I wondered why this happiness befell."" ' The little lass had luck,' the gardener said: And so I learned, luck was with glory wed."" ""His years with others must the sweeter be For those brief days he spent in loving me."" If the "" Brother and Sister "" show the superiority of verse over prose for presenting. a subject sub specie aeternitatis, "" Armgart "" shows the superiority of the same instrument for expressing the fulness of passion which the growing reticence of modern civilisation tends to repress, till it is probable that it will ultimately be extinguished like a fire deprived of air"" Bear witness, I am ealm. I road my lot As soberly as if it were a tale Writ by a creeping feuilletonist, and called ' The Woman's Lot; a Tale of Everyday;' A middling woman's, to impress the world With high superfluousness: her thoughts a crop Of chick-weed errors or of pot-herb facts, Smiled at like some child's drawing on a slate. ' Genteel?' '0 yes, gives lessons; not so good As any man's would be, but cheaper far.' ' Pretty?' ' No; yet she makes a flgure fit For good society. Poor thing, she sews Both late and early, turns and alters all To suit the changing mode. Some wi(lower Mlight do well marrying her; but in these days! ' Well, she can somewhat eke her narrow gains By writing, just to furnish her with gloves And droschlkies in the rain. They print her things Often for charity.'-O a dog's life! A harnessed dog's, that draws a little cart Voted a nuisance! "" It is impossible to write with more severity and compression of style, and yet the effusion of feeling would have been excessive in prose. Again, the verse certainly adds lightness and elevation to the bitter gaiety of Leo's answer, when asked whether he expects his music to live when he is dead""Pfui! the time was I drank that home-brewed wine And found it heady, while my blood was young: Now it scarce warms me. Tipple it as I may, I am sober still, and say, ' My old friend Leo, Much grain is wasted in the world and rots: Why not thy handful? ""' On the other hand, the description of Armgart's reception by the house rather convinces us of the insufficiency of prose than of the sufficiency of verse, and there are passages like the invention of butter in "" Jubal,"" where what would have been easy and familiar in prose becomes strange without becoming beautiful inverse; and in ""A Minor Prophet "" there is a puzzling allusion to "" astral cocoa-nuts,"" which exemplifies a rather common fault of subtle and reflective poetry. The writer sees that many things must always be left to the reader to comprehend at half a word, and it is only in popular poetry that a traditional understanding exists to determine which. Of course, the only reason for speaking of such things is that they intrude themselves on the attention less when they have been noticed and explained. It is a pleasanter and more profitable study to compare ""How Lisa loved the Kino,"" with its original in Boccaccio, and see how the modern writer has enlarged and deepened the meaning of the story without impairing its essential simplicity. Boccaccio keeps throughout to the tone of mere kindly courtesy with which well-bred people tell a graceful interesting story. He does not dwell for a moment on the historical position of King Pedro, though the story is a Ghibelline reply to a story of the temperance of King Charles whom Pedro dispossessed, nor on the growth of Lisa's passion, nor upon the spirit in which she accepted her happiness. What might have been seen and heard is enough for him, and out of this he makes one of the best of his prose idylls, and in all that he says, with one exception, George Eliot follows him closely. The justification of, and the originality of her poem is the wealth of brooding feeling which is poured into the space which Boc. caccio has left blank. Tue central point both of the story and of the poem may bo said to lie in the song which tells Pedro the talc of Lisa's hopeless love. Boccaccio is deliciously sweet, and musical, and genuine, but he does not get beyond the shy broken sob of animal feeling and innocent helpless pain; the singer feels the pathos of this side of the situation too much to care to in. tellectualise it; the approaching death of the love-lorn maiden simply measures the ardour of her hopeless passion; whereas in George Eliot the worship of Death be. comes the key.note of four lovely stan zas, of which the last is the clirqax:Tell him, 0 Love, I am a lowly maid, mo nore than any little knot of thyme That lho with careless foot may ofteu tread; Yet lowliest fragrance oft will mount sublime And cleave to things most high and hallowZ1, As doth the fragrance of my life's springtime, My lowly love, that soaring seeks to climb Within his thought, and makei a gentle bliss More blissful than if mine, in being his: So shlall I live in him and rest in Death."" The glorification of Death is of course tho burden of "" Jubal "" it reads throughout almost like an answer to the early numbers of the E arthly Paradise, and the impression is all the stronger because the music of tho answer is so often like an echo of the music of the challenge. In both the dis. cussion is carried on, as it ought to be, rather in accordance with the logic of feeling than the logic of signs. Mr. Morris's contention is that it is precisely when life is at its best that the thought of death poison, it. George Eliot maintains, with Feuerbachs that it is death at a distance which gives life all its value, and death at hand which puts the seal upon life. When Jubal returns in old age and finds his memory worshipped""All was forgotten but the burning need To claim his fuller self, to clhihn the deed That lived away from him, and grew apart, While he, as from a tomb, with lonely heart, Warmed by no meeting gla nee, no hand that pres.se, Lay chill amid the life his life had blessed. What though his song should spread from man's small race Out through the myriad worlds that people space, And make the heavens one joy-diffusing quire ? Still, 'mid that vast would throb) the keen desire Of this poor, aged flesh, this eventide, This twilight soon in darkness to subside; This little pulse of self that, having glowed Through thrice three centuries, and divinely Strowed The light of music through the vague of sound, Ached smallness still in good that had no bound."" After his rejection the solution is:""'Yea, art thou. come again to me, Oreat Song?' The face bent over him like silver night In long-remembered summers; that calm light Of days which shine in firmament. of thouhit, That past unchangeablo, from change Ftill wrought. And there were tones that with tho vision blent: He know not if that gaze the music sent, Or music that calm gaze: to hear, to see, Was but one undivided ecstasy: The raptured senses melted into one, And parting life a moment's freedom won From in and outer, as a little child Sits on a bank and sees blue heavens mild Down in the water, and forgets its limibs, And knoweth nought savo the blue heaven that swims. 'Jubal,' the face mi'd, ' I am thy loved Past, The soul that makes thee one from first to last. I am the Angel of thy life and death, Thy outbreathod being drawing its last breath. Am I not thine alone, a dear dead bride, Who blest thy lot above all men's beside ? Thy bride whom thou wouldst never chang), nor take Any bride living, for that dead oe's sakeo.""' Of course, if any one were foolish enough to attempt to translate this into the logic of signs, he would expose himself to the obvious observation that it is no more in our power to possess ourselves of our whole past than o""' the whole future of our work, and that, therefore, it is idle to teach that we ought to be content to have our past for ourselves, and give up our work to the world: seriously, if we are to expect either for ourselves, we have an equal right to expect both from the liberality of a Power able to do aI)undantly above all that we can ask or think. The fact is, that there are problems presented by the permanent facts of the world which can only receive an objective solution, if at all, from paramount facts which show that the best which we can apprehend in the little that we know is supreme in the much which we do not know in this life; but whatever objective solution we adopt, or whether we despair of any, we need a subjective solution for the subjective pro. blem presented by the alternations of our own moods. Such a solution has never been given more worthily than in ""Jubal,"" and in the glorious lines beginning ""0 may I join the choir invisible,"" which form the Epilogue of the volume, and make the posi. tivist heaven for the first time intelligible and desirable, because for the first time the conception has been lifted above the level of controversy, from which it suffers even more than the majority of religious conceptions, since there are few which are so open to be taunted with unanswerable questions. Indeed, the whole volume is a splendid homage to the great principle of the inherent supremacy of feeling over thought which it is one of Comte's chief merits to have formulated, though be shrank from its legitimate consequences, which is not surprising when we remember whence he took it. And this gives an artistic value and completeness to the poetry of George Eliot which is missing in some measure in her prose works. Though the latter are richer and more varied and more masterly, the writer seems constantly trying to escape into the atmosphere of high impulse and momentary feeling in which the poems move habitually. The love of Lisa is an exquisite satisfaction to the perilous and invincible desire ""With dream fruit dream wishes to fulfil."" Throughout "" Armgart,"" her single-minded impetuosity is contrasted with the essential unexceptionable baseness of the Count, so as to show how ruinous it is simply to be consistently reasonable in matters of conduct, "" And by what is what will be to define."" Aringart's impulsiveness is, il fact, the key to the whole poem; she aggravates her loss by her eagerness to measure it, and the particular form of her resignation is very much a matter of accident; it would have been easy to find practical and ideal reasons if they were the thing required to show that her talent as an actress was too good to be wasted, and that it would be foolish to destroy the chance of her voice recovering itself by teaching. It would have been equally easy to prove that her tardy sym. pathy for Walpurga and Leo (it is an ad. mirable trait that Walpurga accuses her while she accuses herself to Leo) wvas a motive for generalisinc, her revolt, not for subsiding into submission; but the poet resists the teml)tation to a systematic intel. lectual pessimism as she resists the temptation to a systematic intellectual opti. mism which would have made the moral change in Armgart a compensation for the loss of her voice. The only approach to a glorification of right reason is the very interesting poem on ""Stradivarius,"" who defends his simple straightforward perfect work triumphantly against a painter Naldo, ""Knowing all tricks of style at thirty-one, And weary of them ;"" who tells Stradivariuss"" Thou nrt little more Than a deft potter's wheel, Antonio; Turning out work by more necessity And lack of varied function. Higher arts Subsist on freedom-eccentricityUncounted inspirations, influenco That conies with drinking, gambling, talk turned wild, Then moody misery and lack of foodWith every dithyrumbic fine excess."" Only when we remember that Southey worked, and prepared himself for work, on the principle of Stradivarius, and that Hoff. mann and Byron prepared themselves for work on the principles of Naldo, and compare the value of their work, we see how hard it is to draw universal inferences from the best selected facts. No one would be less disconcerted by this difficulty than the author who combines the most resolute and exalted hope with a keen perception of the ridiculous nature of all Utopias, which are a premature attempt to anticipate in detail the realisation of aspirations which it is well to cherish. Not even the conclave at the Rainbow shows a sharper sense of humour than the ""Minor Prophet,"" an American vegetarian and spiritualist, who holds""That Thought was rapping in the hoary past, And might have edified the Greeks by raps At the greater Dionysia, if their ears Had not been filled with Sophoclean verse; And when all Earth is VegetarianWhen, lacking butchers, quadrupeds die out, And less Thought-atmosphere is reabsorbed By nerves of insects parasitical, Those higher truths, seized now by higher minds, But not expressed (the insects hindering) Will either flash out into eloquence, Or better still, be comprehensible By rappings simply."" "" Two Lovers "" is a very touching picture of the stages of a life-long affection, only the ejaculatory lines at the end of each stanza hardly communicate the depth of feeling out of which they come. "" Arion "" is an almost successful attempt to show that half of a legend which a scientific age can accept may be made more than .the whole. Here are the two last stanzas:""The last long vowels trembled then, As awe within those wolfish men: They said, with mutual stare, Some god was present there. But lo! Arion leaped on high Ready, his descant done, to die; Not asking ' Is it well?' Like a pierced eagle fell."" G. A. Simcox."

96,B7819,"['8643129', '6167269']","Tlie Minister's Wooing. By H. Beecher Stowe. a (Low & Co.) 11; In this novel, the leading events of which, the p preface informs us, are "" founded on actual J p facts,"" and the principal characters of which are historic, Mrs. Stowe endeavours to depict the mannera and austere religious life of New England at the close of the last century. She especially commends her work to the kindly \ 1 thoughts of the British fireside,?a compliment j c which we predict the British public will repay 11 by asking for the story at the circulating libra- ! S ries, and in due course coming to the conclusion j that, notwithstanding numerous blemishes which go a long way towards counterbalancing its I merits, it is a tale to be read, and for nine days ; to be talked about. The critical few will find amusement in comparing an American lady's description of the Transatlantic Puritanism, to which Whitfield imparted fresh earnestness more than a hundred years ago, with the light satiric view taken of the same subject by Mr. Thackeray in ' The Virginians.' 'The Minister's Wooing' is a love tale, a religious novel, and an historic?or, rather, biographic?fiction, all in one. Regarded as the first, it deserves almost unqualified praise; judged of as the second, it merits a certain amount of blame; but viewed as an illustration of history, it is open to very grave censure. The opening chapters (as we indicated last December) induce the reader to hope he is going to be treated with a series of simple domestic episodes, although his feelings are early harrowed with an enumeration of the horrors of the slave trade. But, unfortunately, these expectations are to a certain extent disappointed, and the whole question of negro emancipation is dragged up for re-discussion. In this the author has acted very unwisely. With all its mis-statements and one-sidedness, exaggeration, and reticence, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' was a powerful story, and created a memorable sensation, ? equal, perhaps, to that caused amongst educated English people almost two hundred years before by Afra Behn's 'Oroonoko,' the first "" nigger novel"" of our literature. Mrs. Stowe would have decided well for her fame if, imitating the caution of Hamilton with his famous speech, she had allowed this bril- liant success to remain in solitary splendour, and had not lessened its effect by endeavouring to repeat it. The reception that ' Dred' met with in this country must have convinced her that her English admirers were weary of listening to the cracking of Legree's whip, and that their craving for imagined woes must for some time to come be gratified with more refined sorrows than the tortures of slave-markets and plantations down South. Very likely Mrs. Stowe is well aware of all this; for the tone of her arguments against slavery in the present work is milk and honey in comparison with the scalding indignation of the story that first brought her into notoriety. There is a wide difference between the inspired angel of abolition who penned ' Uncle Tom's Cabin,' and the calm, argumentative lady who, in ' The Minister's Wooing,' is content with coldly enunciating the moral obligation of all men to help the oppressed. And this change can only be accounted for on the supposition that, either she has so far outlived the ardour of her earlier impressions that what a few years since would have been the language of fervid poetry, is now nothing more than a mere habit of sermonizing, ?or else that, accurately appreciating the state of public feeling, she only breathes gently on the embers of a dying enthusiasm, well knowing that a stronger current of air would altogether extinguish the feeble sparks that still linger in them. The scheme of that part of the story on which the rest of the narrative is hung is simple and pretty enough. The drama opens with a teaparty in the parlour of the Widow Scudder, who is a lady blessed with a small farm and "" a gambrel-roofed"" cottage on the outskirts of Newport, a charming daughter (the heroine),? a sweet little maiden just emerging from chUdj hood,?and a high reputation for the possession j of "" faculty,"" the precise meaning of which term | may be found in the Athenmtm for December ! 25, 1858. j The principal inmate of the Widow Scudder's house is Dr. H., the minister, who does the wooing, a divine of extreme Calvinistic J opinions, of pure life and of a gentle nature,? : a man dwelling in a world of spiritual abstracI tions, guileless and simple-minded as a child, ! austere in his habits, and of inflexible firmness of principle. Studious and abstracted, he is a kind of Coleridge divested of poetic faculty, and imbued with moral stability. The good man is a bachelor, something over forty years of age, and besides officiating zealously amongst j his congregation, ministering to his afflicted j black brethren, and writing a profound system I of divinity, finds time to act to the fair Mary Scudder (his landlady's daughter) the part that Abelard did to Heloise. He is her tutor in religious and secular studies, and she, in return, instructs him in the art of loving; but, unlike Heloise of old, Mary only conceives for him that reverential affection which a young maiden naturally entertains for her pastor, who appears to her an the expression of all the goodness that is possible in humanity. The Widow Scudder would gladly see her daughter love the pastor dearly enough to wish to be his wife ; but the meek, gentle child, wilful in one thing only, bestows her heart on a wicked scapegrace of a cousin, James Marvyn, who, having run 31 away from home and been to sea, returns from 3 foreign countries to laugh at the sanctimonious ways of the godly people of Newport, and to question the doctrine of election and predestination. The young man, of course, is condemned, by the surrounding respectability, as r utterly reprobate, and poor little Mary is con_ tinually being informed that her cousin, her playmate from infancy, her dearest cousin, is doomed to eternal perdition. The child has also, amongst other tenets of that religion which Calvinism, grafted on the stern nature of the Puritan colonists, called into existence, has been taught that it is her duty to contemplate the idea of her own eternal punishment with lively pleasure, if, by such suffering, the happiness of mankind at large could be increased. Naturally she applies this terrible doctrine to the state of her own mind in relation to her cousin, until she feels she could willingly surrender herself a sacrifice to never-ending torment, in order to secure him admission to an eternity of bliss. One afternoon James has a stolen interview with her, to say farewell, as next day he is about to start on a long voyage. After much earnest and pathetic conversation on religion, which we extracted when noticing the first number of this work, James gives her a parting kiss, and once more goes off to sea. The voyage is one of disaster. The ship is wrecked, and news comes home that .Tames Marvyn is drowned. The intelligence well nigh kills poor little Mary, and for many a day she seems going ""the downward way to death."" Her mother, who has become possessed of her darling's secret, watches her narrowly, anxiously, and prayerfully. But Mary does not die. Her physical strength is gradually restored to her, and though her heart is saddened for life, she prepares, like the noble self-sacrificing girl she is, to forget her own woes as much as possible and to devote her life to making others happy. Time passes on; and Dr. H., wno has comforted her in her sorrow and sickness, ignorant of the nature of the wound her affections have suffered, begs her to be his wife. To gratify her mother, to make a good man happy, and to secure to herself a field of usefulness, Mary accepts him. The wedding clothes are provided, and the day for her marriage is fixed,?av, the day is not a week distant on which January and May are to be united together,?and Mary is training herself to look cheerfully on her future as the bride of the good and venerable Dr. H.; when, one fine morning, aa she walks in solitary meditation in the fields, a voice is heard behind her, and a quick step beats the ground, and an arm is put round her waist, and she falls fainting in her true lover's arms! Instead of being drowned, James Marvyn has returned home rich. The rest of all this pretty romance can be imagined. Mary acknowledges to James that he has her heart; but she is, nevertheless, determined to keep her promise,?her solemn engagement to good Dr. H., and bids her lover not to hinder her from doing her duty. There is a pause of uncertainty and suspense. The awful day draws nearer; but ere it has arrived, a jolly little dressmaker, Miss Prissy, who acts the part of an amiable sprite all through the play, informs the Doctor of the state of the case. The finehearted man takes all the sorrow of the position to himself, surrenders the timid child he loves so dearly to the man of her choice, and sets his face resolutely forward to do his duty in that unwedded life which it seems Providence has designed for him:? ""' You all know,' he said, turning to Mary, who sat very near him, ' the near and dear relation in which I have been expecting to stand towards this friend; I should not have been worthy of that relation if I had not felt in my heart the true love of a husband as set forth in the New Testament; who should ""love his wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it""; and if in case any peril or danger threatened this dear girl, and I could not give myself for her, I had never been worthy the honour she has done me. For I take it, wherever there is a cross or a burden to be borne by one or the other, that the man who is Biade in the image of God, as to strength and endurance, should take it upon himself, and not lay it upon her that is weaker; for he is therefore strong, not that he may tyrannize over the weak, but bear their burdens for them, even as Christ for his church. I have just discovered,' he added, looking kindly upon Mary, ' that there is a great cross and burden which must come, either on thia dear child or on myself, through no fault of either of us, but through God's good providence; and, therefore, let me bear it. Mary, my dear child, I will be to thee as a father; but I will not force thy heart.'"" This is touching, and well told. But how does it all square with the facts on which the story ia founded? Who is this good Dr. H. ??this pattern minister, so forgetful of himself where the happiness of others is concerned, who, subsequent to the Declaration of Independence, is represented as forty years of age, childless and unwived ? He is no other than the celebrated Samuel Hopkins, D.D., pastor of the first Congregational Church in Newport, and co-founder with Jonathan Edwards of that awful, that indescribably ferocious system of Calvinistic theology, known as the Hopkintonian or Hopkinsian. But, unfortunately for the truthfulness of Mrs. Stowe's tale, Samuel Hopkins was born in the year 1721, and did not settle in Newport till the year 1770. Consequently, instead of being forty at the outset of his wooing (which commences after the recognition of American Independence by England), he must be regarded as more than sixty years old. But further :?Dr. Hopkins married, in 1748, Joanna Ingersol, who presented him with eight children, and livea with him, as his wife, till her death, on the last day of August in 1793. And on the 14th of September, 1794, the Doctor, then in his seventy-fourth year, married again, taking for his second wife Miss Elizabeth West, a lady only sixteen or seventeen years younger than himself. It is a matter of certainty that Samuel Hopkins was in no respect such a man as Mrs. Stowe has depicted him. It is true that he was an Abolitionist, and published, in 1776, 'A Dialogue concerning the Slavery of the Africans'; but, instead of being a shiftless dreamer, incapable of looking after his worldly interests, and wanting a religious landlady to rouse him up and tell nim when he was hungry, he was a keen and energetic man, and as well able to make a bargain as any other citizen of the United States. Although he owned a farm, and made considerable sums by his literary productions, he threatened to quit his congregation at Newport if they could not provide comfortably for him; and Mrs. Stowe can scarcely be ignorant of how active he was in organizing prayer-meetings amongst his flock. Such misrepresentations as these altogether overstep the limits which ought to restrain the imagination of a writer of historic fiction. In such composition it is allowable to exercise the imagination in amplifying and giving colour to the views of history, by the creation of any series of positions and incidents which are in accordance with recorded facts. But surely a too daring disregard of veracity is exhibited by tho writer who professes to sketch the Life of an eminent person, and at the same time misrepresents it in the most important particulars. What object can Mrs. Stowe have in saying that her story is founded on facts, when the master-incident of the book is pure fiction? Are ""the facts"" of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' of a similar kind ? Other historical characters besides Dr. Hopkins are brought on the stage, but not with greater felicity. Col. Aaron Burr figures away with Madame de Frontignac, deluging that lady, and all the rest of the fair sex whom he addresses, with very awkward adulation. But this is a slight fault, and one easily accounted for. Doubtless, it has been Mrs. Stowe's pro* vince throughout life to receive rather than to pay compliments. We cannot discuss at length the religious side of this novel. In that respect it forms a striking contrast to the Tales of Miss Sewell, being marked by a boldness of speculation and language which one would in vain look for in the writings of our own countrywomen. It is, we are willing to believe, written in a devout and reverential spirit: but it is to be regretted that one of the saddest exhibitions of the perverseness of the human intellect, when directed to the contemplation of sacred mysteries, should have been dragged into a pretty love story to disfigure ana even to mar it. The Eicture of Mrs. Marvyn's agony on hearing of er son's death, and her despair of his salvation, is as revolting a spectacle of spiritual Buffering as Uncle Tom dying under the whips of his persecutors was of bodily torture. If the hook should become popular, its success will be won, not by its polemical qualities, but by the winning graces of the heroine and her little friend of the great world, Verginie. In the construction and elaboration of Mary's character genuine artistic power is manifested. In conception it lacks originality, for in many respects she is a combination of Longfellow's Evangeline, and that form of young-ladyism which has for some years been fashionable in American novels; and many features of her mind and incidents of her life have been taken with judicious selection from the numerous Puritan memoirs, which formed an important division of American literature in the last and few preceding generations. The' Memoirs of Mrs. Harriet NeweU,' and Hopkins's 'Memoirs of Miss Susanna Anthony, who died at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1791' have manifestly been carefully read by Mrs. Stowe. In conclusion, we may add, that amongst the pleasant peculiarities of the book are innumerable Americanisms, some of them intentionally and some unconsciously employed by the author. To educate young ladies is to "" fetch them up,"" and a matron wno superintends her domestic servants is said "" to follow them round."" Prominent, too, amongst its national characteristics, the reader will notice the author's passion for "" talking philosophy,"" her familiar mention of Plato as "" an old heathen,"" and her anxiety to display an intimate acquaintance with the Art galleries and cathedrals of Europe. The annoyance of our Transatlantic cousins at their own want of the memorials of ancient Art is one of their most patent foibles; and we are not awafre that it was ever more humorously expressed than by the New York merchant who, on being reminded amidst the ruins of Pompeii that his country was entirely devoid of any such interesting relics, answered "" Yes, stranger, that's an Almighty truth, we have got no remains like these here, but,?I guess, we precious soon shall have some.""Tiik Ministers Wooi.v;.0 LITERATURE.

What Lord Macaulay did for the Puritans of old, Mrs. Stowe has done in the volume before us for the Puritans of Xew England : the difference between them is this, that the Peer writes as a rhetorician whose heart is untouched, while Mrs. Stowe writes from the heart and with all her heart. The people of whom she treats are, in her belief, the excellent ofthe earth. She has lived in the land haunted by their traditions and peopled by their memories. They had crossed the sea and had gone out into the wilderness to find freedom to worship (iud.

The scene is laid in Newport, a flourishing town in New England. The story is simple. Mary Scudder, the saint and beauty of whom we have spoken, is in love with lier cousin .fames, who goes to sea, is shipwrecked, and reported as drowned, just as she ison the point of marrying Dr. Hopkins, her pastor, and thus fulfilling the dearest desires of her mother's heart. James comes to life and claims her as his bride. This he can fairly do, as, since his shipwreck and wonderful escape, he has become a converted character.

97,B6186,['5067427'],"Sketch ofthe Life, Character, and Writings, of Baroness de Stael-Holstein. -, ?.-3?, v ..?. _..??._ By Madame Necker de Saussure. Translated from the French, bvo. pp. 30J. London, IS 20. Madame de Stael was a lady possessed o' such extraor- dinary genius and splendid talents, and filled so important a part in the literature and politics of the time in which she lived, that whatever relates to her as illustrative either of her public or private character, cannot fail of being interesting. The first of female writers, perhaps, of this or of auy age, she not only possessed a commanding influence in France during the most eventful period of its history, but her opinions were inquired after with eagerness, and respected, if not admired, in every state of Europe. Some persons have affected to question the moral tendency of the writings of Madame de Stael, and, passing over the knowledge of human nature, the fidelity of observation, and the acuteness of remark, which she displayed in all her writings, haye, with a most fastidious delicacy, carped at some passages, which, taken even abstractedly, were never doubtful. The present work does not contain a regular biographical memoir of this illustrious woman; but a critical examination of her writings, aud a variety of anecdotes of her domestic and social life; and, when it is known that these anecdotes are related by the friend and near relation of Madame de Stael, who was honoured by her with the appellation of sister, and passed many years of her life in the closest intimacy with her, it will not be doubted that they are highly interesting. We will not follow Madame de Saussure through her critical remarks on the respective works, of Madame de Stael, and this is the less necessary as their superior excellence is now universally acknowledged ; but shall content ourselves with making one extract from this part of the work, and then puss on to that part of it which describes her in private life, which is the more interesting as it is the least known. In u ' general examination ofthe talents of Madame de Stael,' the author remarks :? ? Before she appeared, religion and knowledge had their separate defenders. These two grand causes have been pleaded, as we may say, in opposition: each finding itself a stranger to a whole system of ideas, there has been, in this respect, a secret division among mankind, one party only appearing to tolerate the reign of reason, the other that of faith, out of pure civility. ' Madame de Stael alone has embraced, with equal zeal, the party of knowledge and that of religion: she alone has adopted, from the bottom of her heart, whatever was best in different ages; combating, on one side, ancient prejudices and ignorance, and, on the other, modern selfishness and incredulity. ' ' Madame de Stael loved what was about her, and extended to human nature her affection for her friends. What her style wants of minute finish, is more than compensated by the charm of the first impulse, by the freshness ofthe inspiration, if I may venture to use the term, lt is the stream gushing with vivacity from the fountain, that sparkles as it flows. * But something else may be remarked in her talents than this combination of different faculties: there is a marked originality in each, yet all bearing a similar stamp, which is pe. culiar to Madame de Stael. T his peculiar stamp originates from her character, from the strength as well as the versatile nature of her impressions, from those sudden bursts of indignation, of compassion, of haughtiness, and also from her never ceasing to be a woman. * This last is, perhaps, her secret charm. She addresses herself as a woman to the reader, and presents herself personally to him, to tell him what passes in her mind, and also in his own. But she is aware, that he would soon forget her being a woman, if she ceased to appear amiable or attractive to him: accordingly, whether she endeavours to instruct or dazzle, she never overpowers him with her superioritv; ^he never arrogates to herself any pre-eminence. It seems' as if chance had afforded her a good place at the theatre of moral affairs, and she recited what was thus offered to her view. * Sometimes, too, she presents herself as a child guiding a wiseman, whose sight is a little indistinct. She explains to him all he perceives confusedly, and places him in a bright sunshine, that he may see a little more clearly himself. When she comes to lead him through steep and difficult paths, she says to him, "" do not be afraid; you will be glad you have passed; we shall soon get safe out of it."" Constantly endeavouring to render the road agreeable to him, she brings herself forward to divert him, by rallying herself a little for the strong impressions she receives. Persons, words, faces, accents, attitudes,dresses, every thing, in fact, strikes her, everv thing is characteristic in her pictures. She knows herself as well as she knows others; and that blind instinct, which so frequently determines us to like or dislike, is in hera feeling founded on motives, of which she gives a clear account. ' The precision of her views is such, that we forget their extreme clelicacy. She has no vain subtilty, does not compel r j her readers to discern what is imperceptible, but even* thing l ? enlarges under her hands. lier whole attention is bent for ail instant to each point, and it becomes so distinct to her, that none of its bearings escape her notice: but she takes care to connect threads too slender of themselves with others more strong, the importance of which is acknowledged. Thus we easily pass with her from the particulars to the whole, and we find ourselves at once at the root of ideas, when we fancied we were only tracing their remotest ramifications.' ' The copiousness of her thoughts is extraordinary. Perhaps no writer has equalled her in this respect. Take at a venture any three of her pages, and three of the authors most abounding in wit, we may venture a wager that the number of striking and original ideas will be greatest in Madame de Stael. Not that she affects conciseness; every thought is amply furnished with the necessary words; but we are not accustomed to see so many thoughts together, and perhaps there are two many?perhaps certain phrases, which are superfluous to the train of reasoning, have on the mind the effect of those bits of cloth in the harpsichord, which stop the vibration of one string before another is struck. The succession of thoughts is too rapid and continual in Madame de Stael, to allow ordinary minds to keep pace with it. She is the goddess of plenty; she scatters from full hands, corn, pearls, roses, ribands, and diadems. We would Jet nothing escape us, because every thing is of value; but we may be fatigued in collecting it/ ' On the whole, the works of Madame de Stael appear to belong to a new age; they announce, as they tend to produce, another period in society and in literature; the age of strong, generous, animated thoughts; sentiments proceeding from the bottom of the heart, She has furnished the idea of a literature in some sort, rather spoken than written; of a kind in which the extempore speaking of national assemblies, unrestrained confidence, and conversational sallies, inform us more strongly and more intimately of politics, of the passions, and of society, than studied rhetoric has ever done.' The second part of this work is entitled, ' Social and Domestic Life of Madame de Stael,' and consists of a series of characteristic anecdotes, best calculated to exhibit this estimable woman in the truest light :?? * The distinctions between different kinds of attachment were never less marked than in her. The sentiment was one and the same in her, and assumed the decided cast of her character, much more than that of the different relations of life, or the disposition of the persons she loved. In her, maternal and filial affection, friendship, gratitude, all seemed love, lhere was passion, or at least emotion, in all her attachments. They appeared to differ rather in intensity than in kind; and they were naturally expansive, ardent, impetuous, and even stormy; not that these storms were the effect of any caprice in Madame de Stael, but she revolted against the obstacles which the frame of society, and often human indolence, oppose to the enjoyments of the heart. For a long time she comprehended only her own manner of loving; for a long time she refused to believe the existence of sincere sentiments, that did not express themselves like hers; and the clear knowledge that she had of herself led her into error, when she judged of others from herself. But her most ardent reproaches were also the most affecting; her love was conspicuous through her anger. She never gave pain to another, but because she felt more herself, and you could not avoid pitying her, even when she wounded you most severely.' The affection of Madame de Stael for her father, evinced itself on every occasion, by the most watchful attention on him during his life; and, after his death, she conceived she had lost ever\r earthly comfort with him :? 1 It would be necessary to relate how every day passed with Madame de Stael, if we would give an idea of the place that her deceased father constantly retained in her heart. She never ceased to live with him. She always felt herself protected, consoled, succoured by him. She invoked him in her prayers; and never did any occurrence, that was fortunate for her, take place, without her saying, iC My father obtained that for n.e."" His miniature she always carried about her, and it was to her the object of a kind of superstition. She never parted with it, except on one occasion. Very ill herself, and finding great consolation in contemplating this portrait, she imagined that when her daughter lay in, it would produce the same effect on her. Accordingly, she sent it to her, desiring her to look on it, when she was in pain. Every old man, too, recalled her father to her mind, and made aparticular impression on her. To every thing in which old men were concerned she was peculiarly sensible; and once, when in the time of her persecutions, an old man acted towards her with a degree of pusillanimity, then common, and undoubtedly more excusable at such an age, she wras extraordinarily grieved at it. "" I am very silly,"" said she to me, "" but what would you have? he was kind, ""he was old, he sat at my table, I altered my hours for him, and all these things grieve me to the heart."" Her bounty to the aged, who stood in need of her assistance, was immense; the idea of their sufferings tore her heart, and, as true Christians see Jesus Christ in all who are poor, she saw her father in every man that was old.' Her affection for her mother was scarcely less ardent; and, although she manifested the utmost forbearance towards Madame de Genlis, who never ceased to attack her with severe criticisms, yet, when the same lady spoke in unfavourable terms of Madame Necker, it was with the utmost difficulty she could> be restrained from resenting it:? ' There is great beauty in the thought of that bas-relief, which, after the death of M. Necker, Madame de Stael had sculptured on the funeral monuments cf her parents. An airy figure, as if already beatified, is drawing towards the skies another, that appears to look with compassion on a young woman veiled, and prostrate on a tomb. Madame Necker, her husband, and her daughter, are represented under this emblem, which likewise indicates the passage from this life to life eternal.* The motto of Madame de Stael might have been the following verse, which she often repeated with emotion :? ' "" O liberte de Rome! 6 manes de mon pere !"" ?"" O Roman freedom! manes of my father!' "" Madame de Stael could not avoid forming many friendshins. She whispered this sentiment almost at first sight, and she was touched with the effect which she produced; and yet it was difficult to attain the highest places in her affections. * There are ninety dtgrevs fixed/ saul she,* in my affections, ami only ten moveable.* She was always free in her remarks on her friends, and spared none of tho objects of her attachment :? ' This continual appreciation of her friends, not only every one, but of each daily, this appreciation made incessantly :\ their presence, sometimes hutt them, and led them to doubt her affection. "" With you we must submit to be judged .it fresh cost every morning,"" said Ito her. "" What signifies it/' answered she, "" if I love thee more every pveningr""?Nbc added, "" Were I going to the scaffold, V could not help passingjudgment on the friends that accompanied me."" In her habitual society, Madame de Stael was full of charms. In bur company there was no restraint; thus lu r superiority did not bear heavy on any person ; she asked only for amusement, not for trials of skill;? i She could not endure people to talk with indifference. ""How can he expect me to attend to him,"" she would *ay, "" when he does not do himself the honour to attend to himself ?'' She could better endure certain defects of charade r than a mind dried up and disgusted; and she said one dav rt an egotist and caviller, "" That man talks only of himself; but he does not tire me, hecuase I am certain ul lea t that he feels interested in what he says."" ' ' She had an occupation in society very different from that of shining and pleasing ; she wa> the naturalist, observing a species, as well as the orator that would persuade. * But what deranged this study completely, what took from her all interest in people's words was affectation. This tault, which effaces every prominent feature, which substitutes a false and monotonous phantom, instead of the inunen-e variety of moral nature, was profoundly tiresome to her, ami scarcely less vexatious. She expressed herself thus on ihe subject: "" There is never any such thing as a tele dtC\e with affected people; the personage assumed makes a third, and it is thls,that answers when you speak to the other.?Affected people are the only persons fi om whom nothing is to le learned."" Exaggeration, too, displeased her much. "" lt is no proof of imagination to put a hundred in place of ten,"" she would say. For the same reason she was always suspicious of great expressions of sensibility: ""all natural feeling,"" she remarked, "" have a degree of modesty."" ' From a sketch of her conversation, political opitnons, and repartees, we shall select a few of the most striking passages :? 'When she was told of the follies of some witty man, she would say, <f Give him more wit, and all these will van', h."" One of her Swedish friends observing to her, "" Whatever von may say, witty people commit a great many faults."" .die answered, "" that is very true ; but, unfortunately, stupid persons do the same, though nobody thinks it worth while to ur - tice them."" Another time she said, "" the follies of men os wit are the profits of ordinary men."" ' Her attachment to France never abated, not even ui.? ,i she had been banished from it, ami incurred the enmity of its rulers.?* I have a corroding grief respecting France/ she wrote, * which 1 love more than ever/ And, again, * I have felt clearly that 1 cannot live without that France/ But it must be confessed her country was more es^et lally Paris :? *"" Show me the rue de Bac"" said she once, to some persons who wanted her to admire the splendid view of ti e I ac of Geneva and its banks. "" I would willingly live at f\.ris"" said she again, ?' with a hundred pounds a j ear, itt a lodging up four pair of stairs."" In 1806, when she^pent four d.tys ni Paris in concealment, her greatest pleasure was to walk out ia night, to view the streets by moonlight. "" I have a constancy of heart,"" she wrote, u and an inconstancy of mind, for whick a country is formed, where the scenes are incessantly renewing, and where 1 have my old friends."" ' ' It is very remarkable, that, always cutting to the quick in disputation, always touching the most sensible points, she always conciliated, in her presence, those whom a vague idea of her had previously made her enemies. You might be grazed, be wounded, in the contest; but you always went away healed, or at least she had applied balsam to the sore. ' "" You desire, then, my death or my dishonour?"" said an emigrant to her in Switzerland, as he was going to the army on the frontiers. "" No,"" answered she, "" w~hat I wish is your defeat, and yourglcry: I would have you, except being slain, be like Hector, the hero of a vanquished army."" ' The following are given as a few of her bon mots on public events:? * While she was in England, in 1814, some person thought fit to congratulate her on the taking of Paris, which put an end to her banishment. To these expressions of politeness she answered, "" On what do you compliment me, pray? On my being in the height of distress ?"" It was from the date of the battle of Leipsic that she began to be alarmed for France. 4 In 1815, when Bonaparte had already entered Lyons, a lady, attached to his party, came and said to Madame de Stael, "" The emperor knows, Madame, how generously you spoke of him during his misfortunes,""?"" I hope,"" answered she, "" he will know how much I detest him."" ' During the hundred days, she said, "" If all the declamatory phrases, uttered this winter against the revolution, had been enlisted, we should have had plenty of soldiers ou the COth of March."" * In 1810, Mr. Canning having thought proper to say to Madame de Stael, in the apartment of the first gentleman of the bed-chamber in the palace of the Tuillcries, "" lt is useless to indulge any longer in illusions, madam; France has 'submitted to u>, and we have conquered you.""?""Yes,"" answered sile, "" because you had all Europe and the Cossacs on your side; but meet us tete-d-tete, and we shall see.'* She | said also to Mr. Canning, "" The English nation is deceived ; it is not aware that it is employed to deprive other nations of the liberty enjoyed by itself, and to protect intolerance toward its brethren in religion : if it knew this, it would renounce those who thus abuse its name."" ' "" Fiance,"" said she, "" must remain as dead, as long as it is occupied by foreigners. First let us have independence, and then think of libertv."" ' She said of Mr. De Bonald, "" He is the philosopher of antiphilosophy : but this will not carry a man very far."" * "" The ministerial party,"" observed she, ?' looks at the prosaic side of human nature, and opposition at the poetical side. This is why I have always had an inclination for the opinions ofthe latter."" * Some person once maintained that it was impossible for ministers of state to confine themselves to the employment of strictly legitimate measures. ""What would you'have me say?"" answered she, ""he who possesses genius can never have occasion for immorality; and he who has not, should not accept a post of difficulty."" ' In 1816, she said of the ministry, ? I do not like it, yet 1 prefer it. It is but a barrier of cotton against the return of old abuses, yet still it is a barrier."" ' On occasion of the great number of persons enobled, she said, "" It would be best to create France a marquis once for all."" l ' She set no great value on puns, yet she occasionally uttered them with her usual quickness, in a dispute on the slave trade, with a French lady of high rank, the latter said to her, 4t What, madam, then you are much interested for the Count of Limonade and the Marquis of Marmalade?""?"" Why not as much as for the Duke of Bouillon ?"" answered she. ? Bonaparte having caused her to be told, in 1815, that she must return to Paris, because he wanted her for tbe sake of constitutional ideas, she refused, saying, "" he contrived to do without a constitution, and without me, for a dozen years; and he has now the same regard for the one that he has for the* other."" Even at this period, however, when any Frenchmen passed by Coppet, in their way to join the army ofthe allies, she endeavoured to divert them from their design, not approving their endangering the independence of the nation, even to acquire liberty. ' She was already dangerously ill, when the "" Manuscript from St. Helena"" began to make a great noise in France. Notwithstanding the state of weakness to which Madame de Stael was reduced, she made her children read the work to her, and criticised it with all her strength of mind. "" The Chaldeans worshipped the serpent,"" said she; ""the Bonapartists do the same to the Manuscript from St. Helena; but I am far from sharing their admiration, lt is but in the style of the notes ofthe Moniteur; and, if ever I recover, I think I can refute this writing with a high hand."" ' r One of Bonaparte's ministers having desired her to be told, that the emperor would reward her if she would attach herself to him, she answered, "" I was aware that a certificate of being alive is necessary to the receipt of an annuity, but I did not know that it required a declaration of love."" ' Notwithstanding the liberality and noble facility of Madame de Stael's disposition, great order was observed in the management of her house and estate; so that her circumstances were constantly prosperous when under her government. Her mornings she devoted to business, that is, to the care of her property, and to study; and her evenings to society, and to correspondence :? * The only luxury on which she set any value, was the having accommodation for her friends, and being able to invite to dinner persons with whom she wished to become acquainted. "" I have hired a cook that travels post,""said she: "" is not this exactly what I wanted, to give dinners in dishabille throughout Europe ?"" ' The following anecdote is highly characteristic, and displays Madame de Stael in a very amiable point of view :? ' About twenty years ago, when on a visit to me in the country, it was proposed to play proverbs. A sketch of Marmontel, entitled, Le Barara, (The Prater,) was selected, in which a great lady, ill and nervous, consents to use her interest in favour of an old soldier, who is soliciting a pension; but, on the express condition that he states his case to her in the fewest words possible. The prater, who is duly cautioned beforehand, nevertheless indulges himself in such an exuberance of words, that he exhausts the patience of his patroness, and she will have nothing more to say to him. Madame de Stael represented the great lady. At first she acted her part very well; she counterfeited languor to perfection, next weariness, then vexation and impatience; but when the moment came for inflicting pain on the old soldier, it was impossible for her to bring herself to this. He had spoken of his wife and children; he was, at bottom, one of the best men in the world; it required too hard a heart to refuse him. Quitting, therefore, altogether, her assumed character, and totally destroying the point ofthe piece, she told him with real emotion, that in future he had better not talk so much, but that for this time she would undertake his suit. Suclvin fact, wat* Madame de Stael; she was not only incapable of giving pain to any person voluntarily, but, subject as she was to ennui, she really felt none when she could be useful to others.' Of her religious character we have the following account :? ' Among the happy effects of time on Madame de Stael, ,.-.4. L. .. ?_I_I_1*1 j ...... .1 - 1 ? ? _ * _1^4t? Matta** which had always looked to the consequences of her actions, attached themselves more to their motives. Prayer, that sentimental want of her's, placing her incessantly in communication with the source of all excellence, caused a pure light to penetrate her heart. "" Whenever I am alone I pray,"" said she to her children. She wrote to me, from Sweden, on the subject of Mr. de Montmorency : "" There is no such thing as absence to the religious, because they meet in the sentiment of prayer."" Every moment we find in her letters a request to pray for her, and her children. * Madame de Stael thought it was pride in man to endeavour to penetrate the secret of the universe; and speaking of the higher metaphysics, she said, "" I prefer the Lord's Prayer to it all."" During her long sleeplessness, she was accustomed to repeat this prayer incessantly, in order to calm her mind. Sighs, certain exclamations that she was in the habit of uttering, were with her pious invocations. Thus the following words that escaped her frequently, "" Poor human nature! alas! what are we? Ah, life, life!"" were religious sentiments venting themselves/ lu her last illness she was seen constantly exerting the virtues for which she was distinguished ; and, on the days when she suffered most pain, she was employed in acts of kindness:? s She was heard to utter delightful sayings, in her peculiar way. ?t I have always been the same, lively and sad,"" she observed to Mr. Chateaubriand, ?' I love God, my father, and liberty."" ' On quoting these words of Fontenelle; "" I am a Frenchman, I am fourscore years old, yet I never ridiculed the slightest virtue:"" she added, ""I can say as much of the slightest suffering."" ' Unquestionably she felt great regret at parting with her children and friends. Stoicism, or the particular kind of enthusiasm that is capable of closing the heart to the pains of eternal separation, entered not into her character. Her daughter in particular cost her many tears. "" With such treasures of affection,"" she dictated for me, in speaking of the objects of her regard, *? it is a sad thing to quit life."" "" I should be very sorry,"" she said likewise, "" if every thing were at an end between Albertine, (Madame de Broglie,) and me in another world."" But she rather regretted life, than really feared death. She may have dreaded the last pangs; an imagination like hers may have felt some horrors at the idea of physical dissolution, terrible as it is to all of us ; but death, morally considered, gave her no alarm. She preserved so much tranquility, as to wish to dictate to Mr. Schlegel the description of what she felt. Her thoughts were always turned with hope towards her father, and towards immortality. "" My father waits for me on the other shore,"" she said. She beheld her father with God, and in God himself could see nothing but a father. These two ideas were confounded in her heart; and that of a protecting goodness was inseparable from both. One day, rousing from a state of reverie, she said, "" I think I know what the transition from life to death is; and I am sure, that the goodness of God softens it to us. Our ideas become confused, and the pain is not very acute."" ' Her confidence was not disappointed; the profoundest tranquillity presided over her last moments. Long before she expired, the grand struggle had ended, and her soul departed gently/ It can scarcely be necessary to extend this article by any further remarks on Madame de Stael; or on the present work. That it is written with the partiality of a friend, and an ardent admirer of Madame de Stael, is avowed; and yet there is scarcely an assertion or an opinion respecting her, that has not already been justified, or is so by the present volume. This work is published in French, so that those who may prefer reading it in the original, will have the opportunity; we may, however, observe, that the translation is well executed."

T - fi p i te This Mtdy more celebrated for her wit and her dramatic powers, than the scrupulous delicacy of her productions, was born sometime in the reign of Charles the First. ""By her talents she acquired the acquaintance and esteem of the wits and poets of the age: Dryden, Southerne, Charles Cotton, &c. &c. She was more than suspected of gallantry, to which by her beauty, her genius, and situation, she was peculiarly exposed. Some letters addressed to a gentleman, whom she poetically calls Lycidas, are printed in her memoirs: this attachment appears to have been no less tender than ardent and unfortunate. ""April 16 1689, after a lingering illness, Mrs. Behn expired, and was intered in the cloisters of Westminster-Abbey,. On a plain black marble stone which covers her grave is the following inscription""e Here lies a proof that wit can never be Defence enough against mortality.* Great Poetess-oh I thy stupendous lays The world admires, and the Muses praise !"" Much cannot be said in favour either of the trite information conveyed in the former lines of this curious epitaph, or the elegance of those which follow.-It is said by Mr. Langhame, cotemporary with Mrs. Behn, that her memory will be long cherished among the lovers of the drama. The majority of her comedies were successful.-She seems to have been a plagiarist, ather from haste than sterility of imagination, being at times compelled to write by pressing and urgent necessity. She received the incense and compliments of the men of literature of her times, among whom may be reckoned Mr. Charles Cotton, who prefixed to her "" Lover's Watch,"" some complimentary lines--Mr. Charles Gibson, with whom she lived in habits of friendship, observes- It that she extorted admiration, by maintaining the -force and gaiety of her genius in the midst of disappointment.""-He adds,-""I She had great strength of mind and command of her faculties; being able to write in the midst of comupany, and, at the same time take a share in conversation. Her works, though reprehensible for their licentiousness, abound in the language of passion. Her personal qualities are thus described by the writer of her memoirs. "" She had an open, generous temper, somewhat choleric, yet friendly and placable, incapable of doing a wilful injury. She had wit, honour, goodnature, and judgment; mistress of the arts of converration, yet frank, and sincere; a woman of sense, and a lover of pleasure; more gay and free than allowed by the strict, yet without transgressing tie rules af modesty."" The last commendation, however applicable to her manners and conversation, cannot, it is to be regretted, be extended to her writings.-Her comedies and novels, with the exception of Oroonoko, do not serve the cause of virtue, yet something must be allowed for the manners of tfe times, the example of the first writers, and the contagion of the court. In a manuscript of Mr. Oldly, an attachment is mentioned between Mrs. Behn, and Mr. Horle, a gentleman of Gray's-Irnn- who is thought to have assisted her in her literary studies. Whether this gentleman was the Lycidas of whose unkindness and coldness she afterwards complains, appearF, though probable, to be uncertain. - She is thus spoken of by Mr. Oldly.-Ad Her capacity il allowed superior to most of her sex who have ventured before the public. She had a command of expression, and a pregnant fancy. She wrote wit h facility, spirit, and warmth, more particularly upon amatory subjects. She may be called the English Sapplio. She was a graceful, comely woman; with brown hair, and a piercing eye; she had a happy manner of terminating any disputes which might arise in conversation, abounding in agreeable repartee, and in judgment in timing her retorts. She was between forty and fifty years of age age at the time of her death, which was hastened by an injudicitiis physic# an. Besides other works, she is said to have translated from the latin, the last book af Mr. Cowley's Poem on plants."" This appears inconsistent with Mr. Dryden's declaration in his preface to the Epistles of Ovid, that the writer of the "" Paraphrase of the letter of (Enone to Paris,"" understood not the original language; Thus far is the account of Mrs. Hayes of this celebrated lady.-We have been obliged to abridge it, though we have retained all that we think will please and interest our readers. The most entertaining extracts from .tis book, must be those that relate to characters not generally known. We ,Vill, therefore, exhibit another of our fair countrywomen, with whose his. tory the common reader is, perhaps, not acquainted.

Her father perceiving in her the promise of superior talents, assisted their developement by a liberal education.

She died prematurely in the 25th year of her age, The following particulars of her character and endowments are extracted from the funeral sermon preached by John Prude, at the parish church of Barnes. '"" By this gentleman we are informed that she was well acquainted with philosophy, astronomy, mathematics and physics; that she was ""snot only conversant with these sciences, but a mistress of them, and ihat to such a degree as few of her sex ever attained."" She was familiar with the writingi of the ancients in their original languages, at the age of twenty-three.

Each illustration is on the same high plane, and for her insight into the story, and her courage in getting well clear of the traditional conception of Dickens's characters-who, we may be sure, were very like the people we meet every day-she is to be heartily congratulated.

PRINCESs HELENE VON RACOWrTZA'S autobiography will have a peculiar interest for admirers of George Meredith's novels, and perhaps it is not by a coincidence that its appearance is synchronous with that of 'The Tragic Comedians' in the Memorial Edition of his works. It is now rather more than thirty years since the Princess published that account of her relations with Lassalle upon which Meredith relied as the main authority for the events he narrated and explained. His explanation, brilliant and masterly as it was, omitted a very important factor. After all, the strangest action of the heroine of the story was, not her submission to her family-which, had it been the action of one of his own heroines, Meredith would conceivably have praised -nor yet her marriage with the luckless Yanko, for which other reasons than pusillanimity present themselves, but her subsequent appearance in print as a champion, and a somewhat too com- placent champion, of her own part in the affair. Clotilde, the Princess as Meredith represents her, would have been both too astute and too self-conscious to have committed this astounding blunder. But the woman who committed it was the girl who had asked Lassalle whether the Countess Hatzfeld would have to live with them (an incident omitted by Mere. dith, who no doubt thought it an in. vention of the Princess's); and the first thing to recognize about Clotilde's original is that her perpetration of this blunder came out of a kind of innocence, that she perpetrated it without being aware what she was doing, in a spirit of in. genuousness, verging upon fatuity. "" This,"" she writes of her present volume, ""ranks as far above my first effort as the speech of ripe manhood does above the halting expression of a child."" The autobiography, then, convinces us that the story of ' The Tragio Comedians,' like that of another ""lady of high distinction for wit and beauty (curiously enough, Meredith's next), ""is to be read as fiction ""; nor is this decision prompted by the discovery of discrepancies of detail between the various versions or of inconsistencies in any of them, though not a few are discoverable. The whole course of the Princess Helene's life and the manner in which she tells of it reveal an individuality which has little in common with Clotilde's. She was early introduced to a brilliant and shifting society, and already at the age of fourteen was mistaken for her mother. Spice was added to her beauty by an impetuous, dashing manner, and she went on her way, vaguely drifting, spasmodically candid, playing in tie peculiar world in which she found hersel for no piize except its pleasures, it accepting these, in whatever form they offered themselves, with open arm. While still a child, she formed views of her own upon the fundamental things of life, and carried them into practice; bW she submitted formally to her parents' choice where suitors were concerned, s0 that, on meeting Lassalle when she va nineteen, she was the typical "" jeune file allemande,"" incapable of self-direction, and more than usually afraid of her elders because more conscious of her revolt against them and of its futility. Durng the short period of her engagement to Lassalle, she wanted, she says, "" to tell him all about my past life and my 'crimes against saintly morality '; but he interrupted me with an energetic motion of the hand. 'No! no! for heaven's sake don't let us have any Pompeian excavations! ' "" and the reader is sometimes tempted to wish that the advice had been remembered in the 'Autobiography.' The pages that treaty .of Lassalle are naturally the most interesting in the volume; but even without them it would be worth reading, so great is the variety of the writer's experiences, her psychology so unusual and so intimately revealed. She handles her pen with something of the negligence of a lady of quality, and it must have been in a similar spirit of negligence, with the support, of course, of her exuberant vitality, that she adopted at need, or was ready to adopt, the professions of actress, physician, artist, journalist, in turn-not without success or some promise of it in all. She was obliged to give up medical work shortly before her final examination, and took up flower - painting a little later when forced to lie on her back for a time. Indeed, there are many indications in the volume of a struggle with adversity which high standards of comfort cannot have rendered less acute, and the success with which she met one exigency after another is remarkable evidence of the writer's practical ability and common sense. It is not less remarkable, though less engaging, that she should retain in old age that total absence of the sense of fitness in things which was so conspicuous a feature of her youth. The conclusion of her narrative of the events which led to Lassalle's death (a narrative sincere and poignant, but marred by a recurrence of foolish and tasteless remarks) is puzzlingly absurd. The ""gigantic edifice of the German Empire"" must always, she writes, ""have seemed like a prison "" to Lassalle; "" I therefore ask whether we pigmies, all of us, were not mere puppets in the hand of destiny, and ueed gthe spirit of the world's history as the means of sweeping away the giant who could have found no place in the Empire."" It is not surprising to learn that the writer of this is a Theosophist who published anonymously some years ago a little book entitled 'Wie ich mein Selbst fand.' Her accounts of the many notable persons with whom she has come into contact -from Hans Andersen and Bulwer Lytton, of whom the latter would ""read aloud from his own works "" while "" in especially poetic passages his 'Alice' accompanied him with arpeggios on the harp,"" to Bjbrnstjerne Bj~rnson, ""the wonderful old athlete, his beautiful white curly hair standing straight up ""-are always vivid and amusing; and it is surprising that in a book in which personal jottings Play a large part, and much that is trivial is recorded, there should be few Pages that are dull. The mystery of the author's personality, her anarchic bohemianism, her sometimes childlike, sometimes childish candour, her clear Perception of the details of life, her dimness as to its larger outlines-in short, her combined experience and inexperienceengage attention from the first page to the last.PRINCESs HELENE VON RACOwiTzA: AN Au'ToriocaAPHT. Authorised translation from the German by CECIL MAR. Constable and Co. i 2r. 6d. net. Princess von Racowitza's claim to fame is the part she played as Helene von Danniger, in bringing about the death of Lassalle. Their friendship was regarded with extreme disfavour by the lady's family, who in the end managed to break off the match. Lassalle fought a duel with Racowitza, his rival, and (entirely by accident, the Princess assures us) received a fatal wound. She presently married the victor, who had been thrown over in favour of Lassalle. He lived only a few months, and the Princess afterwards appeared on the stage, wrote for the American newspapers, remarried and got a divorce and remarried again. She was a beautiful, passionate, and imperious person (owing not a little of her temperament, one imagines, to that enraged father who, when she ran away to Lassalle, dragged her by the hair across the street and nailed her up in her room), and her career is full of such adventures as those qualities invited. The story of the Lassalle tragedy has been made use of by George Meredith in htb Tragic Comediaws."

It is the true office of history,"" says Francis Bacon, to represent the events themselves, and to leave the observations and conclusions thereupon to the liberty and faculty of every man's judgment."" That is not the modern waay. History in the contemporary manner is often imaginative biography. Not only are the events represented, but the scene round these events is meticulously set. "" The Queen played with her glove, first drawing it out long, and then stretching it broad. Suddenly she asked her friend: ' Would you like to be a Protestant ? ' "" Or"" ' Oh, no, no ! ' said I)arnley, desperately rumpling his hair."" Employing such methods, this latest biography of the Queen of Scotland runs to close on fiv'e hundred pages. The advantages of such a method are its vividness and the emphasis it sets upon a story. Details build up a picture. Mary's beauty, her charm, her wvaywardness, her inflexible will, are described in many a scene and incident. Where history is content to remark on her superb horsemanship, Fraulein Kurlbaum-Siebert giv'es us a series of pictures of her on Stella, her bay mare: ""The Queen pushed right ahead of them all; her black habit, very plainly cut, clung close to the lines of her slender figure ; she wore a small black beret on her golden hair, closely plaited round her head."" The drawbacks of the method are no less plain. The detail becomes exhausting. The main events get obscured. The murder of Rizzio, the Craigmillar Pact, Carberry Hill, are each important incidents in the life of the Queen. In this book only the first stands out in any true perspective. Summing up, we should say that what emerges from the narrative most clearly is the relationship between AMary and Elizabeth of England. Elizabeth was a mistress in the art of diplomacy, and it is plainly shown to what extent Marv's marriage was a pawn in her game. The biography, by the way, does not take the story to its natural close at Fotheringay. It ends with Langside."

(Downey & Co.)?Of the 312 works, chiefly novels, produced by the Polish writer Kraszewski, we believe ' The Jew' is the only one which up to this time has been translated into English. The present story, however, has enjoyed great popularity among the author's countrymen, and it has been translated into both French and German. Perhaps the best thing which Kraszewski has left is his story of 'Jermola the Potter,' which first appeared in 1857, anticipating by four years ' Silas Marner,' which it greatly resembles. This was an extraordinary coincidence, for it is certain that the English author was unacquainted with the writing of her Polish contemporary. Of the present work we may say that it is lively and carries the reader along with it. The portraits of Augustus II. and his great rival Charles XII. are vigorous, and their supposed meeting at Dresden is dramatically conceived ; but the Polish king is such a thorough scoundrel that we cannot make a hero of him. We grow tired of him and his female favourites, and are sorry that the Countess Cosel, as she was called, should have fallen under his influence. The picture of the orgies of her drunken husband with Augustus and his revellers is repulsive. She is divorced, only to fall into greater misery after a brief triumph, and ends her days in prison. The poor Pole Zaklika, who loses his life for her, is an interesting figure. The book is illustrated with portraits, and deals with an epoch which is not very familiar to the English reader, who probably does not know much about Augustus the Strong and his skill in twisting horseshoes and bending iron bars, as the one preserved in the museum of St. Petersburg testifies. It must be confessed that Kraszewski had a great deal of skill in story-telling. He was a clever man all round, and has left some good poetry. Perhaps we may remind our readers that by order of the German Government he was arrested at Dresden on a frivolous charge of treason, and detained for some time in the fortress of Magdeburg. He died at Geneva, March 19th, 1887."
105,B3172,['3219056'],"the :3ookman's Cable. A SON OF THIE MIDDLE BORDER. By Hamlin Garland. 7s. 6d. (John Lane.) Mr. Ilamlin Garland, one of the truest and strongest of Western novelists, has spent nearly a year in England, and revelled in the fresh understanding it has given him of British nature and British problems. Those of us who know his books-"" Her Mountain Lover"" and the restare well aware of his sincerity of touch in writing and the effective humour he can put into the clash of character and type. Few up-to-date Western writers possess such real affinity with the Old World, and this gives him spiritual kinship with men of the past like Longfellow, Lowell and Howells-men who began by absorbing the best that America and her universities could give, and then completed their development by acquiring the best they could find in the travel and literature of Europe. It is one of the highest ambitions surely for an observer and interpreter to strengthen the bridge of sympathy that has for so long stretched across the Atlantic and has been for ever hallowed by joint service in the war. Mr. Garland is destined to be one of these, and we are glad of this biograph of a family to show what like of men he springs from. There is something of heroism in the drift of his father westward and ever westward in search of the unfailing crop and the kindly season; but it melts to pathos when the author has to follow westward and woo the old and disillusioned farmer back to the haunts of his boyhood, and persuade him that the West has been a cruel lure. Social conditions, especially after the civil war time, were harsh and inclement, but the native beauty of character and custom, the old-fashioned pieties and traditions, blend everything together into a texture of patience and content. The closing scenes where the kinsmen come together at a Thanksgiving feast are like a perfect sunset of human life."
106,B3831,"['4362019', '8780227']","THIE OtUARDIAiN- ANGEL 4 It is not easy to discover the drift of this poemn, and we incline to think that the author has stopped short of his original intention, and presented his readers only with a fragtment. But however this may be, "" The Guardian Angel "" is a work of merit. It is iin the form of a drama ; and the purpose seems to be to show the infiLlence of a good woman over a nature of fierce impulse. Agnes, the heroine, while, abroad, has saved Oliver from commmitting murder. On his retura t;) Wales he sees her aga.in, and appears anxious to marry her, so as to have his guardiani angel always at his side. But lhe falls over a cliff; and dies ; and whether Adrian, who is also in love with Agnes, marries her, we are not told. Nor does it appear that her influence over Oliver has been very effectual, for he plainly intends to murder Adrian a few minutes before he meets with his fatal accident. Thus the cliff over which he fell is better entitled to the name of the dramia than Agnes herself; and it seems rather due to his fall than to her that he dies in a Christian state of mind. The other poems are passable.Thc Guardian Angel. NEW NOVELS. By Oliver Wendell Holmes. 2 vols. (Low & Co.) To the more thoughtful and critical of those who are likely to peruse his new novel, Mr. Wendell Holmes is at pains to set forth, in a lengthy preface, the purpose of the tale, which relates to the character and doings of Myrtle Hazard, in whose blood an element of rebellious wildness, derived from an aboriginal Indian ancestor, is at war with the physical and moral forces which she inherits from her Anglo-Saxon progenitors. "" I have attempted,"" says the author, "" to show the successive evolutions of some inherited qualities in Ihe character ! of Myrtle Hazard, not so obtrusively as to disturb the narrative, but plainly enough to bc , kept in sight by the small class of preface- | readers."" The novel that requires to be thus ! explained in a preface is manifestly deficient' in one of the most important qualities of a i good tale ; and the worst that we have to urge | against 'The Guardian Angel' is said when j we admit that, without the author's considerate ? preface, we should certainly have failed to \ apprehend his special design, and that, even i with the aid of his prefatory intimation, we j are unable to see how his book is calculated ' to effect his object. Like its precursor, * Elsie Vernier,' the tale is termed by the author "" a j study of Reflex Function in its highest sphere,"" j by which term he fears that he may "" frighten | away all but the professors and learned ladies""; j and though, without laying claim to rank with j either of these two classes of severely philo- j sophie readers, we were in no way disposed to ' tremble at his hard words, we must confess j that, when we found the story dull and inco-! herent, they did not tend to influence our ; judgment in its favour. Throughout the earlier chapters, we were inclined to think well of the book, and to hope that, on working into the middle of the first volume, we should take a strong interest in the passionate child, whose peculiarities?amply accounted for by the cheerlessness of her life and the severity of her training in a gloomy home, and, therefore, by no means referable to the physical cause to which the author assigns them?are sketched with force and delicacy. But, as the novel progresses to the end of its first half, growing more devoid of "" story "" with every turn of a leaf, the heroine loses all power over the reader's imagination; and by the time she has tunied out a commonplace school-girl in a fashionable college for young ladies, she has altogether ceased to be in the slightest degree interesting as a psychological curiosity. Some of the subordinate personages of the drama are presented with cleverness. For instance, Mr. Byles Gridley, M.A., the mild, benevolent bookworm, is so well managed that, for the pleasure of watching his humorous nature and amiable disposition under circumstances more favourable to their display, we could wish that Mr. Holmes had put him on a better stage and given him a worthier part, as well as worthier companions. Some skill and originality are also shown in the coarse delineation of the Rev. Mr. Stoker, who is for a time Myrtle Hazard's religious adviser and ghostly enemy, and of whom it is recorded: "" The Rev. Mr. Stoker was a man of emotions. He loved to feel his heart beat; he loved all the forms of nonalcoholic drunkenness, which are so much better than the vinous, because they taste themselves so keenly, whereas the other (according to the statement of experts who are familia* with its curious phenomena) has a certain sense of unreality connected with it. He delighted in the reflex stimulus of the excitement be produced in others by working on their feelings. A powerful preacher is open to thc same sense of enjoyment?an awful, tremulous, gooseflesh sort of state, but still enjoyment,? that a great tragedian feels when he curdles the blood of his audience."" Some of Myrtle's feminine companions?especially her austere aunt, Miss Silence Withers, and her loyal defender, Nurse Byloe?exhibit artistic merits that might almost be extolled for excellence. But other characters of the story are just as poor and ludicrously insufficient for the purposes of romantic art as the better characters are commendable. Gifted Hopkins, the village poet, is perhaps the weakest andmost puerile piece oi'bad '! work in the book ; but in the portions of the tale ? that do not specially relate to this butt for i , Mr. Holmes's satire, there are characters, and ? I devices, and pieces of descriptive writing, that i * will occasion more surprise than gratification to ;' readers who have derived amusement from the 1.1 author's former works. But of all its many $ ; shortcomings, the chief fault of 'The Guardian i | Angel' is its almost total want of what is i j technically termed "" story."" So singularly de)! fective is it in this respect that, if Mr. 1 i Holmes should ever be required to re-issue the J ! work in a second edition, he would d<> well to I ? prepare readers for its most conspicuous failing ? by christening it' The Novel Without a Story?"
107,B6921,['6827082'],"Early Days at Uppingham under Edward Thring. By An Old Boy. (Macmillan. 3s. 6d. net.) About eleven years ago a writer in "" The Times,"" in the course of an article on Imperial Federation and Colonial Policy, referring to Edward Thring, headmaster of Uppingham, remarked that his influence on English thought and feeling had been second only to that of Dr. Arnold. That is most certainly the case, and, moreover, it is good to read such direct testimony to the enormous influence for good which can be, and often is, exercised by the headmaster of a great public school. For England, Great Britain?the Empire, in fact?owes very much more than we are usually inclined to acknowledge to her headmasters. A headmaster's power for good or ill is enormous. He has under his immediate charge, during the most receptive years of their lives, some hundreds of boys, drawn, as a rule, from the best-bred, most highly cultivated and most influential families in the land. He can, if he be a man of the Arnold-Thring stamp, mould them according to his ideal of what a right-thinking, useful member of the community ought to be?not only a good man in himself, but by example and precept the disseminating cause of goodness in others. There is no human being on earth so capable of doing good to his fellows as an English public-school boy, and to his honour be it -said that in every country in the globe, civilised or uncivilised, English publicschool men are re-teaching the lessons in truth, straightforwardness, fair-dealing, word-keeping, justice and uprightness which they learned at one or other of our great public schools. Thring was headmaster of Uppingham from September 1853 to October 1887, and during these four-andthirty years he turned out rather more than a generation of gentlemen?perhaps the greatest achievement of any one man in a given time. The writer of this little book rightly says of him: "" He always behaved like a gentleman to us, and we had to do the same to him. No sneaking where Teddy was concerned."" Throughout this biographical history of the school and its master there breathes the spirit of the man transmitted through the boy, now grown man himself. No headmaster, no earnest working man, could desire a higher testimony, a more lasting monument, than the tradition of honourable life implanted in a generation of schoolboys, and by them transmitted to generations of schoolboys still unborn. The book, in itself, is well put together; there are stories of old times, quaint observances now fallen into disuse, little bits of school folk-lore interesting to old boys, and typical of the inherent conservatism of schoolboy life. Altogether, a worthy book, suggestive and cheering. The Empire can come to no serious harm whilst the traditions of Arnold and Thring still live and are handed down from father to son. Frank Schloesser."
108,B2106,['6790764'],"Moltke in his Home. By F. A. Dressler. Translated by Mrs. C. E. Barrett-Lennard. (Murray, 6s.) The private life of a great soldier is not often so interesting as that which, already well known, is once more described in Herr Dressler's recollections. Lord Methuen, in a brief introduction to the book, remarks on the simplicity and refinement of the Marshal and contrasts him with the other great creator of the German Empire, Bismarck. The comparison is fair and natural enough, but it is more amusing to compare von Moltke, in private life, with Frederick the Great. We have, it is true, no portrait of the former with a phial of poison in one pocket and a quire of bad verses in the other, and in lesser details the comparison emphasises the fact that Moltke was a gentleman and Frederick was not. The comparison may have been for this reason fanciful but it is inevitably suggested by this book. Herr Dressier tells us nothing very new, and a good deal of what he has to say is very small beer, yet his book is interesting because he had excellent opportunities, as a musician in great favour, of observing Moltke in every aspect of private life. Nor does he spare his patron: for instance, he tells how Moltke disliked losing at cards, so that his family were trained to let him win. But the great man showed to better advantage on his country estate or as a musical critic than as a card-player, and best of all on the battlefield or during those arduous years of preparation for the strife. When there was a torchlight procession in his honour, on his ninetieth birthday, he whispered to his adjutant: "" Had I but lost a battle, they would be saying * There goes the old donkey.'"" The remark may be true, but Moltke was spared the ill-usage which has befallen many great and successful generals. ""To soldiers,"" writes Lord Methuen, ,""he set the example of how to work through and for others, not to play for our own hand, and not to seek to enhance our own interest by means of self-advertisement."" That epitaph rings all the more true for having come from the pen of one of the most modest of our living generals."

The Marquise de Keroubec is so attractive a lady that one would like to know more about her; for her memoirs only contain thirty-two entries for the seventy odd years which they cover. Whether, in this English version, we have them complete is left in doubt, for whereas on the title page they are described as "" extracts from her diaries,"" in the publisher's foreword we are told that "" the memoirs are presented in their entirety."" Nor is any information vouchsafed as to the French edition, if there be one. Except for an occasional foot-note the translator, who is anonymous, sticks to his translating. He does not even comment on the fact that the title of Keroubec is absent from the French peerage books. But these fragments, so far as they go, certainly give a lively picture of the life of a French lady of fashion in the provinces under the ancien regime, and during the early days of the Revolution, as an emigrie in England, with the army of invasion, at Paris, where she went on the stage for a time, in the country again and back in Paris under the Directory, the Empire and the restored monarchy. Readers of Abel Hermant's Confidences d'une A feule will be struck by the extraordinary way in which they are anticipated by Madame de Keroubec's adventures. But although the latter's esprit gaulois is noted by her publisher, she is reticence itself compared with M. Hermant's marquise."
110,B2546,"['8774297', '8943685', '3211357']","The Works pf George Peele. TJ..11? t? A "" ? Edited by A. H. x>uuen, u.a. 2 vols. (Nimmo.) After the labour involved in his edition of Middleton, Mr. Bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of Feele almost a holiday task. Not that the text of Peele offers little difficulty to an editor. It is, on the contrary, in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled, and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves. In one case, indeed, that of Peele's Scriptural drama ' David and Bethsabe/ the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out. Not even in the case of a Bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot. Wherever the reader turns, indeed, difficulty besets him, and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied. Practically, most that could be done for Peele was done by Dyce, to whom, in the opening sentence of his introduction, Mr. Bullen pays full homage. Sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of Dyce's edition of Peele, and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories. New facts concerning Peele's history have been dragged to light, and of these Mr. Bullen has naturally made use. In the Athenceum of July 2nd, 1881, the new matter of most interest concerning Peele which appears in this latest edition first saw the light. It is there shown that George Peele, whom Pavne Collier confidently stated to be the son of Stephen Peele, a bookseller and a ballad-writer, was in fact the son of James Peele, clerk of Christ's Hospital, where the dramatist was educated. Successive advances towards George Peele's education are chronicled in the Court Book, as is the easily understood order to the clerk "" to discharge bis howse of his sonne George Peele . .. before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure."" The passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new Peele, though Mr. Bullen's indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries. In the editorial part of his task Mr. Bullen has been aided by Mr. P. A. Daniel, through whose hands every proof and revise has passed. Mr. Daniel's name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays. Not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that Mr. Bullen adopts. In the cases in which Mr. Bullen departs most widely from Dyce we are generally in accord with him. The authority for assigning to Peele ' Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes' is a MS. note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play, which attributes it to Peele. Dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed. Though slow to differ from his predecessor, Mr. Bullen, who has wisely included the play in his collection, ""cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school."" Mr. Bullen's sound instinct has not deceived him. It is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of ' David and Bethsabe' and' The Old Wives' Tale.' It is true, however, that except some tricks of phrase the various works of Peele have little in common. If we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this, the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard. That standard is obtained in 'The Old Wives' Tale/ 'The Arraignment of Paris/ and in ' David and Bethsabe/ though concerning the play last named Mr. Sullen, who regards it as "" exasperatingly insipid?a mess-of cloying sugar plums,"" declares that he does not care ""two straws for it."" Cloying no doubt much of it is, and it is essentially undramatic, but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to Peele. The golden curls Of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period, and the whole has a sort of Eastern extravagance of language which Peele rarely employs elsewhere, and which was doubtless intended. A beauty of ex. pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in ' The Arraignment of Paris' where our author speaks of Yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold. Two other lines, a little Spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of Lord Tennyson. The lines are And round about the valley as ye pass Ye may ne see for peeping flowers the grass. The resemblance between the second of these lines and that in ' The Two Voices,' You scarce could see the grass for flowers, gave Milton some hints for' Comus.'"" It is more than probable ; it is all but certain that Milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints, but the scheme of' Comus.' TocompareMilton's work with that of his predecessor would, of course, be futile. From whatever source Milton took ""son bien"" he made it his own. The resemblance is not, however, confined to the points which have been frequently indicated?the two brothers, the sister who is lost, the necromancer who turns men into beasts, &c?it extends even to expressions. The very phraseology of ' Comus' is, to a certain extent, taken from ' The Old Wives' Tale.' Traces of imitation, moreover, on the part of Milton, though they are most obvious in this instance, are not confined to this play. Vigorous passages are less common in Peele than in other dramatists of his epoch; but such even are to be found, and Peele is occasionally touched by the "" fine fury "" which is the distinguishing attribute of the Elizabethan drama. In his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree. The rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance. Some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between '' beauty"" and ""excellency."" Similar instances abound. To force, however, as is done at the opening of' Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes,''' environ"" to rhyme to "" ocean "" may be regarded as a master-stroke. As the play is of dubious authority, Peele, who has enough to answer for without it, may escape the responsibility for this. In the lyrics inserted in his plays, supposing them to be his, he shows himself at his best. "" Cupid's Curse"" in the'Arraignment of Paris' is an exquisite ditty. It is pleasant, too, to find that the credit of the fine sonnet "" His golden locks time hath to silver turned,"" which has been attributed to the Earl of Essex, belongs to Peele. With the plays Mr. Bullen gives the poems and other works of Peele, including 'The Jests of George Peele.' To some portions of these Mr. Bullen assigns a quasi-autobiographical flavour. In this he is probably right. The jests themselves, however, are the common property of Renaissance story-tellers. Some of them doubtless are, as Mr. Saintsbury states, assignable to the ' Eepues Franches' of Villon, Jestbooks, however, in all times have been the same, and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity. In get-up the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong, and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature. Facsimiles of MSS. of interest are given, and the miniature title of the unique ' Tale of Troy' is copied. It is pleasant to find Mr. Bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacity.The Works of George Meredith. Memorial Edition. Vols. ""I.-VL (Constable & Co.) This Memorial Edition of Meredith's works is a pleasant compromise between the rival claims of stateliness and use. For the greater part of its life a book is an article of furniture, and stands upon the shelf, to decorate the library with its patch of colour and glow of kindly associations ; but from time to time there occur those crises of its existence when it is taken down and read. Books are as a rule designed primarily to meet these crises, and Meredith is in a peculiar degree an author whose significance is only to be discerned by reading him. Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, delightful as they are, can all be, if we choose to make them so, delightful memories; and so clear are they in their place as to be intelligible almost at second-hand. But Meredith is still side by side with us; as a name on the shelf he is an enigma, and there is no choice between living familiarity with him and vexed confusion. On this account he does not readily lend himself to the statuesque habiliments of a *"" Library "" edition, which too often destines the author to be ranked in monumental impressiveness, remaining mute. Yet a Memorial Edition would not fulfil its object if it were not monumental in appearance ; and the twenty and more volumes which the edition before us is to comprise, though a little large for comfort, have an appropriate dignity which is pleasantly emphasized by their sober green attire. They are novels, and a novel is a book to be read in relaxation ; one hand ought to be enough for it; these really require two. On the other side it may be said that this edition is illustrated (and illustrations are mostly not worth looking at unless they are of a certain size), while the clear type is relieved by a margin neither too narrow nor too broad. We have, in fact, a page printed on sound paper, free from eccentricities, and asking, not to be stared at, but to be read. The illustrations are certainly an interesting feature. It is a pity that the open- ing portrait has such a misty look ; a new view of Meredith is presented in it, his piercing and soaring activity of mind ? which is more familiar ? yielding, under the touch of age, to a quality of clear introspection, mixed with meditative sadness. The photographs of various houses in which he lived or worked, or scenes familiar to him and to the characters in his novels, are tastefully done, and, though placed somewhat at random in the text, suggestive in their degree. Charles Keene's dxawings for ' Evan Harrington,' of which five are reproduced, will, as time goes on, become increasingly valuable as illustrations, apart from their native character and charm. The picture of Evan wearing his tall hat in the greenhouse, while his lady-love, her hair neatly netted upon her neck, honours him with the present of a rose (it is a critical moment in* their romance), recalls to us, better than a volume of history, the public and the mind of the public which Meredith originally addressed, and which, as was very natural, only accorded him a qualified appreciation.THE WORKS OF GEORGE MEREDITH. 17 vols. 6s. each. (Constable.) To fall back on a well-worn phrase. there is nothing cheap about this "" Standard Edition "" of Meredith's works except the price. The paper is good, the type clear and of a comfortable size, and the books tastefully bound in blue cloth with gilt tops. Eight of the volumes have been issued, the two latest being "" Harry Richmond "" and "" Beauchamp's Career."" The Poetical Works are issued in uniform style for an extra half-crown, so that in eighteen volumes at a total cpst of about five pounds one rtay now possess the whole of Meredith's writings. His greatness as novelist and poet are no longer in question; his place in our literature is secure. Certain of his admirers have injured his popularity by exaggerating the difficulties of his style; but that talk is dying down, arid the new generation of readers is suspecting that it reflected rather on the limitationL oqf those admirers than on the art of the Master."

It deals with a schooner's voyage to an uncharted guano island in the South Pacific, and its author would appear to possess one qualification for his work which is but seldom found in the books of those who romance about the sea: he writes as one who could sail, and probably has sailed, a schooner. His plot is threadbare, his characters are more puppets, his principal situations are drawn from the stock properties of fiction ; but his navigation is as sound as his seamanship. These things are rare in fiction, and in this case lend distinction to an otherwise colourless narrative. Why is ""Alf"" modelled on Dickensian lines? No Sydney larrikin was ever in the least like this tiresome character; and the author, who appears to know his Sydney, from Woolloomooloo to Pott's Point, must know this."

This is a very clever, epigrammatic hook,? and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker, who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in London between 1740 and 1760. The story is all but identical with the play called ' Masks and Faces,' recently produced at the Haymarket Theatre,? and Known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of Mr. Tom Taylor and Mr. Charles Reade. We spoke highly of the play on its appearance,?and must speak highly now of the novel; but really we are at a loss to know to whom, and in what proportion, this praise properly belongs. Mr. Reade, whose name alone appears on the title-page of the novel, speaks nevertheless of Mr. Tom Taylor as ""his friend and coadjutor,"" ""to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale,"" and pays him with a Dedication. This seams to us something very like dedicating a maB's work to himself. Or, the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of Mr. Reade. Mr. Taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what Garrick was pleased to call the "" concoction"" of the piece; and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the novel aa Golman and Garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in ' The Clandestine Marriage.'? Leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can, we must tnrn to the book itself. There has been of late "" an amiable weakness"" in favour of one or two once well-known actresses. Mr. Cunningham, in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of Charles the Second, gave an undue importance to Nell Gwyn,? and Mr. Reade and Mr. Taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to Peg Woffington. Not much is known of either actress,?and Peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of Nelly. Margaret Woffington was an Irish girl of great beauty, who came from the Dublin stage and made her first appearance on the London boards in 1740,?the year before Garrick appeared at Goodman'8 Fields. She "" took "" at once;?but, as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses, there was a diversity of feeling about her. Walpole speaks of her to Mann, in 1741, as a had actress who was much in vogue:? adding, "" but she has life."" He would seem to have disliked her from the first (but then he admired Kitty Clive); for, his friend, General Conway, writes to him in 1740,?"" So you cannot bear Mrs. Woffington ; yet all the town is in love with her. To say the truth, I am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance, for I think she is an impudent Irish-faced girl."" She was, in short, what Tate Wilkinson called her, ""a wanton, arch wag,""?admirably adapted for certain characters, which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation. She died unmarried in the year 17G0, Wore she was forty; and was buried in Teddington Church, on the banks of the Thames:?where her grave is marked by a modest tablet. Such was Peg Woffington's story ; and if the Wader would see what she was like in face, let him refer to Faber's engraving of her as Mrs. Ford, ? to Van Bleek's engraving of her as Phoebe, in a hat,?and, better still, to M'Ardell's fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand. If from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown Mrs. Woffington, let him go to Bowood, ?and there he will see what the Woffington was like, and how fine a portrait-painter Hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject. We remember the Bowood picture well. There Pee is?a sort of half-length,?in pink and blue, with a yellow hat trimmed with lace, a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin, and such a face! The picture is worthy of Rembrandt,? if Rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas. The characters in this story?as in the play? are, Peg Woffington herself,?a Mr. Vane, a Shropshire Squire, having a young and lovely wife, yet in love with Mrs. Woffington,?a Sir Charles Pomander, a second edition of Lord Foppington,?a poor poet-painter, namedTriplet and his wife,?Colley Cibber,?Mr. Quin,?and a few others. The scene is laid at a time "" when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only think,""?and the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of Mrs. Wofflngton's nature. The heroine is thus described in the book:?we group the several descriptions together.? "" Mrs. Woffington, as an actress, justified a portion of this enthusiasm; she was one of the truest artists of her day; a fine lady in her hands was a lady, with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman, not a harlot's affectation, which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady; an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman, thoroughly old, not a cackling young person of epicene gender. She played Sir Harry Wilduir like a man, which is how he ought to be played (or, which is better still, not at all), so that Garrick acknowledged her as a male rival, and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized. * * She was dressed in a rich silk gown, pearl white, with flowers and sprigs embroidered; her beautiful white neck and arms were bare. She was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand, learning it off by heart; at the other end of the room she turned, and now she shone full upon him. It certainly was a dazzling creature: she had a head of beautiful form, perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster, a symmetrical brow, black eyes full of fire and tenderness, a delicious mouth, with a hundred varying expressions, and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love, or scorn, a sneer, or a smile. But she had one feature more remarkable than all, her eyebrows?the actor's feature,?they were jet black, strongly marked, and in repose were arched like a rainbow; but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside Margaret Woffington's. In person she was considerably above the middle height, and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure. At one time it seemed all stateliness, at another time elegance personified, and flowing voluptuousness nt another. She was Juno, Psyche, Hebe, by turns, and for aught we know at will. * * Her bright skin, contrasted with her powdered periwig, became dazzling. She used little rouge, but th.it little made her eyes two balls of black lightning. From her high instep to her polished forehead, all was symmetry. Her leg would have been a sculptor's glory; and the curve from her waist to her knee, was Hogarth's line itself. She stood like Mercury new lighted on a heaven-kissing hill. She placed her foot upon the ground, as she might put a hand upon her lover's shoulder. * * This lady was subject to two unpleasant companions, sorrow and bitterness. About twice a-week she would cry for two hours; and after this class of fit she generally went abroad, and made a round of certain poor or siek prote'ye's she had, and returned smiling and cheerful."" Sir Charles Pomander is thus described;? and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout.? "" This Sir Charles Pomander was a gentleman of vice: pleasure he called it. Mr. Vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in Shropshire. Sir Charles, who husbanded everything except his soul, had turned himself out to grass for a month. His object was, by roast mutton, bread with some little flour in it, air, water, temperance, chastity, and peace, to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals."" Here is a sample of our author's skill in bringing a dead actress?Mrs. Oldfield?into life.? "" I saw a brigadier-general cry like a child at her Indiana; I have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing (for she was always a great sufferer). I have seen her then spring upon the stage as Lady Townley, and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy; the air seemed to fill with singing birds, that chirped the pleasures of fashion, love, and youth, in notes sparkling like diamonds, and stars, and prisms. She was above criticism, out of its scope, as is the blue sky; men went not to judge her, they drank her, and gazed at her, and were warmed at her, and refreshed by her. The fops were awed into silence, and with their humbler betters thanked Heaven for her, if they thanked it for anything."" Colley Cibber is thus described.? ""This Cibber was the only actor since Shakespeare's time who had both acted and written well. Pope's personal resentment misleads the reader of English poetry as to Cibber's real place among the wits of the day. The man's talent was dramatic, not didactic, or epic, or pastoral. Pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters, and Cibber was one of its luminaries; he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day. Ile also succeeded where Dryden, for lack of true dramatic taste, failed. He tampered successfully with Shakespeare. Colley Cibber's version of' Richard the Third' is impudent and slightly larcenic, but it is marvellously effective. It has stood a century, and probably will stand for ever; and the most admired passages, in what literary humbugs who pretend they know Shakespeare by the closet, not the stage, accept as Shakespeare's ' Richard,' are Cibber's. Mr. Cibber was now in private life, a mild edition of his own Lord Foppington; he had none of the snob-fop as represented on our conventional stage; nobody ever had, and lived. He was in tolerably good taste; but he went ever gold-laced, highly-powdered, scented and diamonded, dispensing graceful bows, praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead, and satire of all who were here to enjoy it. Mr. Vane, to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters, looked with some awe on this veteran, for he had seen many Woffingtons. He fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart. He asked Mr. Cibber what he thought of Mrs. Woffington. The old gentleman thought well of the young lady's talent, especially her comedy; in tragedy, said he, she imitates Mdlle. Dumesnil, of the Theatre Francais, and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress. The next question was not so fortunate. ' Did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the whole?'?Mr. Cibber opened his eyes, a slight flush came into his washleather face, and he replied : ' I have not only seen many equal, many superior to her, but I have seen some half-dozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again, and not known they had done anything out of the way.' "" The stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of Cibber.? ""' When I was young, two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage, where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas. They played Roxana and Statira in the 'Rival Queens.' Rival queenB of ait themselves, they put out all their strength. In the middle of the last act the town gave judgment ia favour of Statira. What did Roxana? Did she spill grease on Statira's robe as Peg Woffington would J or btab her, as I believe Kitty here capable of doing ? No! Statira was never so tenderly killed as that night: she owned this to me. Roxana bade tlie theatre farewell that night, and wrote to Statira thus_I give you word for word: ""Madam,the beat judge we have, has decided in your favour. I shall never play second on a stage where I have been first so long, but I shall often be a spectator, and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than I, who have felt its weight. My wardrobe, one of the best in Europe, is of no use to me; if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me, and I shall fancy I see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than before.""'?.'And what did Statin answer, Sir?' said Mr. Vane, eagerly.?'She answered thus: ""Madam, the town has often been wrong, and may have been so last night, in supposing that I vied successfully with your merit; but thus much is certain?and here, Madam, I am the best judge?that off the stage you have just conquered me. I shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured, and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators, unless, indeed, the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion.' ""?' Whatacouple of stiff old things,' said Mrs. Clive."" Here is Vane's description of Mrs. Woffington.? "" He drew Pomander aside. ' What a simplicity there is in Mrs. Woffington!' said Vane; 'the rest, male and female, are all so affected; she is so fresh and natural. They are all hothouse plants; she is a cowslip with the May dew on it.'?' What you take for simplicity, is her refined art,' replied Sir Charles. ?'No!' said Vane, ' I never saw a more innocent creature!' Pomander laughed in his face; this laugh disconcerted him more than words; he spoke no more?he sat pensive. He was sorry he had come to this place, where everybody knew his goddess; yet nobody admired, nobody loved, and alas! nobody respected her. He was roused from his reverie by a noise; the noise was caused by Cibber felling on Garrick, whom Pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of Colley Cibber's day. * I tell you,' cried the veteran,' that this Garrick has banished dignity from the stage, and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire; but it is smoke and vapour. His manner is little, like his person, it is all fuss nnd bustle. This is his idea of a tragic scene: A littte fellow comes bustling in, goes bustling about, and runs bustling out.' Here Mr. Cibber left the room, to give greater effect to his description, but presently returned in a mighty pother, saying: '"" Give me another horse!"" Well, where's the horse? don't you see I'm waiting for him? ""Bind up my wounds!"" Look sharp now with these wounds. ""Have mercy, Heaven!"" but be quick about it, for the pit can't wait for Heaven. Bustle! bustle! bustle!' The old dog was so irresistibly funny, that the whole company were obliged to laugh."" A good scene in the novel, as it was in the is that wherein Vane's wife arrives in condon, and is accidentally present when Mrs. Woffington and some other of the dramatis persona? are guests at her husband's house. Here is a portion of it.? ""' I beg your pardon, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will forgive me. It is six months since I saw him ?jo you understand?I warrant me you did not look forme so soon, ladies?""?* Some of us did not look for you at all, Madam,' ?aid Mrs. Woffington_' What, Ernest did not tell you he expected me?'?'No! He told us this banquet was in honour of a lady's first visit to his house, but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife.' Vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue, whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him. ' He intended to steal a march on us,' said Pomander, drily; 'and with your help, we steal one on him;' and he smiled maliciously on Mrs. Woffington. ' But, Madam,' said Mr. Quin,' the moment you did arrive, I kept sacred for you a bit of the fat; for which, I am sure, you must be ready. Pass her plate!'?' Not at present, Mr. Quin,' said Mr. Vane, hastily. ' She is about to retire and change her travelling dress.'?* Yes, dear; but you forget, lam a stranaer to your friends. Will you not introduce me to them first?'_'No, no!' cried Vane, in trepidation. 'It is not usual to introduce in the beau monde.'?' We always introduce ourselves,'rejoined Mrs. Woffington; and she rose slowly, with her eye on Vane. He cost a look of abject entreaty cm her; but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye. He closed his own eyes, and waited for the blow. Sir Charles threw himself back in his chair, and chuckling, prepared for the explosion. Mrs. Woffington saw him, and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn; and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while. At length: ' The Honourable Mrs. Quickly, Madam,' said she, indicating Mrs. Clive. This turn took them all by surprise. Pomander bit his lip. ' Sir John Brute?' ?'Falstaff,' cried Quin; 'hang it.'?'Sir John Brute Falstaff,' resumed Mrs. Woffington. 'We call him, for brevity, Brute. Vane drew a long breath. * Your neighbour is Lord Foppington; a butterfly of some standing, and a little gouty.'?'Sir Charles Pomander.'?' Oh!' cried Mrs. Vane. ' It is the good gentleman who helped us out of the slough, near Huntingdon. Ernest, if it had not been j for this gentleman, I should not have had the pleasure of being here now.' And she beamed on the good Pomander. Mr. Vane did not rise and embrace Sir Charles."" | A more touching scene is that between Sir Charles Pomander and Mrs. Vane?Sir Charles is in love with Mrs. Vane.? "" Now, Sir Charles was naturally welcome to Mrs. Vane; for all 6he knew of him was, that he bad helped her on the road to her husband? Pomander. ' What, Madam! all alone here as in Shropshire?'?Mabel. 'For the moment, Sir.'? Pomander. ' Force of habit. A husband with a wife in Shropshire is so like a bachelor.'?Mabel. 'Sir!'?Pomander. 'And our excellent Ernest is such a favourite!'?Mabel. 'No wonder, Sir.'Pomander. ' Few can so pass from the larva state of country squire to the butterfly nature of beau.'? Mabel. ' Yes,' (sadly) ' I find him changed.'?Pomander. ' Changed! Transformed. He is now the prop of the * Cocoa Tree,' the star of Ranelagh, the Luuzun of the green room.'?Mabel. ' The green room ! Where is that? You mean kindly, Sir; but you make me unhappy.'?Pomander. ' The green room, my dear Madam, is the bower where houris put off their wings, and goddesses become dowdies; where Lady Macbeth weeps over her lap-dog, dead from repletion; and Belvidere soothes her broken heart with a dozen of oysters: in a word, it is the place where actors and actresses become men and women, and act their own parts with skill, instead of a poet's, clumsily.'?Mabel. 'Actors! actresses! Does Mr. Vane frequent such?*?Pomander. ' He has earned in six months a reputation many a fine gentleman would give his ears for. Not a scandalous journal his initials have not figured in; not an actress of reputation gossip has not given him for a conquest.'?' How dare you say this to me?' cried Mrs. Vane, with a sudden flash of indignation, and then the tears streamed over her lovely cheeks; and even a Pomander might have forborne to torture her so; but Sir Charles had no mercy. ' You would be sure to learn it,'said he; 'and with malicious additions: It is better to hear the truth from a friend.'?'A friend ? He is no friend to a house who calumniates the husband to the wife. Is it the part of a friend to distort dear Ernest's kindliness and gaiety into ill morals; to pervert his love of poetry and plays into an unworthy attachment to actors and?oh !' and the tears would come. But she dried them, for now she hated this man ; with all the little power of hatred she had, she detested him. 'Do you suppose I did not know Mrs. Woffington was to come to us today ?' cried she, struggling passionately against her own fears and Sir Charles's innuendoes. 'What!' cried he; 'you recognized her? You detected the actress of all work under the airs of Lady Betty Modish ??'Lady Betty Modish!' cried Mabel: 'that good, beautiful face!'?'Ah!' cried Sir Charles,' I see you did not. Well, Lady Betty was Mrs. Woffington!'?'Whom my husband, I know, had invited here to present her with these verses, which I shall take him for her;' and her poor little lip trembled. ' Had the visit been in any other character, as you are so base, so cruel as to insinuate (what have I done to you that you kill me so, you wicked gentleman !) would he have chosen the day of my arrival?'?'Not if he knew you were coming,' was the cool reply.?' And he did know?I wrote to him.'?' Indeed !' said Pomander, fairly puzzled. Mrs. Vane caught sight of her handwriting on the tray and darted to it, and seized her letter, and mid. triumphantly: * My last letter, written upon th* road?see!' Sir Charles took it with surprise, but turning it in his hand a cool satirical smile came to his face. He handed it back, and said coldly: ' Read me the passage, Madam, on which you argue.*1 Poor Mrs. Vane turned the letter in her hand, and her eye became instantly glazed; the seal was un. broken! She gave a sharp cry of agony, like a wounded deer. She saw Pomander no longer; she was alone with her great anguish. ' I had but my husband and my God in the world,' cried she. ? My mother is gone. My God, have pity on me! my husband does not love me.'"" There is a mistake in this book which the author will do well to amend in another edition. The very clever scene in which Mrs. Woffington imitates Mrs. Bracegirdle's acting, and leads Cibber to believe that the real Bracegirdle is before him?could not have occurred, we conceive, as far as Cibber was concerned.?What! Mrs. Woffington, who had never seen Mrs. Bracegirdle act, deceive by an imitation of that lady the best judge of acting ? witness the famous Apology ? that this country has yet seen ! The thing is impossible; ?for Cibber had acted in the same plays with her hundreds of times, and had his eyes and his senses to the last. Mr. Vane might have been deceived,?but not Colley Cibber."
114,B6219,['5067427'],"Sketch ofthe Life, Character, and Writings, of Baroness de Stael-Holstein. -, ?.-3?, v ..?. _..??._ By Madame Necker de Saussure. Translated from the French, bvo. pp. 30J. London, IS 20. Madame de Stael was a lady possessed o' such extraor- dinary genius and splendid talents, and filled so important a part in the literature and politics of the time in which she lived, that whatever relates to her as illustrative either of her public or private character, cannot fail of being interesting. The first of female writers, perhaps, of this or of auy age, she not only possessed a commanding influence in France during the most eventful period of its history, but her opinions were inquired after with eagerness, and respected, if not admired, in every state of Europe. Some persons have affected to question the moral tendency of the writings of Madame de Stael, and, passing over the knowledge of human nature, the fidelity of observation, and the acuteness of remark, which she displayed in all her writings, haye, with a most fastidious delicacy, carped at some passages, which, taken even abstractedly, were never doubtful. The present work does not contain a regular biographical memoir of this illustrious woman; but a critical examination of her writings, aud a variety of anecdotes of her domestic and social life; and, when it is known that these anecdotes are related by the friend and near relation of Madame de Stael, who was honoured by her with the appellation of sister, and passed many years of her life in the closest intimacy with her, it will not be doubted that they are highly interesting. We will not follow Madame de Saussure through her critical remarks on the respective works, of Madame de Stael, and this is the less necessary as their superior excellence is now universally acknowledged ; but shall content ourselves with making one extract from this part of the work, and then puss on to that part of it which describes her in private life, which is the more interesting as it is the least known. In u ' general examination ofthe talents of Madame de Stael,' the author remarks :? ? Before she appeared, religion and knowledge had their separate defenders. These two grand causes have been pleaded, as we may say, in opposition: each finding itself a stranger to a whole system of ideas, there has been, in this respect, a secret division among mankind, one party only appearing to tolerate the reign of reason, the other that of faith, out of pure civility. ' Madame de Stael alone has embraced, with equal zeal, the party of knowledge and that of religion: she alone has adopted, from the bottom of her heart, whatever was best in different ages; combating, on one side, ancient prejudices and ignorance, and, on the other, modern selfishness and incredulity. ' ' Madame de Stael loved what was about her, and extended to human nature her affection for her friends. What her style wants of minute finish, is more than compensated by the charm of the first impulse, by the freshness ofthe inspiration, if I may venture to use the term, lt is the stream gushing with vivacity from the fountain, that sparkles as it flows. * But something else may be remarked in her talents than this combination of different faculties: there is a marked originality in each, yet all bearing a similar stamp, which is pe. culiar to Madame de Stael. T his peculiar stamp originates from her character, from the strength as well as the versatile nature of her impressions, from those sudden bursts of indignation, of compassion, of haughtiness, and also from her never ceasing to be a woman. * This last is, perhaps, her secret charm. She addresses herself as a woman to the reader, and presents herself personally to him, to tell him what passes in her mind, and also in his own. But she is aware, that he would soon forget her being a woman, if she ceased to appear amiable or attractive to him: accordingly, whether she endeavours to instruct or dazzle, she never overpowers him with her superioritv; ^he never arrogates to herself any pre-eminence. It seems' as if chance had afforded her a good place at the theatre of moral affairs, and she recited what was thus offered to her view. * Sometimes, too, she presents herself as a child guiding a wiseman, whose sight is a little indistinct. She explains to him all he perceives confusedly, and places him in a bright sunshine, that he may see a little more clearly himself. When she comes to lead him through steep and difficult paths, she says to him, "" do not be afraid; you will be glad you have passed; we shall soon get safe out of it."" Constantly endeavouring to render the road agreeable to him, she brings herself forward to divert him, by rallying herself a little for the strong impressions she receives. Persons, words, faces, accents, attitudes,dresses, every thing, in fact, strikes her, everv thing is characteristic in her pictures. She knows herself as well as she knows others; and that blind instinct, which so frequently determines us to like or dislike, is in hera feeling founded on motives, of which she gives a clear account. ' The precision of her views is such, that we forget their extreme clelicacy. She has no vain subtilty, does not compel r j her readers to discern what is imperceptible, but even* thing l ? enlarges under her hands. lier whole attention is bent for ail instant to each point, and it becomes so distinct to her, that none of its bearings escape her notice: but she takes care to connect threads too slender of themselves with others more strong, the importance of which is acknowledged. Thus we easily pass with her from the particulars to the whole, and we find ourselves at once at the root of ideas, when we fancied we were only tracing their remotest ramifications.' ' The copiousness of her thoughts is extraordinary. Perhaps no writer has equalled her in this respect. Take at a venture any three of her pages, and three of the authors most abounding in wit, we may venture a wager that the number of striking and original ideas will be greatest in Madame de Stael. Not that she affects conciseness; every thought is amply furnished with the necessary words; but we are not accustomed to see so many thoughts together, and perhaps there are two many?perhaps certain phrases, which are superfluous to the train of reasoning, have on the mind the effect of those bits of cloth in the harpsichord, which stop the vibration of one string before another is struck. The succession of thoughts is too rapid and continual in Madame de Stael, to allow ordinary minds to keep pace with it. She is the goddess of plenty; she scatters from full hands, corn, pearls, roses, ribands, and diadems. We would Jet nothing escape us, because every thing is of value; but we may be fatigued in collecting it/ ' On the whole, the works of Madame de Stael appear to belong to a new age; they announce, as they tend to produce, another period in society and in literature; the age of strong, generous, animated thoughts; sentiments proceeding from the bottom of the heart, She has furnished the idea of a literature in some sort, rather spoken than written; of a kind in which the extempore speaking of national assemblies, unrestrained confidence, and conversational sallies, inform us more strongly and more intimately of politics, of the passions, and of society, than studied rhetoric has ever done.' The second part of this work is entitled, ' Social and Domestic Life of Madame de Stael,' and consists of a series of characteristic anecdotes, best calculated to exhibit this estimable woman in the truest light :?? * The distinctions between different kinds of attachment were never less marked than in her. The sentiment was one and the same in her, and assumed the decided cast of her character, much more than that of the different relations of life, or the disposition of the persons she loved. In her, maternal and filial affection, friendship, gratitude, all seemed love, lhere was passion, or at least emotion, in all her attachments. They appeared to differ rather in intensity than in kind; and they were naturally expansive, ardent, impetuous, and even stormy; not that these storms were the effect of any caprice in Madame de Stael, but she revolted against the obstacles which the frame of society, and often human indolence, oppose to the enjoyments of the heart. For a long time she comprehended only her own manner of loving; for a long time she refused to believe the existence of sincere sentiments, that did not express themselves like hers; and the clear knowledge that she had of herself led her into error, when she judged of others from herself. But her most ardent reproaches were also the most affecting; her love was conspicuous through her anger. She never gave pain to another, but because she felt more herself, and you could not avoid pitying her, even when she wounded you most severely.' The affection of Madame de Stael for her father, evinced itself on every occasion, by the most watchful attention on him during his life; and, after his death, she conceived she had lost ever\r earthly comfort with him :? 1 It would be necessary to relate how every day passed with Madame de Stael, if we would give an idea of the place that her deceased father constantly retained in her heart. She never ceased to live with him. She always felt herself protected, consoled, succoured by him. She invoked him in her prayers; and never did any occurrence, that was fortunate for her, take place, without her saying, iC My father obtained that for n.e."" His miniature she always carried about her, and it was to her the object of a kind of superstition. She never parted with it, except on one occasion. Very ill herself, and finding great consolation in contemplating this portrait, she imagined that when her daughter lay in, it would produce the same effect on her. Accordingly, she sent it to her, desiring her to look on it, when she was in pain. Every old man, too, recalled her father to her mind, and made aparticular impression on her. To every thing in which old men were concerned she was peculiarly sensible; and once, when in the time of her persecutions, an old man acted towards her with a degree of pusillanimity, then common, and undoubtedly more excusable at such an age, she wras extraordinarily grieved at it. "" I am very silly,"" said she to me, "" but what would you have? he was kind, ""he was old, he sat at my table, I altered my hours for him, and all these things grieve me to the heart."" Her bounty to the aged, who stood in need of her assistance, was immense; the idea of their sufferings tore her heart, and, as true Christians see Jesus Christ in all who are poor, she saw her father in every man that was old.' Her affection for her mother was scarcely less ardent; and, although she manifested the utmost forbearance towards Madame de Genlis, who never ceased to attack her with severe criticisms, yet, when the same lady spoke in unfavourable terms of Madame Necker, it was with the utmost difficulty she could> be restrained from resenting it:? ' There is great beauty in the thought of that bas-relief, which, after the death of M. Necker, Madame de Stael had sculptured on the funeral monuments cf her parents. An airy figure, as if already beatified, is drawing towards the skies another, that appears to look with compassion on a young woman veiled, and prostrate on a tomb. Madame Necker, her husband, and her daughter, are represented under this emblem, which likewise indicates the passage from this life to life eternal.* The motto of Madame de Stael might have been the following verse, which she often repeated with emotion :? ' "" O liberte de Rome! 6 manes de mon pere !"" ?"" O Roman freedom! manes of my father!' "" Madame de Stael could not avoid forming many friendshins. She whispered this sentiment almost at first sight, and she was touched with the effect which she produced; and yet it was difficult to attain the highest places in her affections. * There are ninety dtgrevs fixed/ saul she,* in my affections, ami only ten moveable.* She was always free in her remarks on her friends, and spared none of tho objects of her attachment :? ' This continual appreciation of her friends, not only every one, but of each daily, this appreciation made incessantly :\ their presence, sometimes hutt them, and led them to doubt her affection. "" With you we must submit to be judged .it fresh cost every morning,"" said Ito her. "" What signifies it/' answered she, "" if I love thee more every pveningr""?Nbc added, "" Were I going to the scaffold, V could not help passingjudgment on the friends that accompanied me."" In her habitual society, Madame de Stael was full of charms. In bur company there was no restraint; thus lu r superiority did not bear heavy on any person ; she asked only for amusement, not for trials of skill;? i She could not endure people to talk with indifference. ""How can he expect me to attend to him,"" she would *ay, "" when he does not do himself the honour to attend to himself ?'' She could better endure certain defects of charade r than a mind dried up and disgusted; and she said one dav rt an egotist and caviller, "" That man talks only of himself; but he does not tire me, hecuase I am certain ul lea t that he feels interested in what he says."" ' ' She had an occupation in society very different from that of shining and pleasing ; she wa> the naturalist, observing a species, as well as the orator that would persuade. * But what deranged this study completely, what took from her all interest in people's words was affectation. This tault, which effaces every prominent feature, which substitutes a false and monotonous phantom, instead of the inunen-e variety of moral nature, was profoundly tiresome to her, ami scarcely less vexatious. She expressed herself thus on ihe subject: "" There is never any such thing as a tele dtC\e with affected people; the personage assumed makes a third, and it is thls,that answers when you speak to the other.?Affected people are the only persons fi om whom nothing is to le learned."" Exaggeration, too, displeased her much. "" lt is no proof of imagination to put a hundred in place of ten,"" she would say. For the same reason she was always suspicious of great expressions of sensibility: ""all natural feeling,"" she remarked, "" have a degree of modesty."" ' From a sketch of her conversation, political opitnons, and repartees, we shall select a few of the most striking passages :? 'When she was told of the follies of some witty man, she would say, <f Give him more wit, and all these will van', h."" One of her Swedish friends observing to her, "" Whatever von may say, witty people commit a great many faults."" .die answered, "" that is very true ; but, unfortunately, stupid persons do the same, though nobody thinks it worth while to ur - tice them."" Another time she said, "" the follies of men os wit are the profits of ordinary men."" ' Her attachment to France never abated, not even ui.? ,i she had been banished from it, ami incurred the enmity of its rulers.?* I have a corroding grief respecting France/ she wrote, * which 1 love more than ever/ And, again, * I have felt clearly that 1 cannot live without that France/ But it must be confessed her country was more es^et lally Paris :? *"" Show me the rue de Bac"" said she once, to some persons who wanted her to admire the splendid view of ti e I ac of Geneva and its banks. "" I would willingly live at f\.ris"" said she again, ?' with a hundred pounds a j ear, itt a lodging up four pair of stairs."" In 1806, when she^pent four d.tys ni Paris in concealment, her greatest pleasure was to walk out ia night, to view the streets by moonlight. "" I have a constancy of heart,"" she wrote, u and an inconstancy of mind, for whick a country is formed, where the scenes are incessantly renewing, and where 1 have my old friends."" ' ' It is very remarkable, that, always cutting to the quick in disputation, always touching the most sensible points, she always conciliated, in her presence, those whom a vague idea of her had previously made her enemies. You might be grazed, be wounded, in the contest; but you always went away healed, or at least she had applied balsam to the sore. ' "" You desire, then, my death or my dishonour?"" said an emigrant to her in Switzerland, as he was going to the army on the frontiers. "" No,"" answered she, "" w~hat I wish is your defeat, and yourglcry: I would have you, except being slain, be like Hector, the hero of a vanquished army."" ' The following are given as a few of her bon mots on public events:? * While she was in England, in 1814, some person thought fit to congratulate her on the taking of Paris, which put an end to her banishment. To these expressions of politeness she answered, "" On what do you compliment me, pray? On my being in the height of distress ?"" It was from the date of the battle of Leipsic that she began to be alarmed for France. 4 In 1815, when Bonaparte had already entered Lyons, a lady, attached to his party, came and said to Madame de Stael, "" The emperor knows, Madame, how generously you spoke of him during his misfortunes,""?"" I hope,"" answered she, "" he will know how much I detest him."" ' During the hundred days, she said, "" If all the declamatory phrases, uttered this winter against the revolution, had been enlisted, we should have had plenty of soldiers ou the COth of March."" * In 1810, Mr. Canning having thought proper to say to Madame de Stael, in the apartment of the first gentleman of the bed-chamber in the palace of the Tuillcries, "" lt is useless to indulge any longer in illusions, madam; France has 'submitted to u>, and we have conquered you.""?""Yes,"" answered sile, "" because you had all Europe and the Cossacs on your side; but meet us tete-d-tete, and we shall see.'* She | said also to Mr. Canning, "" The English nation is deceived ; it is not aware that it is employed to deprive other nations of the liberty enjoyed by itself, and to protect intolerance toward its brethren in religion : if it knew this, it would renounce those who thus abuse its name."" ' "" Fiance,"" said she, "" must remain as dead, as long as it is occupied by foreigners. First let us have independence, and then think of libertv."" ' She said of Mr. De Bonald, "" He is the philosopher of antiphilosophy : but this will not carry a man very far."" * "" The ministerial party,"" observed she, ?' looks at the prosaic side of human nature, and opposition at the poetical side. This is why I have always had an inclination for the opinions ofthe latter."" * Some person once maintained that it was impossible for ministers of state to confine themselves to the employment of strictly legitimate measures. ""What would you'have me say?"" answered she, ""he who possesses genius can never have occasion for immorality; and he who has not, should not accept a post of difficulty."" ' In 1816, she said of the ministry, ? I do not like it, yet 1 prefer it. It is but a barrier of cotton against the return of old abuses, yet still it is a barrier."" ' On occasion of the great number of persons enobled, she said, "" It would be best to create France a marquis once for all."" l ' She set no great value on puns, yet she occasionally uttered them with her usual quickness, in a dispute on the slave trade, with a French lady of high rank, the latter said to her, 4t What, madam, then you are much interested for the Count of Limonade and the Marquis of Marmalade?""?"" Why not as much as for the Duke of Bouillon ?"" answered she. ? Bonaparte having caused her to be told, in 1815, that she must return to Paris, because he wanted her for tbe sake of constitutional ideas, she refused, saying, "" he contrived to do without a constitution, and without me, for a dozen years; and he has now the same regard for the one that he has for the* other."" Even at this period, however, when any Frenchmen passed by Coppet, in their way to join the army ofthe allies, she endeavoured to divert them from their design, not approving their endangering the independence of the nation, even to acquire liberty. ' She was already dangerously ill, when the "" Manuscript from St. Helena"" began to make a great noise in France. Notwithstanding the state of weakness to which Madame de Stael was reduced, she made her children read the work to her, and criticised it with all her strength of mind. "" The Chaldeans worshipped the serpent,"" said she; ""the Bonapartists do the same to the Manuscript from St. Helena; but I am far from sharing their admiration, lt is but in the style of the notes ofthe Moniteur; and, if ever I recover, I think I can refute this writing with a high hand."" ' r One of Bonaparte's ministers having desired her to be told, that the emperor would reward her if she would attach herself to him, she answered, "" I was aware that a certificate of being alive is necessary to the receipt of an annuity, but I did not know that it required a declaration of love."" ' Notwithstanding the liberality and noble facility of Madame de Stael's disposition, great order was observed in the management of her house and estate; so that her circumstances were constantly prosperous when under her government. Her mornings she devoted to business, that is, to the care of her property, and to study; and her evenings to society, and to correspondence :? * The only luxury on which she set any value, was the having accommodation for her friends, and being able to invite to dinner persons with whom she wished to become acquainted. "" I have hired a cook that travels post,""said she: "" is not this exactly what I wanted, to give dinners in dishabille throughout Europe ?"" ' The following anecdote is highly characteristic, and displays Madame de Stael in a very amiable point of view :? ' About twenty years ago, when on a visit to me in the country, it was proposed to play proverbs. A sketch of Marmontel, entitled, Le Barara, (The Prater,) was selected, in which a great lady, ill and nervous, consents to use her interest in favour of an old soldier, who is soliciting a pension; but, on the express condition that he states his case to her in the fewest words possible. The prater, who is duly cautioned beforehand, nevertheless indulges himself in such an exuberance of words, that he exhausts the patience of his patroness, and she will have nothing more to say to him. Madame de Stael represented the great lady. At first she acted her part very well; she counterfeited languor to perfection, next weariness, then vexation and impatience; but when the moment came for inflicting pain on the old soldier, it was impossible for her to bring herself to this. He had spoken of his wife and children; he was, at bottom, one of the best men in the world; it required too hard a heart to refuse him. Quitting, therefore, altogether, her assumed character, and totally destroying the point ofthe piece, she told him with real emotion, that in future he had better not talk so much, but that for this time she would undertake his suit. Suclvin fact, wat* Madame de Stael; she was not only incapable of giving pain to any person voluntarily, but, subject as she was to ennui, she really felt none when she could be useful to others.' Of her religious character we have the following account :? ' Among the happy effects of time on Madame de Stael, ,.-.4. L. .. ?_I_I_1*1 j ...... .1 - 1 ? ? _ * _1^4t? Matta** which had always looked to the consequences of her actions, attached themselves more to their motives. Prayer, that sentimental want of her's, placing her incessantly in communication with the source of all excellence, caused a pure light to penetrate her heart. "" Whenever I am alone I pray,"" said she to her children. She wrote to me, from Sweden, on the subject of Mr. de Montmorency : "" There is no such thing as absence to the religious, because they meet in the sentiment of prayer."" Every moment we find in her letters a request to pray for her, and her children. * Madame de Stael thought it was pride in man to endeavour to penetrate the secret of the universe; and speaking of the higher metaphysics, she said, "" I prefer the Lord's Prayer to it all."" During her long sleeplessness, she was accustomed to repeat this prayer incessantly, in order to calm her mind. Sighs, certain exclamations that she was in the habit of uttering, were with her pious invocations. Thus the following words that escaped her frequently, "" Poor human nature! alas! what are we? Ah, life, life!"" were religious sentiments venting themselves/ lu her last illness she was seen constantly exerting the virtues for which she was distinguished ; and, on the days when she suffered most pain, she was employed in acts of kindness:? s She was heard to utter delightful sayings, in her peculiar way. ?t I have always been the same, lively and sad,"" she observed to Mr. Chateaubriand, ?' I love God, my father, and liberty."" ' On quoting these words of Fontenelle; "" I am a Frenchman, I am fourscore years old, yet I never ridiculed the slightest virtue:"" she added, ""I can say as much of the slightest suffering."" ' Unquestionably she felt great regret at parting with her children and friends. Stoicism, or the particular kind of enthusiasm that is capable of closing the heart to the pains of eternal separation, entered not into her character. Her daughter in particular cost her many tears. "" With such treasures of affection,"" she dictated for me, in speaking of the objects of her regard, *? it is a sad thing to quit life."" "" I should be very sorry,"" she said likewise, "" if every thing were at an end between Albertine, (Madame de Broglie,) and me in another world."" But she rather regretted life, than really feared death. She may have dreaded the last pangs; an imagination like hers may have felt some horrors at the idea of physical dissolution, terrible as it is to all of us ; but death, morally considered, gave her no alarm. She preserved so much tranquility, as to wish to dictate to Mr. Schlegel the description of what she felt. Her thoughts were always turned with hope towards her father, and towards immortality. "" My father waits for me on the other shore,"" she said. She beheld her father with God, and in God himself could see nothing but a father. These two ideas were confounded in her heart; and that of a protecting goodness was inseparable from both. One day, rousing from a state of reverie, she said, "" I think I know what the transition from life to death is; and I am sure, that the goodness of God softens it to us. Our ideas become confused, and the pain is not very acute."" ' Her confidence was not disappointed; the profoundest tranquillity presided over her last moments. Long before she expired, the grand struggle had ended, and her soul departed gently/ It can scarcely be necessary to extend this article by any further remarks on Madame de Stael; or on the present work. That it is written with the partiality of a friend, and an ardent admirer of Madame de Stael, is avowed; and yet there is scarcely an assertion or an opinion respecting her, that has not already been justified, or is so by the present volume. This work is published in French, so that those who may prefer reading it in the original, will have the opportunity; we may, however, observe, that the translation is well executed."
115,B3714,['6681651'],"SABRINA WARHAM: THE STORY OF HER YOUTH. By Laurence Housman. (Murray, 6s.) With this novel Mr. Housman comes several steps nearer to his own, but his own he has not reached, so far as novels are concerned that is to say. That strange piece of fiction to which he at length put his name, "" An Englishwoman's Love Letters,"" seemed to contain evidence of a dual authorship. Influences were traceable, but they were not all-pervasive, in ""A Modern Antaeus"" he appeared to be controlling the peh himself throughout, but something of his natural freakishness seemed to have dropped off, perhaps instinctively, aware of incompatibility with the disguise its owner was assuming. Here and now there are indications of the development of the novelist in Mr. Housman as he is to be. The influence has remained supreme for the length of one book only, and though it is still easily perceptible?Lady Berrers, for instance (delightful company though one find her), is patently a stray out of Meredithia?it hats entangled itself inextricably with another influence equally potent and equally l**neficent in moderation. And all this sounds very unfair, and even is very unfair until one remembers that Mr. Housman has himself given us the right to claim absolutely individual work from him in fiction by his own achievements in other departments of letters. East and West Gill are indubitably hitherto unmarked spots in the map of Wessex, Sabrina has a puzzling likeness to Bathsheba fiverdene, and David Lorry to Gabriel Oak. The scene in which Roddie, creeping close to the lighted window to decipher his belated love letter, watchss the undressing and bathing of Lottie's child, his own child, Sabrina giving it the attentions that should have come by right from its mother, is an idyllic picture that could only be paralleled in the works of Mr. Hardy; but it would fit into almost any one of the Wessex novels so as to deceive even the very elect. "" The small events, big with the fates of men,"" are wont to move the great artists in fiction to different emotions, according to the mood in which they commonly observe. With Mr. Meredith, even in his more sombre momenta, we are never far removed from comedy. With Mr. Hardy, a fantastic danse macabre lurks in the background, even when his "" comic relief,"" his clowns, are on the stage. Mr. Housman's genius is naturally allied rather to that of such a writer as Hawthorne. He has shown us in his poems, his fairy tales, his pen-drawings, an elvish strain that recalls Donatello in "" The Marble Faun,"" and it is probably in this direction that the novels which shall be absolutely unmistakably his own will evolve themselves. Nevertheless, whilst we still await his savoury meat, we have enjoyed and thank him for his lentil pottage."
116,B5881,"['8880211', '6788507']","The History of Sir Richard Calmady: a Romance. LITERATURE f NEW NOVELS. _ By Lucas Malet. (Methuen &Co.) What sort of novel shall we have next? The political, the romantic, the theological, and so many more types come and go, and still we are left waiting for the satisfying one. All they do just at present is to increase, not in grace, but in length. What we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple, and not such a weight of environment and side issues. 'The History of Sir Richard Calmady' is not the desire of one's eyes, but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough. Mrs. Harrison starts with a leisurely account of her hero's forbears, their fair domain near the Surrey hills, the family legend and the family curse. Six hooks, each with its title, are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a Meredithian turn. But the atmosphere is, alas! more clinical than Meredithian. The skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages. Elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely. 'The History of Sir Richard Calmady' cannot have been lightly undertaken, nor is it lightly executed. The leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable Fallowfield are all the more welcome. His son Ludovic has also a whimsical "" way with him,"" but we seem to have met his kind before, only better realized. Lord Fallowfield may be superficial, and, like some of the other characters, superfluous, yet he is not so superfluous, since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story. As its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel, it must be clearly stated. Briefly it is this :? The year 1842 (when the actual story begins) ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race. They are the parents of the future Sir Richard, and are well dowered not only with a high spirit, youth, and beauty, but with great worldly possessions. On Richard himself all subsequent events turn; he is the centre and pivot of the story, and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends. His is the sort of ""case,"" in fact, that might be supplied by any medical record, but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves; for Richard's horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically, but is from first to last tho dominant factor and the constant interest. Though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility, the plot is, as it were, against him from the beginning. He comes into the world with a "" superb "" head and shoulders, but shorn of the half of each of his legs, with (we are told but too explicitly) feet protruding from the "" stumps,"" and arms almost reaching the ground. Richard is, in fact, the victim of an obscure pre-natal process scientifically termed ""spontaneous mutilation."" The father's death has taken place before his son's birth, but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs, owing to an accident. The shock of his death and the manner of it?the days of chloroform had not dawned ? also, it is suggested, the sight of a Velasquez ' Dwarf' (in its frame), have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boy's mother. Surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer! The result, at any rate in the book, is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physique?a monster. This is the situation, and this the hero offered to the casual reader. We need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness. Mrs. Harrison, seemingly undismayed by her dismal task, has taken him not on the ideal lines of Miss Mulock's old story ' A Noble Life,' but more in the "" modern"" spirit and manner. In spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it, the treatment (if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view) shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother, and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness. But it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject. The mother, a woman ""nobly planned to warn, to comfort, and command,"" weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things, is a beautiful study of resignation and courage. If we cannot look on her as a really vital creature, but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized, the fault is of course our own. The tracing of the physical, moral, and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate, and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother, show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties. Of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses. One scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest, because it is in some ways more restrained. It is when Richard, disappointed in his first hopes of marriage, desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate, and with all his vital energies in full cry, confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live "" fully,"" if not worthily. Nothing is spared elsewhere, nor even here, perhaps, that could agonize a proud yet gentle woman whose son's dire misfortune is in every sense her own. The fifth book, called ' The Rake's Progress,' shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise, unless, indeed, as we begin to believe, the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all. The evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow; the writing is over-charged, lurid, yet inadequate. The author seems quite out of her depth here. The Neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus. To use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake. But the more one fastens on errors of detail (and there are many), and attempts to criticize, the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life, and out of drawing besides. The story actually closes not on the tragic note, but in England, to the sound of Sir Richard's wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin.Fiction. The History of Richard Cal mady : a Romance. By Lucas Malet. (Methuen. 6s.) When you see Richard Calmady sitting at table he is an Apollo. His splendid head, his strong, clear-cut face, which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers, his broad shoulders and noble carriage, all mark him clearly as a man among men. But see him stand upon the ground, the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor, see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk, see him even sitting?when once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidity?and the Apollo is at once forgotten, and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship. And the* very clear distinction of these two impressions, scarcely ever confused, which are produced by his physical personality, is characteristic of his effect as a literary character The reader never sees him all at once. The table may be there to conceal his legs, and one's admiration may be concentrated on the Apollo : or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view, and one can think of nothing eke. Richard is either one or the other, never a combination of the two. And the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person. The artistic justification of Richard and his deformity is, in fact, not himself, but his influence upon others, and especially upon the opposite sex. He is himself more or less of a dummy, an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum, a woman's sexual personality, may be ascertained, decomposed, and separately set forth. Many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment. There is Clara, the housemaid, who nursed the young dwarf in his youth, and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet. There is Mrs. Chifney, the trainer's wife at the stables, who also wept? simple soul?because she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel. There is little Lady Constance Quayle. She, too, wept when Richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations. But the three important patients, the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive, are Katherine Calmady, Helen de Vallorbes, and Honoria St. Quentin. In these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother, the perfect sensualist, and the perfect virgin. It is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable. In all the author shows a subtlety, a frankness, and a tact which are insufficient to conquer one's distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these women's hearts. Moreover, all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man, and which shows, even if we did not know that "" Lucas Malet"" is the pseudonym of Charles Kingsley's daughter, that the book is written by a woman. Perhaps of them all, Katherine Calmady, Richard's mother, is the finest. Pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and, that love once lost, prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present, she walks through the book almost with a majesty, at any ra'e with that calm dignity of motion which in Richard's eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room. The second of the three women, Helen de Vallorbes, Richard's evil genius, if she is certainly not a pleasant character, is scarcely less real, except in a few moments of crude melodrama, than Katherine Calmady. With the artistic temperament's capacities and limitations in emotion, but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it, she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism. She is cruel?she was the child who laughed at Richard's infirmity?calculating in her pleasures, and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires, which is the curse of ignoble passion. To her the grotesquely-dtformed Richard becomes a subtle attraction. She begins by inspiring him with love, and ends by degrading that love to lust. The character is melodramatic at times, as when she is dressed in a "" flowing, yet clinging silken garment of turquoise, shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green."" And the chief incident in her amorous relations with Richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration. Beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters. Richard does not matter ; he is a dummy or a shadow. It is, perhaps, just as well, for if one began to consider this short-legged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous. Cyrano de Bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience, but even he was only grotesque as a lover : he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior. The minor characters do not matter ; they are not drawn with originality or comedy, and they tend to become wearisome. The melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter, although that of the clergyman, Julius March, discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the Velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely Corellian in its obvious luridness. The whole idea of this explanation of Richard's deformity by legend is unworthy of Lucas Malet; it should be left to the How Hells Xnvelette. The unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter, although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words, like "" casement"" and "" greensward, and a speech by the old doctor, on page 404, reads exactly like a schoolboy's essay, and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking. Nothing matters, in fact, except that Lucas Malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different, but all interesting, women. And, if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters, we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters."
117,B2566,['6687957'],"Impzressitons of Theophsrastu Such. By George Eliot. (W. Blackwood & Sons.) THE interest which is felt when a distinguished cultivator of one branch of literature takes to the cultivation of anotber branch is a perfectly natural and legitimate interest. There is certainly no reason why an excellent novelist should not be a good poet, and still less reason why an excellent novelist should not write excellent essays. A reader, therefore, may be pardoned who takes up the Impressicm8 of Theophrastus Such with a pleasant anticipation of finding something good there. It is not to be for. gotten that George Eliot's special excellences in novel writing are such as might with reason be thought likelv to enable her to write good essays of the moralist kind. She has at any rate in her best novel work displayed in occasional reflections and apophthegms exactly the acuteness of observation and the power of expressing its results which the ethi. cal essayist most needs, and pearls are usually no worse for being strung in connexion instead of scattered at hazard. It so happens, too, though perhaps this is a consider. ation of a rather double-edged character, that we have very little essay work nowadays of the kind which England and France pro. duced so abundantly between the middle of the seventeenth and the middle of the eighteenth century. There is. an immense amount of diluted matter of a not dissimilar kind published in weekly and daily journals, and now and then a writer may attempt something, more mature and concentrated in magazines and reviews. But on the whole no collection of the British essayists is in the near future likely to go much beyond Eliaalthough a smart journalist did remark the other day that the only reason for the popularity of Lamb's Essays was that few people could do the thing then, whereas, if they had appeared to-day, they would have been lost amid the superior work of the same kind now daily appearing. That the reader who takes up T/heop7lastus Such in such a mood as that which we have' indicated is likely to be a good deal dis. appointed, may be as well said at once and frankly. The author has attempted a form which is not an easy one, and has not observed its limitations. Before we have got very far into the book, and still more when we Jay it down, we feel that there is either too much or too little of Mr. Such. The essayist who wishes to utter his opinions through the mouth of a feigned personage must give him at least something of a body for our thoughts to take hold of. Mr. Such is little more than a disembodied shadow with a name attached to it, and this being the case we feel that we could do without his shadow and his name altogether. A more doubtful point is the adoption, more majorun, of fictitious but half-significant names for the minor characters introduced or discussed in passing. There is, perhaps, something a little cumbrous about this to the taste of the present day, but it is a matter of no great consequence. The reader would probably be prepared to pardon a good many imperfections in the setting, if the stones set were abundant, of pure water, and cut in a workmanlike manner. It is, however, hereto drop the metaphor, it is in the quality and wording of the thoughts it contains-that the principal weakness of the book consists. The essayist has two different manners in which he may allowably and successfully put what he has to say. There is the garrulous, fluent, and somewhat button-holing, manner, and there is the manner in which the writer devotes his utmost energies to compressing and polishing his phrase till it has at least something of the pregnancy and of the brilliancy of Joubert or of Rochefoucauld. There may be third, fourth, or fifth manners which are allowable, but they have not hitherto been tried, at any rate successfully, in literature. Now, we hardly think that George Eliot has succeeded in working up her matter in either of these possible ways. No one expects her to be easily garrulous; but she might have been expected to be full, and at the same time terse and clear-cut. There is too much in Theophrastus Stich to which these epithets can by no stretch of compliment be applied. Sometimes, though it must be confessed not so often as might have been expected, the fault lies in the use of unfamiliar and technical expressions. When we are presented with such a pensie as the following: "" May there not be at least a partial release from the imprisoning verdict that a man's philo. sophy is the formula of his personality? "" it must be a very dull or a very easy literary sense upon which the use of the word formula does not jar. But there is not very much of this error. A worse and a more frequent one may be best illustrated by a couple of quota. tions. "" One wonders whether the remarkable originatorm who first had the notion of digging wells or of churning for butter, and who certainly were very useful to their own time as well as to ours, were left quite free from invidious comparisons with predecessors who let the water and the milk alone, or whether some rhetorical nomad, as he stretched himself on the grass with a good appetite for contemporary butter, became loud on the virtues of ancestors who were uncorrupted by the produce of the cow ; nay, whether in a high flight of imaginative sacrifice-after swallowing the butter-he even wished himself earlier born and already eaten for the sustenance of a generation more naive than his own."" "" It has sometimes occurred to me when I have been taking a slice of excellent ham that, from a too tenable point of view, I was breakfasting on a small, squealing, black pig, which more than half a century ago was the unwilling representative of spiritual advantages not otherwise acknowledged by tie grudgingfarmer or dairyman who parted with him. One enters on a fearful labyrinth in tracing compound interest backward, and such complications of thought have reduced the flavour of the ham; but since I have nevertheless eaten it, the chief effect has been to moderate the severity of my radicalism, which was not part of my paternal inheritance, and to raise the assuaging reflection that if the pig and the parishioner had been intelligent enough to anticipate my historical point of view, they would have seen themselves and the rector in a light that would have made tithe voluntary."" Now we are very far from thinking that there is nothing worth saying in these ponderous sentences. But it is evident that the author, instead of seeking to compress and point her thought, has allowed it to bulge in any and every direction. She has constantly inserted side reflections as they occurred to her, regardless of the total effect, and pitiless to the unfortunate reader who has begun a sympathetic grin and has to keep his muscles on the stretch for half a page before he is allowed to relax them. She has reversed Joubert's process, and appears to be tormented by the ambition of putting a word into a paragraph, and a para- graph into a chapter, and a chapter into a book. This inability to stop when enough has been said is still more remarkable inl such a sentence as the following:"" Not that Merman had a wrangling disposition; he put all his doubts and queries and paradoxes deferentially, contended without unpleasant heat, and only with a sonorous eagerness, against the personality of Homer; expressed himself civilly, though formally, on the origin of language, and had tact enough to drop at the right moment such subjects as the ultimate reduction of all the socalled elementary substances, his own total scepticism concerning Manetho's Chronology, or even the relation between the magnetic condition of the earth and the outbreak of revolutionary tendencies."" Surely George Eliot's daemon must have whispered ""Stop!"" suggestivelyat ""Homer,"" imperatively at ""the origin of language,"" and despairingly at ""elementary substances."" The sentence as it stands is not a witticism but a catalogue. Although, however, this fatal error per. vades the book and deprives it of a claim to rank with essay work of the best kind, the reader, unless he is a very unreasonable person, is not likely to think his time wasted or to complain that he is sent away empty. No one of George Eliot's powers could pro. duce reflections on subjects of interest-and such are nearly all the matters touched upon in this volume - without those reflections being themselves interesting. With the ast essay, a vigorous Apologia for the Jews, we have little to do here, because it is entirely political in tone and hardly touches at all on the purely literary objections to the handling of the Jewish element in Daniel Derondd. The best of the essays beyond all question is ""Looking Backward,"" a charming description with hardly any veil of the writer's earlier days in the midland counties. The description of English scenery on page 50 is equal to the very best thing she has ever done. So again is the short episode of the manservant Pummel in "" The Watchdog of Knowledge."" This delightful person, who on being asked the cause of the tides answers, ""Well, sir, nobody rightly knows. Many gives their opinion, but if I was to give mine it 'ud be different; "" and who is troubled to think of Adam's surprise at the assembled animals, "" for he was not like us, sir, used from a by to Wombwell's shows,""would redeem many times the number of dull pages or ill-constructed phrases that are to be found in Theophrastus Such. Nor are there wanting abundant flashes of really terse and well oxpressed reflection elsewhere. The political molecule who ""1 occasionally sat alone in the same room with his books"" is not a person to be forgotten. There could hardly be a better-put rebuke to cheap cynicism than this - ""If the human race has a bad reputation, I perceive that I cannot escape being compromised."" Another-""The sea lion plunges and swims the more energetically because his limbs are of a sort to make him shambling on land "" -bears a strange likeness to the thought of a French poet on the albatross "" Ses ailes de g6ant l'empAchent de marcher."" There is all the old psychological acuteness in the comment on a statement of a foolish contemner of modern poetry that he himself had never written anything, but "" often composed as he went along."" "" I was per. r suaded that the birth with which his mind I was pregnant was not poetry, but I did not I question that he composed as he went along, x and that the exercise was attended by a e great sense of power."" I There is, too, a fable about a badger and t a bee and a bear, which is told to perfection. 1 Nor are the figures of Touchwood, the man r with only a temper; of Vorticella, the small t author; of Pepin, the too ready writer- i though perhaps there is a touch of personal r feeling in this which does not improve it I -of the Watchdog of Knowledge, Mordax, c and of the too deferential Hinze, un- i worthy of a place in the gallery appointed c for such types. The most elaborate thing t in the book, the Sorrows of Merman, or, as E it is headed, ""How we Encourage Re. t search,"" pleases us less. The defect of over. i minuteness and voluminousness which we have noticed comes in very strongly here; 4 the playfulness is distinctly elephantine, and I though it has some of the elements of a good X comedy, yet we are by no means sorry when I it is done. Lastly, the protests against 1 ""Moral Swindlers "" and ""Debasing the I Moral Currency "" deserve notice. The 1 latter is directed against the modern I tendency to parody and burlesque of noble work and sentiment, the former to the false and foolish use of the words "" moral"" and ""morality "" which have led to various con. fusions and mistakes as to their acceptation. Neither is exactly novel; but both are vigorous and well worth reading. On the whole, then, Theophrastus Such may be pronounced to be a book containing more good things than bad; but spoilt by an insufficient attention to form and an insufficient recognition of its necessity. It is never likely to be among the most popular of its author's books, nor, perhaps, does it deserve this popularity. But still it will be found in all probability very quotable, not to say plunderable, all the more so, perhaps, because many of its good things are in their present habit not set off to the best advantage, and therefore are not likely to stock the general memory as they stand. l GEORGE SAINTSBURY."
118,B2551,['6823691'],"The Nun Ensign. A HUNDRED SLASHES From the Spanish by J. Fitzmaurice Kelly. (T. Fisher Unwin, 7s. 6d. net.) When Pero Perez and Master Nicholas burnt Amadis de Gaul, Olivante de Laura, Florismarte, and all their company to cure Don Quixote of his romantic madness, their own was but made the clearer. Many fires cannot quench romance, and even Cervantes, whose incarnation of old chivalry was made in a spirit of wistful mockery, so far from stemming the stream, as fools have written, but diverted it into other channels. Here is a maiden, who, though only of brazen fifteen when the Don first appeared, managed to carry on the tradition as faithfully as if Miguel had never blown his counterblast; and great is the comfort of this pleasant and amusing book on that account. The ineradicable love of adventure and valour, the interest and vivacity of a hundred slashes can never be scolded out, preached out, kicked out, or even laughed out of the sons of Adam. The thing is in and will out. Your pious boy from the Sunday-school, brimful of Collect and good advice, a devout and nimble acolyte and the joy of his priest and parents, will always be found to have "" Dick Turpin "" in his coat-pocket, and to be well furnished with tradition about Sixteen-stringed Jack and his distinction. The Dona Catalina of romance and of reality may not now be easy to distinguish, but they evidently had much in common, and without too much impertinent criticism they may be pleasantly confounded. Here then is a delicious post-Quixotic tale well told. Our hearts go with the bold novice when she steals the keys and breathes the fresh night air, when she cuts and fashions her modest petticoats into large-striding, bulbous breeches^ and swaggers as a saucy page, before the blind eyes of her very parents. The brawls and audacities, the cloaked and rapiered persons who wait for her, the intelligent and sympathetic police and clergy, who openly prefer strong swashbucklers before cold justice, the ladies and friars and casual persons who mix in fights just for fun, all these awaken deep sympathy. Everybody acts exactly as he ought to do, from the dramatic point of view. He just opposes enough to set Catalina stabbing and pinking, but not enough to give the gallows its due weight. There are no neural tremors to disturb the gallop of the tale. The murders are all done so unshrinkingly that they affect us only to cheers and are as natural as sneezing, and indeed give. much the same feeling of relief and pleasure. So do the incidents of war. Here is an aside, in a scuffle with the Indians : At the entrance to the village the camp-master, Bartoleme de Alva, feeling the weight of his helmet, took it off to wipe away the sweat, and a little devil of a boy about twelve years old, who had clambered up a tree, let fly at him an arrow, which pierced his eye and knocked him over, wounding him so seriously that he died three days afterwards. We sliced the boy into a thousand bits. In tales like these there is much matter for the stage,, and Juan Perez has not exploited it to fine advantage. His story is less dramatic than the terse prose version, and there seems no reason why he should obtrude into the book at all, except as a sort of cabbage-leaf in the strawberry-pottle?-just to fill a space. The illustrations mounted upon blue, being by Daniel Vierge, are dainty and apposite, but the scale is too small to do them justice. Therefore the eye loses the taste of them and their gentle humour and heroic grace because it has to focus too energetically before it can compass and attain them. The frontispiece, being on a reasonable scale, is a great study. It is hard to make a picture of a woman, a soldier, a rogue, a Catholic, a Spaniard, and a scoundrel all in one buff jerkin. Yet not only to combine all these, but to make them all up into a pleasant picture is a mastery. The careful reader who wishes to %know if the Nun-Ensign really did all that the text displays has some painful notes by the translator which will help him to bolt out the fiction. Most people will prefer the tale with its proper and natural seasonings, and these will not need it to be reduced to history. Apage Clio!"

In trying to work the ship out they run her aground, and before they have had time to efface the signs of the murders a man-of-war appears; they assume the identity of the dead crew, and under their names are rescued, and landed at San Francisco. They make their report, the wreck is put up for auction, and then they disappear. All this is excellent, and excellently told, but alas, how shortly -three chapters only, and those at the very end of the book I Well, on landing Carthew hears that he has come into his estates, and to prevent awkward discoveries, gets an agent to run up the price of the wreck to a fabulous sum. It is, however, secured by the hero, Dodd, and his partner Jim, who stake their all on the venture, naturally suspecting a hidden treasure of opium or gold. Dodd starts for the wreck in a strange state of detective exaltation. Here we are teased by a good deal of the usual Gaboriau business, the discovery of new clues, the fitting in of missing links, the reiterated pronouncements of the actors that they can make nothing out of it. True, the secret is well kept, because as yet we have not had a word about Carthew and his ship, though of course we smell blood from the first, but it is all the more worrying for that. In Gaboriau one always guesses about the second chapter what he is after, and then the dues are quite easy to remember, and one takes a sort of sardonic pleasure in the bungling and sapient wonderment of the poor dear detectives. To properly grasp 'The Wrecker' you must read it-over again, for a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse. The clues turn out all right in the end, when the problem is solved and xoone Mr. Carthew and a totally distinct and separate story; till then it is just algebra. Well, this replica of ' Treasure Island' ends tamely enough; the Flyixg Scd is disembowelled and sunk, but nothing of value beyond clues is found, and Dodd return to his partner and ruin. Having thus wound up the second part of the story, the authors then set about the beginning How do they piece the head on to the tail ? Very simply. Dodd comes into money. He is haunted by the mystery; he feels a strange (a very strange) yearning for the unknown Englishman who is somehow mixed up in it; he knows a blackmailer is on the trail; he will take a holiday by following the clues to England, and warn the victim. He tracks him to Paris, hears his story, and they swear eternal friendship. But unluckily we now feel less inclined to emba on a second (or shall we boldly say a third ?) cruise to the same Treasure Island, through the same seas, and with comrades not wholly differing from our former crew. It is a beautiful voyage, most exciting, most tragical; it is the very cream of the book, but-it is only an appendix. The lat chapter, which is called an Epilogue, is singularly ill-advised. It assumes the form of a letter to Mr. W. H. Low, whose name is to my ignorance a name only. Mr. Stevenson not unfrequently takes a cruel delight in destroying our illusions and throwing cold water on the dying embes of the fire round which he has allowed us to sit. Here he begins by relating how the other day he came across his friend Dodd, who of course proceeds to wind up the story by giving the last news of the various characters. But why this sudden intrusion of the author in the Epilogue ? In the Prologue Dodd's story was told to a merchant named Havens. What is the object of this confused and confusing setting? Mr. Stevenson then in his airy, coaxing way throws the whole fiction aside, and professes to reveal the genesis of the story-how he and his colleague resolved to work up some incident they heard into a popular cart-before-the-horse detective novel, how keenly they appreciated the inherent defects of such a plan-the defects which I have just been illustrating-and how they hoped to disguise or palliate them by sundry devices. But Mr. Stevenson does not beguile me so easily. He is no acquaintance of yesterday. I have learnt to catch the light shadows of feeling which flit across his sunny pages better than he thinks. This is no Epilogue-it is an Apology. But of all acts an apology is about the most graceful and the most righteous, though fools do not think so. It Mr. Stevenson were not a little wearied, nay disgusted, with his excursion into the realms of anical detectivism, he would be no longer to my mind the author of 'Prince Otto.' Once he has relieved our anxiety by hinting his contempt for the whole business, he resumes his reign over us. After all, he has but done well what inferior hands can do much better. But he should not have tried. I would not for the world pit myself against a morning governess at Compound Division or Mangnall's Questions. But to end thus churlishly I, too, should be but a wrecker and of the graceless literary breed. For though Mr. Stevenson's last ship steers an unsteady course, she carries a goodly freight. There are dramatic scenes in this book which he has never yet surpassed, and characters which stand out among his best. These and other fine things let the delighted reader find out for himself. Two points only may be noticed. From an advertisement I gather that Mr. Lang is most impressed with the character of the Captain. Which captain ? There are several If he means Nares I cannot agree with him. I do not believe in the virtues of wicked men, least of all in those of the Far-Western card-sharping cut-throat; nay, why shrink from the degrading confession? I believe there is more virtue in one Bethesda of sleek Anabaptist chandlers and their snoring spouses than in all the gambling hells of the Golden Gates. We meet too many ruffians in 'The Wrecker,' but one highly elaborated, though somewhat neutral character it does present, that of Dodd, the artist nature dragged into the vortex of coarse reality. The other point is the grave and subtle satire on American institutions which underlies the fun of the earlier chapters. The Commercial Academy may be an exaggeration, but it is an instructive parable. Possibly here Mr. Stevenson is indebted to others for the incidents and local colour, but the style is clearly his own, and reveals vet a new phase of his genius. y. y.Literature. The Wrecker. By Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne. (Cassells.) In one of his early essays, Mr. Stevenson played with the charming fancy, that the conduct of life depends upon skill in literature: not indeed wholly, but in a great measure. It is no light task, he insisted, to communicate your precise sense of things, in set phrase, to another man: the choice of words, the nicety and exactitude of them, may fail to impress your companion, as you would have him impressed. All speech, all intercourse by word of mouth or by "" hand of write,"" is so much practice of the literary art; and human converse is thus encompassed with peril. ""The world was made before the English language, and seemingly upon a different design. Suppose we held our converse not in words, but in music, those who have a bad ear would find themselves cut off from all near commerce, and no better than foreigners in this big world. But we do not consider how many have 4a bad ear' for words, nor how often the most eloquent find nothing to reply."" From the first this whimsical commonplace has powerfully influenced Mr. Stevenson; it has made of him an aesthetic casuist, anxious about the veracity of his least word, its minutest tone and accent. Be it a story, a piece of criticism, an essay in ethics, a personal reminiscence, or a private adventure, each of his words is positively tremulous with its desire to tell the truth. Since the whole of life is a continuous and coherent affair, he refuses to isolate literature in a secluded palace of art or bookworm's study: he wants to know life upon all sides, and he wants to express it upon all sides by the use of words. Thus it is that his choice of an adjective, his composition of a phrase, or his disposition of incidents, is for him an exercise in good conduct: a trial of truthfulness. We live in a very rich, full world: our behaviour in it, and out attitude towards it, expressed in words, comprehend all matters of belief and conduct. Of modern writers, only Mr. Pater shares with Mr. Stevenson this fine anxiety not to play life false by using inaccurate expressions. He also, whether he write essays or imaginative studies, or more formal narratives, shows this care for the truth, as he apprehends it. To Mr. Pater an Italian church or a French landscape, an ancient liturgy or a classical rite, is a thing with definite values of its own, a thing with claims and rights, towards which he has duties; a shipwreck or a walking tour, an American man of business or a French artist, is the same to Mr. Stevenson. The one is more meditative, more learned, more gentle, than the other; but both are men who feel the pathos, the heroism, the living significance of things?Virgil's "" sense of tears in mortal things "" and Browning's: "" How good is man's life, the mere living ! how flt to employ All the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy!"" It is curious to reflect that many critics have found in Mr. Pater and Mr. Stevenson? two intensely practical, humane, and sympathetic writers?little more than unreal eclectic profundities, intricacies, and extravagances. The Wrecker contains, as it were in solution, all the perfections of Mr. Stevenson: upon the face of it, it has all the stirring romance of adventure which we enjoyed in Treasure Island; it displays two characters with all the impressive fidelity which made Alan Breck and the Master of Ballantrae so wonderful; it includes episodes and sketches, varieties of life, such as those in the two books of travel, in the Silverado Squatters, and many single essays; it has much of that fantastic humour which adorns the New Arabian Nights; it provides us with more of those brilliancies of moral sentiment, already so characteristic of Mr. Stevenson. The result is a delightful and imperfect book? a saturn, & farrago, in which every reader can come upon something to his taste, and no reader feels satisfied throughout. The writers explain how it all came about, in an ingenious epilogue or apology: they determined, one moonlit night in the Pacific, to write a story about the tale of a wreck, often the occasion of a rascally romance in commerce. "" Before we turned in, the scaffolding of the tale had been put together. But thc question of treatment was, as usual, more obscure. We had long been at once attracted and repelled by that very modern form of tho police novel or mystery story, which consists in beginning your yarn anywhere but at the beginning, and finishing it anywhere but at the end; attracted by its peculiar interest when done, and the peculiar difficulties that attend its execution; repelled by that appearance of insincerity and shallowness of tone, which seems its inevitable drawback."" They determined, by a more artistic method, by a gradual approach to the story, making tho chief character familiar from the first among many various scenes, to give an air of reality to the central mystery. To this end the story flies from Muskegon to Edinburgh, from Edinburgh to Paris, from Paris to San Francisco, before the puzzle of the wreck in the Pacific is introduced: and, to solve that puzzle, the story flies from San Francisco to Dorsetshire and to Barbizon, where the answer is given. The answer takes us to Australia, the Pacific, and San Francisco once more. I do not know that courtesy compels me to accept for literal truth the author's explanation: but it is more convincing, at least, than Poe's account of his evolution of the ""Raven,"" in his essay upon the ""Philosophy of Composition."" To Mr. Stevenson's method are due at once the charm and the defect of The Wrecker. The charm lies in single episodes: the bohemian life of art in Paris, the bohemian life of commerce in San Francisco, the splendid voyage to the Pacific islands, the search for treasure upon the abandoned ship: and in certain characters, Pinkerton, the tactless and romantic speculator ; Nares, the brutal, philosophical, and cordial seaman. But the central facts of the story are obscured by the very means employed to make them plausible and natural. The story begins and ends with some lack of symmetry and rounded form. The last details are told by Mr. Stevenson, propria persona, in a letter of dedication to a friend. It reminds us of Scott's intricate prefaces, introductions, and involved machinery for getting his main story under weigh. Pleasant in themselves, these contrivances do but embarrass the story which they are meant to serve. In the present case, the difficulties of the narrative are pardonable enough, for they help us to realise that variety and richness of life which Mr. Stevenson never wearies of praising. It may be objected to this story, that it contains episodes of brutal violence, murder, and blood-shedding, which its author presents with a certain callousness, if not with a certain gusto. But Mr. Stevenson himself supplies an answer by his constant trust in human nature. To him every man has some nobility, and we are all incomprehensible together. Captain Nares was full of barbarity, vanity, ill-conditioned humours; but "" he won me to a kind of unconsenting fondness. Lastly, the faults were all embraced in a more generous view: I saw them in thoir place, like discords in a musical progression, tu ul accepted them, and found them picturesque, as we accept and admire, in tho habitable lace of nature, the smoky head of tho volcano, or the pernicious thicket of the swamp."" Tho world is a pageant of vicos and of virtues, to be endured by all means, to bo enjoyed if may be. Our vices have something good in them, and our virtuos are not all pure. Dodd, tho narrator of tho story, is grossly ungrateful to his strange, lovable comrade, Pinkorton: he writes him pages of penitence. "" Wonderful are the consolations of literature! As soon as that letter was written and posted, the consciousness of virtue glowed in my veins like some rare vintage."" In tho thick of a dangerous storm Nares was happy: '?Well, there's always something sublime about a big deal like that; and it lund of raises a man in his own liking. We're a queer kind of beasts, Mr. Dodd."" Bellaire, a "" shyster,"" or disbarred lawyer, with qualms of conscience, goes to blackmail an unfortunate man. Dodd comments: ""I used to wonder whether I most admired or most despised this quivering heroism for evil."" Mr. Stevenson feels to the full what Mr. Watson has expressed in four lines: "" Momentous to himself as I to me Hath each man been that ever woman bore ; Once, in a lightning. Hash of sympathy, I fdl this truth, an instant, and no more."" But with Mr. Stevenson this truth is always present; and it has preserved him from that easy contempt for whole classes of men, which so many brilliant living writers lovo to express. It is instructive to compare Mr. Stevenson's praise of a free, natural life of work under sun and wind and rain, with Mr. Kipling's praise of a strenuous, rapid, active life?the ona so simply honest and exhilarating, the other so merely hitter and exasperating. The two writers have something in common : Mr. Stevenson make us interested in such things as a "" deep-water tramp, limejuicing around between big ports, Calcutta and Rangoon and 'Frisco and the Canton River "": Mr. Kipling in such experience us ""loafing from Lima to Auckland in a big, old, condemned passenger-ship turned into a cargo-boat and owned by a secondhand Italian firm."" Yet the interest roused in us by Mr. Stevenson is very different from that roused by Mr. Kipling: it is the difference between thn truth of pootry and tho truth of bcienco. Behind Mr. Stevenson's writing there is a soul and a heart; behind Mr. Kipling's a good memory and a keen eye. A detail, recorded by Mr. Stevenson, has always some human interest; it betokens moro than quick observation and mechanical experience. It means that Mr. Stevenson has been true to his pleasaut boase: that he has never found life wholly dull nud vapid ; that his sympathy with ail forms of life and all ways of men has made hint alort to notice the little details which go to compose them. This is a brave book, as confused as the Iliad, as adventurous as tho Odyssey, and with no little of tho heartening morality common to both. Lionel Johnson."

Wa have before us seven numbers of a work which has attracted no little notice in the world of wit, and which certainly deserves the serious attention of all laughter-loving mortals. These memoirs contain some account of the adventures of Mr. Pickwick, the founder, and Messrs. Tupman, Winkle, and Snodgrass, three of the members of the club, in search, not of the picturesque, like Dr. Syntax, but of information concerning men and manners, for the instruction and edification of the members of the society. Of course the story is merely a frame-work in which to exhibit pictorial representations of the incidents which befel these gentlemen in the course of their travels. The comedy is interspersed with some occasional touches of tragedy, which we do not think by any means so felicitous in their execution as the lighter and more humorous parts; and for poetry, at least poetry of a serious character, we recommend the author of these papers to eschew it for ever. To borrow the words which he has put into the mouth of the supposititious creator of the lines on the "" Joy Green,"" when called upon to recite his offerings to the muse, ""It's a very slight affair, and the onlv excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it is, that I was a young man at the time."" The style of ideas brought into fashion bv Monk Lewis, and sustained for a time by the vigorous pen and wild imagination of Barry Cornwall, has long since been forsaken under the influence of returning good taste, and consigned to the "" tomb of all the Capulets ;"" and young poets should recollect that the uneven lines of Thomas Moore are excused only by their exquisite matter, or by the kWill which h. rendered a deformity of metre pleasing to the ear, as a skilful composer will enhance the value of his harmonies by the occasional interposition of the harshest discords. But such liberties with the rhythm of verse may only be taken by the lofty spirit of genius or the practised band of long-tried ingenuity. Having thus blamed what we consider blameable, it is but just that we should offer our meed of praise. The scenes from life are sketched with considerable graphic power and rich humour, showing an insight into the mechanism of human actions, and a knowledge of the workings of that incomprehensible cause, the mind, which give a more interesting character to the fun and frolic of these racy pages than if they were mere farce unseasoned with the sharp relish of a strong satirical vein. A scene in mimicry of the tranquil and digtified proceedings of a certain great house, not a hundred miles from Westminster-bridge, is well worthy of perusal; and in short, if we were to particularize all that is good, we should give the numbers of all the comic chapters; and if we were to select a specimen of every variety of merry jest, we should reprint half of the contents. We give one extract, which will serve to initiate our readers into the mysteries of the Pickwick Club, and refer them to certain little monthly numbers which are displayed in green coats in the majority of the booksellers' shops we have passed for some time since.

We give, meanwhile, the author's su^lementary sketch of the present condition of some few of the weuknown persons to whom we have just made allusion :? Mr sad Mrs Winkle halag folly received into favour by the old gentleman, were shortly afterwards installed in a newly-t uilt house, not half a mile from Mr Pickwick's. Mr Winkle being engaged ia the city as agent or town corespondent of his father, exchanged his old costume for the ordinary dress of Englishman, aad presented all the external appearance of a civilised Christina everaJlerwarda. Mr aad Mrs Saodgraas settled at Dingley Dell, where they purchased and cultivated a small farm, more for occupation than profit. Mr Snodgrass, being occasionally abstracted and melancholy, is to this day reputed a great poet laong his friends and acquaintance, although we do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief. We know many celebrated characters, literary, philosophical, and otherwise, who hold a high reputation on a similar tenure. Mr Tupmaa, when his friends married and Mr Pickwick settled, took lodgings at Richmond, where he has ever since resided. He walks constantly on the Terrace during the summer months, with a youthful and janty air, which has rendered him the admiration ofthe numerous elderly ladies of single condition, who reside in the vicinity. He has never proposed again. Mr Bob Sawyer, having previously passed through the Gazette, passed over to Bengal, accompanied by Mr Benjamin Allen, both gentlemen having received surgical appointments, from the East India Company. They each had the yellow fever fourteen times, and then resolved to try a little abstinence, since which period they have been doing well. Mrs Bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentlemen with great Boat, hut never brought any more actions for a breach of promise of marriage, er attorneys, Messrs Dodson and Fogg, continue in business, from which thev realise a large income, and in which they are universally considered among the sharpest of the sharp. Sam Weller kept his word, and remained unmarried for two years. The old housekeeper dying at the end of that time, Mr Pickwick promoted Mary to tbt situation, oa condition of her marrying Mr Weller at once, which she did without a murmur. From the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been repeatedly seen at tha gate of the back garden, we have reason to suppose that Sam has some family. The elder Mr Weller drove a coach for twelve months, but being afflicted with the gout, was compelled to retire. The contents of the pocket-book had been so well invested for him, however, by Mr Pickwick, that he had a handsome independence to retire on, upon which he still lives at an excellent public-house near Shooter's hill, where he is quite reverenced as an oracle, boasting very much of his intimacy with Mr Pickwick, and retaining a most unconauerable aversion to widows. Mr Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house, employing his leisure hoars in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club, or in hearing Sam Weller read aloud, with such remarks as suggested themselves to his original mind, which never failed to afford Mr Pickwick great amusement. He was much troubled at first by the numerous applications which were made to him hy Mr Snodgrass, Mr Winkle, and Mr Trundle, to act as godfather to their offspring, but he has become used to it now, and officiates as a matter of course, lie never had occasion to regret his bounty to Mr Jingle, for both that person and Job Trotter' became in time worthy members of society, although they have always steadily objected taratara to tha scenes of their old haunts and temptations. He is somewhat infirm now, but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit, aad may still be frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the Dalwieh Gallery, or enjoying n walk about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine day. Ha is known by nil the poor people about, who never fail to take their hats off as he passes with great respect; tbe children idolise him, nnd so indeed deas the whole neighbourhood. Every year he repairs to a large family merry-making at Mr Wardle'a; on this, as on all other occasions, he is invariably attended by the faithful Sam, between whom and his master there exists a steady aad reciprocal attachment, which nothing but death will saver. A preface which touches on some of the difficulties the author has had to contend with in his undertaking, and a dedication, are given in tbe last number. Tbe dedication is to Mr Serjeant Talfourd "" mm a slight and roost inadequate acknowledgment of the inestimable services he is rendering to the literature of his country, and of the lasting, benefits he will confer upon the authors of this and succeeding generations, by securing to them and their descendants a permanent interest in the copywright of their works.""The Posthumous Papers ofthe Pickwick Club. Edited by Boz. JNo. VIII. Chapman and Hall* We continue to read these papers with great admiration of the easy, original, and unaffected powers displayed in them. We should be ungrateful if we passed by the appearance of a new number without a word of notice and welcome. There is no flagging in this number before us. Every stroke of the writer's humour, the most common or the most careless, tells to a desired effect; and that rarely mastered distinction between thc power of embodying the serious and the ludicrous, is thoroughly mastered here. We should say that the grave passages of the number even excel the Comic, tn the heart-rending calamities of common life, as in its side-splitting oddities and humours* the writer bids fair to show himself unrivalled. The number opens with an impassioned rhapsody by a mysterious old law-clerk, on the many miseries that have darkened the dingy old Inns of Court. Mr Pickwick stares at him in silence. The old gentleman resumes with a leer :? "" Look at them in another light: their most common-place and least romantic : What fine places of slow torture they are. Think of the needy man who has spent his all, beggared himself, and pinched his friends, to enter the profession, which is destined never te yield a morsel of bread to him. The waiting?the hope?the disappointment?the fear?the misery?the poverty? the blight on his hopes, and end to his career?the suicide perhaps, or, better still, the shabby, slip-shod drunkard. Am I not righi about them, eh ?"" And the old man rubbed his hands, and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject. Mr Pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity, and the remainder of the company smiled, and looked on in silence. "" Talk of your German universities,"" said the little old man?"" Pooh, pooh! there's romance enough at home, Without going half a mile for it ( only people never tb ink of it."" "" I never thought of the romance of this particular subject before, certainly,"" said Mr. Pickwick, laughing. "" To be sure you didn't, "" said the little old man, a of course not As a friend bit of it.' said he. He died one morning_w ?, his outer door. Fell with his head in his own letter-box, and there he lay for eighteen months. Everybody thought he had gone out of town."" "" And how was he found at last ?"" hundred Mr Pickwick. "" The benchers determined to break his door open, as he hadn't paid any rent for two years. So they did. Forced the lock; and n very dusty skeleton in a blue coat, black knee-shorts, and silks, fell forward in tne arms of the porter who opened the door. Queer, that. Rather, perhaps; rather, eh r And the little old man put his head more on one side, and rubbed his hands with unspeakable glee. "" I know another case,"" said the little old man, when bia chuckles had io some degree subsided?"" It occurred in Clifford's Inn* Tenaat of a top ut ?bad character?shut himself up in his bed-room closet, and took a dose ol arsenic The steward thought he had ron away: opened the door, and pot a bill up.

He made the chango, aad slept very well at night, nnt suddenly found that somehow he couldn't read ia the evening: he got nervous and uncomfortable, aad used to be always straffing hit candles and staring about him. ?I can't make thia ont,' said be. whoa he came borne from Uie play one night, nnd waa drinking a glass of cold grog, with his back to tne wall, in order that he mightn't be abb to fancy there was any one behind fina ?< I can't make it ont,' said he; aad just thoa hit eyes rested on a Mtg closet that had been always locked np. ead a shudder ran through huiwno'J frame from top to toe. * I have felt thia strange feeling before, said ne? i cannot help thinking thorn's something wrong about thia closet.'

It's a wery remarkable circumstance, Sir,"" said Sam, "" that poverty and oysters always aeems to go together. u l don't underataad you, Sam,"" said Mr Pickwick. a What I mean, Sir,"" said Sam, "" is, that the poorer a place is, the greater call there seems to be for oysters. Look here, Sir; here's a oyster stall to efery half-dozen houses?the street's lined vith 'ern. Blessed if I don't think that ven a man's wery poor, he rushes out of his lodgings, and eats oysters in reg'lar desperation. ? To be sure he does,"" said Mr Weller senior, "" and it's just the same vith pickled salmon!"" * Those are two very remarkable facts, which never occurred to me before,"" ?aid Mr Pickwick. "" The very first place we stop at I'll make a note of By this time they had reached the turnpike at Mile End; a profound silence prevailed, until thev had got two or three miles further on, when Mr Weller senior, turning suddenly to Mr Pickwick, said? ** Wery queer life is a pike-keeper's, Sir."" ? A what ?"" said Mr Pickwick. "" A pike-keeper.' ? What do you mean by a pike-keeper ?"" inquired Mr Peter Magnus. "" The old *un means a turnpike-keeper, gen'lm'n,"" observed Mr Weller, in explanation. .... ?Oh,"" said Mr Pickwick, "" I see. Yes; very curious life. Very uncomfortable."" ? They're all on 'em, men as has met vith some disappointment in life,"" said Mr Weller senior. "" Ay, ay ? "" said Mr Pickwick. "" Yes. Consequence of vich, they retires from the world, and shuts themselves up in pikes; partly vith the view of being solitary, and partly to rawenge themselves on mankind, by takin' tolls."" N Deat me,"" said Mr Pickwick, "" I never knew that before."" "" Fact, Sir,"" said Mr Weller, "" if they was gen'lm'n you'd cali 'era misanthropes, but as it is they only takes to pike-keepin'."" All this is excellent, but the wit of Boz, excellent as it is, has not exhausted this subject of Turnpikes. He may return to it with some effect. We look upon it as only another strong proof of tbeir misanthropical turn for annoying and disappointing mankind, that they are specially called Trusts, because they all declare "" No Trust."" It is malice and false pretence. The elder Mr Weller acquits himself through the number in a manner infinitely worthy of his esteemed aad ingenious son. We will close our extracts by quoting his touching farewell to Sam, when he is obliged to resume the reins for London :? ? pm a goin' to leave you, Samivel my boy, and there's no telling ven I shall see you again. Your mother-in-law may ha' been too much for me, or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o' the celebrated Mr Yeller o' the Bell Savage. The family name dependa wery much upon you, Samivel, and I hope you'll do wot's right by it Upon all little piata o' breedin', I know I may trust you as veil as if it was my own self. So i've only this here one little bit of adwice to give you. If ever you ?no matter and pison to say to that. Pison yourself, Samivel my boy, pison yourself, and you'll be glad on it afterwards."" With these affecting words, Mr Weller looked steadfastly on his son, nnd turning slowly upon his heel, disappeared from his sight."" We see in this the foreshadowing of some deep and pathetic interest or other, and wait impatiently for the ninth number of the Papers of the Pickwick.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwickian Club. Indited by Bo/,. And The Library of Fiction ; or, lui utily Story Teller. Boz marches on triumphantly, and has completely taken possession of the ear, and of the hearts, too, of his countrymen. His fifth number is .joyous in the scenes of a contested election, and the honest wonder and indignation ol' the great Mr. Pickwick at the venality he witnesses are charming. The contents of the ** Story Teller "" this month are all good, and two of the pieces are original, the one ""Jesse Chile,"" by Miss Mitford, and "" the Alchymist,"" by Mr. Harvey. This is really a great advance upon the last. Hoing thus, this periodical cannot fail to do well.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club ; containing a Faithful Record of thc Perambulations, Perils, Travels, Adventures, and Sporting Transactions of the Correspotiding Members. Edited by Boz. With Illustrations. The public have now had a full dozen of these papers, and they are cager for a dozen more. They seem to increase in interest and ability as they proceed. Instead of flagging, they grow more uproarious in their fun, and more rich in their drollery. We like this number the best of any that have yet appeared, still it has a striking fault; and we shall take this opportunity of reading Master Boz a friendly lecture in public, that we are quite secure he would not submit to in private. When he brings his scenes home to us in their familiarity of every-day life, he should always be not only strictly possible, but even probable. Thus, if an artist choose to paint a dragon or a chimera, we give him a little latitude as to his proportions, and the free use of his colours ; but should he choose to paint a pig, it must be a pig, and nothing else but a pig that he paints, or we shall pronounce his attempt a failure. The trial scene, that makes the interest of this volume, is as familiar to his readers, as is the appearance of a denizen of the sty ; and everybody who reads it knows, badly as much of our judicature is conducted, that the verdict was not possible from the evidence produced. This is a pity, inasmuch as it has no- thing to do with the humour of the proceedings. If it were necessary for the following out of the story, that the venerable and much-to.beidolized Pickwick should be wrongfully cast in damages, the evidence against him should have been made stronger?the misconception could easily afterwards have been explained away. However, ull this may not have struck the million. But we will still maintain that, however wild may be the fiction, or rampant the humour of a literary production, all the groundwork upon which it is erected, such as the face of the country, the manners of the time, and the operations of public institutions, should be strictly in accordance with truth.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, containing a faithful Record of the Perambulations, Ptriis, Travels. Adventures, and Sporting Transactions of the Corresponding Members. Edited bv Box. With Illustrations. Boz iroes on triumphing, and has again proved to the world that the comic muse is not yet quite defunct. The seventh number of this Pickwickian risibility has more than rivalled the preceding six. The sporting excursion on the 1st of September, which was undertaken with all the strength of the club, still more strong in its adjutant, Sam Weller, is one of the best things of the sort that we have ever read. The impounding of the dignified leader in a barrow, among the pigs and the asses, in the Tillage receptacle for the wandering, is a happy hit, and, though a most powerful, still a most probable one. For quiet humour, and keen satirical acumen, the interview with the lawyers is really not to be stirpassed. The next number promises us a rich treat. Wo are just admitted into the vestibule, with the folding-doors partially opened, that are to disclose some rich scenes?upon which we are impatient to enter.Posthumous leapers of the Pickwick Club; containing a Faithful Pecord of the l\ramhnhttions, Perils, Travels, Adventures, anil Sport- ing Transactions of thc Corresponding Me min rs. tl'!i.l. III........ Edited by Boz. v\ itu illustrations. Very good, this number the eleventh, indeed. Sam Weller improves upon acquaintance. The world never saw drollery and wit offered to them before in a form so singular. The renowned Mr. Pickwick is, himself, the legitimate successor to Don Quixote ; indeed, he is the cockney Quixote of the nineteenth century, and instead of armour of iron, he is encased in a good coating of aldermanie fat, and instead of spear and sword, has his own powers of declamation with which to go forth to do fearful hattie upon the swindler, the wrong-doer, and the oppressor of the innocent. Wc wish that the humorous Boz would call to mind that the knight of La Mancha was really the victim of a veritable flame. We should like to see Mr. Pickwick confess to the soft impeachment. This gentleman's attendant has the process of mollification already going forward in his heart;?we trust that it will not ascend to his head, but that he will make love with the same effect that hitherto he does everything else. Wc know of no publication that is productive ot more genuine amusement than these Pickwickian papers.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club. Edited by Boz. No. IX. Chapman and Hall. This is the best Pickwick we have had. The humour is broad, rich, and effective as usual; and there are sharper and nicci touches of character. The sketch of "" George Nupkins, Esquire,"" the Magistrate ol Ipswich, with all its accessories, is done to the life. This gentleman receives information of a duel, in which tbe amiable Mr Pickwick is found to be involved *? u It's a most extraordinary thing,"" said the astounded Magistrate. ? Mossie."" a Yes. your worship.'* * * Send mr Jinks here, directly?instantly."" u Yes. yew worship.""

"" This lady, Mr Jinks, has come here to give information of an intended dael ia this town."" Mr Jinks, not exactly knowing what to do, smiled a dependent's smile. a What are-you laughing at, Mr Jinks ?"" said the Magistrate. Mr Jinks looked serious instantly. "" Mr Jinks,"" said the Magistrate, ""youVe a fool, Sir."" Mr Jiaks looked humbly at the great man, and bit the top of his pen. ""Yoe amy see something very comical in this information, Sir; but I caa tell yoe this, Mr Jinks, that you have very little to laugh at,"" said the Magistrate* Tba hBeery-looking Jinks sighed, as if he were quite aware of the fact af-bia fevmw very little indeed to be merry about; and, being ordered to rn may's informatioa, shambled to a seat, aad proceeded to write it Mr Jinka ia a likeness of exquisite reality; touching* and even painful for its troth, while contributing most richly to the humour Of tho eeene. Mr drummer, an elderly gentleman in top boots, who forme tho Constabulary of Ipswich, is another most exact portrait;?he appears upon the scene at an interesting moment, having owly jost ouelled a great rebellion of the scholars of the lomat day-schooi hi' the town, who had conspired to break the windows of aa obnoxious apple-seller:?

Crummer proceeds with bis warrants to tho hotel of the Pickwickians, and insinuates *.himself into their presence:? Mr Grummer's mode of proceeding was professional, bot peculiar. Hie first act was to bolt the door on the inside; his second to polish Ms head and countenance very carefully with a cotton handkerchief; his third to jAocO his hat, with the cotton handkerchief in it, on the nearest chair; and rn* fourth to produce from tbe breast-pocket of his coat, a short truncheon sui uJowuted by a brazen crown, with which he beckoned to Mr Pickwick with a grave aad ghost-like air. Mr Snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence. He looked steadily at Mr Grummer for a brief space, and then said, emphatically?a This is a private room, Sir?a private room."" Mr Grummer shook his head, and replied?"" No room's private to his Majesty when the street door's once passed. That's law. Some people maintains that an Englishman's house is hit castle. That*s gammon."" A scene of great spirit and humour follows, which ends in Mr Pickwick's obeying thc laws of his country, and entering a sedan-chair with Mr Tupman for the purpose of being earned before the Magistrate. 8am Weller attempts a rescue, but after sundry great achievements of personal prowess, is himself made prisoner, and brought with the other offenders into the presence of inflamed and outraged Justice in the person of Mr Nupkins :? ** What's your name, fellow ?"" thundered Mr Nu pk ins. ** Yeller,"" replied Sam. "" A very good name for the Newgate Calendar,"" said Mr Nupkins. This was a joke : so Jinks, Grummer, Dubbley, all the specials, and Muzzle, went into fits of laughter of five minutes' duration. "" Put down his name, Mr Jinks,"" said the magistrate. ? Two L's, old feller,"" said Sam. Here an unfortunate special laughed again, whereupon the magistrate threatened to commit him instantly. It's a dangerous thing, laughing at the witkaa; man, in these cases. "" Where do you live ?"" said the magistrate. "" Yare-ever i can,"" replied Sam. "" Put down that, Mr Jinks,"" said the magistrate, who was fast rising tate a rage. "" Score it under,"" said Sam. "" He is a vagabond, Mr Jinks,"" said the magistrate. "" He is a vagabond on his own statement, is he not, Mr Jinks ?"" ""Certainly, Sir."" * "" Then I'll commit him?I'll commit him, as such,"" said Mr Napkins. "" This is a wery impartial country for justice,"" said Sam. ""Tnere ain't a magistrate going, as don't commit himself, twice as often as he commits other people."" At this sally another special laughed, and then tried to look so tuperoatu* rally solemn, that the magistrate detected him immediately. An inimitably humorous passage ensues in which it appears eer* tain that the Inst named unlucky special must have been committed, . only that Mr Jinks, who is the Magistrate's adviser (having bad k legal education of three years in a country attorney's office), whispers the Magistrate that bc thinks it wouldn't do, and so Mr Nop. kins makes a speech and says that, in consideration of the special's family, he shall merely reprimand and discharge him* Poor Mr Jinks afterwards saves the "" tremendous"" Mr Nupkins from Anally committing Mr Pickwick without a hearing. That illustrious maa is permitted to speak :? "" First,"" said Mr Pickwick, sending a look through his spectacles, under which even Nupkins quailed. u First, I wish to know what I aad my frteed have been brought here for ?"" "" Must I tell him ?"" whispered the magistrate to Jinks.

This is, beyond a doubt, the most original and amusing series of comic sketches that have been published in our time; and we are inclined to think the present number, so far as they have gone, the best of them. The jest is kent up with excellent breadth of humour, and a most studied insight into the niceties and peculiarities of character. Scene after scene is worked out as if on the spur of the occasion, without much appearance of any previous bias or ultimate purpose, but always broadly and powerfully, and from a rich rein of comic invention. The style continues racy and unaffected. The writer reminds us frequently, in his ingenuity, in the vivacity of his talents, in the wonderful local truth of his pictures, and in the general accuracy of his observation and humour, as well as in the ease and animation of his manner, of the elder English comedies and farces. He has a share of the ludicrous invention of Vanbrugh, and touch of the higher powers of Wycherley. The number before us opens with a serious imputation on the character of Mr Winkie, whose friendly attentions to Mrs Pott, the wife of the redoubted Editor of the Eatanstrill Gazette, were remarked upon in a previous number. As Mr Winkle is sitting in Mr Pott's breakfast room, in all the unconscious simplicity of perfect innocence. Mr P. enters and calls him a "" Serpent."" Mr W. very naturally supposes this to be a piece of pleasantry. We recommend what follows to the reader, in the hope that none of our contemporaries will suppose its allusions levelled at them :? "" Pleasantry, Sir !"" exclaimed Pott, with a motion of the hand, indicative of a strong desire to hurl the Britannia metal tea-pot at the head of his visitor. u Pleasantry, Sir !-but no, I will be calm: Fwill be calm, Sir;"" and in proof of his calmness Mr Pott flung himself into a chair, and foamed at the mouth. "" My dear Sir,"" interposed Mr Winkle. "" Dear Sir !"" replied Pott. "" How dare vou address me as dear Sir, Sir ? How dare you look me in the face and do it ?** "" Well, Sir, if you come to that,"" responded Mr Winkle, "" how dare yon look me in the face, and call me a serpent, Sir ? "" Because you are one,"" replied Mr Pott. ? Prove it, Sir,"" said Mr Winkle, warmly. ? Prove it."" A malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor as he drew from his pocket the Independent of that morning; and laying his finger on a particular paragraph, threw the journal across the table to Mr Winkle. That gentleman took it np, and read as follows :? "" Our obscure and filthy contemporary, in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough, has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life, and to refer, in a manner not to be misunderstood, to the personal affairs of our late candidate?aye, and notwithstanding his base defeat, we will add, our future member, Mr Fizkin. What does our dastardly contemporary mean ? What would the ruffian say, if we, setting at naught, like him, the decencies of social intercourse, were to raise the curtain which happily conceals his private life from general ridicule, not to say from general execration ? What, if we were even to point ont, and comment on, facts and circumstances which are publicly notorious, and beheld by every one but our mole-eyed contemporary?what if we were to print the following effusion, which we received while we were writing the commencement of this artiele, from a talented fellow-townsman and correspondent :? "" ? LINES TO A BRASS POT. "" < Oh Pott! if you'd known How false she'd hare grown, When you heard the marriage hells tinkle; You'd have done then, I vow, What you cannot help now, And handed her over to W * ? ? * V "" ? What,"" said Mr Pott, solemnly?"" what rhymes to * tinkle,' villain ?"" "" What rhymes to tinkle ?"" said Mrs Pott, whose entrance at the moment forestalled the reply. "" What rhymes to tinkle ? Why, Winkle, I should conceive;"" and saying this, Mrs Pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed Pickwickian, and extended her hand towards him. The agitated young maa would have accepted it, in his confusion, had not Pott indignantly interposed. "" Back, Ma'am?back,"" said the editor. "" Take his hand before my very face ln "" Mr P*!"" said his astonished lady. "" Wretched woman, look here,** exclaimed the husband* "" Look here, Ma'am?< Lines to a brass Pot,' Ma'am. ' Brass pot;'?that's me, Ma'am. * False she'd have grown ;'?that's vou, Ma'am?you."" With this ebullition of rage, which was not unaccompanied with something like a tremble, at tho expression of his wife's face, Mr Pott dashed the current number of tho Eatanswill Independent at her feet. "" Upon my word, Sir,"" said the astonished Mrs Pott, stooping to pick up the pantr. "" Upon my word, Sir."" Mr Pot winced beneath the contemptuous gate of his wife. He had made a desperate straggle to screw op his courage, but it was fast coming uasorewed again. There appears nothing very tremendous in this little sentence, ? Upon my word, Sir, when it comes to be read; but the tone of voice io which H was delivered, and the look that accompanied it, both seeming to bear reference to some revenge to be thereafter wreaked upon the bead of Foti, produced their full effect upon him.

"" He must hare been a very ingenious young man, that, Sam,"" said Mr Pickwick, with a slight shudder. "" Just was, Sir,"" replied Mr Weller, continuing his occupation of emptying the basket, "" and the pies was beautiful"" We began by describing an imputation on the character of Mr Winkle, and we regret to say that, before the number closes, Mr Pickwick himself plays some opening passages in the part of defendant in an action for "" breach of promise."" His visit to the office of Messrs Dodson and Fogg is inimitably told:?the sketch of the clerks is finished adunguem. But we must pass these, and also the sharp lineaments of Captain Boldwig, and likewise the choice spirits assembled at the Magpie and Stump, for the purpose of introducing the father of Mr Weller, and the scene of his affectionate recognition. Sam and Mr Pickwick have turned in for a few minutes to a house of refreshment, by way of relief from thc toils of a verv anxious afternoon:? m* The room was one of a very homely description, and was apparently under the especial patronage of stage coachmen; for several gentlemen, who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession, were drinking and smoking in the different boxes. Among the number was one stout, red-meed, elderly man in particular, seated in an opposite box, who attracted Mr Pickwick's attention. The stout man was smoking with great vehemence, but between every half-dozen puffs he took his pipe from nis mouth, and looked first at Mr Weller and then at Mr Pickwick. Then he would bury in a (juart pot, as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving, and take another look at Sam and Mr Pickwick. Then he would take another half-dozen puffs with an air of profound meditation, and look at them again. And at last the stout man, putting up his legs on the ?eat, and leaning his back against the wall, began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all, and to stare through the smoke at the new comers, as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them. At first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped Mr Weller's observation, but by decrees, as he saw Mr Pickwick's eyes every now and then turning towards lum, he began to gaze in the same direction, at the same time shading his eyes with nis hand, as if he partially recognised the object before him, and wished to make quite sure of its identity. His doubts were speedily dispelled, however; for the stout man having blown a thick cloud hom his pipe, a hoarse voice, like some strange effort of ventriloquism, emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his throat and chest, and slowly uttered these sounds?"" Vy, Sammy."" "" Who's that, Sam? "" inquired Mr Pickwick. "" Why, I wouldn't ha' believed it, Sir,"" replied Mr Weller, with astonished eyes. "" It's the old 'un."" "" Old one,"" said Mr Pickwick. ? What old one ? "" "" My father, Sir,"" replied Mr Weller. "" How are you, my ancient?"" And with this beautiful ebullition of filial affection, Mr Weller made room, on the seat beside him, fbr the stout roan, who advanced, pipe in mouth and pot in hand, to greet him. "" Vy, Sammy,"" said the father, "" I han't seen you for two years and better.*' "" Nor more you have, old codger,"" replied the son. "" How's mother in law ? "" "" Vy, I'll tell you what, Sammy,"" said Mr Weller, senior, with much solemnity in his manner, "" there never was a nicer woman, as a widder, than that 'ere second wentur o' mine?a sweet cretur she was, Sammy, and all I can say on her now is, that aa she was such an uncommon pleasant widder, it's a great pity ahe ever changed her condition. She don't act as a vife, Sammy."" "" Don't she, though ? "" inquired Mr Weller, junior. The elder Mr Weller shook his head, as he replied with a sigh,"" I've done t once too often, Sammy; I've done it once too often."" The illustrations are excellent. They are quite equal to the best attempts of Mr Seymour in the early numbers.The Posthumous Pt tpc rs of thc Pichtvick Club* containing a Faithful liecord of the Perambulations, Perils* Tnt eels* Adventures* and Sporting 'Transactions* of thc ('or responding Members.

Wv notice these two works together, because together they first appeared, and together we are in the habit of receiving them at the beginning of each month. But the race is all in favour of the Pickwick Club, elderly though its members be, and very obese its renowned chairman and sundry of its members. "" Bo//' is making for himself a .standard fame, and this number is, perhaps, the best that luis yet appeared. The witjif these papers is subtle and beneath the surface ; their humour is not that of extravagance, but of nature. The laugh that the author has raised against the strenuous trilling oj antiquarianism is a fair laugh, and it is exquisitely excited. The whole thing is well clone, and we shall say no more. In the Library of Fiction, the *k Diary of a Surgeon"" does not improve. "" Sandie Saudeman, the Piper,"" will be pleasing to a certain class of readers, and of the non-original papers we shall say nothing. Thc redeeming point of this number is tk The Sybil's Stone,"" by the author of the "" Gentleman in Black."" Though the idea has often been worked up before, yet it is so pleasantly done that we do not regret its want of novelty. We wish well to this periodical, and we trust that, in its next number, it will put forth greater strength. Even the engravings are infinitely inferior to those of its Pickwickian brother.The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club. By ""Boz.'* (Nos. 1 to 6.) Chapman and Hall. As a lively caricaturist, the author of these papers may take rank with some of the best comic writers in the language. In hitting off the eccentricities of life, few have excelled him. His style is fresh and racy, and has all the stamp of an original spirit. Tbe reader will thank us for the extracts we are about to make, if he bas not already had the good fortune to meet with thc papers themselves. The idea worked out is that of a "" faithful record of the perambulations, perils, travels, adventures, and sporting transactions"" ofthe corresponding members of a cockney club, founded by Mr Pickwick, "" for the promotion of science, thc advancement of knowledge, and the diffusion of learning."" The corresponding members consist of thc illustrious founder himself, whose character is sustained throughout with a very romantic gravity, and of Messrs Tupman, Snodgrass, and Winkle, who are respectively distinguished by admiration ofthe fair sex, a taste for poetry, and a sporting turn. The different parties play upon one another's failings, and into one another's hands?thc plot of their adventures is kept up with infinite liveliness, bustle, point, and interest?and many neb sources of the truly ludicrous are opened. Tne nature of Mr PickwicVs observations on the various towns that are visited, may be gathered from an abridgment of what he says on Stroud, Rochester, Chatham, and Brompton. His impressions of their appearance certainly do not differ in any material point from those of other travellers wbo have gone over tha same ground? rn Tbs priooisnl prodactions of to os soMisfB) st-NSf-pS} #owoi sass**. oppbjs* flsMML mmn\ svssors* sha rn lt If SraWsSSislw to a pJ_flMfcsspoisj~o)sY ia ssa tba SSMSBSO of SB nf thoma tomoo,"" soy* Mr Pickwick, ***hg* % tMsMS) oAiwf*. ami damkymH bm* lb sols ss tho amati* stfoots, oro aaaiaa o*soJoo? oxpoooi fer sols bi tho pobBe ?trotts, sro tasrtiaa s*SJo~)L _-~-wt*_A*l _______% ________________% ^_\_____\_p o__i_____\ ffmoim of tibaa kai boomsii more liquor; in return for which he had (taerely io pmyfuloess) drawn his bayonet; and wounded the girl in the shoulder.

A superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic; but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity, it is truly gratifying."" Our next extract is an admirable picture of a family party. The travellers have been invited to the house of a good-humoured country gentleman, Mr Wardle. Some strokes of character in the following description of the scene of their reception, are truly excellent for humour, force, and reality:? A very old lady, in a lofty cap and faded silk gown?no less a personage than Mr Wardle s mother?occupied the post of honour on the right-hand comer of the chimney-piece; and various certificates of her having been brought up ia the way ihe should go when young, and of her not having departed from it when old, ornamented the walls, in the form of samplers of ancient date, worsted landscapes of equal antiquity, and crimson silk tea-kettle holders of a more modern period. The au ut, the two young ladies, and Mr Wardle, each vying with the other in paving zealous and unremitting attentions to tbe old lad}', crowded round her easy chair, one holding her ear-trumpet, another an orange, and a third a smelling-bottle, while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows, which were arranged for her support. On the opposite side, sat a bald-headed old gentleman, with a goodhumoured benevolent face?the clergy noan of Dingley Dell; and next him sat his wife, a stout blooming old lady, who looked as if she were well skilled, not only in the art and mystery ot manufacturing home-made cordials greatly to other people's satisfaction, but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own. A little hard-headed, Ripstone pippin-faced man, was conversing with a fat old gentleman *n one corner; ana two or three more old gentlemen, and two or three more old ladies, sat bilt-upright and motionless on their chairs, staring very hard at Mr Pickwick and bis fellow-voyagers. ""Mr Pickwick, mother,'* said Mr Wardle, at the very top of his voice "" Ah!"" maid the old lady, shaking her head; "" I can't hear you."" "" Mr Pickwick, grandma !"" screamed both the young ladies together. "" Ah !"" exclaimed the old lady. ""Well; it don't much matter. He don't grasping the old lady's hand, care for an old 'ooman like me, I dare say."" u I assure you, Ma'am,"" said M r Pickwick, and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance; "" I assure vou, Ma am, that nothing delights me more, than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family, and looking so young and well."" 44 Ah !"" said the old lady, after a short pause; "" It's all very fine, I dare ssy; bot I can't bear him."" u Grandma's rather put out now,"" said Miss Isabella Wardle, in a low tone; ** but she'll talk to vou presently."" Mr Pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age, and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle. ? Delightful situation this,"" said Mr Pickwick. u Delightful!"" echoed Messrs Snodgrass, Tupman, and Winkle. ? Welt, I think it is,"" said Mr Wardle. ? There ain't a better ipot o ground in all Kent* Sir,"" said the hard-headed man with the pippin-face; ""there aint indeed, Sir?Fm sure there ain't, Sir ;*' and the hard-headed man looked triumphantly round, as if he had been very muck contradicted by somebody* but had got the better of him at last. 44 There ain't a better spot o' ground in all Kent*"" said the hard-headed man again, after a pause. u 'Cent Mullins' Meadows,"" observed the fat man, solemnly. u Mullios' Meadows !"" ejaculated the other, with profound contempt. ^ Ah, Mullins' Meadows,"" repeated the fat man. "" Heg'lar good land that,"" interposed another fat man. "" And so it is, sure-ly,"" said a third fat man. <( Everybody knows that,"" said the corpulent host The hard-headed man looked dubiously round* but finding himself in a minority* assumed a compassionate air, and said no more. "" What are they talking about ?"" inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters, in a very audible voice; tor, like roany deaf people, she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself. "" About the land, grandma."" "" What about the land ??Nothing the matter, is there ?"" u No, no. Mr Miller was saying our land was better than Mullins' Meadows."" ** How should he know anything about it ?"" inquired the old lady indignantly. u Miller's a conceited coxcomb, and you may tell him I said so Saving which, the old lady, ouite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper, drew herself up, and looked carving-knives at the hard-headed delinquent. "" Come, come,"" said the bustling host, with a natural anxiety to change the conversation?u W hat say you to a rubber, Mr Pickwick ?"" "" 1 should like it of all things,"" replied that gentleman; "" but pray don't make up one on my account."" "" Oh, I assure you, mother's very food of a rubber,"" said Mr Wardle; ""ain't you, mother?"" The old lady, who waa much lass deaf on this subject than on say other, replied ia the affirmative. In his efforts to please hts visitors, Mr Wardle is careful to consult their various tastes. He proposes rook-shooting to the sportloving Winkle, and the following scene is the result. The "" Alt boy*9 who figures in it, we should observe, is a most felicitous creation. He is a very Daniel Lambert of a boy, in fat and Isxiness. He goes on errands fast asleep, aad snores sa he waits at table:? -Thia ii tba psacn,"" said the old giotlomoo, ponsmy oller a ssw io oa a veone of trune- Tho ieJbnoetioo woe eee*ceesary; for the eawiag sf tho aacoaacioas rooka saflektatlj ieaHeatsd their I gentlemen Issi sm aaa oa tbs gi*s?J, sad lossie* tte stow. ttsy msm*r essa M^lhehwfc* i emi ss bo oosha, tba forans rf Mr and Mt WJetde if yisral is tbs oJsUain, The fol i wbieb goasaaame ba waa obi mi to eal, kai topmsttt tlmpossieoltyrf ?j Imhi.

Fire nra? ** Mr Winkle advanced, and levelled his gun. Mr Pickwick and his friend. cowered involuntarily to escape damage from the heavy fall of rook*, whick they felt quite certain would be occasioned by the devastating barrel of their friend. There was a solemn pause?a shoat?a flapping of wiora?a faint click. "" Hallo!"" said the.ojd gentleman. ? Won't it go P? inquired Mr Pickwick. "" Missed fire,"" said Mr Winkle, who was very pale, probably from disappointment. "" Odd,"" said the old gentleman, taking the gun. "" Never bew oq? of them miss fire before. Why, I don't see anything of the cap.*' "" Bless my soul,"" said Mr Winkle. "" I declare I forgot the cap!"" The slight omission was rectified. Mr Pickwick crouched again. Mr Winkle stepped forward with an air of determination and resolution; and Mr Tupman looked out from behind a tree. The boy shouted;?four birds fler out Mr Winkle fired. There was a scream as of an individual?not a rook ?in corporeal anguish. Mr Tupman had saved the lives of iaoumerablc unoffending birds, by receiving a portion of the charge in his left arm. The various incidents that arise out ofthe visit ofthe Pickwick. ians to the borough of Eatanswill are told with excellent whim and shrewdness. A little high-dried attorney, Mr Perker, adviser to the Honourable Samuel Slumkey, is happily sketched. He has placed "" twenty washed mea9' at Mr SI um key's door on the day of the election, for him to shake bands with, and six children in arms for him to pat on the head, and enquire the age of? There was a moment of awful suspense as the procession waitad for tht Honourable Samuel Slumkey to step into his carriage. Suddenly the crowd ut up a great cheering. "" He has come out,"" said little Mr Perker, greatly excited; the mort so as their position did not enable them to see what was going forward. Another cheer, much louder. "" He has shaken hands with the men,"" cried the little agent. Another cheer, far more vehement. "" He has patted the babes on the head,"" said Mr Perker, trembling with anxiety. A roar of applause tbat rent the air. "" He has kissed one of 'em !"" exclaimed the delighted little man, A second roar. "" He has kissed another,"" gasped the excited manager. A third roar. ? He's kissing 'em all!"" screamed the enthusiastic little gcntleriMAnd hailed by the deafening shouts ofthe multitude, tbe procession moted oo.

The wood-cut illustrations are excellent Where this author places himself under the imputation of coarseness it is only by that amount of sympathy with some portions of his subject, without which he could not enter into, or describe, as he does so thoroughly, the ludicrous eccentricities of life. Humour cannot always be refined.Thc Posthumous Papers of thc Pickwick Club, containing a Faithful Hecordofthc Perambulations, Perils, Travels, and Adventures, of the Corresponding 3/embers. Edited by Hoz. With Four Illus- trations by Seymour. This, like the publication above, also goes on well. The Stroller's tale is ns true to the life as it is melancholy. The dying Stroller has been well illustrated by Seymour. This number tells us it was his last?that he was employed upon it when the fatal mania overtook him. It is a heartrending subject, that engraving, and too exciting for the sensitive and over-wrought nerves of misery. Might it not have been the one drop ot bitterness that made the poor artist's cup of anguish overflow, and thus incite him to pour out his life wantonly with it ? When a wretch is balancing on the edge of a precipice, small is the weight that will precipitate him down the abyss. Let us leave this painful subject. The present number is very good, and the description of thc review graphic. We have been also much entertained bv the adventures and misadventures of that brigade of the club that went foraging on horseback, and in a chaise, or the hospitality of thc hearty and honest Mr. Wardle. We think that the latter gentleman's Fat Boy is a little too sleepy. It is, however, a good conception. Mr. Pickwick himself is, as the nurse of Juliet says, ""A'man of wax?a mould?a bright light among his brethren."" We hope, notwithstanding the ominous word ""Posthumous,"" that bc is not quite dead?buried, at least, in oblivion, he never will be. We hope some day to view him in all the vigour of vitality, and in his own improper person."

A NEW edition of Thackeray's novel, of which he is proudest, although the public place others far higher in their esteem, needs neither criticism nor commendation. It bad established its fame in the costly form of throe volumnes, and it now seeks the patronage of a vastly wider circle in a single volume, at a price that brings it within the reach of humble means. Its appearance just now is peculiarly welcome, for "" The Virginians"" is a sort of continuation of it, and the serial publication of that tale will pass it into hands that could not have procured the three volumes, but who will now be most desirous of making acquaintance with the predecessors of the personages to whom they have been lately introduced."
122,B5928,['6691507'],"The Land of Pearl and Gold. By Alexander Macdonald, F.R.G.S. (Blackie and Son, Ltd., ios. 6d. net.) This is a very attractive collection of breezy tales of prospecting, mining, and travel in and on the coasts of Australia, in New Guinea, and other islands. Pearl is given precedence of gold in the title, but in the text there is only one tale of pearl fishing, and that is nearly at the end. But a pearl is the lady of all gems, and so the title is in the best of taste. Place aux dames! Mr. Macdonald tells these sixteen tales in the first person, and there is not one that is dull. He delineates his characters with force and sympathy, and we quickly make friends with many of them. "" Mac,"" the huge Scotchman, is his constant henchman, as loyal as he is self-assertive, as tender-hearted as he is fierce. Morris, the gentlemanminer and "" new chum,"" whose nerves are so unstrung when his mate, "" the Shadow,"" lights a detonating-fuse in a shaft that he jumps for the rope by which he and Shadow are to be hauled into safety, and so pulls down the windlass-barrel. But, having seemingly doomed himself and comrade to destruction, his nerve is good enough again, and he digs below the burning fuse and cuts off its connection with the charge (see ""The Golden Promise Mine ""). "" The Warden "" is a resident magistrate who holds the wildest valley of New Guinea in the hollow of his hand, being feared by cannibal natives and worshipped by pioneer miners to the extent that their first preoccupation was to avoid any action which might involve him with his seniors?happily a no uncommon type among those in whose hands lies the honour of the Empire at its outposts (see "" Men of the Yodda Valley""); and there are many others whom the reader will not forget. Though many fortunes are made in the gold and other mining fields, too seldom, alas ! does the pioneer or bona fide miner slam the cream. He has many dangers and difficulties to overcome?physical, dangers of fatigue, fever, and thirst. The enmity of the aboriginals, the wile of the mining Chinee, these produce a stirring tale in "" White, Black, and Yellow,"" when threatening black men, preparing a great corroboree are attracted to the camp of no less hostile Chinamen, and one enemy disperses the other. But the canteen-keeper and the sharper are almost the worst enemies of all, and the tactics by which a good find must sometimes be secured to the pioneer is humorously told in "" How we Held Mackay's Find."" ""On a Colonial Coaster,"" which tells of of a voyage round Australia, sounds a little improbably rough and haphazard ; but "" A Sugar Expert"" deserves notice. A mining engineer is pressed into visiting the sugarplantations of the Bardekin Delta, and spends a bewildering two days amid hospitality and culture, resource and cultivation. He finds sugar and sago, pineapple and vineyards, all thriving, and a planter who invents anything from a shower-bath to a flying-machine, and whose steam sugarcutter is to solve the great difficulty of labour; for the Kanaka is no longer to be admitted, and white labour unions are fast making planting a losing game. A blank cheque is offered the miner for a report as a "" sugar expert,"" which is never filled in. Mr. Macdonald describes scenery with an artist's pen, and he is nowhere happier than in "" The Pearling Grounds,"" when he donned the diver's dress and went down to a coral reef: I stood in the midst of a magnificent marine forest, where graceful coral branches intertwined with less material tendril growth. The fronds of the coral palms trembled as if in a gentle, breeze, and the more robust growths swayed slowly to and fro."" And so we will leave Mr. Macdonald, but well above water. "" The Land of Pearl and Gold "" will be always a welcome companion to those who like to read of men doing man's work in the wilds."

""' What name?' said the girl. **' Nickleby,' replied Knlpli. ""'Ob! Mr?. Nickleby,' said the girl, throwing open the door,' here's Mr. Nickleby.' 44 A lady in deep mourning arose as Mr. Nickleby entered, but appeared incapable of advancing to meet him, and leant upon the arm of a slight but very beautiful girl of about seventeen, who had been sitting by her. A youth, who appeared a year or two older,stepped forward and saluted Ralph as bis uncle. ** * Oh,'growled Ralph, with an ill-favoured frown, ?you are Nicholas, I suppose?'' * 'That is my name. Sir,' replied the youth. ** * Put my hat down,' siid Ralph, imperiously. *Wi*ll, ma'am, bow do you do? You must bear up against sorrow, ma'am ; I always do.' ** * Mine was no common loss!' said Mrs. Nickleby, applying ber handkerchief to her eyes. *? ? It was no 'o'connnon loss, ma'am,' returned Ralph, as he coolly unbuttoned his spencer. * flus, bands die every dav, ma'am, and wives too.' ** * And brothers also, ""Sir,' said Nicholas, with a glance of indignation. ""' Yes, Sir, and puppies mid pug-dog? likewise,' replied his uncle, taking a chair. ' Von didn't mention in your letter what my brother's complaint was, ma'am.' "" 'The doctors could attribute it to no particular disease,'said Mrs. Nickleby, shedding tears. * Wo have too much reason to fear that bc died of a broken heart. **' Pooh !' said Ralph,' there's no such thing. I can understand a man's dying of a broken neck, or mi Henna: from a broken arm, or a broken head, or a broken leg, or a broken nn.-o; but a broken heart? nonsense, it's the cant of the day. If a man can't pay his debts, lie dies of a broken heart, and his widow's a martyr.' j ""' .Some people, I believe, have no hearts to break,' j observed Nicholas, quietly. j **' How old is this Iwiy, for God's ?ake .' inquired Ralph, wheeling hack hi* chair, and surveying his, nephew from head to foot with intense scorn. '""Nicholas is \iry nearly nineteen,' replied the widow. "" * Nineteen, eli !' said Ralph, ' and what do you mean to do for jour bread. Sir?' ?*' Not to lise upon my mother,' replied Nicholas, bis heart swelling a*, he spoke. "" ' You'd have little tuouidi to live upon if you did.' retorted the uncle, eyeing him contemptuously. ??'Whatever it be.' said Nicholas, Hushed with anger, ' I shall not look to you to make it more.' '* ' Nicholas, my dear, recollect yourself,' remonstrated Mrs. Nickleby. ?** Dear Nicholas, pray,' urged the young lady. ""? Hold your tongue, Sir,' said Ralph. * I'poa my word! Kine beginnings, Mrs. Nickleby?tine beginning*-.' "" * '? * Well, ma'am,* said Ralph, impatiently, 'the creditors have administered, you tell me, iind there's nothing left for you ?' "" * Nothing,' replied Mrs. Nickleby. ** * And you spent what little money you bad, in coming all the way to London, to see what I could do for you?' pursued R-Uph. '*' I hoped,' faltered Mrs. Nickleby, 'that you might have an opportunity of doing something for your brother's children. It was his dying wish that I should appeal to you in their In-half.' "" ' I don't know how it is,' muttered Ralph, walking up and down thc room, ' but whenever a man dies without any property of his own, he always seems to think he luis a right to dispose of other people's. What is your daughter fit for, ma'am ?' *' Kate has been well educated,' sobbed 31rs. Nickleby. 'Tell your uncle, my dear, how far you went in french and extras.' "" The poor girl was about to murmur forth something, when her uncle stopped her very unceremoniously. "" "" We inu-t try and get you apprenticed at some boarding-school,' said Ralph. ? You have not been brought up too delicately fur that, I hope?' "" ' No. indeed, uncle,' replied the weeping girl. * I will try to do anything that will gain me a home and bread.' "" ' Well, well,' said Ralph, a little softened, either by bis niece's beauty or her distress (stretch a point, and say the latter). * You must try it, and if the life is too hard, perhaps drcs3-making or tambourwork will come lighter. Have you ever done anything, Sir?' (turning to his nephew.) "" * No,' replied Nicholas, bluntly. "" * y>n, I thought not 1' said Ralph. 'This is the way my brother brought up his children, ma'am.' '?' Nicholas bas not long completed such educacation as his poor father could give him,' rejoined Mrs. Nickleby,' and he was thinking of?' '?"" Of making something of him some day,' said Ralph. 'The old story; always thinking, and never doing, if my brother had been a niau of activity and prudence, he might have left you a rich woman, ma'am : and if he had turned bis son into the world, ;us my father turned mc, when I wasn't as old as that boy by a year and a half, he would have been in a situation to help you, instead of being a burden upon you, and increasing your distress. My brother was a thoughtless, inconsiderate man, Mrs. Nickleby, and nobody, I am sure, eau have better reason to feel that than you.' * * '?'Are you willing to work, Sir?' he inquired, frowning on his nephew. "" "" Ot'course I am,' replied Nicholas, haughtily. ""'Then see here. Sir,' said his uncle. 'This caught my eye this morning, and you may thank your stars for it.' "" With this exordium, Mr. ""Ralph Nickleby took a newspaper from his pocket, and after unfolding it, and looking for a short time among the advertisements, read as follows: "" ' Ian ivrion?At Mr. Wackford Squcers's Academy, Dotheboys Ibill, itt the delightful village of Dotheboys, near (ireta Bridge, in Yorkshire, Youth are boarded, clothed, booked, furnished with pocketmoney, provided with all necessaries, instructed in j all languages, living and dead, mathematics, ortbo! graphy, geometry, astronomy, trigonometry, the use j of the globes, algebra, single stick (if required), writing, arithmetic, fortitication, and every other branch , of classical literature.

But he is not a Master of Arts,' said Mrs. ' Nickleby. "" ' That,' replied Ralph,' that. I think, can be got over.' "" ' But the salary is so small, and it is such a long way oil"", uncle !* faltered Kate."" The scene nt thc Saracen's Head, on Snow Hill, is in the best Pickwick manner. Here is the schoolmaster from the picturesque neighbourhood of Greta Uridge :? "" Mr. Squcers's appearance was not prepossessing. He h;id but one eye, and the popular prejudice runs in favour of two. The eye he bad was unquestionably useful, but decidedly not ornamental, being of a greenish grey, and in shape resembling the fanlight of a street door. The blank side of his face was much wrinkled and puckered up, which gave him a very sinister appearance, especially when he smiled, at which times his expression bordered closely on the vitiations. His hair was very flat and shiny, save at the ends, where it was brushed stiffly up from a low protruding forehead, which assorted well with his harsh voice and coarse manner. He was about two or three iind titty, and a trifle below the middle size; he wore a white neckerchief with long eads,andasiiit of scholastic black, but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long, and his trousers a great deal too short, he appeared ill at ease in bis clothes, and as if he were iu a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable. '* Mr. Squccrs was standing in a box by one of the coffee-room fire-places, titted with one such table as is usually seen in i-otfee.rooms, and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition. In a corner of the seat was a very small deal trunk, tied round with a scanty piece of cord; and on the trunk was perched_bis lace-up half-boots and corduroy trousers dangling in the air?i diminutive boy, with his shoulders drawn up to his ears, and his hands planted on his knees who glanced timidly at the schoolmaster from time to time with evident dread and apprehension. '?* Halt past three,'muttered Mr. Si'iieers,turnb? from the window, and looking sulkily at the cottee"" room clock. 'There will be nobody hen; to-day."" "" Much vexed by this reflection, Mr. S'jiieers looked at the little boy to see whether be was dui in any thing be could beat bim tor: as he happeiudiiot to bo doing anything at all, he merely boxed hy, ears, and told him not to do it again. '?'At Midsummer,' muttered Mr. Saucers, re. suming his complaint, ? 1 took down ten hoys: tva twentys?two hundred pound.

What's come of all the boys? what's purer.:* got in their betula? what does it all mean:-' "" 1 Tere the little boy on the top of the trunk zi\? a violent sneeze. ?* * Halloa, Sir!"" growled th.e schoolmaster, turning round. * What's that, Sir .' '?'Nothing, please Sir,' replied the little boy. '? 'Nothing, Sir!' exclaimed Mr. Saucers '? * Please Sir, I sneezed,' rejoined the boy, tren. hiing till the little trunk shook under him. ""'Oh! sneezed, did you .' retorted Mr. Squeers. 'Then what did you say ""nothing"" for. Sir:' "" In default of a better answer to this (juevaon, the little boy screwed a couple of knuckles into each of his eyes and began to cry, wherefore Mr. Spicers knocked bini off tlie trunk with a blow on oin- sule of his face, and knocked him on again with u Mow on the other.

The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickltby. Bv Charles Dickens. Chapman and Hall. Great success is a thing as little understood in literature now-a-d.iys, as great failure. The tut issi-\ mus ibis is found in the old place. The sale of the Pickwick Papers was very generally held to be in the nature of a bookselling curiosity, and when a j career as prosperous was foretold for a new work of; the same extent by the same hand, wise people j shook their heads and said it was impossible. It has been proved possible, notwithstanding. The sale of Nicholas Nickleby is understood, even thus early, to have exceeded by many thousands that of l\\*' Pickwick Papers. Without entering on the question of how far such a circumstance should be taken as a test of genius or even of talent, it establishes tho claim of thc work to critical consideration on the highest grounds, and with reference to the best models. We propose in this spirit briefly to examine its pretensions to rank with thc enduring fictions of our language. Since Richardson published in successive portions his famous story of Clarissa Har lo we. ami enthusiastic damsels, eager for the conversion of Lovelace, besieged and implored the author, as for a living sinner whose future state depended on thc decision, to "" save his soul alive,"" no characters of an unfinished1 work of fiction have excited anything like the interest manifested by large classes of persons in all ranks f^r tbe fate of the various actors in the tale of Nicholas Nicklcby. The Cibbers of that day, after "" a delicious meal of Miss Byron '* in one volume, were not more anxious for "" another slice of herein the next, than the Cibbers of our own, after regaling themselves with a Squeers, or a Smike, or a Newman Noggs, or a Vincent Crummies in number six, have been for other slices of them in number seven. This shows us, at the outset, a great secret of the popularity of the author. He seizes the eager attention of his readers by the strong power of reality. Ile thoroughly individualises what he takes in hand. Our sympathies are never left to wander off, into quarters vague or undefined, from thc flesh and blood to which he allies them. And this also is the reason why we cannot associate anything that is vulgar or I >w with his treatment of subjects that in themselves are avowedly so. In everything of that kind that he presents to us, there is, in his manner of doing it, the manliness and simplicity of nature, or the truth of life as it is. We are never repelled by the abominations of egotism, conceit, or dogmatism. We are never disgusted by misplaced ridicule. If there is good going on, there is a vivid and hearty style to bring out all its beauty ; and if there is evil, it runs no chance of being mistaken for good. The quantity of invention, observation, and knowledge of character, observable in tl**, writings of Mr Dickens, is never more apparent than are his kindness of heart and capacity for generous emotion. Now by all the various readers of this tale of Nicholas Nichleby?and they separate themselves into classes most widely apart from each other?these various qualities can bc in an almost equal degree appreciated and felt. In this we advance further into thc causes of so remarkable a popularity. Thousands read the book because it places them in the midst of scenes and characters with which they are already themselves acquainted; and thousands read it with no less avidity because it introduces | them to passages of nature and life of which they before knew nothing, but of the truth of which their own habits and senses suffice to assure them. This is a test which only a man of genius could bear. It is only in the presence of a writer of genius that the affinities and sympathies of high and low, in regard to the customs and usages of life, are so revealed. For it is not more by the bonds of a common humanity, than by the alliances of common habits, that we are all linked together. The highest and the lowest in these respects roost nearly approximate to each other. Like effects must always more or less result from being either above or below a dependence on other people's opinions. These are elements in the wide success and popularity of this remarkable writer, that would probably first suggest themselves in a critical examination of the book before in. Incidentally they embrace many others. His style is for the most part admirable. Bating some faults of occasional exaggeration, which we may presently advert to, it is fresh and racy, and has the surpassing charms of simplicity, earnestness, animal spirit*, and good humour. A rare virtue in It is, that it is always, whether grave or gay, thoroughly intelligible, and for the most part thoroughly natural. Its sparkling stream of vivacity or humour glides down by the easiest transition into deeper cuireou of seriousness and pathos. It is a? quick, as warm, as comprehensive, as the sympathies it is taxed to express. We know of none that csu paint more powerfully by an apposite epithet, or iltostfate mot* happily by n s|ehofeesJassion.

Who that hus read his descriptions ofthe various localities of Loudon, as set down in this story of Nicholas NickUby. can ever expect to forget them more? A fresh glow of warmth and light plays over thc cheerful and familia"" places, a deeper mist of misery and blackness settles on thc darker scenes. With him, we pass along misty streets in some cold and (og^y morning, while but a few meagre shadows flit to and fro or now and then a heavy outline of coach or cab or cart looms through the dull vapour, yet were it oAy for the noises he strikes from time to time upon our ears, distantly and indistinctly as though the (o^ had muflicd them, we could not doubt that it was London. We enter with him by night, through long double rows of brightly burning lamps, a noisy, bust lim;, crowded scene, in which he shows us the rags of the squalid ballad-singer fluttering in thc same rich light that shows thc goldsmith's glittering treasures, and where one thin sheet of brittle glass is the iron wall by which vast profusions of wealth and food aro guarded from starved and pennyless men, add this is the same London as before. At all times, and under every aspect, bc gives us to feel and sec the great city as it absolutely is. Its interior life is made as familiar to us as its exterior forms. We come to know better the very places we have known best. Wc observe more smoking and bear more singing in Golden square; thc Saracen's Head on Snow hill relaxes into a grim cordiality; the Alphonse*) of Cadogan place reveal themselves plain Bills to our practised eye ; and the sight of even a real butterfly, fluttering among thc iron heads of dusty area railings in some retired and noiseless City square, startles us no more. And with all these masterly requisites for his art, is Mr Dickens a perfect novelist? By no means. He has yet to acquire the faculty of constructing a compact and effective story, without which that rank can never be attained. He has yet to subdue his tendencies of exaggeration, to which, though wc observe it infinitely less in this work than in the Pickwick Papers, he is still too prone. In saying this we only carry out the spirit of the praise we have just offered him. It is a due compliment to such a writer to assume, that he is not one of those frail folks who must bc bolstered up good and bad together. The great master in our language of thc art of constructing a plot, we need hardly observe, is Fielding. For exquisitest contrivance, for happiest extrication of story, he stands quite unrivalled. In this respect Tom Jones is an universally acknowledged masterpiece. Not an incident occurs in it from the first page to the last, which docs not more or less tell upon the story, while it illustrates at thc same time the character of thc .'gents by which its results ure to be worked out. Thus Black George is scarcely a less essential personage than Tom Jones himself, and a long list of intermediate persons iu like manner combine, each in his own peculiar sphere, to one grand effect. Its only episode, the only circumstance that is ever suffered to divert our attention from thc business going on, is that of thc Old Man of thc Hill, introduced in mere conventional imitation of the absurd custom of Cervantes and Le Sage. Passing this there is not an eddy, a current, scarcely a single ripple, on its full and flowing stream of purest incident and art. Nicholas Nie** kleby could not stand such a test for an instant. A want of plan is apparent in it from the first, an absence of design. The plot seems to have grown as the book appeared by numbers, instead of having been mapped out beforehand. The attention is ever and anon diverted from the story by digressions, introduced for the apparent uses of mere contrast and effect, while abrupt and startling recurrences are thus of course rendered necessary to recal us to the main interest and action. Admirable and very plausible reasons might no doubt be urged for all this, yet should none be admitted that contravene the sounder claims and more enduring requisites of high and perfect Art. The consequence of it is in this case, that many characters are altogether dropped as the necessities ofthe story force theimelves on tho writer, and that the grander effect of some of his most masterly and powerful writing in the latter chapters is marred by the introduction of matters, needful indeed to a gathering up of the loone or broken threads of an imperfect story, but sounding more like the minute recitals of a lawyer's deed than the natural development of a book of so much originality and ginini, Of the occasional sins against verisimititode on the side of exngteration, nriatng ont of ono lided views of a certain sort of life*, or the btw e# periog ? toondie joke to excess, tm wowW sven thrn-ns sis tbe Mtttln aad ?Deena*** ia the entry pm of the te* of Messrs Pyke and Pluck* i of the tcenes wkh Kr Mefrswy Verisopht. We have now and then as the work proceeded, directed attention to things of this kind. We are not certain even that the more amiable characters of the book are always so amiable as we are desired to suppose them, and we must confess an insuperable aversion to the heroics of Nicholas Nickleby himself, when, as it happens sometimes, they obscure even his strong and gentle mind. We take him to cut a poor figure, for example, in that quarrel with our dear Mr Lenville (how ultra-exquisite, saving only that, are all the scenes with the strollers 1), and when he stalks out nf the green room, "" bowing slightly"" to the assembled company, we long to have been there, notwithstanding our seldom-varying strong affection for him, to have joined the hearty laugh at his exit. We can scarcely reproach ourselves for this. We are not sure that even Mr Dickens himself is indisposed to quiz now and then these little foibles of his favourite hero. It is, we remember, after a certain sort of hasty demonstration of them that one of the ""helpers"" at thc Saracen's head is heard to exclaim, "" Hallo! this is somebody in disguise, this is!"" and another follows up tbe joke with ** Room for the eldest son of the Emperor of Roosher, iien'limn."" But when we follow tbe son of the imperial potentate into bis little dark and deserted room, when we see him in his tender devotion to poor Smike (an always touching and most beautiful feature in the story; w rought, too, with consummate art), when we are with him in his lonely thoughts of sister and home, all other vagaries are forgotten, and nothing is visU-ie to the moistening eye save the simplicity and sweetness of his nature. We have only to make one exception more. We referred to it when} we spoke of some exaggerations in mere style. Mr Dickens occasionally overlays his thoughts with needless epithets, and is over profuse in his use of adjectives. It is only in his reflections we find this?and that rarely?in his descriptions never. And now, having hastily glanced at objectionable points in the conduct or treatment of this famous story, what a host of beauties crowd on our grateful recollection, for which we have not opportunity or space to give even a passing glance to. With what pleasant thoughts it has stocked our memory, with what true and tender sentiments enriched our hearts, with what a healthy and manly moral instructed our minds. With bow much vivid distinctness each character takes its place before us, how plainly we pee the individualities of each, the form of their faces, the accident of iheir habits, the nicer peculiarity of their minds. These are triumphs which on I j belortg to a first-rate writer. The creative powers of the novelist, when properly directed and well sustained, take rank with history itself. The M*chylus of Parson Adams is not less real than the spectacles of Burke, the trumpet of Sir Joshua, or the snuffbox of Gibbon. In reserve for Mr Dickens are still greater triumphs if he has patience and perseverance to prepare hiimelf by study and self-restraint, hy the pursuit of art and the pruning of common-place exuberance, for their full and satisfactory achievement. We hope that he will not fail in this. Great is the glory, though the strife be bard, and heartily do we wish him strength to surmount the one and long life to enjoy the other. We see in him, at no distant day, if he does entire justice to hi* powers, the not unworthy successor of our Goldsmiths and Fieldings."

(Macmillan & Co.) Marion Crawford's posthumous novel deals with an exciting episode in the life of Stradella, the Italian seventeenthcentury composer and musician, namely, his elopement with Ortensia, niece and affianced bride of an elderly Venetian Senator. The story, if not on the high dramatic level of some of Mr. Crawford's earlier work, is yet extremely romantic, and suggests no decline of vitality in his imaginative faculty. The characters are all individual; the two bravi, hired by the irate Senator to pursue the young couple, are a grotesque pair, but both distinct creations ; and the manner in which their cupidity entangles them in a mesh of conflicting schemes, while their victims happily escape, is, if not strictly historical, sufficiently entertaining. Life in Rome and Venice at this period is cleverly suggested without too much detail; and the figures of Clement X., Cardinal Altieri, and Queen Christina of Sweden are effectively introduced into the picture."
126,B4134,['6643455'],"Little Journeys to the Homes of Good Men and Great. By Elbert Hubbard. (G. P. f utnam's Sons.) It must be confessed that Mr. Elbert Hubbard has selected a most unfortunate title for his book. It has about it a distinct flavour of the Young Men's Christian Society, and conveys to the literary reader an entirely false impression of the nature of its contents. As a matter of fact, these twelve essays are particularly free from faults of the kind their ill-chosen title suggests. Jejune they are not; neither are they amateurish. Indeed, it is not to praise them too highly to say that they are free from conspicuous faults of any kind. We receive another check in attacking the book almost immediately we open it. It was a mistake to couple George Eliot's name with Shakspere's, treating the two as equals. It was a mistake, too, to assume that George Eliot occupies the place among women conceded by all the world to Shakspere as a man. It is true that when we challenge ourselves to instance her superiors we feel somewhat confused; but this only emphasises the fact that at present, at all events, it is ridiculous to assume that in the aggregate there is anything like equality between men and women writers. However, we may let that pass. It is a small fault, and it is almost ungenerous to mention it. As we dip deeper into Mr. Hubbard's pages, the simplicity and grace of his narrative compel confidence. He has the true instinct of compression and the skill to seize essentials. He paints pictures for us with the directness of a Degas, but he infuses into them the idealism of a Millet. He tells the story of Mary Ann Evans's association with George Lewes with sympathetic insight and completeness, nothing extenuating and setting naught down in malice. His description of hie stay at Warwick, of tho inn there, and of his walk over to Nuneaton is written with cameolike distinction- The present writer has made the same pilgrimage, and in doing so he has communed in spirit with the essayist. The writer next takes us into the company of Thomas Carlyle and his wife. Herein he shows that ho possesses the gift of sympathy and iosight into the complexity of human character. I have never read a more understanding story of the relations between these two. "" Jeannie Welsh Carlyle,"" writes Mr. Hubbard, "" bad oapacity for pain, as r seems all great souls have. She Buffered?but then suffering is not all suffering, and pain is not all pain."" And again: "" His [Carlyle's] was a masculine mind. Tbe discrimination and subtle intuitions which are k found to be scattered through his pages like t violets growing among the rank swale of the prairies; all these sweet odorous things came from his wife. She gave him her best thoughts and he greedily absorbed and unconsciously wrote it down as his own."" The excellent taste of Mr. Hubbard's brief biography makes it of more value than many ponderous tomes written about Carlyle. The picture of John Ruskin, too, if as vivid as it is characteristic. Incidentally it must be remarked that in this essay Mr. Hubbard is betrayed into indulging in some cheap and inconclusive remarks on the nature of genius, and on the position of the woman married to a man of genius. His premises are wrong and bis deductions are false, and the several examples upon which he bases his contentions are absolutely without point. Mr. Gladstone's picture has been so often drawn that Mr. Hubbard could not be expected to make his version of that many-sided man stand out. He gives us, however, an excellent sketch of Chester and of a wellknown hostelry there. But Mr. Hubbard is at fault in speaking of Lord Brougham as a Scotchman. He prefaces his eulogium of Turner wiih that sentence of Ruskin's which is more remarkable for the generous wholeheartedness of its praise than for its critical accuracy. To speak of any work of Turner's as incapable of any improvement conceivable by the human mind is simply to descend into rhapsody. However, the responsibility for this extravagance may be borne by Mr. Ruskin. The tale of Turner's early struggles is told with sympathy and knowledge. For a long time his pictures were not popular. '' First the public,"" says Mr. Hubbard,'' scorned Turner. Next Turner scorned the public. In the beginning it would not buy his pictures, and later it could not. . . . For merit there is a recompense in sneers, and a benefit in sarcasms, and a compensation in hate."" This essay on Turner is among the most illumined of the series. "" If Swift,"" says Mr. Hubbard,"" had possessed only his mother's merits without his father's faults, he would never have shaken the world with laughter, and we should never have heard of him."" In other words, no man is supremely great unless he has a dash of the devil in him. And Swift is certainly a striking example of this truth. "" His misanthropy,"" as the writer remarks, "" defeated his purpose, thwarted his ambition, ruined his aims, and?made his name illustrious."" For think what a small meed of fame would have been his had he achieved the summit of his desires, and been enthroned as Primate of England! The profession of letters was hateful to him; he despised it. Social precedence was his aim, even more than political power. The last was, in his eyes, a passport to the first. But Swift had not the patience to wait; his stomach was too high to permit him to crawl into the office he coveted. 4' To succeed in winning a bishopric requires a sagacity as keen as that needed to become a governor of New York. The man bides his time, makes himself popular, secures advocates, lubricates the way, pulls the wires, and slides noiselessly into place."" As a Churchman, Swift was an Erastian of the purest type. He was, as Mr. Hubbard says, "" as incapable of 'spirituality as he was of the grand passion."" Not an amiable man assuredly: a man to respect, perhaps, but not to love. Frond, severe, cruel, calculating?there were no bounds to his ambition. The philosophy which comes with years did not serve to allay the smart of his bruised and wounded spirit. He was of the earth earthy: a materialist and, so far as essentials go, a sceptic. His undying literary creations wera evolved to give vent to his spleen. That Swift wai congenitally mad his recent biographers see fit to deny; but to the present writer the denial seems to be based on grounds which only pedantry can accept. His overweening vanity was the outcome of incipient madnees, of which, indeed, it was a symptom. Mr. Hubbard tells a characteristic story of Victor Hugo. What he had once written | down, Beelzebub and all his hosts could not make him change. At a rehearsal of "" Hernani"" Mlle. Man expressed a dislike to rn certain word, and asked the author to change it "" I wrote it and it must stand,"" was his answer. But Mlle. Mars persisted in using another expression instead of the author's, whereupon Hugo asked her to resign her part The lady wept, promised to adhere to the text, and was reinstated. Fifty-three times thereafter she played the part, and she did not once speak what the author had written. "" The moral of this is, that even a strong man cannot cope with a small woman who weeps at the right time."" The next two essays, those on Wordsworth and Thackeray, are less effective. Thousands of pens have written about Dickens, but bis works and his haunts have rarely been treated more luminously than by the writer under consideration. It would be difficult to commend too highly his lightness of touch or the philosophic tolerance with which he deals with his subject. And in estimating Dickens's place among the novelists of all time, Mr. Hubbard is as critical as he is just. "" The novelist,"" says he, "" must have lived and the novelist must have imagination. But this is not enough. He must have power to analyse and separate, and then he should have the good taste to select and group, forming his parts into a harmonious whole."" It must be admitted that Mr. Hubbard's defence of Dickens against his severest critics is scarcely convincing. He tacitly admits that many of his characters are^not really alive, but only seem to be. "" By rummaging,"" he says, "" over the commercial world, you can collect the harshness, greed, avarice, selfishness, and vanity from a thousand men. With these sins you can, if you are very skilful, construot a Ralph Nicklcby, a Scrooge, a Jonas Chuzzlewit, an Alderman Cute, a Mr. Murdstone, a Bounderby, or Gradgrind at will. A little more pride, a trifle less hypocrisy, a molecule extra of untruth, and flavour with this fault or that, and your man is ready to place up against the fence to dry."" Mr. Hubbard discourses on Dickens admirably and entertainingly, and he says some acute things on his own account. He thus sums up his qualities and limitations: 44 He has a watch that starts in a way of its own, never mind the sun. He lets you see the wheels go round, but he never tells you why the wheels go round. He knows little of psychology?that curious, unseen thing that stands behind every act. He knows not the highest love, therefore he never depiots the highest joy. Nowhere does he show the gradual awakening in man of God-like passion; nowhere does he show the evolution of a soul; very, very seldom does he touch the sublime. But he has given the Athenians a day of pleasure, and for this let us all devoutly give thanks."" After Dickens, Goldsmith. About that wayward son of genius Mr. Hubbard writes entrancingly. He takes us through the land of his birth in a coach and four?the good steeds of fancy, sympathy, charity, and Ehilosophy. And when he leaves Goldsmith e takes up his parable again with Shakspere. Then he makes his bow, and we are sincerely sorry. Jas. Stanley Little."
127,B7450,['6711828'],"The Aran Inlands. By J. M. Synge. (Dublin: Maunsel, 5s. net.) The Aran Islands, it is probably necessary to remind the ignorant Saxon, are three small islands lying off the west coast of Ireland, about thirty miles from Galway. The largest is about nine miles long, and the inhabitants, who are for the most part still strangely primitive, gain their living by burning kelp, fishing, and tilling their scant fields, though the soil is so poor that a field hardly produces more grain than is needed for seed in the following year, and the straw is all the profit. Of his four visits to these islands, Mr. Synge, the author of The Playboy of the Western World, the play that caused so much disturbance at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, has written an attractive book, which, while relating his experiences simply and without literary artifice, is rendered charming by tne author's sympathy with the kindly men and women of whom he writes. ' Mr. Synge has a fine eye for colour, and he has painted a truthful though sombre picture of the islands, with their grey clouds, and grey seas, and slaty limestone rocks, the men dressed in indigo and grey, and the women in red petticoats with grey shawls twisted round their heads. There is little division of labour on these barren rocks ; every man is a good sailor, an expert fisherman, sufficiently wise in agriculture to till his poor fields, clever enough with his hands to make a cradle or a coffin. They dwell in thatched cottages, whose chief room, the kitchen, has an earth floor and open rafters and two doors facing each other, one open and one shut according to the wind. In this room the men sit on the wet foggy days that are so frequent on these desolate islands, drinking, perhaps, the grey poteen in a haze of turf smoke, and listening to the wonderful tales of the old men or talking endlessly of tides and fish and the price of kelp in Connemara. But in all the speech of this simple folk there sounds a note of despondency, a sadness of things passing. For their growing sons leave the islands nowadays for America or the mainland, unwilling that like their fathers before them they should spend their days in snatching a poor livelihood from the winds and the sea. Even here the Gaelic seems to be dying out, and the younger men are no longer ready to believe in the fairies, whose strange hatred of the human race colours so many of the stories that Mr. Synge has collected from the old men of the islands. Progress, which may not spare either beauty or simplicity, is reaching these primitive men and women at last, and we therefore owe a double debt to Mr. Synge for having written this book before it was too late, and for having written it so well. Mr, J. B. Yeats contributes some clever illustrations."
128,B3468,['6815004'],"Father and Son; a Study of Two Temperaments. (Heinemann.) This anonymous book is one of the most fascinating and interesting pieces of literature that has been issued of recent years. Were we not, in the preface to it, specifically informed that the narrative '' in all its parts . . . . is scrupulously true,"" we should have judged it to be fiction by a skilled hand, founded upon fact and personal experience, but either way, as unadulterated fact or unadulterated fiction, it is, as the author offers it to us, a document of the highest value, though, strangely enough, not so for the reason advanced by the writer, who claims that it is a "" record of educational and religious conditions which, having passed away, will never return,"" "" a diagnosis of a dying Puritanism."" This stifling, joyless creed is neither dead nor dying; it is to-day a power in the land. Indeed, a prominent Puritan not long since urged upon us that it was the backbone of the nation, and was not a little annoyed when we retorted that, if so, "" the nation was suffering from spinal disease."" The Puritans we have always with us, and their creed, admirably summed up in the following quotation, is the same now as it was in the beginning: It divides heart from heart. It sets up a vain, chimerical idea, in the barren pursuit of which all the tender, indulgent affection, all the genial play of life, all the exquisite pleasures and soft resignations of the body, all that enlarges and calms the soul, are exchanged for what is harsh and void and negative. It encourages a stern and ignorant spirit of condemnation; it throws altogether out of gear the healthy movements of the conscience; it invents virtues which are sterile and cruel; it invents sins which are no sins at all, but which darken the heaven of innocent joy with futile clouds of remorse. There is something horrible, if we will bring ourselves to face it, in the fanaticism that can do nothing with this pathetic and fugitive existence of ours, but treat it as if it were the uncomfortable ante-chamber to a palace which no one has explored and of the plan of which we know absolutely nothing. The book is the story of the struggle between two temperaments, the father's and the son's. The father is a Plymouth brother of the sternest, strictest, blindest type; the mother, who dies while the son is yet a child, is equally fanatical. For example, to her every work of fiction is simply a lie. The father is a zoologist of high standing and considerable fame, not a little troubled for a time by the contradiction of Genesis by science. The mother bequeaths the son to her husband as one of the Lord's anointed, and as destined to devote his life to the propagation of extreme Puritanism; the remainder of the book is devoted to the mental autobiography of the son's boyhood and youth. All the characters are drawn with extreme skill, and the picture of the small group of Brethren in a little Devonshire village is pitiable in its accurate dissection of narrow bigotry and self-sufficient blindness. Is not this, a perfect touch, this point concerning the father and his praying aloud over the son ? I cannot help thinking that he liked to hear himself speak to God in the presence of an admiring listener. These folk love to be familiar with the Deity, without the slightest intention or sense of irreverence. There are revival scenes, too, painted soberly and with unfailing accuracy, but we cannot follow our author when he sets forth that he is depicting a dead past. Fanaticism and Puritanism vary in externals from age to age, but in essentials remain the same. We have neither space nor would it be profitable to attempt a detailed analysis of the book; it must be read to be understood and appreciated?but we will give one more quotation, a passage which seems to us to sum, briefly and ably, a great subject: It will, I suppose, be admitted that there is no greater proof of complete religious sincerity than fervour in private prayer. If an individual, alone by the side of his bed, prolongs his intercessions, lingers wrestling with his Divine Companion, and will not leave off until he has what he believes to be evidence of a reply to his entreaties?then, no matter what the character of his public protestations, or what the frailty of his actions, it is absolutely certain that he believes in what he professes. Various famous men flit across the pages?Kingsley, Huxley, Robert Louis Stevenson, Sheridan Knowles?historic events play their part, and had we the inclination, the writer's claim to be a narrator of fact could easily be checked; but, as we have said, it boots not whether the story is fact or fiction?it is true to life. The author, also, challenges the reader to "" recognise him as an old acquaintance, occasionally met with in quite other fields."" The secret has not been kept for long, and we understand that Mr. Edmund Gosse does not deny that he is the writer of the book. It is a great book, but for our part we scarcely like this close anatomisation by a son of a father."

The many works which he has presented for the perusal of the novel-reading worI(l have all been decided hits, and have wvon for him the reputation of being our best seanovelist. The good qualities of his books up to the appearance of the present volumes have been progressive,-an(d consequently from the author of Peter Simple very much was expected ; nor indeed, whatever blemishes the candi(d reviewer must point out, has the hope been dlisappointed. The tale is neither so full of incident, nor are the characters drawn with that force-nor indeed is the whole so well finished as Peter Simple ; but waith the exception of our favourite, we have great pleasure in stating our conscientious opinion that Mr. Midshipman Elasy is the best of the author's novels. Captain Marvatt is not like mano of his tribe of litterateurs, who write merely to amuse without a moral object. Each of his books has a distinct end in viCe ; and in each he has considered a novel as a channel through which wholesome advice may be conveyed in a palatable form; and there is reason to believe that his writings have not only amused the public but have also (lone no small good to the navy. Whether or not "" out and out radical"" notions are ,gaining ground in the service we pretend not to know: if the al)olbinlations of radicalism are tainting the middies, all well and good ; the e quality mania must be written down: but, if not, why the gallant author has raised( up a manl ot straw in order to knock him down. But to tell the truth we suspect him of aiming his shafts at civil as well as naval politics. Oh fie! Captain Marryat.-'T'his is too bad ! But to the story. The hero, Jack lEasv, is the son of a wealthy country gentleman imbued with the revolutionary notions of equality which prevailed in England at the close of the last century, which of course he is made bv the author to express in so absurd and unlimited a manner as to make the reader laugh at Mr. Easy's expense. Jack, as tiresome and obstinate a little brat as ever sucked of a wet nurse, imbibes from his father at a very early period all his peculiar notions of equality; and it requires all the hard discipline detailed in these three volumes to knock them out of his noddle. His first acquaintance with schooldiscipline would, it is reasonably supposed, have opened the youngster's eves: but no, not even his acquaintance with the watch-dog, the bull, and the beehive while robbing an orchard, to the fruit of which"" in arguing the point"" he claims an equal right with the owner, nor his ducking in the fish-pond when caught poaching on a neighbour's property, are sufficient to convince Master Jack of the untenableness of his position. The theory of equality not being satisfactorily proved on land as far as his experience goes, he determines to try its truth at sea; and he accordingly asserts to his father, his right on the principle of equality of determining his own profession. The "" point"" is argued, and Jack prevails. By influence with a captain, fortunately for Jack, under pecuniary obligations to Mr. Eiasy, he is appointed midshipman on board the Harpy, and in due time he makes his way to Portsmouth. After enjoying his notions of equality by spending his money like a lord for three weeks, and after insulting the first lieutenant of his own ship (one of the best scenes in the book), he goes on board, and while in the service meets with a variety of adventures, particularly in the Mediterranean, on board, in engagements, and on shore, all of which tend to prove the invalidity of his favourite 'point.' Jack on the whole is a lucky fellow with his vltra notions to escape mast-heading or the bilbos. He gets married in the end to Donna Agnes, a Spanish lady, whom he had once released from a prize ship, and afterwards fallen in love with at Palermo. Mr. Easy senior becomes stark-mad with the equality mania and dies. Jack succeeds to eight thousand a vear, leaves the navy, and becomes a country gentleman and a Conservative. There are some admirably humorous scenes in these volumes, which might be extracted, if our space allowed and we did not wish to forestall the reader's lleasure. Jack's learning his alphabet withhis nother and afterwards with the schoolmaster, the first interview between him and the lieutenant, Bigg's ad. venture at Gibraltar illustrative of "" duty before decency,"" and the duel scene at Malta, are perhaps the best; but there are many others, at which we have laughed incontinently. The best drawn characters are Mesty, quite a bijou in his way, although a black diamond, Easthupp the purser's steward, ci devant pick-pocket, Talbovs the mathematical gunner, and Gascoigne the firm friend and ally of Easy :-the foreigners are we think rather a failure. After pointing out so much that is excellent in Mr. Midshipman Easy, we mnay safely take up the pen to make some strictures on the book. We do not go the length of saying, with one of our great men, that he who would make a pun would pick a pocket; but we detest puns, except after dinner when a few glasses of wine have made us very amiable and easy to please. Written puns are absolutely intolerable :-need it be said, that such wretched traps for horse-laughers are quite unworthy of the acknowledged talents of Captain Marryat i But a much graver charge is that of representing the Roman religion and its priesthood in an odious light. Such bigotry is now quite pase', and can only serve to disgust the intelligent reader and injure the Captain's credit. The most rabid Orangemen could not paint more revolting scenes than are here given of the foul conduct of the Romish priesthood. The author may have his own opinions on these matters, and we will not 'argue the point;' but we question the good taste of dragging them before the public in a work of fiction. Those of our readers who enjoy hearty merriment, must read these volumes.Mr. Midshipman Easy. LITERATURE. NOTICES OF NEW WORKS. By the Author of "" Peter Simple,"" "" Ja- cob Faithful,"" &c. 3 Vols. This is a beautiful personification of a principle, a working out of character that is fiction only in the events in which it is shown, as in a multiplicity of mirrors, hut perfectly true and real in its moral identity. Had Mr. Midshipman Easy existed, he must, per force, have acted precisely as Captain Marryat has made him act; and, that he has actually been met with a thousand times in the naval service, all who know that noble service will testify, though the Midshipmen Kanya who have appeared on his Majesty's books have not been placed exactly in the same situation as this Mr. Midshipman Easy (par excellence) occupies in Captain Marryat's. We have given, in a long extract, in our preceding number, a specimen of what this exciting novel is. It was the opening of the tale, and with the sliest humour, and in the blandest style, covereel the most hiting satire. Of this, almost every sentence was pregnant with covert wit, of which not one, two, but three or four perusals were necessary to understand the full force. The paternal Mr. Kasy having allowed his good-nature to run to seed, which seed proves to be the dry fruit of democratical mania, carried out even to the Agrarian law anel a community of goods, becomes, as such a person infallibly must, a madman abroad, and a tyrant at home. Though he finds his beloved theory of equality plants thorns on his pillow, (the expression is pretty, though a little used,) and something sharper than thorns elsewhere, and everywhere else, he still follows it out, as all other democrats do, until it interferes with his own convenience; and, at length, notwithstanding the Junior Easy's assertions to the contrary, the old gentleman finds it just and expedient to send his son to school. This part of the story, which is not at all maritime, but strictly natural and highly amusing, will be found philosophical also. Now, the embryo Mr. Midshipman Easv inherits, from his worthy father, a most unconquerable predilection in all cases to argue the case, whatever may be the tense in which he finds the circumstances or the mood in which he finds his opponent. This leads the young philosopher into the most ludicrous situations, out of which he always extricates himself with glory, owing to the sound principle, upon which he always acts, of taking things easily. Should he be on the? horns of a bull, or of a dilemma, no fear for Master Easy, he will contrive to ?lip himself ofF softly from the one, without a broken bone, and to extricate himself honourably from the other, by making an easy cushion between them, from which to combat his adversary. But, as neither father nor son can make many proselytes to their doctrine of equality when united, like the Roman conquerors of old, they resolve to divide the world between them, old Easy undertaking to regenerate all that live on thc earth, vonni; Kasy all tho.se who reside on the waters. With a shamefully ample allowance, the latter goes to sea as a midshipman. Then conic thc laughable collisions between absolute authority and unqualified licence. Thc reader may suppose that, at first, in endeavouring to take all things easy, he of that name finds it goes hard with him. No such tliin.tr. He is imperturbable. Command him, he argues the case, and produces his minor?reprove him, he argues the case still, and produces his major?well, he is still unconquered ; then to wind up the debate, his superior officer proceeds to punish him?but he is not beaten ; he begins logically to draw his conclusions from his premises, and ultimately proves himself to be in the right, by taking his punishment easily. But the witty author contrives that a subject so apparently intractable shall, with all his whimsies, do himself great honour, and his country some service. By Mr. Easy's maimer of thinking and acting, he manages to rectify errors of much better and more experienced officers, and to perform achievements that would well entitle him to the epithet of more than the hero of an excellently written novel. But his many droll and highly interesting adventures, gradually work out an alteration in his levelling principles, by teaching him that, in this ever shifting world, everything will ultimately find its own level, worth and activity rising, vice, profligacy, and stupidity, sinking to the depths of their natural degradation, lu fact, Mr. Easy, though always liberal, becomes very gentlemanly, and a good Tory, leaves all notions of equality to the indulgence of those who have got nothing, and determines hereafter to preserve his station in society, and his very excellent estate of eight thousand pounds a year with it. Lucky was it for our midshipman that it was entailed ; for Mr. Easy, senior, not having been to sea to gain wisdom, goes on from bad to worse, from the whimsical to the extravagant, and from the extravagant to thc insane. All this part of the tale is a melancholy, but a true picture of our fallible natures. The love affair of our hero is merely an amplification of Madame de Stael's aphorism, that the tender passion is but an episode in the lite of man; but Captain Marryat has contrived to make his midshipman's episode a very exquisite one. The naval scenes, as usual with this author, are glorious. The storm, the fight, the imminent danger, are all portrayed in these volumes with the hand of a master. The delineation of the various characters that act with Mr. Easy, are also first rate. What a troop of creations has this writer called forth! We will not use the cant of criticism, and say, as that cant too frequently does, this is the last and best of his works. It is not better than "" Peter Simple,"" nor better written than "" Jacob Faithful,"" or a more true picture of life, as life really is, than "" Japhet, in Search of a Father."" Each of these works has an excellence peculiar to itself, which excellence could not, by any possibility, belong to the other. ""Midshipman Easy"" is inferior to none of Captain Marryat's preceding works ; we think that the world will prefer it to any of them ; but tliis preference ought not, and will not, throw his other productions into shade. We shall conclude our remarks by saying, that our author has given a perfect literature to the marine of our country? not merely originated one to be improved by others?and the world acknowledges that the fairest and the brightest fields of fiction are now to be found on the measureless waste of thc seas, over which we hope that England may be for ever triumphant."

With a Preface by Bernard Shaw. (A. C. Fifield, 6s.) When, a few years since, a modest volume of poems entitled "" The Soul's Destroyer"" appeared, the lover of poetry who was fortunate enough to read it was justified in thinking that a new planet had swum within his ken. The book was received with a chorus of discriminating praise, and speculation became rife as to the strange and fascinating personality that lurked behind the name of William H. Davies. We learned just enough to whet our curiosity. We learned, for instance, that the new poet was a one-legged man, who lived in a common lodging-house somewhere in Southwark, that he enjoyed the munificent pension of 8s. a week, and that (most wonderful of all!) he had contrived to publish his verses at his own expense. This sounded promising ; but, like Oliver Twist, we wanted more. At length Mr. Davies has taken pity on our ignorance. He has told us the plain and unvarnished story of his life. And a marvellous record it is ! In these days incident, having deserted the region of fiction, is forced to fly to autobiography as to a welcome sanctuary. Certainly "" The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp ""?we like not the title, by the way, it is too slavishly Shavian !?contains enough adventure to fit out a dozen romances by (say) Mr. Rolf Boldrewood. Its author has tramped it up hill and down dale ; he is equally at home on the highroads of America or in the slums of our English cities. He has known the agonies of starvation, and, by dint of considerable practice, has acquired the difficult art of begging. His companions have been thieves, vagrants, and mendicants. Not since Borrow (it seems safe to say) have we had a presentment so vivid, forceful, and intimate of the inner lives of these delightful people. And the strange thing about it all is that Mr. Davies himself appears to be a man with essentially domestic instincts, a lover of the fireside and the companionship of men and books. He has gone through the world weaving his wonderful experiences into song, and with an eye always on the end of wandering?the happy haven that awaits the tired voyager. It is difficult?indeed, it is almost impossible?to quote from this volume, so full is every chapter of strange and exciting matter. But one incident in this Odyssey of a vagabond must not go unrecorded. The scene is America. Mr. Davies and a companion tramp had been found guilty of the crime of trespassing on a railroad. They were each fined five dollars by the Judge. Hot with indignation, Davies refused to disgorge a cent. The remainder must be told in his own words : Judge Stevens looked at us steadily for a time, and then asked this astounding question?"" Boys, how much are you prepared to pay?"" Brum, who had very little sense of justice, and being such a good beggar, set very little value on money, asked the Judge if he would accept three dollars from each of us. If I had been alone at this time I would have paid nothing, but to save Brum from going to prison, who I knew would support me through all, I satisfied myself that, if the Judge approved of this amount, I would pay it without further comment. The Judge appeared to weigh the matter seriously, and then cried, with a magnanimity that was irresistible, "" Pass over the dollars, boys ; you shall have a chance this time."" As a record of a life lived in defiance of all the conventional rules of our modern civilisation this volume is of priceless value. Its freshness of outlook and spontaneity of expression, together with its entire freedom from cant, make it in every sense of the term a truly remarkable production. Mr. Shaw contributes a characteristic Preface."

The style of the telling is simplicity itself; but those who have a true touch for a fine and exquisite style will be quick to recognise that the clearness and liquid flow of this Englishing must interpret faithfully the beautiful -style of the French. To read this story is not to see through a glass darkly, but to see through a glass lightly, through the clearness of crystal or the clearness of water. Lady Glenconnor has doubtless followed the original in abstaining from any kind of ornamentation. The story is told, as by a contemporary, in a limpid and lucent English. The book is worthy of its subject. A child will understand every word of it, which is as good a test as any other for the grown-up reader when a noble and simple story has to be told."

Regarded as craftsman, as rascal (in spite of his English interpreter), as cold-blooded reporter of his adventures in art and in villainy, Cellini is unsurpassed. Only pure unblushing egotism moved him, and he threw a flood of light on a profoundly interesting country and epoch, and on the attitude of mind of a masterful man and an exquisite artist. Possessing Mr. Symonds' translation of the long famous book, we may neglect the original. His introduction and the notes are both helpful.

As a delineator, Dr. Brown has much pathetic force, and under the guidance of his heart tells a sad story with admirable effect. His great failing is want of humour,? though, like so very many other Scotchmen labouring under the same deficiency, his chief ambition J is to be esteemed a humorist. As a philosophical critic, the doctor is altogether beyond us. The following sentence we have read over six times with increasing perplexity:?""And though in all works of Art there should be a plus of delectation, the ultimate overcoming of evil and sorrow by good and joy,?the end of all Art being pleasure,? whatsoever things are lovely first, and tilings that are trite and of good report afterwards in their turn,? still there is a pleasure, one of the strangest and strongest in our nature, in imaginative suffering with and for others,? In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering; for sympathy is worth nothing, is indeed not itself, unless it has in it somewhat of personal j pain."" Does Dr. Brown mean that in works : of Art evil and sorrow should be overcome . through thc agency of "" whatsoever things are lovely first, and things that are true and of good report afterwards in their turn""? If such be his meaning, he ought at least to have helped his j rambling involutions, in their task of stating a simple matter in an obscure manner, with an insertion of ""by"" before "" whatsoever."" The story itself has no ordinary merits. The Introduction, in which the author attempts at the same time to be funny and profound, is so awkward and in such bad taste that it will prevent many from reading on. As he approaches the heart of his tale, however, the narrator becomes simple, nervous and powerful. When the honest, time-worn village carrier takes his dead wife in his arms, wraps her in the same white blankets she made long years before for her bridal bed, bears her from the hospital (in which she has expired), puts her in his cart, and drives home over the cold, bleak, desolate moor,?the heart of the reader goes forth after the wretched man, and prays God to take him to his keeping. The saddest tale of human suffering, where the suffering is distinct for human sin, has in it an unspeakable sweetness; and Dr. Brown, who in depicting such sorrow can stir the depths of feeling with the power of a master artist, does a wrong to society when he exercises his ingenuity and pains his readers with attempting to be a humorist."

It is impossible to regard this book otherwise than with feelings of respect, and that not merely on its author's account, but because it is exactly what it professes to be. The twenty years with which the Journal has to do was indeed an eventful period. It was marked by such important incidents as thc Franco-German and Russo-Turkish ""Wars, not to mention the many minor campaigns in which our own armies were engaged, and the grave political complications which from time to time presented themselves. But with these matters the Journal is altogether unconcerned. It deals solely with the Queen's life in the Highlands; and, though it is quite natural that her Majesty's subjects should wish to know what were the Queen's thoughts and feelings about things and people outside the narrow limits thus laid down, we certainly cannot find fault with the almost absolute reticence which is preserved throughout the volume upon all questions of national importance. Such silence seems to us to bc as discreet as it is rare; and, as there is nothing in the title of the book which is calculated to mislead, we are unable to justify a disappointment in which we do not share. Having said so much, we shall bc understood when we add that the most remarkable thing about the book is that there is nothing very remarkable in it. It records no thrilling adventures. A carriage accident, an arrival without bag or baggage, a near chance of being benighted upon the mountain side?these are almost the only "" situations"" which the Journal offers to its readers. The interest of the book is, if we may use a much-abused phrase, subjective rather than objective. ""We look through it at the writer, and are brought face to face with her. As a rule, diaries which record anything more than bare facts betray tho self-consciousness of their authors, and make us feel that we are only so far taken into confidence as may bo necessary to produce a certain effect. An art which strives to look like artlessness is their commonest characteristic. And the special value of the Queen's Journal is its genuine simplicity and perfect candour. In these pages she is no longer the lofty abstraction of royalty who lends dignity to a pageant but otherwise is hedged about with a divinity through which it would be profane to penetrate. Here we are permitted to look upon the woman rather than the monarch, and to repay with sympathy the sympathy which she is so ready to extend towards her subjects. It is sometimes asked, with some little jealousy, why the Queen is so fond of Scotland. This book answers the question. It is because there, and especially in the Highlands, she can gratify that intense love of nature which she possesses, and which shows itself in keen appreciation, not merely of wild and beautiful scenery, but also of characters and modes of life as yet in somewhat of their primitive simplicity. The Queen, too, is?as she confesses with evident pride?a descendant of tho House of Stuart, and for her each scene she looks upon recalls some romantic incident in connexion with the fortunes of her ancestors. Heredity asserts itself, Mr. Galton would tell us, in this particular, but not in this alone. For we arc insensibly reminded of King George III.?"" Farmer George ""?when wo read the Queen's account of ""juicing the sheep "" and the interest she took in the more familiar operation of clipping. But, although the Journal recounts the Queen's participation in many simple pleasures (and none seem too homely for her enjoyment), there is throughout her diary an undertone of sadness which the writer never attempts to conceal. Visits paid to old friends and old places bring back the memories of a happier past, and the very warmth of affection with which the Queen speaks of and treats those, whether gentle or simple, who have attached themselves to her seems like the yeanling of an empty heart for a consolation still denied. But we are, perhaps, intruding upon matters with which the reviewer has no concern. The book is emphatically one to be read rather than criticised, and cannot fail to deepen thc respect and sympathy already felt towards its author. Charles J. Robinson.More Leaves from the Journal of a Life in \ 0f the Highlands, from 1862 to 1882. Btf LITERATURE ^] tn (Smith, I crQ Elder & Co.)"" ' ' j th From a purely literary point of view there ! he is not a great deal to say of the Queen's new j th hook. Its style is of the simplest, and it al has the charm of naturalness which belongs ' al to simplicity. The story is told without effort ? w or affectation of any kind, and produces its j tc effect entirely by tho force of sincerity. Her ? Q Majesty is probably a sympathetic rather ' S than an acute and dispassionate observer, , A1 and everything that she sees is seen through , o sentiment. That the sentiment itself is tl always pure and often elevated is a reason I why these records of home life in the royal C circle will find a responsive echo. Otherwise o the experiences recorded are not altogether 1< such as would of themselves impart to this h interesting volume a distinctive character, t The book tells the story of the widowed life t of a queen. It affords touching glimpses a of a chilling isolation of personal position, i which is none the less real because in the t nature of things it must be rare. But it is e its simple human interest that gives the ( hook its strongest appeal. The reader rises < from its perusal with the feeling that he i has learnt something more of the good | i woman by whom it was written?that, above all else, he has seen her in that hour of desolation which comes to many good women, and must be borne by all to whom it comes. ""How will the Queen bear it?"" was the question everywhere asked on that early morning twenty-two years ago, when the tolling of the bell of St. Paul's after midnight carried the mournful intelligence that an hour earlier the Queen's consort had died at Windsor. This book contains the answer to that question. Its tone is one of calm resignation brightened by peaceful and confident hope. Of the Queen's personal character tlie volume contains, naturally enough, many indications. That character is here as elsewhere seen to be eminent in womanliness. Without being deficient in fibre and with abundance of volition it loves best to trust to a higher strength and lean on a firmer will. It was so in those early days of her sovereignty when Lord Melbourne told the Queen in a fatherly way that no woman, whatever her position, could Eve happily I for long without a man's arin?*tb rest on. And when, by the bereavement of 1861, the support of her husband's strength was withdrawn, the Queen turned for solace to that daughter whose fortitude during her father's sufferings and subsequent motherly devotion find a fitting record hero. This womanly trait is obviously a key to the Queen's intimacy with Dr. Norman Macleod, to whose guidance amid many difficulties and consolation in many troubles she has offered tho tribute of an I abundant gratitude. A keener sense of humour might have modified some of these reminiscences. Occasionally, however, a smile betrays itself behind the record of a solemn incident, as when we are told that Principal Campbell's prayer was very trying, because very long, on the day of the unveiling of tho statue of the Prince Consort at Aberdeen, when it rained in torrents. In other places the manifest sincerity saves everything. The book contains some few indications of the Queen's taste in literature. We gather that she is a warm lover of Scott, and this passion probably came to her through her husband from his and her grandmother, the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg?a remarkable woman, of a powerful, energetic, and almost masculine mind, whose pleasure it was of an evening to tell Scott's stories | to Prince Albert and his brother. The ? Queen herself appears to be familiar with Scott?especially, perhaps, with his poetry. j We are told that Brown gave her a copy of the poems of the Ettrick Shepherd, and that she found them full of beautiful things. It is said in various places that Lady Churchill read after dinner ; but except in one instance, of no special moment, we are left in ignorance of the books. This is to be regretted. Tho anxiety to avoid controversial topics, which has wisely restrained the Queenfrom almost all allusion to political affairs, need hardly have operatedin restraining her from all mention of the literature that has cheered her leisure. A similar silence is observed with respect to the Queen's tastes in the arts. Wo have heard elsewhere that she took lessons in singing from Labluche, and that the attained to marked proficiency as an executant on the pianoforte. That her skill with the pencil is at least such as to enable her to seize the broad features of a landscape, the illustrations to the present volume bear evidence. It is scarcely conceivable that one who possesses such attainments should be destitute of opinions on artistic questions. Nor would the expression of these opinions havo been foreign to the revelations of domestic lifo which it is tho sole business of the book to present. But while a certain reticence must have been judicious and necessary respecting artists in many walks who might be irritated by the preference shown to a rival, it is surely a loss that we are deprived of all mention of those who are beyond that infirmity, and about whom the Queen: must have thought and written frequently. The following passage on a visit to Abbotsford is full of the kind of interest of which we could almost wish that the book had yet more:? ""Another twenty minutes or half-hour brought us to Abbotsford, the well-known residence of Sir Walter Scott. It lies low and looks rather gloomy. Mr. Hope Scott and Lady Victoria (my god-daughter and sister to the present Duke of Norfolk) with their children, the young Duke of Norfolk, and some other relations, received us. Mr. Hope Scott married first Miss Lockhart, the last surviving grandchild of Sir Walter Scott, and she died leaving only one daughter, a pretty girl of eleven, to whom this place will go, and who is the only surviving descendant of Sir Walter. They showed us the part of the house in which Sir Walter lived, and all his rooms?his drawing-room with the same furniture and carpet, the library where we saw his MS. of 'Ivanhoe,' and several others of his novels and poems in a beautiful handwriting with hardly any erasures, and other relics whiclx Sir Walter had himself collected. Then his study, a small dark room, with a little turret in which is a bust in bronze, done from a cast taken after death, of Sir Walter. In the study we saw his journal, in which Mr. Hope Scott asked me to write my name (which I felt it to be a presumption in me to do), as also the others. We went through some passages into two or three rooms where were collected fine specimens of old armour, &c., and where in a glass case are Sir Walter's last clothes. We ended by going into the dining-rcom, in which Sir Walter Scott died, where we took tea."" In this connexion it may be mentioned that when the Queen's uncle and early guardian Leopold, King of the Belgians, travelled in Scotland as a solace for his bereavement on the death of the Princess Charlotte, he was for a few days the guest of Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford. While there his pride of descent peeped out in a curious way. An aged Scotch divine alluded to the fact that tho king was descended from Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony, who was one of the first to embrace the principles of the Reformation and to become a protector of Martin Luther. Thereupon Leopold said that he felt more honoured by tho mention of this circumstance than by anything that had been said of him and his family during his stay. The relevancy of the story will be felt by those who have been arrested by what the Queen herself says in these ' Leaves' of the strong Protestant basis which she rejoices to find in the larger religious bodies of Scotland. Her Majesty s love of the Highlands is too well known to require illustrative comment. That she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale, cloud and mist, that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder, and their brighter and sunnier effects, is obvious enough. Above all things the Queen's nature-worship is healthy, and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently* haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when, according to Carlyle, Goethe was the first to say, "" Come, let us make a description."" It will be remembered that the passages of the Queen's book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her Majesty's visits to poor Highland women. There was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old ""bodies"" to say just what was uppermost and not what was "" fut,"" and to talk to tho Queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman. The present volume contains two such peep** into Highland life, and the one we quote f>resents us with tho last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure, widow Grant: ""On Sunday, August 22, 1869, I went to see old Mn. Grant, whom I was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows, and her poor feet r used upon cushions, very much altered in her face, and, I fear, dying of dropsy. On August 20 I again saw her, and gave her a shawl and pair of socks, and found the poor old soul in bed, looking very weak and very ill, but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way. I took her hand and held it. On the 27th she died. On the 28th I stopped at her cottage and went in with Louise and Leopold. We found all so clean and tidy, but all so silent. Mrs. Gordon, her daughter, was there, having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her ; and then she lifted the sheet, and there the poor old woman, whom we had known and seen from the first here these twenty-one years, lay on a bier in her shroud, but with her usual cap on, peaceful and little altered, her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death. She had on the socks I gave her the day before yesterday. She was in her eighty-ninth year."" Probably the most enjoyable of these ' Leaves' are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the Highlands. Here is a sketch of the ""'juicing of the sheep"":? ""At a quarter to twelve I drove off with Louise and Leopold in the waggonette up to near the ' Bush' (the residence of William Brown, the farmer) to see them ' juice the sheep.' This is a practice pursued all over the Highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter, lt is done to preserve the wool. Not far from the burnside, where there are a few hillocks, was a pen in which the sheep were placed, and then, just outside it, a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap, and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other; one man (James Brown, my shepherd, tho elder brother, who came up on purpose to help) took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs ; and then William and he, holding them by their legs, dipped them well in, after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened, and here they had to remain to dry. To the left, a little lower down, was a cauldron boiling over a tire and containing the tobacco with water and soap ; this was then emptied into a tub, from which it was transferred into the trough. A very rosy-faced lassie, with a plaid over her head, was superintending this part of the work, and helped to fetch the water from the burn, while children and many collie dogs were grouped about, and several men and shepherds were helping. It was a very curious and picturesque sight."" More pathetic is the following :? ""Tuesday, June ll, 1872. '? Brown came in soon after four o'clock, saying he had been down at the waterside, for a child had fallen into the water, and the whole district was out to try and recover it?but it must be drowned long before this time. I was dreadfully shocked. It was the child of a man named Rattray, who lives at Cairn-na-Craig, just above where the new wood-merchant has built a house, and quite close to the keeper Abercrombie's house, not far from Monaltrie Farmhouse in the street. At a little before five, set off in the waggonette with Beatrice and Janie Ely, and drove along the north side of the river. We stopped a little way beyond Tynebaich, and saw the people wandering along the riverside. Two women told us that two children had fallen in (how terrible), and that one "" had been gotten?the little een ' (as the people pronounce 'one'), but not the eldest. They were searching everywhere. While we were there, the o'.'l grandmother, Catenach by name, who lives at Souttar Hole, came running along in a great state of distress. She is Rattray's mother. We drove on a little way, and then turned round. We heard from the people that the two boys, one of ten or eleven and the other only three, were at Monaltrie Burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below Mrs. Patterson's shop, passing under a little bridge and running into the Dee. This burn is generally very low and small, but had risen to a great height?the Dee itself being tremendously high?-not a stone to be seen. The little child fell in while the eldest was fishing ; the other jumped in after him, trying to save his little brother ; and before any one could come out to save them (though the screams of Abercrombie's children, who were with them, were heard) they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the Dee, and carried along. Too dreadful ! It seems, from what I heard coming back, that the poor mother was away from home, having gone to see her own mother who was dying, and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one. We drove back and up to Mrs. Grant's, where we took tea and then walked up along the river side, and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back ; but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching: amongst them was the poor father?a sad and piteous sight?crying and looking so anxiously for his poor child's body. "" Wednesday, June 12. "" Drove up to the Bush to warn Mrs. William Brown never to let dear little Albert run about alone, or near to the burn, of tho danger of which she was quite aware. She said her husband, William, had started off early at three this morning. Some people went down to Abergeldie and as far as the Girnoch to search, and others were up and below the castle. No word of the poor child being found. All were to start early to search."" That the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying, for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the Queen's domestic life. In truth, her Majesty's participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment. So long ago as the year of the Queen's accession the Marquis of Londonderry, writing to the Duke of Buckingham, said: ""I hear Melbourne says, in all his numerous conversations with the Queen, ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection."" Thia fact her Premier seems to have stated with some surprise; but probably the last of her seven subsequent Premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience. That these ' Leaves' contain much moro about Mr. John Brown than about Lord Beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise. The book is exclusively a record of home life, and in the domestic circle the Queen's personal attendant was obviously a more important person?as contributing more to her comfort?than even the most admired of her first ministers. Naturally enough, Brown became essential to the Queen, whose health, sorely tried and weakened, stood moro immediately in need of such simple-minded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy. It is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of Brown's robust independence and simple usefulness. We do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kind-hearted and devoted servant, whose discretion and faithfulness were rewarded by gratitude and even friendship. _"
136,B3175,['6815004'],"Father and Son; a Study of Two Temperaments. (Heinemann.) This anonymous book is one of the most fascinating and interesting pieces of literature that has been issued of recent years. Were we not, in the preface to it, specifically informed that the narrative '' in all its parts . . . . is scrupulously true,"" we should have judged it to be fiction by a skilled hand, founded upon fact and personal experience, but either way, as unadulterated fact or unadulterated fiction, it is, as the author offers it to us, a document of the highest value, though, strangely enough, not so for the reason advanced by the writer, who claims that it is a "" record of educational and religious conditions which, having passed away, will never return,"" "" a diagnosis of a dying Puritanism."" This stifling, joyless creed is neither dead nor dying; it is to-day a power in the land. Indeed, a prominent Puritan not long since urged upon us that it was the backbone of the nation, and was not a little annoyed when we retorted that, if so, "" the nation was suffering from spinal disease."" The Puritans we have always with us, and their creed, admirably summed up in the following quotation, is the same now as it was in the beginning: It divides heart from heart. It sets up a vain, chimerical idea, in the barren pursuit of which all the tender, indulgent affection, all the genial play of life, all the exquisite pleasures and soft resignations of the body, all that enlarges and calms the soul, are exchanged for what is harsh and void and negative. It encourages a stern and ignorant spirit of condemnation; it throws altogether out of gear the healthy movements of the conscience; it invents virtues which are sterile and cruel; it invents sins which are no sins at all, but which darken the heaven of innocent joy with futile clouds of remorse. There is something horrible, if we will bring ourselves to face it, in the fanaticism that can do nothing with this pathetic and fugitive existence of ours, but treat it as if it were the uncomfortable ante-chamber to a palace which no one has explored and of the plan of which we know absolutely nothing. The book is the story of the struggle between two temperaments, the father's and the son's. The father is a Plymouth brother of the sternest, strictest, blindest type; the mother, who dies while the son is yet a child, is equally fanatical. For example, to her every work of fiction is simply a lie. The father is a zoologist of high standing and considerable fame, not a little troubled for a time by the contradiction of Genesis by science. The mother bequeaths the son to her husband as one of the Lord's anointed, and as destined to devote his life to the propagation of extreme Puritanism; the remainder of the book is devoted to the mental autobiography of the son's boyhood and youth. All the characters are drawn with extreme skill, and the picture of the small group of Brethren in a little Devonshire village is pitiable in its accurate dissection of narrow bigotry and self-sufficient blindness. Is not this, a perfect touch, this point concerning the father and his praying aloud over the son ? I cannot help thinking that he liked to hear himself speak to God in the presence of an admiring listener. These folk love to be familiar with the Deity, without the slightest intention or sense of irreverence. There are revival scenes, too, painted soberly and with unfailing accuracy, but we cannot follow our author when he sets forth that he is depicting a dead past. Fanaticism and Puritanism vary in externals from age to age, but in essentials remain the same. We have neither space nor would it be profitable to attempt a detailed analysis of the book; it must be read to be understood and appreciated?but we will give one more quotation, a passage which seems to us to sum, briefly and ably, a great subject: It will, I suppose, be admitted that there is no greater proof of complete religious sincerity than fervour in private prayer. If an individual, alone by the side of his bed, prolongs his intercessions, lingers wrestling with his Divine Companion, and will not leave off until he has what he believes to be evidence of a reply to his entreaties?then, no matter what the character of his public protestations, or what the frailty of his actions, it is absolutely certain that he believes in what he professes. Various famous men flit across the pages?Kingsley, Huxley, Robert Louis Stevenson, Sheridan Knowles?historic events play their part, and had we the inclination, the writer's claim to be a narrator of fact could easily be checked; but, as we have said, it boots not whether the story is fact or fiction?it is true to life. The author, also, challenges the reader to "" recognise him as an old acquaintance, occasionally met with in quite other fields."" The secret has not been kept for long, and we understand that Mr. Edmund Gosse does not deny that he is the writer of the book. It is a great book, but for our part we scarcely like this close anatomisation by a son of a father."

Ile gives us certain historical facts and weaves about them a narrative well-constructed, melodramatic, brisk?but the book has no psychology. Now it is precisely the psychology of Villon which should appeal to the artist, as the psychology of Ferdinand Lassalle appeared to Mr. Meredith when he wrote Tl ie Tragic-Comedians. There is really no reason why Villon should be the hero of this story: any sentimental rascal would have done just as well. The quality of Villon's rascality and sentiment Mr. McCarthy does not succeed in conveying to us, and Katherine de Vaucelles is no more than a figure moving prettily in stage gardens and the like places. In a word, If I Were King is a story of pose, of crude colour, and of superficial sentiment. Indeed, the sentiment throughout is cloying, and sometimes almost nauseating. To write "" the cup of her heart seemed to run over with red tears"" is, frankly, to write nonsense of a particularly objectionable kind, and there is much more of the same sort. But we have no doubt that to many readers If I Were King will make quite a strong appeal. They will not however, be readers who know Villon at first hand. To them the book will hardly count.If I were King. By Justin Huntly J McCarthy. (Hei nemann.) It would be superfluous to judge Mr. McCarthy's novel from an historical standpoint, since the characters whom he introduces are bent entirely to the author's own ends and are historical in little else than name. His portrait of Louis XI. may be sufficiently striking to impress those readers whose knowledge of the cynical sovereign is not too intimate. B ut it requires more than Mr. McCarthy's undeniable brilliancy of narrative and picturesqueness of detail to enable us to recognize in the high-souled gentleman who, as Grand Constable of France for one short week, saves his country and wins the love of the Lady Katharine de Vaudelles, the sordid, unscrupulous rogue whose rhymes alone have redeemed the memory of Villon from the stigma of complete ruffianism. Mr. McCarthy, in his anxiety to present a vivid picture of the Fircone tavern and its frequenters, errs on the side of unnecessary coarseness; but the story is certainly not wanting in melodramatic incident, and for this reason is probably better suited to the stage ? which it has already reached?than to a form of literature demanding serious criticism of another kind."
138,B3323,"['4842116', '8528390', '8470921', '4361330', '9461784']","REVIEW OF CURRENT LITERATURE. SYLVIA'S LOVERS. Three Vols. Post Svo. j Smith and Elder. 1863. WHATEVER defects may be justly imputed to the present age, the most prejudiced ""praiser of past time"" would hardly grudge to it the tribute of having excited in the minds of all classes a pre-eminent sense of the claims and interest in the fortunes of the poor. We may be less full of enthusiasm than our fathers; the rapid progress of luxury may have made us more self-indulgent than they, the relaxa? tion of authority may have made us less reverent; but we have a sense of respon? sibility in our dealings willi the poor as a body, 'nnd consequently of interest in their condition, which is altogether a new thing. The world of Addison and Fielding and Pope is, in this respect, a different world. It is not that uneducated people do not play a large part in the novels of Fielding, for instance,?perhaps larger than would be thc case in the same kind of novel at the present day. But they are strictly accessories; their ruggedness is only brought out to set off the polite life, in subordination to which they are all arranged. This is true to a considerable degree even of Sir ""Walter Scott and Miss Edgeworth, who both be? long unquestionably to the new age. They linger over their sketches of the lower orders with a far more loving pencil than they bestow on the more elaborate portraits of their superiors in rank,?but it is the latter, after all, which form the centre of j the picture. That this rugged life can be an object large enough to engross the canvass to itself, is the discover}' of our own day. To us it appears that the reaction against eighteenth century gentility has been in some directions excessive, and we should as much regret that all writers of fiction should draw their materials from clav hovels and crowded back lanes, or even from farm? houses and shops, as we should .that all educated women who arc without the re? sources assigned to them in Pope's hack? neyed line should devote themselves to visiting the poor. Still, it cannot be denied that a fiction representing the life of uneducated people has certain advantages over one equally good, in which the subjectmatter is different. The aim of literature, and especially of fiction, ought to be the enlargement and elevation of sympathy? the cultivation of a catholic interest in all non-moral differences of character and life. For this object it is well that we should be sometimes taken out of our own atmo? sphere?that we should look at the pro? blem of life under those simpler aspects which it wears to those who are hemmed in on every side by its humbler necessities. This is a very desirable result, and the power of producing it is rare. Few edu? cated people really know the poor, and still fewer can translate that knowledge into fiction. When we say, therefore, that the novel here noticed is one of the very best of this kind, we award it no slight praise. It will (somewhat unfortunately, we think) remind most readers of Mrs. Gaskell's only rival in this field; but though we cannot think it bears any approach to the rich and vigorous colouring of the author of "" Adam Bede,"" in the outline of an interesting plot (which we have thc self-denial to refrain from extracting) the superiority lies with it. "" Sylvia's Lovers,"" although we look upon it as a better novel than ""Marv Barton,"" will not, for several reasons, share thc popularity of its predecessor. Some of these reasons might be reckoned by many among its merits. Those who re? member the state of feeling with regard to the relations of labour and capital fifteen years ago, will not doubt that some part of thc very lively interest excited by tho ""novel of Manchester life"" was due to its entanglement with a complex problem of thc day. But critics who believe all adventitious interest of this kind to be as dangerous to the effect of art as a CT stripe of bright colour running across a beautiful pattern, ?who doubt whether problems of this kind are a good field for the powers of women?nay, who feel quite certain that novels are not a good occasion for discussing such, will find with un? mixed satisfaction that Mrs. GaskelFs last novel opens no issues of this nature. Our attention to an interesting and pathetic story is not carried out of the picture, as it were, by any introduction of an element foreign to art. Mrs. Gaskell's last novel is, moreover, very superior to her first, in the absolute exclusion of all ""gentility."" She keeps on her own peculiar ground from the beginning of the book to the end, and those feebler touches, which her vigorous style iii dealing with favourable material brought out so forciblv in her earlier novels, are ' thereby avoided. The quality of the novel ? which will, we imagine, most detract from its general popularity, is its exceeding ; painfulness. This, in itself, is neither good j nor bad?a tragedy cannot bc too tragic, j But wc do not find all that in a verv pain- ! ful story we unconsciously demand. Thack- j cray had a good right to give us a novel \ without a hero, but a novelist who takes | us into the dark recesses which onlv a few ; human beings are called upon to tread, j owes us the compensation of a central j image of large and lofty proportions, ex- j celling, not necessarily in virtue, but in j energy, in elevation, in strength?owes us, ; in short, the relief of poetry, as it is denned j in the noble words of Bacon,?"" The use j of this feigned histoiy hath been to give ; some shadow of satisfaction to the mind in j those points wherein the nature of things j doth deny it. * * * A more ; ample greatness, a more exact goodness, ! and a more absolute variety, than is to be found?in the nature of things,"" he con- j eludes, but wc would alter it to "" the j nature of man."" Here our author fails. She does, indeed, j leave a large space for her central figure, and spend much pains in the elaboration of his portrait, but the conception is feeble, and the execution indistinct. Philip Hep? burn is Sylvia's lover and nothing more. Take from him the love which leads him into the basest perfidy, and which, there? fore, eminently needs the background of a rich and glowing character, and he becomes a mere blank, while his wife is drawn with so much force and soliditv, that the extreme flatness of his portrait tells like a false note. We cannot help comparing him with Adam Bede, and the difference of the two im? pressions of character is thc differencebetween a name written on loose sand, and one engraved on a gem. Thc dashing young sailor, whose gallantry wins him a cap? taincy, is a stock novel character, it is true, but the superior crispness and de? cision of execution so far compensates for the common-place ideal, that we timi our? selves regretting at every turn that he, instead of his uncouth and yet insipid rival, does not occupy the place of honour in the story. This is the capital flaw in tlie book, and it is, to our thinking, something more than an artistic flaw. Hepburn is so evi? dently intended to interest us on the moral side of his character, that the absence of any remorse for his treachery, apart from the fear of and regret for its consequences, strikes us somewhat painfully. And though the occasion demands the exclusion of ali bitter feeling, we yet are somewhat revolted when his wife, repenting of what seems to us her righteous indigna? tion against him, laments him with the words, "" Oh, Philip, my Philip, tender and true f Mrs. Gaskell is too much inclined to confuse the sharp line whieh divides those temptations whieh are and are not possible to a character she intends to retain its hold on our respect. Nevertheless, the story has a noble moral, put in the mouth of the dying Philip. ""Child,"" he said, ""I ha' made thee my idol; and if I could live my life o'er again , I would love my God more, and thee less; and then I shouldn't have sinned this sin against thee."" This is the key-note of the book, but to give it full effect the character j of Philip should have been altogether dif? ferent. Milton's division, "" He for God i ... only, she for God in him,"" might be owing '. to a low conception of the woman's ideal, : but to sacrifice honour and dutv for one I beloved object is the woman's temptation, 1 and the character which is to vield to it j and vet retain our svmpathv should retain ! the attraction of a somewhat feminine | grace. This the uncouth shopman is entirelv and desijmedlv without, and loses i therebv as much in an artistic as in a mond j point e,f view. We have dwelt too long on the one great 1 want of a storv whose excellence forces us i to try it by a very high standard, to do j more than indicate very slightly either its | few remaining defects, or its many lesser merits. Our favourite passages are those fresh country scenes where we seem to ; breathe the pure dewy air of the Georgies, though there are not wanting passages of great vigour (as for instance, the description of the lire , which will excite more general admiration. We cannot reckon the scene at the storming of St. Jean d'Acre among these, but it is the only too ambitious passage in thc book. We regret this failure the more, as the author might easily have spared us this journey to Palestine and back by merely giving a letter actually tjuoted. When we have added that thc first half of the first volume is very de? cidedly inferior to the rest, and that there is a superficial resemblance to George Eliot's Hetty in the heroine, which is quite lost sight of as we advance, we havo noticed almost everything we regret in a book, the merits of which could not be exhausted in a much longer space. Rumour assigns a vcr}- similar plot as a subject for the labours of the laureate. We can hardly expect, even from him, a more pathetic rendering of it. The delineation of in? dividual character is not the forte of our author, but she has wisely chosen a subject in which her almost unequalled power of painting the character of a class, and those deeper emotions which bring out not what is individual but what is universal, has enabled her to give us a fiction which will take its place above the high water-mark of the fashion or caprice of the day.S'lh'in's Tjorors. By Mrs Haskell, Author of 'The Life of Charlotte Bronte,' ' Mary Barton,' &c. In Three Volumes. Smith, Elder, and Co. [?Second' Notice.] Monkshaven is a little seaport town upon the coast of Yorkshire, depending for all its prosperity upon the whale fishery. It has two busy seasons, one in spring when the whalers are sent out, and another in autumn when they return. In Monkshaven and upon the adjacent coasts and moors, especially at an outlying farm of llaytersbank, where at thc beginning of the story Sylvia lives, thc one pretty spoilt child of her parents, nearly the whole action occurs. Thc characters are, Sylvia, a rustic beauty j?her simple, easy father Daniel Robson, proud of his small brains, once a whale-fisher, who when impressed had, as be likes to tell his friends, chopped off thumb and forefinger to escape the King's service, then a smuggler, next a farmer at Haytersbank. At Haytersbank we find him with the child of his heart Sylvia, a faithful farm servant Rester, and a staid good wife Bella, who is full of household loves and household cares. She dotes not less than her man on the pretty, generous, impulsive, loving maid, but she is by nature more reserved. As Sylvia tells her young neighbour Molly Corney, when we first see the two girls as they are tripping to market with butter and eggs, "" Feyther's liker "" me, and we talk a deal o' rubble; but mother's words "" are liker to hewn stono. She puts a deal of meaning in "" them."" Bella Robson, quietly hopes that time will bring together Sylvia her daughter and Philip Hepburn her nephew as man and wife. Fhilip is but an assistant at the chief shop in Monkshaven for drapery and general stores, kept by the kindly quakers John and Jeremiah Foster; he had entered the shop as an errand boy, but has by honest patient industry, and a good mother wit, risen to confidence and respect. He has taught himself some book learning, with which, and with all that he does, he is a little pedantic and formal. He carries an old head on young shoulders, has a dry manner, a long sallow face ; only bright honest eyes to recommend him to the eyesight of a girl; but his unflinching, patient life of duty faithfully performed, has made him a hero in the eyes of the yet more quiet Hester Rose. Hester serves with Philip in the shop and lives in one household with him, for he and the other shop assistant William Coulson lodge with her mother Alice Rose. Alice is a devout and careworn woman, who with a mother's eye has seen her girl's closely enshrined secret, as Philip to the end of his life never does. Coulson would marry Hester, if she would. Why will she not ? asks Philip at his friend Coulson's request, but he is none the wiser for Alice's wrath and her dismissal of him as "" one too blind to see through a win"" dow."" Throughout the tale Hester loves, suffers, and serves. In his unconscious adoption of the relation of brother and sister, and his sense that Hester never will refuse to do a kind act, Philip tries her heart to the utmost, but she conquers every rebellious pang. Philip's whole soul is set upon his cousin Sylvia. She is his idol, and he loves her with a strength and constancy that has its reward from her only in the hour of death. And yet he marries her. But Sylvia has another lover. ""When we first meet her on her way to market, she is rejoiced at the commission to buy herself duffel for a cloak. Her mother has suggested that it should be grey "" I wish,"" she said, "" mother hadn't spoken up for t' grey,"" and after all, since it must be bought at Foster's shop, and Philip is there, and Philip advises her against scarlet, she wilfully pleases her own fancy and buys the scarlet. Philip himself, with his long dry face, his formal manner, and his strong enduring love, is as the grey duffel that does not please the maiden's fancy. The scarlet is Charley Kinraid, a gay "" speck"" sioneer,"" who first appears before her as the wounded hero of a battle with the pressgang, and who is bright in manly youth and beauty, with the gay kindly manner of a ""light o' love,"" who can win woman's hearts and break them without meaning harm. He wins Sylvia and is won by her; but how should Philip know that he is won, or that he is worth winning ? He has trifled with and deserted Coulson's sister, who is dead of grief. That Philip knows. When Philip has seen him kidnapped by a chance crew from a passing man-of-war while on his way to join his whale-vessel, with Sylvia's love token?a ribbon Philip had given her?in his hat, and has been charged by him to carry word to her that Charley Kinraid will remember her and will come back, subtle and sore is the temptation to keep silence. Halting at the next roadside inn, for he is on his way to London honoured with a trust by the Fosters, and will be away a month, Philip means to write what he has seen, but he hears sailors who know Kiuruid talking of him, and celebrating his gay conquests among the girls. Ay, there was Coulson's sister too, and Sylvia's mother had bidden Philip keep harm from her girl. Was not Kinraid too fickle to be true to Sylvia even if he lived through the war and did return ? Philip would say nothing till he returned to Monkshaven. And when he did return, Kinrald's hat had been found on the water, no pressing had been seen in the neighbourhood, and all thought Kinraid dead. Was it not better, thought Philip, that a man like Kinraid should thus die out of Sylvia's Hie, and leave open for her thc way to his own great, deep, j earnest love. The message was not delivered. ' Thc pressgang came afterwards again into those parts. ] At Shields it was riotously fought against, and for a time j beaten by the people. At Monkshaven thc able-bodied sailors I of the returned whaling vessels were lured to the market | place one night bv the ringing of the fire bell, and sur; rounded by the armed gang. Farmer Robson, who was then in the town, suggested rescue to half-a-dozen ready old salts who stood with bim in a court; the rescue was planned and effected. In the heat of triumph old Robson further suggested that thc fire bell should not have been rung for nothing, and straightway fire was set to tho old inn that hud been used by thc pressgang for head-quarters, and in which thc rescued men had been imprisoned. Very proud was Daniel Bobson of thc head he had shown in setting all this work afoot, and he went homo smoky, bruised, und tired, to be honoured for his deed even by his good and prudent wife, to have thc warming pan taken down for his special comfort, and when he was got with aching bones between the warm sheets, he thanked Sylvia and her mother in a sleepy voice, adding, ""It's a 'vast o' comfort to think on yon poor lads as is sleeping in "" their own homes this night,"" and then slumber fell upon him, and he was hardly roused by Bell's softly kissing his weather-beaten cheek, and saying low, "" God bless thee, "" my man! Thou was allays for them that was down and "" put upon.1' But the burning of the inn was hanging matter in those days, and honest Daniel was hanged for it. Mrs Gaskell doea not describe either the trial or the execution. After Daniel Robson has been carried to the county jail, we hear only of the home from which he has been wrenched, of the love that yearns to him and labours for him. A single fine touch indicates the completion of the tragedy behind the scenes. And in those days who so firm, so true, so gentle as Philip, so sure a support to the widow, who gropes for her lost husband through a darkened mind, so true in love to Sylvia. Philip and Coulson have been made by the kindly Fosters their successors in the shop. Haytersbank must be given up. Philip and Sylvia are married, and the widow is their common care. But Philip's conscience is mindful of the undelivered message, and it tortures him to see that Sylvia gives him wifely service and friendship while, even after their child is born, her heart yearns still towards her old idol, Charley Kinraid. And a day comes when Kinraid does return, preternaturally faithful. His reappearance, handsome, good-natured, and for once not careless, severs Sylvia and Philip. He himself goes away disappointed, in a few months marries a rich and pretty cousin, and is perfectly hippy and good-natured as before. But Philip's life becomes a tragedy. Before he dies Sylvia has seen KinraidY happy wife, has learnt that on a distant battle-field the banished Philip, who had enlisted ns a common soldier, saved Kinraid's life. She has outlived her girlish illusion for the gay "" specksioncer"" when she weeps by the deathbed of the grave, long-faced shopkeeper, who had proved himself the better hero, although the less brilliant, and the nobler lover, though his love had stooped to one unhappy breach of a trust thrust on him against his will. The end of the book is like the burden of some true-hearted old ballad tale, and in its whole substance there is not only the refinement of plot that contrasts so forcibly with the coarse fiction now in request, but also a charm of style and a poetical conception of detail that leaves the reader, when he closes the book, with such memories as might be carried from a gallery of choice cabinet pictures. But in a former notice we have expressed our sense of the general character of this welcome addition to the sterling literature of our day. Now, therefore, we will leave the book to be read by all who desire better entertainment than is to be found in the bad grammar of Mrs Henry Wood, and the coarse kitchen literature of Miss Braddon. The graceful and shrewd humour of Mrs Gaskell's Cranford lives again in the first half of Sylvia's Lovers. The character painting is throughout exquisite, and the picture of trouble at Haytersbank consequent upon Daniel Robson's fatal arrest has been equalled in pathos only occasionally by the best masters of fiction. How cleverly Mrs Gaskell manages the dialect she has here given to her humble characters, we must be content to show by taking a group or two from a picture of a Yorkshire farm-house festival. Bessy, a daughter of the house, has fetched her married sister Molly, who is well settled in Newcastle and affects matronly, town-bred airs, to see the supper tbat has been laid out: Bessy was full of admiration. ""There, Molly 1"" aaid she. ""Yo' never saw more vittle brought together i' Newcassel, I'll be bound; there'll be above half a hundredweight o' butcher's meat, besides pies and custards. I've eaten no dinner these two days for thinking on't; it's been a weary burden on my mind, but it's off now I see how well it looks. I told mother not to come near it till we'd spread it all out, and now I'll go fetch ber."" Beaty ran off into the house-place. "" It's well enough in a country kind o' way,"" said Molly, with the faint approbation of condescension. "" But if I'd thought on I'd ha' brought 'em down a beast or two done in sponge-cake, wi' currants for his eyes to give t' table an sir."" The door was opened, and Berny came in smiling and blushing with proud pleasure. Her mother followed ber on tip-toe, smoothing down her apron, and with her vuico subdued to a whisper: "" Ay, my lass, it is fine I But dunnot make an ado about it, let 'em think its just our common way. If any one says ought about how good t' vittle is. Uk' it calm, and say we'n better i' t* house,? it'll soak' 'em eat wi' a better appetite, and think the more on us. Sylvie, I'm much beholden t' ye for coming so earlr, and helping t' lasses, but yo' mun come in t' house-place now, t' folks is gathering, sn' yo'r cousin's been asking after yo' a'ready."" Molly gave her a nudge, which made Sylvia's face go all aflsme with angry embarrassment. She wu conscious that the watching which Molly hsd threatened her with began directly; for Molly went up to her husband, and whispered something to him which set him off io a chuckling laugh, sad Sylvia was aware thst his <y?s followed her about with knowing looks all the evening. She would hardly apeak to Philip, and pretended not to see his outstretched hand, but paased on to the chimney-oorner, and tried to shelter herself behind the broad back of Farmer Corney, who had no notion of relinquishing his customary place for all the youag people who ever came to the house,?or for any old people either, for tbat matter. It was hia household throne, and there he sat, with no more idea of abdicating in favour of any comer than King George at St James's. But be waa glad to see hia friends; and had paid them the unwonted compliment of shaving on a week-day, and putting on his Sunday coat. The united efforts of wife and children had failed to persuade him to make any further change in hia attire; to all their arguments on this bead be had replied : "" Them as doesn't like to see me i' my work-a-dsy wescut and breeches may bide away."" It was the longest sentence he said that day, but he repeated it several times over. He was glsd enough to tee all the youn^r people, but they were not "" of his kidney,"" aa he expressed it to himself, and he did not feel any call upon himself to entertain them. He left that to his bustling wife, all smartness and smiles, and to hia daughter* and son-in-law. His efforts at hospitality consisted of sitting still, smoking hui pipe; when any one came, he took it out of hia mouth for sn instant, and nodded his head in a cheerful friendly wsy, with- out a word of speech; sad then returned to hit smoking with th greater relish for the moment's intermission. He thought to himself "" They're a set o' young chaps ss think more on t' Isssee than 01 i 'baccy;?they 11 find out their mistake i' time;?give 'ern time, giv 'em time."" And before eight o'clock, he went ss quietly ss a maa of twelvi stone can upataira to bed, having made a previous arrangement wit) bis wife that she should bring him up about two pounds of spice* beef, snd a hot tumbler of stiff grog.THE LITERARY EXAMINER. { Sylvia'* Lovers. By Mrs Gaakell, Author of ' Tho Life J of Charlotte Bronte,1 * Mary Barton,' Ac. Volumes. Smith, Elder, and Co. In Three This is a novel to read slowly, as one reads a poem. Its plot is of such a tale as Crabbe might have chosen for his verse, and although written in prose, it deals, among simple and unfashionable people, with the truest poetry of life, in thought, feeling, and action. Every incident hi' alive with subtle tooohea of humour or pathos, and in ita harmony of colouring, the skilful grouping of ito characters, and the quiok sense of life and nature shown in ita minutest detail, stands before the reader as a picture by a sterling artist Mrs Gaskell has never written with mon care than in this novel. The Yorkshire dialect of nearly all the dialogues is so skilfully managed, that without being a stumbling-block to any reader, it gives the charm of a Doric simplicity to the whole idyll. The shrewd character painting, the incessant blending of the sights and sounds of nature with the action of tip story, the spirit of kindly human fellowship and the high sense of human duty belong to the unaffected English of the narrative itself, rich in fresh thought and true refinement of expression. Were the story of the book poor it would be commended by the manner of the telling. In its whola texture Sylvia** Lovers is as lawn to sackcloth compared with the coarse "" sensa"" tion "" tales of late forced irtfj^Mlion, which produce a striking plot, as one might jfroTOe a striking pattern by daubs with a tar brush on the miller's sacking. In story as in style the oontrast is complete. In Sylvia** Lovers, though strong interest is excited, and none who have tears for an imagined grief will pass with dry eyes through the closing chapters either of the second or of the third volume, there is no bigamist, no murderer, no villain at all. There are the shortcomings of human weakness common to us all, the lesser conflicts of character wherein no small part of all human life consists; but there is not a person in the book of either sex who does not accredit the sound doctrine at which they who live healthily must needs arrive in their mature years, although ito evidences are not clear to youth, that men and women are good fellows in the main. The true artist shrinks from nothing so much as the mere dull reproduction of deformity. Crime of course must be always a common element in tragic narrative, but then it must be introduced not for its own sake but as an active power, through which souls are tried and the great depths of man's nature may be stirred. A great crime establishes among a group of surrounding |persons strong exceptional conditions of life; exceptional because it is below the common nature of men to be greatly criminal. The true poet, novelist, or dramatist, uses the crime not as a condition interesting in itself, but as productive of conditions under which the spirit of man shows in its strong emotion forces that would, in repose, not be apparent. The objection against such books as 4 Lady Audley's Secret,' apart from the fact that they show only the coarsest sense of literature in their writing, is not that they are tales of crime, but that they are ill-written talcs of sordid crime, of crimes meanly committed for poor, sneaking ends, and dilated upon for their own sake as interesting matters of concealment and detection. Writers of such books would make a "" sensation"" novel of "" Goneril"" out of the play of * King Lear,' add Regan's share of cruelty to Goneril's, cut out Cordelia, reduce Lear to a "" softy,"" and make him creep nnder his daughter's bed with a lighted chamber-candle. All the stir of emotion that can be produced by a great crime, Mrs Gaskell has obtained in Sylvia'* Lovers without the production of a criminal. There is great iniquity, but it is the iniquity of an abstraction; relentless, powerful, impalpable as the Fate of a Greek tragedy; iniquity of Law, mainly in the activity of the press-gang among the seafaring men of coast towns during the war with France at the close of the last century, and subordinately in the undue severity of penal law at the same date. We are reminded that there was no deliberate wickedness in the motives that maintained at that time in great vigour the system of impressment, and that backed it with the strong arm of the law. Those persons concerned in execution of the law who appear in the tale are represented only as men with the same kindly sympathies as their neighbours. But the evil Law is the dread shadowy Fate, against which hearts beat and souls chafe in vain. To-day we only express an opinion of this tale; but we shall return to it and justify it fully.REVIEWS OF BOOKS. SYLVIA'S LOVER.S.* Tie success of ""Adan) Bede"" and its successors attestcd the )oSs1bility of a delineation of peasant life, sutfficiently humorous and );athetic to stimulate the inquisitiveness and enlist the symiptthies of a fastidious, highly educated, and hlasl ' audience. The frwiio prettiness of Hetty, the saintship of the interesting Diah, th1e ententious comicality of Mrs. Poyser,-all were too striking in ttheir way to fade easily front the minld, and from that time to thi.s the dispensers of fictitious literature have favoured. us With a suecession of "" cottage interiors "" as inuilite, if not as spirited, a those of the Dutch School of Painting. Mrs. Gaskell has miiany qualitications for success in this line of art. She s Chasc 11o11nd of a vernacular which is piquant, picturesque, and sometimes toucliillul. Her north country talk, if not invariably well sustained and sometimes a little theatrical, is at any rate sufficiently good for the general public ; she has a quick eye for the effective points in Scenic grouping, and there is a geniiuine touch of pathos about those parts of her writIngs in wlhich she is herself sincerely in,terested. Moreover, she seems to have studied Yorkshire and Lancashire life to good effect, and sonic of the characters introluced into her latest story (such, for instance, as that of Kester, a s<(rt of half farm servant, half confidential friend,) are suffilciently removed, from the conventional types of modern life to attract us by their curious originality. And yet the efiect0 of the whole story is to disappoint those who remember the g low with which they followed Mrs. Gaskell's earlier romances to their 'novuewent, and the first-rate artistic ability displaye(l in the compilation of such a biography as that of Charlotte Ilronte. For one thing "" Sylvia's Lovers "" is eminently an "" unsatisfactory"" novel. The good-natured inclination to make everything Co righlt in the long run, and to believe that this is, after all, the best of all possible worlds, is absolutely set at naught. The book is full of gratuitous suffering, nor does the conclusion leave us any reason to fancy that when the dark cloud of tragedy has drawn off, the mournful landscape will be, in any material respect, altered for the better. The chief incidents, upon which the tale turns, are as old as the history of story-telling. A serious, sentimental youth falls desperately in love with a flighty girl, who, after leading him for some time along the stony path of adverse courtship, proceeds herself at last to fall desperately in love with a roving, rmarine Don Juan, whose personal charms and audacious behaviour make him secure of feminine conquests wherever he conies. Upon this primitive foundation the whole superstructure of the tale is raised; and as the scene lies at the close of the last century, the authoress has the opportunity of interweaving sone capital press-gang stories, and the execution of a man for riot, which are the real backbone of the book. Novelists who wish to be effective always stand in need of a grievance, and the political position of England at this period of her history involved many grievances of the most serious description. No more tyrannical interference with the liberties of the subject has probably ever been attempted than the 1 arbitrary impressment of sailors for the royal service, and nothing but the desperate struggle in which England was engaged couldbe i held to justify a measure, which hurt niutch, and terrified even more than it hurt. That it often resulted in intolerable hardship,-that it entaile(d dreadful sufferings,-that it roused a furious spirit of discontent and disloyalty among the classes whom it principally affected,--might, be conceived without the aid of Mrs. Gaskeli's vivid delinieiation; but in no part of the story are her powers so thorou-fhly aroused as when she describes the several seizures of the Monk!haven fishermen, the fights which resulted therefrom, and the miserable doom to which through their instrumentality, a simple, well-meaning old man was brought. It is in resisting one of the raids of the press-ganc that Kincaid, the hero of the piece, first makes his appearance; and nothing can be better than the description. of the sort of charm which the prestige of personal bravery, and a desperate wound received in opposing a supposed outralre, invested him in the eyes of an impressible, passionate, and enthusiastic girl. A nation, stirred to its depths by a world-wide struggle, dazzled by great military achievements, fretted by oppressive laws, is far better material for the novelist's purposes than the uninteresting prosperity, which, in modern times, drives the framers of fiction into the invention of imaginary grievances, and chequers their pages with tragical catastrophes, too wildly impossible even for the most willing and eager credulity. Real life, then, is full of real tragedy, and the most faithful delineation of its incidents is the most artistically effective. Mrs. Gaskell seems to have felt this, and to have bent herself assiduously to reproducing the actual state of feeling and mode of life among the sea-faring population of the northern coasts at that time. Education, thoughtfulness, morality were, it is needless to say, all widely different from what they are among ourselves. Very worthy heads of families indulge in frequent inebriety and occasional smuggzling; virtuous wives and mothers see as little harmn in one as t other; prejudice is supreme, knowledge scanty, reading an honourable but half-dangerous accomplishment, religion of a simple and not very profound order. One of the beat characters here is that of the unfortunate yeoman, who afterwards gets hanged for taking part in a riot.

N o sulch gentle casuistry as Mrs. Gaskell deseribes woluld silence the outcries of conscience and honour, supposin, either to exist ; anld it is only in the French fictions of the latter empire that we expect to find ardent affection turning, a naan into little short of a deion. The capital defect, however, of "" Sylviz's Lovers"" is the chaingei which comes over the story in the course of telling. We beg-inl with an intense fidelity to nature ; we end with the wildest of melodramas ; for two volumes we are occupied with the little joys an(d soiwows of a seamtan's cottage and a Quaker's shop ; in the third we are hurried off to a siege in the Holy L'nd, our senses stunned with sallies, bonibardmnents, surprises, wonderful mneetings, still more wonderful escapes, and the performaince comes to a closu in the inidst of a dazzling disp;lay of the most approved 1,itorical imnprobabilities. This is a strange fault for so experiencedan arti-t ats M'rs. Gaskell to have comnmitted. The very excellence of one part of the story makes us morbidly sensitive as to the defects of the other. ""Such as you are at the commencement,"" says one of the greatest literairy authorities, ""continuc to be througrhouit."" Miss Bra ddon, anl the other compilers of the "" sensation stories "" just now the fashioni, observe the rule strictly, for their whole canvass is full of nmonstrosities, to which the eye gradually gets so accustomed, that orne ceases to be shocked. If the very framework of a story warns thel reader not to look for probability, be makes up his mind to thie marvellous, and accepts the prodigies as a matter of courrse. Mrs. Gask;el, 1however is an artist of another and a hiaher school, and it is only in a moment of carelessness or fatigue that she forgrets to ""hold the mirror up to nmature,"" and starts off on a courageous expedition into the region of the impossible. If any ordinary novelist sent off one hero to Palestine to rescue another hero, hi.s Ideadlyenemy, under a heavy fire of artillery, we should take it as Oa matter of course, and neither wonder nor complain ; but whent the hand which depicted ""Rtuth"" descends to such commnonplace trivialities, we feel disposed to murmur at the eccentricities of talent, and in behalf of the authoress, no less than of the public she hab iso often delighted, to warn her against forgetfulness of the first principles of her art, and against negrlect of those true natural types upon which all genuine art is necessarily dependent.Sylvia's Lovers. NEW NOVELS. By Mrs. Gaskell. 3 vols. ] (Smith, Elder & Co.) The story of ' Sylvia's Lovers' is laid in humble life, and is narrated chiefly in the broad vernacular Yorkshire dialect, which, although it gives the local colour, is a drawback to the comfort of the reader, and fatiguing to the eye. But for true artistic workmanship we think 'Sylvia's Lovers' superior to any of Mrs. Ga-skell's former works. The scene of the story is laid at a fishing-town on the Yorkshire coast, called here Monkhaven; the time, the close of the last century, when ?the war with France was rife, and pressgangs were in all their cruel authority. Monkhaven was the seat of the Greenland whaling-trade; and the best scene in the book is the description of the return of a whaling-vessel, the first of the season, waiting to get over the bar, all the inhabitants assembled in breathless excitement to hear news of sons, brothers, husbands and lovers who had sailed on the Toyage. Just as she clears the bar and gets in, the pressgang is upon her, seizing halfa-dozen of the crew, and carrying them oft' to the rendezvous, without allowing them a word with their half-frantic relations waiting and watching for them. It is a highly-wrought scene, and yet there is not a trace of straining for effect or of exaggeration; it is true pathos, and relies only on the simple truth of the reality. Sylvia, the heroine, is the daughter of a retired whaling-sailor, who has become a farmer, but who still loves whaling and smuggling far better than ploughing or seeing after sheep and cattle. Old Daniel Robson is a capital portrait: Sylvia is as charming and pretty a damsel as ever tormented the heart of a lover ; but she has a dash of fierce, persistent resentment in her character that effectually redeems her from perfection. The mother is an excellent and skilfully-drawn character?a respectable, sensible,religious woman, whose one inconsistent act had been the choice of her husband; but she behaves so wisely and well, that it would have been a pity to deprive her of such an opportunity to exercise her virtues. Sylvia's cousin, Philip, is desperately in love with her, against all his sense of prudence; for he is as wise and excellent and disagreeable a young man as can well be imagined. There is no fault to be found with him, except that he is detestable. Sylvia hates him, and the reader sympathizes with her heartily; and yet he never does anything but good, nor says anything but what is unexceptionable. He loves Sylvia with a remorseless pertinacity which affects the reader with a positive dread, it is so certain to tire down all opposition and wear out obstacles: of course he suffers a great deal, and the reader feels a malignant pleasure in every rebuff he receives. He is a man who can talk of the respect due to the law to the poor people who are driven wild by seeing the pressgang carry off their relatives as they touch the hind. In one of the returning whalers which the pressgaiig boards, a young man distinguishes himself by his resistance, and gets nearly killed ; in fact, there are several lives lost in the affray. This young man is the type of a fine, high-spirited sailor: Sylvia exalts him into a hero; he tells tales of adventure which would have won Desdemona herself. He falls in love with Sylvia; and though the mother favours Philip and does not like Charley, circumstances are, however, propitious,?the father gives his consent, and the two plight their troth; but they have to part immediately, for he has to join his ship, a whaler: he is the best harpooner in all the service. On his road he is seized by a pressgang in the sight of Philip, to whom he gives a message for Sylvia. Philip never delivers it; lets her believe him dead; sees her breaking her heart, and only thinks of the steadilyincreasing chances for himself to win her. Mrs. Gaskell tries very hard to furnish him with redeeming traits of character, and to make excuses, and to get up the reader's pity for him, but quite in vain. Poor old Daniel, the father, gets mixed up in a riot and a rescue from a pressgang, in which a house is broken into and destroyed. For this he is committed to York Castle, and takes his trial, is condemned to be hanged, and the law takes its course. This part is t%ld vaguely and feebly. Mrs. Gaskell does not let her sympathies go with the poor old man, and she shrinks from this part of her narrative ; it is hastily huddled over. After this terrible catastrophe, Sylvia and her mother are left helpless and alone, with no one to assist them or protect them but Philip, who has certainly been a good friend in their trouble. Sylvia marries him for the sake of a home for her mother. The real genius of the story now begins. Nothing can be more true and delicately indicated than the cold, disappointed married life of Philip. The treachery he has practised begins for the first time to weigh heavily upon him: his punishment lies in his sin; even the reader feels sorry for him. Of course, Charley Killian comes home, and Sylvia learns the truth. There is a very strong scene, excellently done: the fierce, unforgiving side of Sylvia's character comes out towards her husband. She has by this time a ehild: this, and her sense of honour, enable her to refuse to leave him; but he cannot stand her wild, contemptuous, indignant misery, ? he leaves home, and in ti fit of reckless despair enlists for a soldier, and never lets his wile know what has become of him. Years pass by, and the triumph of Mrs. Gaskell's art is shown in her power to bring over the sympathy of the reader to Philip. Charley goes away and makes a fine marriage; he has risen to be an officer, and become so prosperous that the reader cares no more for him. Philip saves his life; but he meets with no success himself; he is in a terrific explosion, and scarred, maimed, and disfigured so as not to be recognized. He is sent to England and discharged. His deep, passionate love for his wife remains all unchanged; but he dares not return to her?the memory of her curse lies heavy on him. The reader not only forgives him, but the intensest sympathy is roused for him. We will not spoil the readers interest, by narrating the end of the story; it is very finely worked up, and is as true as it is powerful. When once the reader has got over the provincial dialect and the peculiar orthography, there will be nothing more to find fault with."
139,B4035,['8621966'],"THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA. Thc Hand of Ethelberta. By Thomas Hardy. In Two Volumes. London : Smith, Elder, and Co. If you asked anybody, during the progress of Mr. Hardy's novel through the Cornhill, how they liked the story, you generally received an uncertain and qualified answer. All admitted tbat it was very clever and original, not like any other novel they had ever read, but most people added tbat they thought the character of the lady as well as her adventures too improbable. They would not believe that such a woman ever existed or could exist, and, granting the possibility of the character, there were many of tho incidents which struck them as extremely unlikely departures from the course of real life. Improbability has been the main fault alleged against the * Hand of Ethelberta' in current criticisms of the story. Now we have always been among the enthusiastic admirers of Mr. Hardy's work, recognising in it the very highest artistic purposes and something not far short of the highest powers of execution, and we venture to think that this accusation of improbability as a fault proceeds upon a misapprehension of the writer's intentions. We do not, of course, presume to dictate what is to be considered probable and what improbable. This is eminently one of the points on which a critic has no right to interfere between the novelist and his reader, and would find no profit in interfering. The reader may always legitimately decline to take any critic's opinion as to what he ought to believe to be possible; and if the reader pronounces a story improbable, and declines on that ground to approve of it, the novelist has failed. He has failed, that is, if he intended to produce an impression of probability. Here the critic, in the exercise of his chief function of discovering and explaining the intentions of the novelist, may lawfully intervene. If the novelist did not intend his story to be a reflex of real life, he ?cannot be blamed if it is not, unless we are to lay down ^ close adherence to the probabilities of real life as an indispensable condition of novel-writing. Mr. Hardy seems to us to have deliberately disclaimed being tried by a rigid standard of probability when he adopted as the sub-title of his work ""a comedy in chapters."" True, there is a comedy of manners in which to be improbable is to fail, because its design is to produce an illusion of real life. It has recently been argued in these columns that probability is one of the tests by which the comedy of manners is distinguished from the farce. But there is another sort of comedy, what may be called ideal comedy, in which the fancy is permitted to range beyond the limits of real life. Mr. Hardy's ' Ethelberta,' "" a comedy in chapters,"" is a comedy of this sort. Characters and incidents are deliberately and consistently deflected from the perpendicular of real life to gratify the humour of the comic muse. The incidents in * Ethelberta' are improbable as the incidents in Shakespeare's comedies are improbable. It is a work of art, pervaded by a dominant sentiment, which colours every incident and every character. Whatever maybe thought of the interest of 'Ethelberta' as compared with ' Far from the Madding Crowd,' it certainly shows no falling off in intellectual force. There is not a trace of hasty work in ' Ethelberta ;' its dialogues, its descriptions, its general proportions, are as thoughtfully calculated and firmly worked out as a Dutch painting of the old school. Not that the novel is dull and laborious; on the contrary, it is full of life and spirit, bright all through with the sunshine of humour and fancy. The novelist has been at pains to conceal his painstaking, and has succeeded. But Mr. Hardy undertook a difficult task in trying to work out such a conception as the character of the heroine Ethelberta ; he burdened himself with a very subtle and intricate psychological problem. The starting-point of the story he gives in a brief formal prologue in the first chapter. Younp* Mrs. Petherwin stepped from the door of an old though popularlnn in a Wessex town to ti-ke a country walk. By her look and carriage she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no worldly sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen ; but, as a fact not generally known, her claim to distinction was rather one of brains than of blood. She was a respectable butler s daughter, and began life as a baby christened Ethelberta after an infant of'title who does not come into the story at all, having merely furnished to Ethelberta's mother a means of occupying herself as head nurse. She became teacher in a school, was praised by examiners, admired by gentlemen, not admired by gentlewomen, was touched up with accomplishments by masters who wero coaxed into painstaking by her many graces rather than by her few coins, and, entering a mansion as governess to the daughter thereof, was .stealthily married by the son. He, a minor like herself, died from a chill c Night during the wedding tour, and a few weeks later was followed into the grave by Sir Ralph Pethcrwin, his unforgiving father, who had bequeathed his wealth to his wifo absolutely. These calamities were a sufficient reason to Lady Petherwin for pardoning all concerned. She took by the hand the forlorn Ethelberta?who seemed rather a detached bride than a widow?and finished her education by placing her for two or threo years in a boarding-school at Bonn. Latterly ?he had brought the girl to England to live under hvr roof as daughter and companion, th*1 condition attached being that Ethelberta was never openly to recognise her poor relations. This is the lady whose hand is the subject of contention throughout the book. If Mr. Anthony Trollope had been commissioned to trace Mrs. Petherwin's adventures in search of a husband, he would probably have contented himself with bringing out, in a series of clever descriptions of Mrs. Petherwin in society, that her varnish of gentility was only skin-deep, that the heart of the butler's daughter beat beneath the elegant garb of the fine lady, and he would have found in this plenty of material for an entertaining comedy of manners. But Mr. Hardy has chosen another line. He drops the question of Ethelberta's manners on one side with an understanding that they were as perfect as if her father's vestibules had been lined with ancestral mail, and sets himself to the more intricate task of tracing how Ethelberta threw overboard various lovers and made up her mind to accept the suit of a profligate old lord. There is not much difficulty, it will be said, in that; nor, indeed, would there have been if Mr. Hardy had written from the point of view of the cynic. A marriage of love renounced for a marriage of convenience is a very commonplace affair. But the peculiarity aud originality of Mr. Hardy's conception lies in the motives which he assigns for Ethelberta's choice, and his mastery of the novelist's art is shown in the skill with which he traces the working of contending motives. If the ' Hand of Ethelberta' had not appeared before ' Daniel Deronda,* Mr. Hardy might have been accused of borrowing his method, under great variety of character and circumstances, from "" George Eliot."" Ethelberta is a character in which passion is ruled by judgment. She was not incapable of passion, but reason, clear-sighted calculation of consequences, had the upper hand. A talent for demureness under difficulties without tho coldbloodedness which renders such a bearing natural and easy, a face and hand reigning unmoved outside a heart by nature turbulent as a M*ave, is a constitutional arrangement much to bo desired by people in general; yet had Ethelberta been framed with less of that gift in her, her life might have been more comfortable as an experience, and brighter as an example, though perhaps duller as a story. Such a character is dangerous; the most cruel monsters, the most shameless adventurers, are often made of such materials. If Ethelberta's judgment had been occupied solely in controlling her turbulent impulses to her own advantage, her biographer might have had to record a very unlovely career. But she was not a selfish woman, though she did read Bentham and slightly pervert his teaching. The sentiment of family was stronger in her than the sentiment of self. In the prologue which we have quoted, it is said to have been a condition of Lady Petherwin's patronage of her daughter-in-law that she should not recognise her poor relations. Now it was by no means with goodwill that Ethelberta temporarily yielded to this condition. The old butler, her father, had a large family, of whom Ethelberta was the eldest, and her ruling motive in life, to which every other was subordinated, was the advancement of her brothers and sisters. She had all a parent's interest in them. She was eager enough for distinction and social homage, but she was resolved to put her whole family in a position of independence. This was the source of all her difficulties, aud the source we should think of many difficulties to the novelist. If Ethelberta had been a solitary adventuress, her fortunes would have been much easier to trace. The death of Lady Petherwin removed her necessity for living separate from her poor relations, and at the same time imposed upon her the necessity of earning a living by her own exertions, for Lady Petherwin and she quarrelled before the old lady's death, and she was cut off with nothing as a basis of operations except the lease of a house for three years in a fashionable square. It was no easy task for a woman to make a living and at the same time keep her position in society; but Ethelberta contrived not only to do so, but also to keep all her family by her side. The shifts by which this was managed, the mental struggles ofthe heroine during tbe three years for which her fashionable residence was at her command, and the grounds of ber final decision, are invented and imagined with the most unfailing humour and a very sure insight into the mysteries of the conscience. To lay bare the framework of Mr. Hardy's story in this analytical way would bo doing him an injustice if we did not say that his framework does not lie on the surface. In tbis respect his art is very much higher than George Eliot's. He traces motives with a skill not less sure and patient, but with a much more perfect concealment of the process. There is a freshness and sunny clearness about his work, a definiteness of outline, a bold play of fancy, which recals, in some indefinable way, through all tho difference of incidents and characters, the air of the Elizabethan comedy. Mr. Hardy's carefulness in construction and regard for dramatic unity is worthy of Ben Jonson himself. There is no straggling in the novel; in every chapter it is the disposal of the hand of Ethelberta tbat is in suspense. The connecting thread is slight, but it binds thc parts very firmly together. From whatever point of view we regard the work, we find deliberate artistic aims and unflinching fidelity of execution. One of the most striking features is the way in which pictorial effects are interpenetrated with the action, giving every chapter something like the vividness of a scene in a play. We are not only told what the personages say, but we seem to see the gesture with which tbey say it, and the furniture or the landscape round them. Whether this is altogether commendable in a novel, whether it does not tend to impede the course of the action, and generally dull the impression of what is said and done by imposing too constant a strain on the pictorial faculty of the reader, is a subject for consideration; but at any rate it is interesting as an experiment. We doubt whether Ethelberta possesses tho popular interest of some of Mr. Hardy's previous novels, and so far that is a fault, or at least a disadvantage, to which the novelist must reconcile himself; but it is more masterly as a work of art?it reveals a progress in technical excellence which makes us look forward with curiosity to his next publication."
140,B8218,['9446050'],"The Adventures of Philip on his Way through the World, Ac. y_w XOVELS. By W. M. Thackeray. 3 vols. (Smith, Elder & Co.) Mr. Thackeray must look to bis laurels. The world, whether it be the world of fine gentlemen or of innocent women?the world of the first or of the second table,?will at last get tired of being led down alley after alley of ""Vanity Fair.?The lamps in all the alleys are the same: the toys in the booths are the same: the haggard or humble people who tumble for mosey, or solicit custom for a livelihood, are the same. The ear cannot bear too long the drone of a hurdy-gurdy or the peal of an organ. Who has not wearied of a painter's model-face?of his chrome sky?of his grey wave?of his tree greener than grass or browner Utan burnt sienna, to be met with in our exhibition-rooms year after year? Who has not longed for something, if less mechanically true to Nature, at least offering some variety in form or colour ? Had ' Philip' been a first novel, the book might have commanded as many readers as had' Pamela,' when the Roxalanas of Kanelagh nsed to hold up a volume in their hands, byway of assuring rival SUUiras that they had got the new novel. Being something like the ?trent-, successor to the tale which installed (and most deservedly) its author as a first-class censor of manners, painter of life, and keen anatomist of the human heart, with all its breathings and its bleedings,?it may possibly meet with a more tepid welcome than any seventh or seventeenth work by so quick an observer, so well-read an author, so neat and manly a master of pure English as Mr. Thackeray ought to meet. No creator who produces much and rapidly can be always up to his own mark; but a Scott, even when he has to fight bankruptcy with palsy, in his old age, could not throw out his 'Fair Maid of Perth' without adding another figure to our gallery of real beings, in Harry the Armourer. It may be Erofoundly true that there is no hero without is speck, no villain without his temptation and his redeeming virtue, no good woman without her "" tempers,"" no virago without her passing spasms of goodness?that vulgar people are as essentially refined as many genteel ones, and genteel ones as intrinsically coarse as many vulgar ones,?but has not the world known as much, or as little, as this for the last eighteen hundred and sixty-two years? The episodes in the great chronicle of Time, however, vary ?the varieties of humour are endless; and among these things every real novelist will alwavs find sufficiently various material, whether he works up his public by an artfullycontrived plot, or holds them fast by developing some quaint character such as a Jonathan Oldbuck or a Sarah Gamp. In ' Philip' there is no intimation of novelty, save such as exists in the character of Nurse Brandon, with her stupendous love for the illegitimate son of the physician, whose lawful wife she was?her consequent self-effacement and her bad English. Some of her doings, however, are badly devised; as, for instance, her great achievement in overcoming the brute and the bully of the narrative by whisking chloroform into his face. "" Oh, my brother! were you to introduce a ""sensation effect"" like this into your everyday story of commonplace people, would not Pendennis have some sharp sarcasm to bestow on you?none the less stinging because it was thrown off with a poco-curante yawn ? Then, to set wrong to-rights?to turn the iron of a human lot into gold by such a fairy wand as a lost will delivered from the sword-case of a post-chaise by a providential overturn,?is surely an expedient on which bland moralists, like some authors we know, who professionally sneer at excitement and repudiate exaggeration, might find something to remark. In brief, if Mr. Thackeray's new book be subjected to the microscope, the result of such experiment may be referred to his own good sense and honest judgment. It is not well put together; there is a quiet carelessness in the style, a perpetual interposition of the author betwixt the reader and the characters, which tire and chill the interest. Mr. Thackeray can hardly write a chapter which does not contain some happily-fancied turn of language; but we wish that, when he writes again, he would not choose for characters a hero who is disagreeable, and a heroine who is merely pretty and loving, with a weak father and a horrible shrew of a mother, and a scheming, speculating hypocrite who ruins everybody?himself held in thrall by a sort of Fleet parson, gambler, sot and bully, and a vulgar publisher and his wife, who are not half so absurd in their breaking of English as the Twigg* in Hood's ' Tylney Hall,'?and a humane boarding-house keeper, the Afr*. Todgers of Paris, not so rich and real as her English contemporary,?and a heart-ess coquette who jilts the hero for money. The best-natured and most patient of men, or women, tires of keeping shabby company such as the above, and may be excused for hankeriiw after Alphonso the Brave and the Fair Imogene, or any other impossible Virtue or unmitigated Vice."
141,B7067,"['8940843', '2440875']","Princes8 Helene von Racowitza'8 Auto- I biography. Translated from the G(er- I man by Cecil Mar. (Constable & Co.) PRINCESs HELENE VON RACOWrTZA'S autobiography will have a peculiar interest for admirers of George Meredith's novels, and perhaps it is not by a coincidence that its appearance is synchronous with that of 'The Tragic Comedians' in the Memorial Edition of his works. It is now rather more than thirty years since the Princess published that account of her relations with Lassalle upon which Meredith relied as the main authority for the events he narrated and explained. His explanation, brilliant and masterly as it was, omitted a very important factor. After all, the strangest action of the heroine of the story was, not her submission to her family-which, had it been the action of one of his own heroines, Meredith would conceivably have praised -nor yet her marriage with the luckless Yanko, for which other reasons than pusillanimity present themselves, but her subsequent appearance in print as a champion, and a somewhat too com- placent champion, of her own part in the affair. Clotilde, the Princess as Meredith represents her, would have been both too astute and too self-conscious to have committed this astounding blunder. But the woman who committed it was the girl who had asked Lassalle whether the Countess Hatzfeld would have to live with them (an incident omitted by Mere. dith, who no doubt thought it an in. vention of the Princess's); and the first thing to recognize about Clotilde's original is that her perpetration of this blunder came out of a kind of innocence, that she perpetrated it without being aware what she was doing, in a spirit of in. genuousness, verging upon fatuity. "" This,"" she writes of her present volume, ""ranks as far above my first effort as the speech of ripe manhood does above the halting expression of a child."" The autobiography, then, convinces us that the story of ' The Tragio Comedians,' like that of another ""lady of high distinction for wit and beauty (curiously enough, Meredith's next), ""is to be read as fiction ""; nor is this decision prompted by the discovery of discrepancies of detail between the various versions or of inconsistencies in any of them, though not a few are discoverable. The whole course of the Princess Helene's life and the manner in which she tells of it reveal an individuality which has little in common with Clotilde's. She was early introduced to a brilliant and shifting society, and already at the age of fourteen was mistaken for her mother. Spice was added to her beauty by an impetuous, dashing manner, and she went on her way, vaguely drifting, spasmodically candid, playing in tie peculiar world in which she found hersel for no piize except its pleasures, it accepting these, in whatever form they offered themselves, with open arm. While still a child, she formed views of her own upon the fundamental things of life, and carried them into practice; bW she submitted formally to her parents' choice where suitors were concerned, s0 that, on meeting Lassalle when she va nineteen, she was the typical "" jeune file allemande,"" incapable of self-direction, and more than usually afraid of her elders because more conscious of her revolt against them and of its futility. Durng the short period of her engagement to Lassalle, she wanted, she says, "" to tell him all about my past life and my 'crimes against saintly morality '; but he interrupted me with an energetic motion of the hand. 'No! no! for heaven's sake don't let us have any Pompeian excavations! ' "" and the reader is sometimes tempted to wish that the advice had been remembered in the 'Autobiography.' The pages that treaty .of Lassalle are naturally the most interesting in the volume; but even without them it would be worth reading, so great is the variety of the writer's experiences, her psychology so unusual and so intimately revealed. She handles her pen with something of the negligence of a lady of quality, and it must have been in a similar spirit of negligence, with the support, of course, of her exuberant vitality, that she adopted at need, or was ready to adopt, the professions of actress, physician, artist, journalist, in turn-not without success or some promise of it in all. She was obliged to give up medical work shortly before her final examination, and took up flower - painting a little later when forced to lie on her back for a time. Indeed, there are many indications in the volume of a struggle with adversity which high standards of comfort cannot have rendered less acute, and the success with which she met one exigency after another is remarkable evidence of the writer's practical ability and common sense. It is not less remarkable, though less engaging, that she should retain in old age that total absence of the sense of fitness in things which was so conspicuous a feature of her youth. The conclusion of her narrative of the events which led to Lassalle's death (a narrative sincere and poignant, but marred by a recurrence of foolish and tasteless remarks) is puzzlingly absurd. The ""gigantic edifice of the German Empire"" must always, she writes, ""have seemed like a prison "" to Lassalle; "" I therefore ask whether we pigmies, all of us, were not mere puppets in the hand of destiny, and ueed gthe spirit of the world's history as the means of sweeping away the giant who could have found no place in the Empire."" It is not surprising to learn that the writer of this is a Theosophist who published anonymously some years ago a little book entitled 'Wie ich mein Selbst fand.' Her accounts of the many notable persons with whom she has come into contact -from Hans Andersen and Bulwer Lytton, of whom the latter would ""read aloud from his own works "" while "" in especially poetic passages his 'Alice' accompanied him with arpeggios on the harp,"" to Bjbrnstjerne Bj~rnson, ""the wonderful old athlete, his beautiful white curly hair standing straight up ""-are always vivid and amusing; and it is surprising that in a book in which personal jottings Play a large part, and much that is trivial is recorded, there should be few Pages that are dull. The mystery of the author's personality, her anarchic bohemianism, her sometimes childlike, sometimes childish candour, her clear Perception of the details of life, her dimness as to its larger outlines-in short, her combined experience and inexperienceengage attention from the first page to the last.PRINCESs HELENE VON RACOwiTzA: AN Au'ToriocaAPHT. Authorised translation from the German by CECIL MAR. Constable and Co. i 2r. 6d. net. Princess von Racowitza's claim to fame is the part she played as Helene von Danniger, in bringing about the death of Lassalle. Their friendship was regarded with extreme disfavour by the lady's family, who in the end managed to break off the match. Lassalle fought a duel with Racowitza, his rival, and (entirely by accident, the Princess assures us) received a fatal wound. She presently married the victor, who had been thrown over in favour of Lassalle. He lived only a few months, and the Princess afterwards appeared on the stage, wrote for the American newspapers, remarried and got a divorce and remarried again. She was a beautiful, passionate, and imperious person (owing not a little of her temperament, one imagines, to that enraged father who, when she ran away to Lassalle, dragged her by the hair across the street and nailed her up in her room), and her career is full of such adventures as those qualities invited. The story of the Lassalle tragedy has been made use of by George Meredith in htb Tragic Comediaws."

Tuts being a fourth edition indicates its popularity. It is a record of the events, during a number of years, in the household at Chelsea, of an eminent and honest English lawyer, it the days of Henry VIII. England had never a purer or more upright judge than its ex-chancellor, who was beheaded for his persistence in believing that there is a jurisdiction in ecclesiastical affairs wherewith the State should not intermeddle; and refusing, at a period when oaths were lightly broken, to accept one which he might not keep. The work professes to be a diary by his daughter, Margaret Roper, including periods before and after her marriage. The style of the period, and of a lady in the position and under the trials of Sir Thomas More's favourite daughter, are preserved well. The extract beneath refers to Sir Thomas More's return to private life:Hie hath resigned the great seal!

IT would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family, suffering, obviously, from the ""1 cacoethes scribendi"".-a very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under. We should almost be inclined to suppose that ""I The Tenant of Wildfell Hall "" is a family affair, in which each member of the said literary family, from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for ""I a jolly row,"" has had a scratch, each adding an incident in his own fashion. The difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel, and the effect is by no means pleasing. But it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the ""Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"" for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment, which, like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day, puzzles us to think where it can come from; whilst, at the same time, we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together, and, like the oasis in the desert, refresh the reader's wearying soul. With the plot of ""1 The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"" we shall not meddle; for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader; but may simply state, that t1he "" Tenant"" is a certain widow lady, who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen, with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant. Mrs. Graham, the widow lady in question, lives at W""'ildfell Hall with an old female servant, and occupies that portion. of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genl'temen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting, in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled. We must do her the jutice to state that, however much she may paint, we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s, razsis Wiinporte. Mrs. Graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one Gilbert Markham, a young gentleman, of a somewhat sanguine tem perament, who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood. Mr. Gilbert Markham seems to have a soul above the farm-yard and piggeries; in short, a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket, and supported by leathern gaiters and ankle-jacks. Paying a visit one evening to the Hall, for the purpose of ascertaining how Mrs. Graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame, which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood, the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence, which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat. And here we shall let this youth speak for himself, at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the ""v arm"" generally produces :"" But I gave one look back before I closed the door, and saw her leaning forward on the table, with her hands pressed against her eyes, sobbing convulsively, yet I withdrew in silence. I felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings. I"" To tell you all the questionings and conjectures, the fears and hopes, and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as I descended the hill, would almost fill a volume in itself. But before I was half way down, a sentiment of strong sympathy for her I had left behind me had displaced all other feelings, and seemed imperatively to draw me back. I began to think 'Why am I hurrying so fast inl this direction ? Can I find comfort or consolation, peace, certainty, contentment, all, or anything that I want, at home ? and can I leave all perturbation, sorrow, and anxiety behind me there? ""' Instead of going home, as he ought to have done, and taking off his half boots, and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe, and quietly toddling off to bed, he ""turned round to look at the old hall. ""' There was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon. I walked back to get a better view of it. When it rose -in sight, I stood still a moment to look, and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction. Something called me nearer-nearer still-and why nQt, pray ? Might I not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile, with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it, with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm August night, and the mistress of my soul within, than in returning to mv home, where all, comparatively, was light and life, and cheerfulness, and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind, and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins, and how could I endure to hear it openly declared, or cautiously insinuated, which was worse ! I had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear, 'It may be true,' till I had shouted aloud, 4 It is false ! I defy you to make me suppose it ! ""1 I could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlor window. I went up to the garden wall, and stood leaning over it, with my eyes fixed upon the lattice, wondering what she was doing, thinking, or suffering now, and wishing I could speak to her but one word, or even catch one glimpse of her, before I went."" There is sonmething very truthful and life-like in the preceding and following extracts, which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated. But "" I had not titus looked, and wished, and wondered long, before I vaulted over the barrier, unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window, just to see if she were more composed than when we parted; and if I found her still in deep distress, perhaps I might venture to attempt a word of comfort-to utter one of the many things I should have said before, instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity. I looked ; her chair was vacant; so was the room. But at that moment some one opened the outer door, and a voice-her voice-said, ' Come out, I want to see the moon, and breathe the evening air; they will do me good, if anything will. "" Here, then, were she and Rachel coming to take a walk in the garden. I wished myself safe back over the wall ; I stood, however, under the tally holly beach, which, standing between the window and the porch, at present screened me from observation, but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlight-Mrs. Graham, followed by another, not Rachel, but a youngt man, slender and rather tall. Oh ! Heavens! how my temples throbbed! Intense anxiety darkened my sight; but I thought-yes, and the voice confirmed it-it was Mr. Lawrence. ""' You should not let it worry you so much, Helen,' said he; ""I will be nmore cautious in future ! and in tinme,-' "" I did not hear the rest of the sentence; for he walked close beside her, and spoke so gently that I could not catch the words; my heart was splitting with hatred ; but 1 listened in tently for her reply? I heard it plainly enough. ""' But I must leave this place, Frederick,' she said; ' I never can be happy here, nor anywhere else, indeed,' she added, with a mirthless laugh; ' but I cannot rest here.""' Now, we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle. Here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral, that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with, much more so young a writer as Mr. Acton Bell. Even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight, here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable, and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility, 'which we shall presently extr.act. It is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that, in order to secure success as a romancist, an author must pander to thei vices of the age, and endeavour to display, in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character ^vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation. There can be no doubt that, owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romance-reading public, incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest; and, as a matter of course, young writers, in order to be read, seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character, which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice! But this is bad; and in young writers particularly so. It shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader; in short, how little confidence they have in themiiselves, which we regard as very essential to success. But we shall make one inore extract froin Mr. Bell, in order to show why we find fault. Mr. Gilbert Markham, the "" gentlemnan farmer "" the reader wotW of,' having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed, taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman, has the happiness to meet his rival on his ""s pretty grey poney."" The twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise; but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust, we shall append an extract, the italics and notes of admiration being our own :""As I trotted along, however, chewing the cud of bitter fancies, I heard another horse at no great distance behind me; but I never conjectured who, tihe rider might be, or troubled mv head about him!!! till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity, or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk ; for lost in my own reflections, I was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper. I lost ground, and my fellow traveller overtook me. He accosted me by name; for it was no stranger-it was Mr. Lawrence ! Instinctively the fingers of my whip-hand tingrled, and grasped their charge with convulsive energy : but I restrained the impulse, and answering his salutation with a nod, attempted to push on; but he pushed on beside me, and began to talk of the weather and the crops. 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries 'aild observations, and fell back. He fell back too, and asked if my horse was lame ! I replied with a look, at which he placidly smiled"" ! ! ! This looks something like a climax, and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs, prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street, when each is afraid to begin. But our friend the "" gentlemanfarmer"" girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to say-""s I grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before ; but still forbore to raise it, and rose in silence, waiting for some more tangible cause of offence, before I opened the floodgates of my soul, and poured out the dammed-up fury that was foaming and swelling within. ""'sMarkham,' said he in his usual quiet tone, ' why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter ? You have found your hopes defeated ; but how am I to blame for it I warned you beforehand, you know, but you would not "" He said no more.; for, impelled by some fiend at my elbow, I had seized my whip by the small end, and-swift and sudden as a flash of lightning-brought the other down upon his head."" Continuing in this silly tone of namby-pambyism, for it really is nothing else, our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant "" gentleman-farmer,"" whose sympathy for his fallen foe-for Lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeins-and whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader. He says that the "" little grey pony,"" somewhat astonished, no doubt, at this extraordinary proceeding, "" kicked and capered a little,"" and quietly cropped the grass off the hedge-bank, having "" made use of its freedom"" to do so. Mr. Markham gallops off, leaving Lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose. Having some compunctions of conscience, however, he returns to the spot, where he finds his rival, with his handkerchief still at his nose. But let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style"" I dismounted, however, and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree, first picked up his hat, intending to clap it on his head, but either he considered his head unfit for a hat, or the hat, in its present condition, unfit for his head; for shrinking away the one, he took the other from my hand, and scornfully cast it aside. I It's good enough for you,' I muttered. ""My next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him, which was soon accomplished; for the, beast was quiet enough in the main, and only winced and flirted a trifle, till I got hold of the bridle; but then I must see him in the saddle. "" 'Here you fellow-scoundrel-dog-aive me your hand and I'll help you to mount."" ""'No; he turned from me in disgust. I attempted to take him bv the arm. He shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch. "" What, you won't ? Well! You may sit there till doomsday, for what I care.

But we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this, nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this, even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer; but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted, being so glarinfly improbable in their action. The "" Tenant of Wildfell Mall is evidently made-manufactured, and that, too, in a very clumsy manner; and though we cannot, and will not state that it is "" a tale told by an idiot,"" we are compelled to say that it is "" full of sound and fury,"" and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnption-.and most decidedly that it "" signifies nothing.""I The Tenant of 9-ildfeU HaU. BYACtON BELL. Newby. - LIKE the other novels by the BELLS, there is much to object to in this. There are unnatural personages and isolated specimens. It is a tale of wonders and eccentricities, in which something of atrocity is mixed. Yet does it rivet the attention. Only its picturings offend; and they, merely on account of their truthfulness. It is not always advisable to tell the truth. Disgusting truths had, indeed, better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt. It was the error of Sir EDWARD BLULWER'S Lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement. In Wildfell Hall a would-be widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives. Now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon. Boarding-school misses would be apt to misconstrue it, and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge. No amount of beautiful writing-no intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts, can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work. In its plot Wildfell Hall is well constructed, the narrative is %vigorously sustained, and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author. We trust that in future 'Mr. ACTON BELL will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork. A*n extract or two will shew how near to the style of CURRFR BELL is the composition of this tale:WILDFVLIL HALL. Near the top of this hill, about two miles from Linden-Car, stood Wildfell Hall, a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era, built of dark grey stone,-venerable and picturesque to look at, but, doubtless, cold and gloomy enough to inhabit, with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes, its time-eaten airholes, and its too lonely, too unsheltered situation,-only shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of Scotch firs, themselves half blighted with storms, and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself. Behind it lay a few desolate fields, and then, the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill; before it (enclosed by stone walls, and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granite-similar to those which decorated the roof and gables-surmounting the gate-posts) was a gar. !den,-once stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate, and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardener's torturing shears, and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give them,-now, having been left so many years, untilled and untrimmed, abandoned to the weeds and the grass, to the frost and the wind, the rain and the drought, it presented a very singular appearance indeed. The close green walls of privet, 'that had bordered the princial walk, were two-thirds I withered away, and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds; the old boxwood swan, that sat beside the scraper, had lost its neck and half its body; the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden, the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway, and the lion that guarded the other, were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth, or in the waters under the earth; but, to my young imagination, they presented all of them a goblinish appearance, that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants. And here is A DOMESTIC PICTI'RE. I wth too late for tea; but my mother nad kindly kept too tea-pot and muffin warm upon the bobs, and though she scolded me a little, readily admitted my excuses; and when I complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea, she poured the remainder into the slop basin, and bade Rose put some fresh into the pot, and reboil the kettle, which offices were performed with great commotion, and certain re. markable comments. "" Well !-if it had been me now, I should have had no tea at all,-if it had been Fergus, even, he would have had to put up with such as there was, and been told to be thankful, for it was far too good for him; but you-we can't do too much for you.-It's always so-if there's any thing particularly nice at table, mamma winks and nods at me, to abstain from it, and if I don't attend to that, she whispers, ' Don't eat so much of that, Rose, Gilbert will like it for his supper,'-rs nothing at all-in the parlour, it's ' Come Rose, put away your things, and let's have the room nice and tidy against they come in; and keep up a good fire; Gilbert likes a cheerful fire.' In the kitchen-' Make that pie a large one, Rose, I dare say the boys '11 be hungry ;-and don't put so much pepper in, they'll not like it I'm sure,'or, ' Rose, don't put so many spices in the pudding, Gilbert likes it plain,'-or, ' Mind you put plenty of currants in the cake, Fergus likes plenty.' If I say, 'Well, mamma, I don't,' I'm told I ought not to think of myself-' You know, Rose, in all household matters, we have only two things to consider, first, what's proper to be done: and secondly, what's most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house -any thing will do for the ladies.' "" "" And very good doctrine, too,"" said my mother. "" Gilbert thinks so, I'm sure."" A. Very convenient doctrine for us at all events,"" said I; ""' but if you would really study my pleavure, mother, you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you do-as for Rose, I have no doubt she'll take care of herself; and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness, she'll take good ""are to let me know the extent of it. But for you, I might sink into the grossest condition of self-in. dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others, from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself, and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied, while left in total ignorance of what is done for me,-if Rose did not enlighten me now and then; and I should receive all your kindness as a matter of course, and never know how much I owe you."" "" Ah! and you never will know, Gilbert, till you're married. Then, when you've got some trifling, se'f cornceited girl like Eliza Millward, careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage, or some misguided, obstinate woman like Mrs. Graham, ignorant of her principal duties, and clever only in what concerns her least to know-then you'll find the difference."" "" It will do me good, mother; I was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of others-was I ?-but to exert my own towards them; and when I marry, I shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable, than in being made so by her; I would rather give than receive."" "" Oh! that's all nonsense, my dearit's mere boy's talk that ! You'll soon tire of petting and humouring your wife, be she ever so charming, aid then comes the trial."" "" Well, then, we must bear one another's burdens."" "" Then you must fall each into your proper place. You'll do your business, and she, if she's worthy of you, will do hers; but it's your business to please yourself, and hers to please you. I'm sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived, and after the first six months or so were over, I should as soon have expected him to fly, as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me. He always said I was a good wife, and did my duty; and he always did his-bless him !-he was steady and punctual, seldom found fault without a reason, always did justice to my good dinners, and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delay-and that's as much as any woman can expect of any man."" "" ' Hypocrite ! ' I exclaimed, and he held his breath, and looked very blank, turned white about the gills, and went away without another word."" "" You must not stay long, Gilbert,"" said she, when the door was closed upon us "" I'm not going to,"" said 1, somewhat testily.The Tenant of WMil(dfell Hall. MIR. BELL'S NEW NOVEL. Ba Acton Bell. London, Newby. TIF. names of Acton Bell, Currer Bell, and Ellis Bell, are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms (le guerre in the literary world. The novels lately published by these supposed individuals, or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three, are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic; while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman, and, as wve suspect, a Yorkshirewoman.. Jane Eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the Bell designation ; and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. These two are, indeed, so strikingly alike in sentiment, style, and general mnodes of thought, that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other. That the author is a clever and vigorous writer, the popularity of Jane Eyre is a fair proof. She has also a certain marked tone of mind, which has impressed itself upon her books, and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels. And for the sake of the morals of the novel-reading public, we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers; and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in Jane FPyre and in the tale now before uts. We should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages, or approval of her principles, ha(d any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels, and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin, that is new. Jane Eyre is, indeed, one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever Perused. It is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc ab)solutely wrong or forbidding, or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales. It is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas, expressions, and circumstances, %hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature; and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification. The heroine, who tells the story, and who cer- tainly is iuiade to paint herself an(l her comi. panions with very considerable force and skill, is as utterly unattractive and unIfeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew. The Teniant of Wfeildrl Hail is also a species of autobiography. One third of the story is tol(l by thc lhero, a kind of gentleman farmer, whose morals, religion, cultivation, aiid talents, are about on a par with those of Jane Eyre herself; and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom, lie falls in love, not knowing that, though living in solitude, she is really married to a living husband. Throughout the whole book, there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader. All are commonplace, vulgar, rough, brusquemannered personages, whatever their supposed station in life; while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species. She is married to a man of family and fortune, to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of Iter fricnds, and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind, andl treats her with every indigniity, insult, and ill, usage which can be conceived, slhort of actual personal violence. 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands, an(l (dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher!, blasphemy, and l;rofaneness, inl whichl, with a herd of boon companjions, he (lelighted to spend his days. By and by, of course, lie dies, and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a death-bed which are tneither edifying, nor true to life, nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate. In the end, the hero and heroine nmarry, after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntn""s anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writer's creations. Nevertheless, on the whole, we should say that The Tenant of Wildfell lail is not so 1xad a book as Jane Eyre. There is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of' it-s most prominent characters. The hero and heroine are people of decent intentions; and though the same offensive element of interest (so to call it) occurs in both of the tales, and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid; yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor.

Sometimes the worthy gentleman would reprove my mother for being over-indulgent to her sons, wvith a reference to old Eli, or David and Absolom, vwhich was particularly galling to her feelings; and very highly as she respected him and all his sayings, I once heard her exclaim, 'I wish to goodness he had a son himself! lie wouldn't be so ready with his advice to other l)eOple then; he'd see what it is to have a couple of boys to keep in order.' "" He had a laudable care for his own bodily healthkept very early hours, regularly took a walk before breakfast, was vastly particular about warm and dry clothing, had never been known to preach a sermon without previously swallowing a raw egg-albeit he was gifted with good lungs and a powerful voice,, and was, generally,, extremely particular about what he eat and drank, though by no means abstemious, and having a mode of dietary peculiar to himself, - being a great despiser of tea, and such slops, and a patron of malt liquors, bacon and eggs, ham, hung beef, and other strong meats, which agreed well enough with his digestive organs, and therefore were maintained by him to be good and wholesome for every body, and confidently recommended to the most delicate convalescents or dyspeptics, who, if they failed to derive the promised benefit from his prescriptions, were told it was because they had not persevered; and if they complaimed of inconvenient results therefrom, were assured it was all fancy."""

If half the travellers' tales of this or any other age had the fascination of this simple story, the term would never have become a reproach. It has not fallen to the lot of many men to be the subject of a hymn of worship, extolling their bravery as that of a saviour. To fewer still, we should think, has come such an honour on such good grounds; and when to these distinctions Colonel Patterson adds that of telling the story without a trace of self-consciousness, and without the smallest touch of boastfulness, he may indeed be counted fortunate among men. The skill and nerve of the sportsman, resource, and modesty are, it is true, attributes which we are fond, not without reason, of regarding as the characteristics of our Empire builders; but it is not often that we are given the opportunity of appreciating their presence in one individual through the unconscious medium of himself. After all, it was his beloved Tsavo bridge that filled Colonel Patterson's mind. It is as much upon the trials and humours of its building that he lingers as upQn the grim excitement of his campaign against the disturbers of the peace of his encampments. But it is ' this very unconsciousness that brings into strong relief the ghastly strain that must have been imposed upon every soul in those beast-beleaguered tents. And the flashes of humour that betray us to an unexpected smile, even in the midst of the excitement of a chase which is not one-sided, give us a vision of that happy, enduring patience which Africa, above all continents, seems to develop in her tamers. There is tragedy in the story too. Apart from the grim tale of coolie victims claimed by the man-eaters, the ghastly deaths of Mr. O'Hara and Mr. Ryall, and of the poor gun-boy, Bhoota, are recounted with telling simplicity. Indeed, it is the artlessness, the Tack of "" style,"" which gives this book its force, and lifts it from the level of mere romance to that of living truth. One feels in reading that this was as it is written, and from between the lines emerges what is not written?that the personal factor bulked large in the turn of events. We should like to quote much, but there is one sentence which must be quoted, and which should serve to emphasise the first essential of true sportsmanship. Much as I should have liked to have added a giraffe to my collection of trophies, I left them undisturbed, as I think it a pity to shoot these rather rare and very harmless creatures, unless one is required for a special purpose. Colonel Patterson used his camera instead of his rifle, and the charming picture he gives us is a far more telling result than any trophy could have been. The pictures in the book are a special delight. There is one on almost every page, and they form a running commentary upon the text, which enables the least informed of readers to visualise each succeeding scene in the story.

A book woven out of actual experiences, owing, nothing to other books, to preconceived opinions,.stereotyped conventions, or the idle chatter of the clubs and coteries. A book which expresses?faultily, it may be, but sincerely?the mind and soul of the author: something individual and apart. Our English literature, which has produced many great classics, contains few such books as this, and they are the more valuable for their rarity. It is a self-conscious age, and absence of self-consciousness is of the very essence of Yoi Pawlowska's art. A certain simplicity alike of expression and of feeling is everywhere apparent. Our author has wandered through Europe and into the warm, mysterious lands of the near East?a solitary pilgrim. But she has looked upon men and women, upon small, smiling cities and vast, barren plains with an observant and sympathetic eye. Everywhere she has found something in which to delight, and she has discovered for herself?what' we all profess to believe?that there is a certain quality called "" humanity "" whioh binds together in an indissoluble fellowship the peoples of the world. This book is full of the joy pf life, of the mere delight in living. One feels that each moment brings, with it for the author its appropriate gift. ""To be perfect to the present moment""?is not that, as Pater taught us, the secret of happiness ? And Yoi' Pawlowska is always in harmony with her surroundings, whether kneeling before the dim altar of some Gothic church, chatting to an unknown companion in a railway train, or seeing ""night with the tombs and dawn with the mountains "" from the Appian Way. So..she takes., from .life?gladly and with gratitude?all that it has to give, and when she writes of "" the gaiety of forest life, the haunting shade of leafy valleys, the laughter of running water, the little cries of surprised wild things, the joy of wood flowers, and the glancing of sunlight on green moss through trembling branches "" one is sure that these things?seen and unnoticed each day by every one of us?have for her their message of beauty and consolation. ' To quote is almost an impertinence, for no isolated passage can convey any idea of the delicate charm and fragrance of the whole. But listen to the reflections of Yoi Pawlowska as she views Rome in the moonlight from a roof garden:? I move to the parapet and sit on it, trying to realise all that Eome has done, all that she will yet do. I whisper her name softly, "" Roma, Roma."" She is as beautiful now as when Nero's palace crowned two of her hills. She does not age because she assimilates; all that conies to her becomes part of her, or it cannot exist, and all that belongs to her is in some ways somehow?good. ?'' Perhaps our critical faculties are dormant in great love; certainly here we like what elsewhere we should find blatant and noisy. She is great, noble, splendid. What does it matter if that with which she clothes herself is sometimes glaring to our eyes P She can never be vulgar, her personality is too great, her simplicity too childlike. She is no illusive fairy, but a-goddess carved in mountains, free to the sky; no pitiful comforter of the weak and the unfit, no friend to the moral or physical degenerate, but she thrusts a bar of steel into the hands of those who can fight. She is a friend for the strong and the young in spirit, for those who can draw strength from their dreams. In every woman's figure by Michael Angelo I see Rome, Rome always, even in the Madonna of the Pieta, where a sorrowing mother sees Hope in the death of her son. This "" Year of Strangers "" will not be exhausted by the first reading. It is not, perhaps, a book for all readers, bnt there are many who, having once read it, will return to it continually as to the companionship of a tried and trnsty friend.A YEAR OF STRANGERS. By Yoi PAWLOWSKA. Duckworth & Co. 5s. Yoi Pawlowska's name is new to the literary world, but those who read her book will not forget it. These sketches are like the music of Debussy. The simple, unaffected literary style has that intangible, undefinable quality which is in the dancing of Anna Pavlova, with the same elusiveness, the same tender, half-sad, half-loving strains in it, the same vivid colour touches. Written in an admirable English, some of the sentences have a queerly foreign twist, and this adds to, rather than detracts from the charm of the book, about which there is something infinitely pathetic, and, though there is no pathos in it, once more we realise that for every real bit of art there is, somewhere, a broken heart. Each sketch has in it a momentary lifting of the veil on the deep recesses of a soul washed white by tears; each is the work of a dreamer with the heart of a child, who has been face to face with the evils of life, and has found beauty. There is in all this an atmosphere new to literature. Many have written of their travels, but no one has written quite like this before. Here and there we find terse bits of realism; true and little understood things about men and women, written by one who has proved perhaps the biggest of all truths-that there is very little difference in the feelings of the two sexes; that men, as well as women, are often irresponsible and unpractical, even hysterical; that women, as well as men, can be true to each other, have a sense of honour and can, if needs must, stand alone; if the common want of all creatures is a love which understands everything. We have only one critical bone to pick, and this is with the proof reader, who has left the printer to his own devices in the matter of punctuation."

The Celtic Twilight will still remain, to the Saxon intelligence at any rate, as much a mystery as ever. Its men and women will remain?only men and women; the dhouls and faeries will be no more intelligible or conceivable than before. But to those who believe in Math: that is, in the Imagination before all, it is different. They soon fall under the spell; a rhyme or so, and the thing is done. And Mr. Yeats knows his art, and begins with rhyme :? 44 The host is riding from Knockoarea, And over the grave of Clooth-na-barc ; Caolte tosoing his burning hair, And Niam calling, * Away, como away ; 44 4 And brood uo more where tho fire ia bright, filling thy heart with a mortal dream ; For breasts are heaviug aud eyes a-gl?ara : Away, come away, to the dim twilight.'"" .... This invocation is only too effective. It makes one expect other ghosts, and enchantments more rare and elusive, and more mediaeval, than can possibly belong to this latter end of the Celtic twilight. On the very next page, it is true, Mr. Yeats determines his boundary explicitly in prose. But the promise of his verse is not to be gainsaid, and its effect is to make one keep hoping for all the ancient mystery of Celtic tradition, still lurking, as one half ventured to believe, in the fields and watersides of Connaught and Leinster. That, unhappily, no longer exists as it did. Only the merest fragments remain; and this book is a melancholy witness of how little that is. For Mr. Yeats makes no effort to build up these fragments; he takes them as he finds them, as they appear to him. To give his own account of himself and his book: ""Next to the desire,"" he says, ""which every artist feels, to create for himself a little world out of the beautiful, pleasant, and significant things of this marred and clumsy universe, I have desired to show in a vision something of the face of Ireland to any of my own people who care for things of this kind. I have, therefore, written down accurately and candidly much that I have heard and seen, and, except by way of commentary, nothing that I have merely imagined."" This distinction between the writer's impressions and his imaginations is worth noting, seeing how much Impressionism, as against the purely imaginative use of subjectmatter, is now in vogue. Mr. Yeats is not the only one among our younger contemporaries, perhaps, who has implied a difference between the two; but none other that I know of has elected to make it in actual practice a question betwixt prose and verse. However, like many other poets, his imEressions, though expressed in prose, will e found often to end in imaginations?even in lyrical imaginations. In some passages of the book, indeed, the reader who has known Mr. Yeats hitherto only as poet and rhymer, will be very likely to hesitate, and wonder whether this thing had not been better adapted to another vehicle: as, for instance, in the striking conclusion of his second apologue : "" When all is said and done, how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than another's truth ? For it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls, and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it, and make their sweet honey. Come into the world again, wild bees, wild bees!"" But in the main the form is excellently wellfitted to the subject-matter of the book, as in the opening chapter, which gives a characteristic account of one P<tddy Flynn. A little bright-eyed old man, he lived in a leaky and one-roomed cabin in the village of Ballisodare, which is, he was wont to say, ""the most gentle""?whereby he meant faery?"" place in the whole of County Sligo "" :? "" He was a great teller of tale j, and unlike our common romancers, knew how to empty heaven, hell and purgatory, faeryland and earth, to people his stories. He did not live in a shrunken world, but knew of no less ample circumstance than did nomer himself. Perhaps the Gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination. What is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident. And are there not moods which need heaven, hell, purgatory, and faeryland for their expression, no less than this dilapidated earth F "" Au "" impressionist,"" in the ordinary sense, it is clear, of course, as any reader of his previous books must know, Mr. Yeats could never be; and though in this book he pretends to give us impressions, rather than imaginations, of the twilight of the Gael, his natural temper of idealism is such that not one of these sketches but is constantly turning its matter of fact into matter of imagination. There is no want of humour either in the tales of the "" gentry"" or fairy people, or of the ghosts, who range so delightfully through Mr. Yeats's pages. There is an excellent set of them in a chapter on "" Village Ghosts,"" in whose doings the villagers, with true Irish philosophy, have even learnt to take a humorous pleasure. Of these ghosts, one was a wicked sea-captain, who 44 stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall, in the shape of a snipe, making the most horrible noises. He was only dislodged when the wall was broken down ; then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling."" How much more original this is than most of the ghosts in Borderland. So, too, with others who inhabit the same village of H- in Leinster, which is so well described by Mr. Yeats that we cannot resist stealing the passage: 44 History has in no manner been burdened by this ancient village, with its crooked lanes, its old abbey churchyard full of long grass, its green background of small fir-trees, and its Juay, where lie a few tarry fishing-luggers, n the annals of entomology it is well known. For a small bay lies westward a little, where he who watohes night after night may see a certain rare moth fluttering along the edge of the tide, just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn. A hundred years ago it was carried here from Italy by smugglers in a cargo of silks and laces."" There is a curious, half-ghostly fascination about this elusive moth, that makes one at once expect Mr. Yeats to turn it to account as a symbol of the tricksy spirit of Celtic lore which he pursues. But no ! singularly enough, he severely discounts both moth and moth-hunter in a way that is quite unlike him. For every poet is, in a sense, a moth-hunter; though, indeed, it is not given to many to have so rare a moth of a muse as that which haunts Mr. Yeats's Celtic twilight. Ernest Rhys."
149,B2688,['8719283'],"The Works of Henry Fielding, Esq. With a Biographical Essay by Leslie Stephen. 10 vols. (Smith, Elder & Co.) Here, in ten portly and imposing volumes, are the entire works?plays, novels, poems, essays, legal papers?of Byron's "" prose Homer of human nature."" No expense has been spared to make the edition worthy of ts matter and its subject. The type is clear nd comely; the paper is thick and brilliant; he covers, of brown buckram relieved by a >archmont label, are workmanlike and neat; dr. Small has illustrated the novels with ome forty designs, elaborately cut and reproluced as India proofs; Mr. Leslie Stepnen tas contributed an admirable introductory sssay; and the English edition is limited o a thousand copies. The change from Roscoe's penurious issue and from the culgar poverty of a cheap reprint is strikng. Fielding took rank among immortals >ven while he lived and wrought; and ime, in spite of Richardson's illiberal sharity and Johnson's honest disregard, las but strengthened his claims and improved his position. The issue of the present edition?an edition de luxe in every jen se of the term?is a kind of official recognition of the admiration which has been his portion all along. Thanks to its publishers, he has become one of the saints Df the library as well as one of the world's novelists. His canonization is complete ; the last honours have been bestowed, and his reception into the hierarchy is an accomplished fact. He need no longer be read in the blunt type and blurred pages of Murphy and Chalmers, nor in the pale ink and yellow paper of original editions, nor in the dog's-ears and meagre margins and dreadful double columns of popular reissues. The greatness now thrust upon him is at once impressive and engaging. In his new guise he appears as one of the handsomest and noblest classics in the language. With so much to praise?and justly praise ?it seems ungraceful to condemn. The edition has been projected on so opulent a scale, and is in certain ways so complete and honourable a success, that to find fault with it at all is to run the risk of appearing hypercritical, and even unjust. On reflection, however, it is impossible to reject the conclusion that the enterprise is remarkable rather for liberality and enthusiasm than for taste and judgment. To begin with, the size of the volumes raises objections, and objections that are neither to be gainsaid nor despised. Fielding is, before all things else, a writer to be studied. He wrote for the world at large, and he wrote to the end that he might be read, and read continually. His matter, his manner, the terms of his philosophy, the quality of his ideals, the nature of his achievement, proclaim him popular. Like Scott, like Cervantes, like Shakspeare, he claims not merely our acquaintance, but an intimate and abiding familiarity. He has no special public, and to be only on nodding terms with him is to be practically dead to his attraction and unworthy of his society. He worked, not for the boys and girls of an age, but for men and women of all time ; and both as an artist and as a thinker he commands unending attention and lifelong friendship. He is a great inventor, an unrivalled craftsman, a perfect master of his material. His work is the record of a lifetime of varied experience, of keen observation, of unwearying intellectual endeavour. The types he created are vigorous and sound, with an intellectual flavour peculiarly their own. His novels teem with ripe wisdom, and generous conclusions, and improving examples. He has, as Mr. Stephen remarks, ?""the undeniable merit of representing certain aspects of contemporary society with a force and accuracy not oven rivalled by any other writer."" Not to have studied him ""is to be without a knowledge of the most important documents of contemporary history."" It is evident that such a writer is not one to be skimmed and laid aside, and that it is doing his admirers doubtful service to present him in any but the handiest of forms. Now this is exactly what has come to pass in the present edition. It is sumptuous, but it is unwieldy. It is inaccessible without a reading-desk and a library chair. To peruse it is to engage in the performance of a literary solemnity. We consider it with a respectful admiration; and we think, with a mixture of envy and regret, of the ?editions of Alphonso Lemerre and the delightful bouquim produced by Jouaust at the Librairie des Bibliophiles. What was wanted was a Fielding that could be comfortably held and easily perused, and that, while an ornament to the shelf, would not on occasion have proved impossible to the pocket;?a Fielding with whom the reader might converse at odd hours of the day or night with the affectionate freedom that is his due. What has been achieved is a Fielding to be superbly bound and gilded, honoured with a prominent place in the library, and venerated for his appearance? a Fielding to be revered at a respectful distance, like a colossal Pharaoh or Mr. Addison's celebrated tragedy of ' Cato.' Another point on which we regret to find ourselves at variance with the publishers of the new Fielding is the illustrations. It is at all times difficult to understand why the library edition of a great writer should be held incomplete without pictures; and the difficulty is increased tenfold when the great writer enjoys such a position as is Henry Fielding's. In the first place it is not doubtful that if Fielding wrote for any -class of readers in particular, it was for readers who were interested in his work not as a vehicle for illustrations, but, primarily and ?essentially, as literature, and that, could we suppose him to have been consulted in the matter, he would be mortified to find that after over a hundred years of popularity his novels are held to stand in need ?of adventitious assistance. Again, 'Tom Jones,' and ' Jonathan Wild, 'and 'Amelia' have been classics for many years; we know them intimately, and we have formed as ?definite a conception of the appearance of their heroes and heroines as we have of the men and women of Shakspeare and Cervantes themselves; and it is certain that the artist who essays to improve upon our imaginings for us, or to thrust them out to make room for imaginings of his own, is doomed in advance to failure. Moreover? and this is perhaps the strongest argument of all?there is a gap between the present and that part of the past which it was Fielding's lot to represent for us, between the convention of to-day and the convention of a century and a half ago, between the age of Gladstone and the age of Walpole, that is, for all practical purposes, as impassable as Styx itself. The present is an epoch of sentiment; its ideals and ambitions are mainly emotional; what it chiefly loves is romance or the affectation of romance, passion, self-conscious solemnity, and a ertain striving after the picturesque. In fielding's time there was doubtless a food deal of sentimentality, for his geneation delighted not only in Western md Trunnion and Mrs. Slipslop, but in Pamela and Clarissa and the pathetic Lie Fevre. But for all that it was?at all wents in so far as it was interesting to Fielding and in so far as Fielding has pictured it?a generation that knew nothing )f romance, and was keenly interested in lommon sense, and took a vast deal of honest pleasure in wit and humour and a rather :ruculent type of satire. It is evident that such possibilities of sympathy and understanding as exist between a past of this sort and such a present as our own must }f necessity bo few and small. Their importance, too, is greatly diminished when we reflect on the nature and tendency 3f certain among tho essential elements of Fielding's art and mind. The most vigorous and the most individual of these is, perhaps, his irony; the next is that abundant vein of pure intellectual comedy by the presence of which his work is exalted to a place not much inferior to that of such work as the ' Tartuffe ' and the ' Ecole des Femmes.' These rare and splendid qualities are distinguishing features in the best and soundest part of Fielding's work. Of irony he is probably the greatest English master; of pure comedy ?the intellectual manipulation and transmutation of what is spiritually ridiculous in manners and society?he is, both in narrative and in dialogue, the greatest between Shakspeare and Mr. George Meredith. And with both our sympathy is, to say the least of it, imperfect in no small degree. AVe have learned to be sentimental and self-sufficient with Rousseau, to be romantic and chivalrous with Scott, to be emotional with Dickens, to take ourselves seriously with Balzac and George Eliot; there are touches of feeling in our laughter, even though the feeling be but spite; we have acquired a habit of politeness?a tradition of universal consideration and respect; and our theory of satire is rounded by the harmless generalities of Mr. Du Maurier on the one hand and the malevolent respectability of Mr. W. S. Gilbert on the other. A consequence of all this is that, in attempting the illustration of ' Tom Jones' and * Jonathan Wild,' the modern artist enters on a task for which he is indifferently prepared, and in which he can at best achieve but an imperfect success. This is what has happened to Mr. Small. He is probably as good a draughtsman for wood as the publishers could have selected; in picturing the aspects and emotions of his contemporaries he is usually successful; he has the true sentiment of black and white; his invention is varied, his design expressive and sound. Yet of the forty pictures he has contributed to the new Fielding there is hardly one that does not seem inappropriate to his matter, and that does not act as a barrier between his author and his author's readers. It is not that the illustrations are bad in themselves. On the contrary, many of them are excellent. But they have little or none of Fielding's spirit, and they are in no sense in harmony with Fielding's work. In Thackeray or in Messrs. Besant and Rice, in ' Denis Duval' or ' The Chaplain of the Fleet,' they would be well enough; in ' Amelia' and ' Joseph Andrews ' they appear misplaced, and their affect is discomforting. They have faults }f their own, as, for instance, a certain inlecision in invention, which has resulted in the production of two or three Westerns, balf a dozen Joneses, several Jonathan Wilds, and a strange variety of Amelias ind Sophias. But their chief fault is that they do not illustrate Fielding. Mr. Small has left his comedy to shift for itself, and has endowed him with picturesque and romantic qualities altogether foreign to his art and to the epoch in which it was produced. He ignores Lady Bellaston and Miss Matthews and Mrs. Ellison ; he only shows us Col. Bath as a defeated duellist, and Sergeant Atkinson in tho act of saving his master's life; to him Capt. Blifil is but a body to be carried upstairs, and Jones a slim young gentleman to be presented under the influence of violent emotion ; he has made nothing of Partridge, nothing of the Ordinary, and next to nothing of Mr. Abraham Adams; and for one picture of Lady Booby conceived in something of the right spirit he has given us half a dozen of Sophia which are merely pretty and clever and accomplished. And just as he has suppressed the element of comedy so has he exaggerated the element of incident. His picture of Joseph Andrews, stripped and abandoned, has the gloom and the terror of a design for ' Eugeno Aram'; he has drawn us three or four duels, as many bouts, at fisticuffs, and a couple of highway robberies; his sketch of Jonathan Wild picking the count's pocket might illustrate a melodrama in a Strand theatre; his presentment of Booth in prison is like a page from a modern novel in the manner of ' Oliver Twist.' His designs, in one word, are suggestive now of a Fielding who wrote for the Adelphi, and now of a Fielding who lived at Bedford Park. The impression, as may be imagined, is peculiar. To this may be added that, though fairly well engraved, they are, on the whole, ill printed. For the reproduction of such trenchant contrasts as those in which Mr. Small indulges such a medium as India paper seems improper. It is soft and spongy, and it absorbs and spreads the ink, so that an impression is often produced of vagueness and indecision. It is probable that a better effect might be obtained with ordinary plate-paper, which is hard and glossy, and permits of a great deal of clearness of outline and transparency of darks and shadows. For the selection of wood engraving in preference to etching as a means of illustration the projectors of the edition deserve a great deal of praise; and we cannot but regret that their venture should be unfortunate?as in certain ways it undoubtedly is. In addition to all this it must be admitted that the editing of the new Fielding is by no means so scholarly as was to be desired. The arrangement is entirely arbitrary ; the text, save that in ' Amelia' a few suppressed passages have been reprinted, appears to be mainly that of Arthur Murphy; of annotations and explanations, which are absolutely indispensable to a correct and complete understanding of Fielding, and which, judiciously supplied, would have gone far to make the edition final, there is not one in all the ten volumes. That these are defects, and grave ones, will readily be granted. They are blemishes, too, that were hardly to be looked for in such an elaborate publication as the present. To the absence of critical and historical annotations we have just referred ; and we shall add no more than that, in our opinion, it does away with any pretensions to finality the edition might have been supposed to possess. Scarce less noticeable are the vices of arrangement. 'Tom Jones' (1749), the author's second novel, is printed first; it is followed immediately by 'Amelia' (1751), which was his last; and this in its turn is succeeded by 'Joseph Andrews' (1742), which was his first. In tho same volume with 'Joseph Andrews' appears tho ' Journey from this World to the Next,' which first appeared in the second volume of the ' Miscellanies,' published in 1743; while the fifth volume is composed of ' Jonathan Wild,' originally printed as the third volume of the ' Miscellanies,' and of Fielding's contributions to the Champion, which appeared in 17391740, two or three years before. The sixth volumo contains, in the order specified, thirtyseven articles from the Covent Garden Journal (1752), against the twenty-six reprinted by Murphy ; the ten numbers of the True Patriot (1745) included in Murphy's edition ; the two numbers of the Jacobite's Journal (1748) republished by Murphy; the 'Philosophical Transactions' (1743); the essay 'Of the Remedy of Afflictions'; the ' Dialogue between Alexander the Great and Diogenes the Cynic,' the 'Interlude,' and the essays on ' Conversation,' 'Character,' and 'Nothing' (1743); and the ' Clear State of the Case of Elizabeth Canning' and the ' Case of Bosavern Penlez,' which appeared full ten years later. The seventh volume opens with the ' Voyage to Lisbon,' which is a posthumous publication ; passes on to the ' Charge to the Middlesex Grand Jury ' and the ' Inquiry into the Causes of the late Increase of Robbery,' which date from 1751 and 1753 respectively; and after presenting us with the early prefaces to ' David Simple' and the ' Familiar Letters,' continues withthe ' Translation of the Second Olynthiac' and the ' Poems,' included in the ' Miscellanies' in 1743, and concludes with the translation of Juvenal's Sixth Satire, which is one of Fielding's first performances. The last three volumes are devoted to the plays, and include ? very properly ? the two pieces first printed among the ' Miscellanies.' It is to be noted that the dates of production are not always given, and that the editor has very wisely prefaced each play with a statement of the cast. Where much is wanting one is apt, in the nature of things, to feel grateful for little. Of Mr. Stephen's introductory essay we can speak in terms of almost unqualified approval. It is not so hearty and cheerful as the excellent note on Fielding contributed to one of the series of 'Hours in a Library'; it repeats unquestioningly the old, old story of the Fielding portrait; it comments upon Lady Mary's estimate of Fielding and Horace Walpole's malevolent historiette as though the lady's literary weaknesses and Walpole's fondness for decorating his gossip had no existence, and were not to be taken into the writer's calculation; and it errs a little in electing to consider its hero according o the canons of modern morality, in showing i trifle more interest in the religious inluences that made him what he was than >erhaps they deserve, and in declining to give i detailed opinion about Fielding's relations vith his contemporaries, and particularly vith his innumerable posterity. But, ivhen all is said, it remains a piece of singularly good and able work, and one of svhich even its author may well be proud. lt bears in every sentence the stamp of acute intelligence and great literary tact; it is full of wit and humour, of excellent criticism, and of kindly and generous feeling; it abounds in happy phrases, and in just and pointed remarks on lifo and literature and morals. It may, without exaggeration, be described as the best and soundest estimate of Fielding that has yet appeared, in English or in any language whatsoever."
150,B9103,"['8954323', '2438135']","The Secret of an Empress. By Countess Zanardi Landi. (Cassell & Co., 16s. net.) The last of the children of the Emperor and Empress of Austria who figure in the ' Almanach de Gotha ' was born in 1868 ; but the writer of the book before us claims to be the daughter of the Empress Elizabeth, and states that she was born in 1882. She informs the public that her birth took place at a chateau in Normandy, where her mother was staying under an assumed name, but she does not know her birthday. A few weeks later she was smuggled into the house of some people in Vienna, and it was announced to the Viennese that the lady of this house had given birth to a daughter? the author of this curious memoir. It is stated in the first chapter that the Emperor "" came secretly"" to see the Empress while she was at the chateau of Sassetot in the Seine Inferieure, but that "" what passed between her and the Emperor now will never be revealed."" It is suggested that the reason why the Empress wished her child brought up without knowledge of her parentage was that the Empress did not want this last of her children to be educated at the Court, and preferred her childhood to be as different as possible from that of her other children. The book is full of mysterious references to Ludwig II. of Bavaria and to the affection of the Empress for his memory, which cannot fail to make the reader ask what it is that the author means. She is, however, studiously vague, and declines to take the public into her confidence on the most important of all points, though she indulges in hundreds of pages of trivial details about her childhood. On one occasion, after the Empress had told her that she was her real mother, she ventured to ask, "" Why were you so fond of Ludwig of Bavaria, mother ? "" She notes that the Empress "" started violently at my words, and I felt that I should have liked to bite off my foolish tongue."" But the Empress recovered her self-possession, and remarked that the question had been unexpected; that "" she would like to talk to me about him. She knew I must be bewildered, and it was time that I should be enlightened a little."" The enlightenment was "" little,"" as all that it comes to, as reported by the author, is that, in the opinion of the Empress, Ludwig II. was not mad! But the Empress brought the conversation to a close with the significant words : "" We two remain... .to mourn for him."" In the account given of the death of this Bavarian king wide variations will be noticed from all the official statements. The author's account, derived, she says, from the Empress Elizabeth, is a convenient one ; but to the public it may be incredible. That the Empress was an odd woman, that she spent a large part of her life in wandering about the world, and in living quietly where she was unrecognized, is already known to the public ; but there is much in this volume which will interest those who care for gossip, and will tell them for the first time why the Empress hid herself, and how she contrived to spend long holidays, often in the same hotel, with the child whom the Austrian Court refuses to recognize as being a member of the royal family. The author lays stress on her account of the Mayerling- tragedy, and what she calls the true solution of that mystery is that the Crown Prince Rudolph was murdered, and did not commit suicide. She believes that a party hostile to him was formed at the Court. The Crown Prince took no interest in military affairs, and he found the soldiers and the Emperor were against him. His unhappy marriage is described at length, and the way in which he became acquainted with Marie Vetsera. When she was staying with him at< Mayerling, the Emperor is said to have sent Baron Bolfrass to search the house and arrest the Crown Prince. Rudolph threatened to shoot the first man who entered the room. In a struggle the Crown Prince shot a gamekeeper, and was himself shot, as was Marie Vetsera. This is the story of*the Countess Zanardi Landi, and it is given as coming direct from the Empress Elizabeth. The author reports that, shortly before the death of the Empress, her mother promised to introduce her to the world. "" ' Should I know my father and s's'ers ? ' I asked. * Yes, of course,"" she answered. ....41 wonder how I shall get on with them ? ' ' Very well, I hope, dear. Anyhow, they will not trouble us much.' "" The author asked the Empress how she was going to "" bring her out,"" and the answer was :? '' Very simply. Th? Emperor will have to announce officially. . . .th<*t th? Empress and he have a third daught?r living, who has been educated away from th? Court, and who will be introduced on the occasion of his Jubilee. It will not make any trouble whatever. All is in order, the papers and everything. That is al' that will be neeessarv.'' After the assassination of the Empress, the author wished to get into touch with her relatives, but the lady with whom she was boarding warned her in the fol'owing words to avoid trouble :? "" Your mother and the Emperor never ne reed. Is it any wonder, then, that they went separate ways, and as far a* possible sought consolation elsewhere ?. . . . Von must keep quiet for your mother** sake, if you don't want the story in everybody's mouth."" According to the tale here told, the Empress left her child a fortune of 160.000/. She married a man for whom she did not care. The money was placed in his hands, and he at once lost it by s|>eculation. In 1906 she went with him to Canada, but parted from him in 1908, and after a series of struggles was married again? to Count Zanardi Landi. The Countess describes the legal action which she began in Vienna, and says that she refused 1? million crowns to settle it. She gives the reasons why her lawyers dropped it?reasons which are not very convincing; and says that, when they had thrown her over, she was advised that her only course was to publish this work.Books BIOGRAPHICAL THE SECRET OF AN EMPRESS. BY COUNTESS ZANARDI LANDI. (Cassell.) i6s. net. WE took up this volume not without misgiving. But that flavour of courtly rottenness which generally hangs about this class of literature is not at all pronounced here. On the contrary, the book is a protest against everything of the kind-the author is animated with all the Empress Elizabeth's hatred of restraint and conventionality. Its title, to be sure, is a ""popular"" one, and may well have been chosen with a view to appealing to snobs of every class, with a view to "" selling."" It deserves to sell. We hope it will bring all the material profit possible to those concerned, for Countess Landi is unquestionably entitled to every kind of compensation she can extract out of this world. She tells her tale with such straightforward simplicity that these pages, we think, will not fail to procure her a number of new friends. Vivid sidelights are thrown upon the manifold tragedies and absurdities of the House of Hapsburg and the fantastic ritual (there is no other word for it) which orders the life of the Austrian Court, that perverse institution overhung by the mephitic vapours of jesuitry, where the Empress may not even see her own children unless her visit is announced twenty-four hours beforehand; where everybody, up to the very head of the State, moves about like puppets in some sinister pantomime. There is a good little bit, too, about the Empress's ideas of what constitutes a ""small villa."" Mother had intended to have a small villa at Corfu, with beautiful gardens attacked to it. The cost was not meant to exceed a million pounds in English money. The merest labourer's cottage ! We would like very much to know the name of the Italian publisher who was officially hindered from printing this interesting document, and also that of the French firm which agreed to suppress it for a consideration of forty thousand francs."
151,B7231,['6827082'],"Early Days at Uppingham under Edward Thring. By An Old Boy. (Macmillan. 3s. 6d. net.) About eleven years ago a writer in "" The Times,"" in the course of an article on Imperial Federation and Colonial Policy, referring to Edward Thring, headmaster of Uppingham, remarked that his influence on English thought and feeling had been second only to that of Dr. Arnold. That is most certainly the case, and, moreover, it is good to read such direct testimony to the enormous influence for good which can be, and often is, exercised by the headmaster of a great public school. For England, Great Britain?the Empire, in fact?owes very much more than we are usually inclined to acknowledge to her headmasters. A headmaster's power for good or ill is enormous. He has under his immediate charge, during the most receptive years of their lives, some hundreds of boys, drawn, as a rule, from the best-bred, most highly cultivated and most influential families in the land. He can, if he be a man of the Arnold-Thring stamp, mould them according to his ideal of what a right-thinking, useful member of the community ought to be?not only a good man in himself, but by example and precept the disseminating cause of goodness in others. There is no human being on earth so capable of doing good to his fellows as an English public-school boy, and to his honour be it -said that in every country in the globe, civilised or uncivilised, English publicschool men are re-teaching the lessons in truth, straightforwardness, fair-dealing, word-keeping, justice and uprightness which they learned at one or other of our great public schools. Thring was headmaster of Uppingham from September 1853 to October 1887, and during these four-andthirty years he turned out rather more than a generation of gentlemen?perhaps the greatest achievement of any one man in a given time. The writer of this little book rightly says of him: "" He always behaved like a gentleman to us, and we had to do the same to him. No sneaking where Teddy was concerned."" Throughout this biographical history of the school and its master there breathes the spirit of the man transmitted through the boy, now grown man himself. No headmaster, no earnest working man, could desire a higher testimony, a more lasting monument, than the tradition of honourable life implanted in a generation of schoolboys, and by them transmitted to generations of schoolboys still unborn. The book, in itself, is well put together; there are stories of old times, quaint observances now fallen into disuse, little bits of school folk-lore interesting to old boys, and typical of the inherent conservatism of schoolboy life. Altogether, a worthy book, suggestive and cheering. The Empire can come to no serious harm whilst the traditions of Arnold and Thring still live and are handed down from father to son.

Mr. Patterson's is one of them. - From his cradle until the present day the author's life has been that of a rolling stone, and the amount of moss which it appears likely to gather until the time when it comes finally to rest is a negligible quantity. But rolling stones sometimes gather something better than moss, and we have before us an instance in the present work-full of much hard-won wisdom, offering many a glimpse into phases of humanity strange to the majority of us, and fraught with not a little pathos ever and anon. The author has throughout his life been gifted with an astonishing knack of dodging death and a no less remarkable aptitude for sitting down and composing a dozen stanzas upon the spot to celebrate the occasion. Among the many which appear in these pages we think those addressed ""to certain Critics and Improvers of 'the Mermaid ""' are perhaps the most happily conceived. Mr. Patterson's road through life, whether high or low, has been undeniably rough, and the incidents thereof he tells with uncommon freshness and force. Probably few children ever survived such a wayward and adventurous childhood, or, having survived, so thoroughly cheated the gloomy prognostications of infallible prophets. Nailmaker, miner, deep-sea fisherman, able-bodied seaman, reporter, journalist, poet-such are a few of the callings successively, and more or less sucessfully, pursued by this versatile genius. And what though his Pegasus cast a shoe now and again P The consequent lameness but serves to show that the steed is something more substantial than a fleeting vision. In this book we find presented to us the living apotheosis of the penny ""dreadful."" Here is a real boy who sees real ghosts-nay, more, feels them-runs away to sea, has hair-raising experiences in a. god-house, fights with pirates-in fact does all that the penny ""dreadful"" ascribes to the youthful genius of its pages. But the toughest proposition that our hero struck was the publishers. For some unfathomable reason those ogres refused to play the fairy godmother to Mr. Patterson's literary productions. The loss of course was theirs. As for the critics-well, one is on dangerous ground, and must tread softly, like Agag, or suffer a fate similar to that of the unfortunate monarch. At length the unpublished author learnt the fell secret, and the sun of his literary fortune rose in dewy splendour, we trust not to set for many a long day. In case the eyes of any other struggling genius should light upon these pages, we feel in duty bound to give away Mr. Patterson's little secret; and it is this: Advertise, advertise, advertiseWhether Bibles, or whiskey, or pies, Cathedrals or huts, or political lies. Remember this well, Whatever you sell, New ways to heaven Or old ways to hell, Advertise, advertise, advertise, Or you're sure to be left to the flies."

If everv rich and contented woman in the land would but read it, how wise she would become,"" said the late Mrs. Ramsay Macdonald when she first read Adelheid Popp's "" Autobiography of a W\orking Woman "" in its original German; and one of the last acts of her life was to arrange for its publication in England. The preface she was to have written in the English edition is penned by her husband, Mlr. Raamsay Macdonald, M.P.; the Volume also contains August Bebel's preface to the German edition. It is a powerful book, intensely human and convincing, unfolding its narrative in a simple, downright manner. The story shows us a little girl who has to struggle for everv bit of bread she eats-a young woman with tremendous odds against her, who has never had a fair chance to live -and finallyv we see the woman who is reaping the results of her years of self-culture and unfailing courage. Frau Popp wrote because she says "" I recognised in my lot that of hundreds and thousands of the women and girls of the working class, because I saw great social phenomena at work in what surrounded me and brought me into difficult situations."" This is a book that cannot be too widely read, and the sooner the unenlightened in those great social problems that it deals with are startled by the revelations it contains for them, the better it will be for the world."

We are not, indeed, prepared to accept without qualification the theory, said to have been established by M.

Then she says: "" This was one of the things George Eliot longed to sav. That way that (;God has of seeing us is the wav the true artist has; it is the way George Eliot herself had."" This emphatic and picturesque statement, however, does not cover the whole matter, and somewhat depreciates the value of the personal insight which Miss DLeakin has specially set herself to afford. For much of George Eliot's power comes from that half-knowledge which we derive from our own experience. As we all know, she put much of herself into Maggie Tulliver: she had faced, in her own person. many of the problems confronting Romola and Esther Lvon, (wendolen. D)orothea and Will Ladislaw. We mav learn, from this ' Early l.ife,"" how faithfully her novels reflect her deepest convictions on men and life. It proves also that, like her own heroines, she seldom depended on her own judgment, however tenaciouslv, if not dogmatically, she would pronounce upon the convictions she had acquired. At every stage of her intellectual or emotional development she confesses to an '' absolute need of some one person who should be all in all to her and to whom she should he all in all."" Probably, without George - Henry Lewes, she would never have written a novel. Each of the many religious phases through which Miss D)eakin has traced her was dlue directlv to the personal influences. As Mliss NMeynell expresses it, in each case the apostolic man becomes the woman's conscience.' Such chances, it will be remembered, were at an end before the publication of her first novel-in her thirty-ninth year. She had then settled (town into a broad humanitarianism, subscribing to no definite creed, but convinced "" of the efficacy th.it lies in all sincere faith and the spiritual blight that comes with no faith."" Miss Mlevnell, i n d e e d, defines her ethical code as "" uncom- promisingly Christian ' and ' verv hard."" admitting no possibility of "" compromise or dispensation the code of a woman who in her own conulict of life has broken all the pledges made and implied for her by her parentage. kin, and educlation."" On the personal aspect of this question Miss Deakin reveals more sy impathetic generositt, greater subtlety, andi -in our opinion --more justice. She en(leavours to show that (;eorge Eliot never put greater value on the restrictioins of conventionality than when she broke them. In her opinion only exceptional circunimtances, like her own, coiuld maake reeltlion permissible. She never resented "" the qluick condemination ' of public opinion, however much the mistinderstanding of friends hurt her. Privately she held herself justified and never regarded the teaching of her novels as an atonement. Thev upheld what she had always believed ; what, in her own heart, she felt she had practised. Miss Deakin has justified her contention by reliable evidence, perhaps the most valuable part of her work. She also tells us how early in life George Eliot was puzzled by finding that ""glory was an attendant on luck instead of on goodness 9; and that, like Maggie Tulliver, "" at a very early age she got the idea into her head that she would become a person of importance in the world."" We find her accepting a "" compromise "" with her father on the trying question of religious observances; and are assured that, however autobiographical or reminiscent, her books contained no actual portraits from real life. There is, too, an interesting passage about the "" tidiness "" of her writing, which recalls Mrs. Poyser's dairy; a quality evincing selfdiscipline and conscientiousness, not entirely congenial to the highest art. Yet surely it is as an artist that George Eliot will live; by her characterization, her insight and her wit; her genius for dialogue, invention, and narrative. She has given us a glorious gallery of full-length portraits; increasing the number of our intimate friends; and, through them, the problems of life which have an endless fascination for all who care to think. In that sense her work remains, as Dr. Herford puts it, "" a great and still unexhausted literary and ethical force."" Miss Deakin could not give us too much detail in illustration of her personality and her powers, though only the serious student will wish to follow so closely her various incursions into philosophy. It is not as a thinker that we value George Eliot to-day. The quotations, and deductions, from her letters and journals are most welcome: we could willingly have been spared some of her essays and reviews. R. BRIMLEY JOHNSON."
155,B19,['8848414'],"1 The Promised Land. From the Danish of | Henrik Pontoppidan by Mrs. Edgar Lucas. (Dent & Co.)?We are glad to notice that Henrik Pontoppidan is gradually becoming known among us. It is now six years since the publication of 4 The Apothecary's Daughters,' the first of his works, we believe, that was ever translated into English, and Messrs. Dent have just brought out adequate English versions of 4 Muld' and its sequel, now before us, 4 Det Forjrettede Land.' Pontoppidan possesses many of the qualities which should make him popular with all classes of the English public. His art is cheerful, sane, and healthy ; he is a genuine humourist, with a keen eye, but also an indulgent smile, for the foibles of his fellows; and his simple, concise, and pregnant style, pointed with light irony and graceful satire, reminding one occasionally of Guy de Maupassant, especially in his shorter stories, is that of the true raconteur. The present novel, as already mentioned, is the sequel to 4Muld,' also translated by Mrs. Edgar Lucas under the title of * Emanuel ; or, Children of the Soil.' The 44children of the soil"" are, of course, the peasants, and Emanuel is an enthusiastic young parson who, in order to realize his Socialistic ideals, deliberately turns his back on all that wealth and culture can offer him, takes a peasant girl to wife, and settles down among the country-folk as one of themselves. ' The Promised Land' is the pathetic story of his gradual disenchantment and somewhat shamefaced return to civilization sacrificing in the process the noble wife of whom he is not worthy. It is an exceedingly clever study of the most diverse types of character, standing out against a vivid and convincing background of Danish village life and village politics. The parson himself, his muchenduring wife, his children, his self-seeking and unstable flock, to whom he sacrifices in vain seven of the best years of his life, and his aristocratic friends, who ultimately reclaim him, supply excellent entertainment. The translator has, on the whole, done her work well. Downright blunders are creditably few, but her sentences are occasionally (e. g., on pp. 151 and 195) clumsy and involved, faults of style which Herr Pontoppidan himself is absolutely incapable of committing. The book is prettily illustrated by Nelly Erichsen."

The writing of popular books on the fascinating women of history has long been a French fashion. Fifty years ago and more, while we waere still modest and early Victorian, authors like Capefiguc and Lescure had created a whole library of works dealing with the lives of the favourites of kings. Now such works, it seems, can scarcely come fast enough from English printing presses. Madame de Maintenon is, of course, one of the ladies to be dealt with, but while the interest of many of these beauties is wholly or mainly scandalous, Louis XIV. 's wife has other and more venerable characteristics. Her present biographer, indeed, is extremely anxious to explain that she was not scandalous at all. She was far from the"" narrow, coldhearted woman"" and "" successful adventuress "" of ultra-Protestant historians. She has been blamed for the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, but the most that can be laid to her charge is that she did not use her great influence to stop the atrocities which followed that abominable decree. Much good is certainly to be accounted un-to her. A genuinely pious woman, it was her ambition to wean Louis from that attitude towards her sex wvhich resulted in the illicit splendours of Louise de la Valliv're and Madame de Alontespan. But her greatest work w-as the foundation of that college for the orphan daughters of nobles and officers of wvhich Boileau said : "" If any gentleman should venture to speak wvith detraction of Madamne de AMaintenon, his name ought to be erased from the Roll of the Nobility, so base would be his ingratitude after the great benefits her foundation has conferred on his class."" Mr. Dyson has written an interesting account of the long 'life of the foundress of St. Cvr: as a needv child, as wife to the brilliant, crooked Scarron. as gouvernante to Madame de Montespan's children, as the King's wife and councillor. His facts, however, which have been collected with great industry, might have been a little better digested. His proo)fs, too, might haive been read a little more carefully. Bossuet is called B)ssnet three times in two pages. Tll origin of "" God save the King,"" as stated on the last palge. is surely inaccurate.MADAME DE MAINTENON, by Maud Cruttwell. Dent. 15s. net. Miss Cruttwell, already known for her carful and scholarly studies in French history and memoirs, has produced a handsome, exhaustive and extremely welldocumented account of the most outstanding figure in a brilliant Court. Madame de Maintenon in her lifetime was an enigma to her contemporaries. Pursued by envy and scandal, traduced by her enmies and by her biographers, she went on her way reserved, dignified, untroubled. ""Devoted to God and to her King,"" she who had endured poverty and ignominy in her youth, scorned either wealth or advanement, if they were to be purchased as the wages of personal sin or by stooping to disloyalty. Yet an enigma she remains. ""Very simple, very straightforward, Wqemely charitable; a saint, whose sole ambitions were to convert her King and alleviate the misery caused by his wars,"" D her latest biographer sums her up. Yet tis "" Saint "" accepted the position of p~fo ante to the King's bastards, complait companion to his mistress, and Tuirator of silence to safeguard that mistress's frailty and its results from a jealous and outraged husband. Autres temp, autres mocursl We should now-a-days want other evidences of sainthood. But it is indisputable that, as Louis' Egeria, she induced him to show decency to his discarded mistress and humanity to his neglected wife, and that when, after the death of the Queen, she consented to take the place of both, she refused to do it without the sanction of marriage. And so great was her loyalty that she accepted, almost without complaint, the secrecy and consequent slights of an equivocal position for thirty years and scrupulously destroyed every scrap of evidence, which would have proved her right to the privileges of the King's wife. Though Miss Cruttwell's book begins slowly and looks a little difficult of attack, no one who perseveres beyond the first fifty pages will fail to follow to the end her absorbing story. JANzT E.

There are few more pathetic figures than that of Christian, few portraits painted with greater perfection of style. How simply, yet perfectly, the story opens?"" As I walked through the wilderness of this world, I lighted on a certain place where was a den, and laid me down in that place to sleep; and, as I slept, I dreamed a dream. I dreamed, and, behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he? wept and trembled; and not being able longer to contain, he brake out with * lamentable cry, saying, ' What shall I do ?'"" Is not this the perfection of simplicity 1 It may seem unnecessary to write thus of "" The Pilgrim's Progress,"" but is it not one of the great unread books of the world 1 To illustrate a masterpiece is always a task of supreme difficulty, artist and author must be strangely in mental accord if success is to be attained. So far we have seen no finer illustrations of "" The Pilgrim's Progress "" than those of C. H.

The same epithets may justly be applied to most of the plates, particularly to those of "" Christian before Discretion,"" "" The Jury,"" "" Hill Error,"" and "" Feeble and Ready-to-Halt Bring Up The Rear ""; but to make choice of very good out of so many excellences is scarcely fair.

The tragedy that ended in the murder of Count Paul Kamarowsky in September, 1907, seems more in keeping with the Court of the Borgias than with the Venice of our own day. Though the idea of retelling the story came from Prof. Rossi, the chief medical expert for the defence, who has made a life-study of the relations between criminal impulse and morbid physical condition in women, this is no scientific treatise. Mrs. Chartres has heard the details from the lips of the Countess Tarnowska herself, to whose notes, written in prison before the trial, she has also had access, and, "" moved by the puissant influence of art,"" she tells her tale with a power and a vividness that cannot fail to impress her readers. A letter from the prisoner, authorizing the publication of the narrative, is included in the volume. It is clear from her family history and from other detaite given here that the Countess Tarnowska can never have been a normal woman, and the life into which she was plunged on her marriage when a mere girl to the man of her choice obviously reacted with fatal effect on the morbid strain in her. But how far her physical condition may be considered to free her from moral responsibility is another question. An Italian court, which is always inclined to be indulgent towards her sex, unhesitatingly gave its verdict against her. Even in Mrs. Chartres's narrative it is difficult to sympathize with her in many of the crises of her existence. Who, for instance, could well blame her husband for shooting her lover as he did. in a country where duelling is still in fashion, after the provocation he had received ? Prilukov does not appear as a pleasant character, yet he owed his ruin to the influence the Countess exercised on every man who came into her power. For Count Kamarowsky, the one good man who entered her life, she seems at times to have felt a positive aversion, according to her own account, so different was he from the others to whom she was accustomed. The picture of this unhappy woman, pursuing her weary course from hotel to hotel, with her boy and her faithful maid, accompanied by the Count, to whom she was now engaged, yet shadowed all the time by the evil spirit of her former lover, Prilukov, is tragic in the extreme. The motives which a woman of this sort may discover for a crime after the event are notoriously untrustworthy, and it is impossible to put from one's mind the pecuniary advantages she was to gain by the murder. But her statement that she believed the recovery of her boy from a serious illness to be due to her swearing to fulfil the oath she had taken upon his life to murder Kamarowsky, though she had already induced Prilukov to release her from it, is certainly worth attention."

We return to the deformed gentleman, into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until Death opened the door,?that we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room, and the Professor's speculations on the same. These, if not wholly new, are neatly put, and give a fair idea of Dr, Holmes when he is bent on philosophizing :? "" I have never yet crossed the threshold of the Little Gentleman's chamber. How he lives when he once gets within it, I can only guess. His horns are late, as I have said ; often, on waking late in the night, I see the light through cracks in his window-shutters on the wall of the house opposite. If the times of witchcraft were not over, I should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises. Sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor, that makes me shiver to hear it,?it sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then. Occasionally I hear very sweet BtTains of music,?whether of a wind or stringed instrument, or a human voice, strange as it may seem, I have often tried to find out, but through the partition I could not be quite sure. If I have not heard a woman cry and moan, and then again laugh as though she would die laughing, I have heard sounds so like them that?I am a fool to confess it?I have covered my head with the bedclothes; for I have had a fancy in my dreams, that I could hardly shake off when I woke up, about that so-called witch that was bia great-grandmother, or whatever it was,?a sort of fancy that she visited the Little Gentleman, ? a young woman in old-fashioned dress, with a red ring round her white neck,?not a necklace, but a dull stain. Of course you don't suppose that I have any foolish superstitions about the matter,?I, the Professor, who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any man's bead! It is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies. A man not only believes, but knows he runs a risk, whenever he steps into a railroad car; but it doesn't worry him much. On the other hand, carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary country-village, and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago, and there are rumours of ugly spots on the walls,-the old man hung himself in the garret, that is certain, and ever Bincethe country-people have called it' the haunted house,'? the owners haven't been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noises,?so it has fallen into sad decay, and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof, and the clap-boards have turned black, and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear, and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shaking,-take the man who didn't mind the real risk of the cars to that old house, on some dreary November evening, and ask him to sleep there alone,?how do you think he will like it? He doesn't believe one word of ghosts,?but then he knows that, whether waking or sleeping, his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images. It is not what we believe, as I said before, that frightens us commonly, but what we conceive. A principle that reaches a good way, if I am not mistaken."" Here are some verses out of the book of "" Iris,"" which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic:? UNDER THE VIOLETS. Her hands are cold; her face is white; No more her pulses come and go; Her eyes arc shut to life and light;? Fold the white vesture, snow on snow, And lay her where the violets blow. But not beneath a graven stone, To plead for tears with alien eyes; A slender cross of wood alone Bhall say, that here a maiden lies In peace beneath the peaceful skies. And gray old trees of hugest limb Shall wheel their circling shadows round To make the scorching sunlight dim That drinks the greenness from the ground, And drop their dead leaves on her mound. When o'er their boughs the squirrels run. And through their leaves the robins call. And, ripening in the autumn sun, The acorns and the chestnuts fall, Doubt not that she will heed them all. For her the morning choir shall sing Its matins from the branches high, And every minstrel-voice of spring That trills beneath the April sky, Shall greet her with its earliest cry. When, turning round their dial-track, Eastward the lengthening shadows pass, Her little mourners, clad in black, The crickets, sliding through the grass, Shall pipe for her an evening mau. At last the rootlets of the trees Shall And the prison where she lies, And bear the buried dust they seize In leaves and blossoms to the skies. So may the soul that warmed it rise! If any, born of kindlier blood, Should ask, What maiden lies below? Say only this: A tender bud, That tried to blossom in the snow, Lie3 withered where the violets blow. A fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round tho breakfast - table of the Transatlantic Mrs. Todgers, or to reveal what untied the knot, and cleared up the mysteries of the boarding-house. The book will not be read for its narrative; but it may be taken up again and again, and its pages paused over, for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain. Mr. Prentice is a humorist of a different kind from Dr. Holmes. He is a painfully diffident American editor, one of a class distinguished for their modesty. For something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers; living thus before the public in the columns of those journals. He has collected them all?to forestall others in doing so,?not because he thinks such collections praiseworthy, at least by other men. Some of them, he says, made the Louisville Journal famous, or at any rate notorious; and were exceedingly offensive to individuals, whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature. One merit of the collection in Mr. Prentice's eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own,? original, ? representing the editor himself. Thus he embalms, as it were, some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity. American museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the Yankee Yorick, or lend it out to evening parties, as was done with that of George Frederick Cooke; but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of Prentice's head and its contents, when he was young. Of the more youthful head, with its quips and sharp sayings, PrenticeYorick is manifestly proud, albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing. The world had its Menagiana after the wit was dead, and half a hundred other Anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed. Now-a-days, the initiation has been made in the States for a man to read his own Ana, set up his own statue, chiselled by himself, burn incense to and under his own nose, and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic Figaro, "" Que les gens d'esprit sont betes I"" In all the Anas hitherto published, the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine. The flashes are those of a thunder-cloud; the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning, ? spontaneous; bright effects of natural causes,?words that burn, titterings among contending wits, where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains, and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest. Not of these are the Prentice sayings. They were composed or invented by elaborate process, ?the joke not being the consequent ot' a pre- cedent, but this latter being made for the sake of the former. Thus Mr. Prentice gives us, frequently, only bottled lightning. He maintains, nevertheless, with all the pertinacity of Dennis, that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august Louisville Olympus. "" To express a thought, or a fancy, or a conceit moro conveniently,"" says the trans-oceanic joker of jokes, ""I have put the words into the form of a dialogue, purporting sometimes to be between two politicians, sometimes a man and his wife; but such paragraphs are not less my own, nor less original, than the rest."" Mr. Prentice's own description will thus best characterize the manner of his wit. Give him his time?only let him think?and at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible, if you will only have patience ! This process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent; and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve "" his 'prentice han'"" in this respect, we cannot do better than refer him to the ""Guepes"" of M. Alphonso Karr. Bad, however, as some of these jokes are, that same ""'prentice han'"" is not altogether unskilful?though thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master. The following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work, and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith. Here are half-a-dozen of the smart things whichthe author deems worthy of handing down to posterity:? "" The editor of the-asks if he shall write our life. Exactly as he pleases. Perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura, as iu living such a one as his own."" "" The Louisville Democrat announces the melancholy fact that Gen. Cass has been slain ' by the jawbone of an ass.' Does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death?"" '' A lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses, but she shouldn't break the peace."" "" The earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman; and yet, at one season, he always harrows her bosom, and at another plucks her ears.*' "" An editor in the West boasts that his enemies will find him ' a young David.' Very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaim?Goliar."" ""Several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of Mt. Vernon. Ah, ye miscreants, the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon Washington's.'' "" We know a beautiful girl, who would prove a capital speculation for a fortune-hunter of the right sort. Her voice is of silver, her hair of gold, her teeth of pearl, her cheeks of rubies, and her eyes of diamonds."" The playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality ; for instance :? "" Yesterday the junior editor of the Democrat called upon the senior editor of the Journal to welcome him back to Kentucky. The senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chair?full grown, minus two legs?to sit in ! To sit in! To tumble out of! which he did without an effort. No bones broken, andmatters compromised.?Louisville Democrat. Well, you and the chair had four legs between you, which certainly should have been enough to stand upon. If you insist that we gave you the fall, you must at least admit, in justice to our magnanimity, that we didn't hit you after you were down."" These folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling:? "" The editor of the New Hampshire Patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives. Ah, yes; but, when he dies, will not the fat be all in the fire!"" ""The editor of the-says he almost scorns to deny our charges, 'they are so utterly ground- less.' We believe he generally scorns to deny ' groundless' charges. He prefers confining hima^f to the denial of true ones."" "" The editor of the SouUiern Democrat wants to know what makes us so smart. If we are smart,, it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid ?cant help it."" ""A democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down. No doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well."" The subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented joke,?where there is a lack of truth as well as of wit:? ""An English paper says that a superbly oma* mented whip was one of the presents made to the Princess Royal of England on her late wedding-day. We are not told whether the bridegroom, upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride, looked scared or not. The richest part of the whip was the butt?so we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either."" There are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the Republican wit for the unchivalrous Irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour. Here are some of them:? ""John Mitchel says, in his Southern Ciiizen,thsX this country ' needs a rattling war.' She certainly does not need any more rattling Irishmen."" ""John Mitchel, the Irishman, is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the Hon. John Bell in the U.S. Senate. He is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with Macbeth, 'stop that dreadful Bell.'"" We thought the quotation was from 'Othello'; but they have probably a new Shakspeare in Louisville. The sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words. Again:? "" John Mitchel, who made his escape from Botany Bay, should remember that wheu he abuse* fugitive slaves, he abuses himself."" "" John Mitchel is by this time in Europe. We are rid of him. If he could have had his way, we should Ijave been rid by him."" The ladies, of course, come in for a large share of our wit's notice :? "" The more our ladies practise walking, the more graceful they become in their movements. Those ladies acquire the best carriage who don't ride ia one."" ""A graceful correction.?'The proper study of mankind is woman'?Punch. Woman is certainly wonderfully constructed; we have always loved to study her and get her by heart. Our first lessons were delightful, but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive."" ""A Kentucky editor says that among other presents, the ladies have sometimes given us scissors. Oh, yes, some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors, accompanying the gift with the old motto?' we part to meet again.' Let those beware who, like our ugly neighbour, would come between."" "" A Miss Way advertises that she will debate woman's rights with a Kentucky lawyer in that city, after which she will make a grand balloon ascension from Congo Square.?Exchange. Does she propose to take the Kentucky lawyer up with her? Or does she mean to throw him sky high in the argument and then go up after him in her balloon?"" ""Brigham Young says, in one of his late manifestoes, that' the great resources of Utah are her women.' It is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi* resources."" The last of the half-dozen, and the concluding maxim in the book, may be profitably read on both sides of the water:? "" Oftentimes the ' fastest' young women an th* most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption."" With these specimens of the Prenticeana, our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean, and how it is appreciated by the maker of it. We will only add, that he has annexed a very great number of "" Joe's,"" committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general, ready to take all that is worth having, and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employers.The Poet of the Breakfast Table. SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1872. LITERATURE By Oliver Wendell Holmes. (Routledge & Sons.) We have had the Autocrat and the Professor, and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the Poet, and again instructs the world, and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour. We cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded. It would have been as well, perhaps, to have ended by a grand display of fireworks; but the Poet, like the Autocrat and Professor, has his own way with his own means, and ends tranquilly. The Breakfast-Table Series is now complete. Its fault is its extreme length. The Poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closely-printed pages of prose and verse. If he leaves pleasant memories, they are also somewhat confused. ""Ne quid nimis"" is as useful a maxim as ""Pas trop de zele."" The Poet gives us too much of one thing; and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely, that such excess is good for nothing, he leaves, with his memories of pleasure, sensations of fatigue. There are fourteen persons at the Breakfast Table. The opposite ends are occupied by the Landlady and the Capitalist. On one side are the Poet, the Scarabee (a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined), a Man of Letters, a Master of Arts, a Young Girl (who writes stories for periodicals, and who is called Scheherazade), and ""the Lady."" On the other side are Dr. B. Franklin (no connexion with the older owner of the name), the Astronomer, the Member of the Haouse (as the Legislator calls himself), the Registrarof Deeds, the Salesman, and That Boy. The last-named is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community. He turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted; though, perhaps not so often as he is wanted, and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden pop-gun when people are getting prosy, which, whether it gives forth only a report, or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull, is entertaining and neverintrusive ?quite the contrary. In this company, the Poet speaks as he likes, and makes his companions speak after the same fashion?that is to say, after his own humour, and not according to their own natures. They are, however, not out of character ; but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself, he is, of course, not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries. The Poet, nevertheless, is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings, and with doings to match. The following are among very numerous examples :?"" It ain't just the thing to grease your ex with the ile of vitriol; the wheel of progress will soon stick fast, if you do."" Again : "" It is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle. Cotton Mather was miserable all his days, I am afraid, after that entry in his diary, ' This day, Dr. Sewele was chosen President, for his piety.1"" We may observe, by the way, that there are two prejudices which seem immortal. Americans believe that there are no hs in England, and Frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs ! However, we could match the good-looking Landlady of the Poet's boarding-house, from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out, ""with an unmistakable expression, conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood, to the effect that while there is life there is hope.'' The daughter of this lady is quaintly said ""to have married well to a member of th*3 postmedical profession, that, namely, which deals with the mortal frame, after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave."" Among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the Order of Things, and who remarks, "" I hope to do some sound thinking in Heaven,?if I ever get there !"" Fanciful, too, is the division of one-story, two-story, and three-story intellects. The first is described as a fact-collector, and nothing more; the twostory men are those who compare, generalize,? and reason; but the three-story individuals are men of imagination, and are far-sighted. They have skylights over their miuds, through which illumination reaches them from Heaven. The ground-floor men have only stores of books, and cannot be said to know how to use ?further than lending?them. We approve of the Old Master's criticism on returning from a concert, although it seems to have been borrowed. ""I don't like your chopped music, any way. That woman, ?she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societies?Florence Nightingale, ?says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks, and the music you jpow/ieZ out isn't. Not that exactly, but something like it. I have been to hear some music pounding."" After describing the concert, with much humour, he adds:?"" 'I like to hear a woman sing, and I like to hear a fiddle sing, but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvils!?don't talk to me, I know the difference between a bull-frog and a wood-thrush, and?' Pop! went a small piece of artillery. . . . That Boy was in his seat, looking demure enough!"" The Master refers to a ""line of anxious and conscientious effort, which I saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us; the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our Great Organ,?that Himalayan home of Harmony which you are to see and then die, if you don't live where you can see and hear it often."" There is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests; namely, "" I thank God that a great many people believe a great deal more than I do. I think, when it comes to serious matters, I like those who believe more than I do better than those who believe less."" There is no doubt that this is a general feeling. We endorse the sentiment, as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words : "" It is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs, if he does it so that others may make anything out of it. If he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists, he may as well let it alone."" In quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the Breakfast Table, we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water. Nevertheless, the smoothness, polish, and cleanliness of the pebble, after all, indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly, and that it may be good to taste now and then, but not altogether to drink by pailfuls, or to live upon, to the exclusion of other liquids. The character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the Young Girl, who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper, the Weekly Bucket, ""which has no bottom, and it is her business to fill it."" The poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions, passions, mysteries, plots, and graces of style, in stories always ending and always beginning, for the wages of a maid-of-all-work, and no recognition or thanks from the public :? "" Poor little body! poor little mind ! poor little soul! She ia one of that great company of delicate, intelligent, emotional young creatures who are waiting, like that sail I spoke of, for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms, ?love, the right of every woman,... and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench, a chain to fasten them to it, and a heavy oar to pull day and night."" The Poet thinks the toiling Scheherazade of the Weekly Bucket never had a lover, "" or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion "" as she does in a ""fantasia"" from a story of hers, 'The SunWorshipper's Daughter,' which she wrote for the Bucket. Here is a sample :? Kiss mine eyelids, beauteous Morn, Blushing into life newborn ; Lend me violets for my hair, And thy russet robe to wear, And thy ring of rosiest hue Set in drops of diamond dew ! Kiss my lips, thou Lord of Light, Kips my lips, a soft Good Night: Westward sinks thy golden car, . Leave me but the evening star, And my solace that shall be, Borrowing all its light from thee ! We may now rise from the Breakfast Table, leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at that well-furnished board."
161,B1165,['4692800'],"n-* Boyne Water, a Talc by te O'1!Ha Famity. a .. 3 vols. 12mo.-Anotber tale of the Waely school,- Mth . ft W'erly school, with Jreland for the 5CC""' and Ireland's History for the subject. Sated as we have been with Scottish story, we are quite ready to turn to the records of another country, and Ireland as well as, or better than any other. She furnishes materials in abundance. She has been oppressed for ages, and her oppressors have been her historians. She is Catholic, and we have her story told by protestants. misrepresentations inevitably followed, and prejudices have now rooted in the hearts of successive generations. It is high time to hear the other side freely and fully; and no way half so effective, as the medium of tales: for nothing else, now-a-days, gets regarded. The writer of the tale before us is well qualified to play the part of national historian under the guise of the national novelist. Ile knows the country and its history, and is deeply stung with a sense of that country~' injuries. He wants nothing but a little more resolution to cut away superfluities, and a little more address in conduicting us at once medias in res. He is too fond of surprises; he attempts, by crowding incidents, to give that life and reality which would be better accomplished by lopping off the incumbrances of minor ones; and the flow of his language is too frequently checked by breaks and parentheses; but these are curable defects. He has the stuff and staple of a good narrator in him; when he comes to the action, and warms in the business of his tale, he is vivid and vigorous; scenes of bustle and confusion rouse his best energies, and his powers of description, mental, moral and natural. are of no ordinary cast. Historical novelists, at least, those of any value, have an object, distinct from the tale. That of the author of the Scotch novels is sufficiently obvious, and the views of the writer of the Boyne Water are equally conspicuous. He regards the struggle of the Revolution as one of religious parties. He gives James credit for moderation; and believes he had no other view in any of his attempts than to rescue Catholics from their oppressions, and to establish general toleration. Of course the Revolution itself was gratuitous. On the other hand, he considers William to have been influenced by the same views, but overborne by the fears and bigotries of the protestant clergy. Of the latter there can be little question; but quite as little, we think that James, whatever were his private wishes, never would have been sutf fered to stop at all short of the re-establishment of Catholic superiority. The main object of the novel is to give a representation of the state of Ireland from James's abdication, as his expulsion is still curiously phrased, to the Treaty of Limerick; though the tale commences with his accession just to give the author an Opportunity of exhibiting the feelings of expectation, which that event excited among all parti.e To the principat characters of I the tale, we are introduced on their way from Belfast to Cushindoll, a village on the north-east coast. The travellers consist of Evelyn and his sister, both very young, ver handsome and very amiable, in the style of those, who are destined to figure in "" modern story,"" with their guardians and attendants, of whom, in our brief sketch, we shall have no occasion to speak. In crossing the hills, the topography of which is very elaborately described, extraordinary difficulties are encountered-roads were not Macadamized in those days-and to fill up the measure of their alarms and embarrassments, a tremendous storm-a tornado, such an one as is now never seen without the tropics, overtakes them. A sweeping dispersion ensues, one falls to the earth, another performs a series of somersets down the hills, and Miss Evelyn is luckily rescued from destruction-her frightened jennet backing to the very edge of a precipice-7by the critical appearance and fearless energies of a young gentleman and lady. These young natives of the hills, a brother and sister, prove to be persons of most surprising excellence, vigorous and resolute, as the mountaineers of romance are of course entitled to be. To the house of their parent, a ruined chieftain of the clan McDonnel, the young Evelyn and the party are finally carried for shelter. Intimacy soon grows up among the young people, and they are speedily betrothed to each other. Out of these sudden engagements spring the subsequent interests and perplexities of the tale-the McDonnels being Catho_ lies, and the Evelyns Protestants. Evelyn just to give him time to reach his majority, is dispatched to the West-Indies for a couple of years, and returns to Ireland to consummate his marriage with Eva McDonnel, at the period when every body was in a state of excitement respecting the invasion of William. M~cDonnel meets his friend on landing at Carrickfergus, aid in a few hours, each of them, unknown to the other, is enlisted on opposite sides. Evelyn is encountered by George Walker, the well known defender of Derry, and, by the urgency of that wily agitator, is engaged to take part in the approaching struggle; and at the same moment the Jesuit O'Haggerty presents McDonnel with a commission of dragoons in the service of James. Walker labours hard to break off the match with the Catholic Eva, and at last exacts a promise to be summoned to the nuptials. On the day of the double marriage, the ceremony, delayed by the non-arival of Walker, at length proceeds, and Eva and Evelyn are coupled by the Catholic Priest; but just as the second ceremony is commencing, strange noises are heard, and a furious gust of wind extinguishes most of the lights, and in rushes Walker, declaring the marriage illegal, and announcing the landing in England of William the deliverer. Confusion follows, the ceremony suspends; Walker calls upon Evelyn, and O'Haggerty upon McDonnel to fulfil their respective engagements, and sacrifice their private wishes to public duties. Each is surprised by the discovery of the other's engagement; sitspicion spring up in the breast of each; their passions kindle; high words follow, and brides and bridegrooms separate. Impelled by Walker, Evelyn joins the Ulster Union and accepts a commission in William's name; but before joining the troops, he conducts his distressed sister to her friends at Derry, and proceeds himself to look after his family estate on the Lough Neagh. On advancing up the avenue, he perceives unusual stirrings in the house, and while hastening forward to ascertain the cause, lie strikes against the legs of his own servant dangling from a tree. Alarmed and retiring, his retreat is instantly cut off on all sides by armed men, who force him to go forward to the house, which he now discovers to be in the full possession of a party of Rapparees. He receives a very hearty welcome from them to his own home, and is hospitably entertained by them with a supper provided from his own stores, and by his own cook. The feast is suddenly interrupted by the intelligence of an enemy at hand. Up starts the party; measures are instantly taken for defense, and the commander places a guard over Evelyn with orders to shoot him. on the spot, should the invaders prevail. These invaders prove to be Evelyn's friends headed by Walker. The Rapparees were defeated, 'and Evelyn was rescued from his fate, by the artifice of a young lass, who had taken a fancy to him, and threw some water on the lock of the Guard's pistol, which was thus snapped at him in vain. Evelyn now joined the forces under Lord Mount Alexander, and was wounded in the first battle fought at Dromore on the retreat from Newry, and left bleeding on the field. On recovering his senses, he seizes a stray horse, and sets out for the north. Beyond Carrickfergus, the Redshanks, Lord Antrim's dragoons, a troop of which McDonnel commanded, were scouring the country, and lhe quickly found himself pursued. His horse failing, he betook himself to his legs, and after flying across we know not how many hills and dales, and endeavouring, to descend a steep declivity, he sunk at last exhausted in a hole of the rock, till his pursuers came up with him, at the first of whom he dis. charged a pistol. It was McDonnel himself. No harm was done; they recognize each other, and a reconciliation follows. He refuses to take Evelyn prisoner, in spite of the sulky remonstrances of his men; but dismissing them to the next town, himsclf, to the neglect apparently of his military duties, engages to Eonthllet h; &..~~~! - - I * L4L-1JZ friend to a place of safety. T'his, hoevesr, is not so easily aecoml)lis'ed. Prodigious diffieultwis are encountered, a most painful and laborious succession of elimubgi id slippings and escapes. By the wq t is a vast deal too much of diffia. if this kind; the realities are intoe*, enough, but the descriptions are s momt so. By-and-bye, however, Eva m them, and Evelyn and his bride ""explyn... All are now proceeding very hkarmoniou together, when suddenly a party of Ulsgi dragoons come upon them, and McDow is instantly taken prisoner, but placed Aid the charge of his friend. Eva now gees to her friends, and Evelyn, with McDound on parole, proceeds to Derry to visit his sin ter, and McDonnel and Miss Evelyn SWh of course come again to a perfect under. standing. The memorable siege had already orn. menced, and Evelyn takes an active pm in the defence under Walker, whose cleo racter is here ably developed; a singular union of energy, craft, and fanaticism. The whole progress of the siege, to the final relief by the arrival of Kirke, is faith. fiully and vigorously detailed, and presents many a striking picture of the miseries sus. tained by that devoted city fromn the can. nonadingy without, and the famine within; with the unresisting submission of the citi. zens and Walker and his few energetic apprentice-boys. In the course of the siege an attempt is again made to celebrate the marriage between McDonnel and Evelyn's sister, which is again interrupted by the mysterious agency of a wild Irishwomn, possessed of something like the attributes of omniscience and ubiquity; and the poor girl at last dies from the combined effects of fright, famine and fever. On the raising of the siege, the McDlon nels and Evelyn, being again all together, and passes and protections obtained, they proceed towards old McDonnel's. ButbY this time, Schomberg had landed 2O000 men, and Kirke had set out to join him to' wards the south. Old McDonnel's unluckily lay in his way; and there was danger, let he should be beforehand with them. They speeded, therefore, with all their migh1 and in the deepest anxiety-all too late. Kirke and his troops had just quitted the smoking ruins, and the followers of the deA were hanging on the trees by dozens. TIe shrieks of poor Eva over the dead'body of her father, bring Kirke and his fellov sljk again; Evelyn presents the protections fov his companions in vain. At the moment Of imminent peril, a party of Rapparees cowe suddenly upon them; a skirmish ensue; Evelyn is cut down, and on waking to life agrain, finds his head resting on the lap of I young woman, whrom he recognizes to be the same, who had before saved his life, Ad who now informs him that McDonnel bid perished, and Eva was carried off by KirkC The recollection of Kirke's well-knT1O character threw him into a storm of bh* ror, and he makes desperate efforts tO pMr slue him, in spite of his weakness and the I rl's efforts to detain Shim. They had not roceeded far, before they were challenged by the troops of his own volunteer-corps; from the commander of whom, Evelyn forthwith solicits a horse and attendants to enable him to overtake Kirke; when to his confusion and despair, he learns that Kirke had left orders to put him under arrest. Resistance is vain; but three or four days bringt up the corps to Schomberg's camp. Schomberg, with Kirke by his side was reviewing the troops; Evelyn advances in front of the line, and in the presence of Schomberg, demands of Kirke the cause of his arrest, who charges him with aiding and abetting rcbels. He appeals to the old Duke, and exhibits his passes and protections, and is immediately released. Then finding Schomberg disposed to befriend him, he demands of Kirke an account of Eva. Kirke haughtily refuses. Evelyn challenges, and Schlomberg sanctions the challenge, and witnesses the conflict on the spot. By an accidental slip, Evelyn is finally worsted, and having put his cause upon his failing sword, is thus left without redress. Eva appears lost to him for ever. Schomberg appoints him his aid-de-camp, retains him about him for the remainder of the campaign, and at the end of it sends him with despatcles to England. In London, or rather at Kensington, where Wiliam resided, he is detained for the winter. The interior of the court is thrown open, and we have William and Mary, and Ben. tinck, and Burnett, very characteristically exhibited. Two or three times, in the gar. dens, he gets a glimpse of a person in a male dress, whom he believes to be Eva, but in spite of his efforts, he is unable to speak with her. In the spring he returns to Schomberg, and at last gets a short leave of absence, to attend to his private affairs. His first step is to go straight to Sarsfield's camp, then at Dublin. Sarsfield had saved the life of Evelyn and his friend, before Derry, wlhen they had indiscreetly accompanied the deputation of the city to James's camp; and on this ground of acquaintanceship, Evelyn ventures to- introduce hiwrself to that brave man to procure intelligence of Eva. He gets detained by the out-posts, and meets again with the girl, who had twice saved his life, and also with the figure, whom he had taken for Eva, but again is baffled in his attempts to speak with her. Sarsfield receives him with kindness and testifies an interest in his distress; though knowing nothing whatever of the fate of McDonnel or Eva, he recollects there is a lady of the name at James's court, and he engages to take him in the evening to the Castle. There he is noticed, as a stranger, by James, who enters into conversation with him, defending his .conduct, and vindicating his rights. Blat, what is most interesting to Evelyn, he recognizes among the attendants of Lady lYreonnel, the Ladv Lieutenant, bis own Eva; but again every attempt to addres her is defeated. His.interview with James is thus suddenly interrupted by the junex. pected announcement of Willias landim, and having actually been six days in the country. The party breaks up; Sersfield dismisses Evelyn with a pass, and hi makes his speedy way to rejoin Schomberg. Now comes on William's brief campaign, and we fight the battle of the Boyne bravely over again. Evelyn, who in the engagement had acted as Aid-de-camp to Wit. liam, is takeni prisoner; and after James's desertion of his cause and country, accompanies Sarsfield to Limerick, where he has the luck again to undergo the harassings and miseries of a siege. Here too, he aocompanies Sarsfield on the memorable ex. pedition, in which, with the aid of the Rap. parees, he succeeded in destroying William's ammunition and baggage. The commander of these Rapparees turns out to be his long lost friend Mc Donnel, whose kindness to him had brought suspicion upon himself, and finally dismissal from the service. Resentment and despair drove him to head a band of these desperadoes. He ipeets with Evelyn, and while pouring curses upon him, and preparing to cut him down; a signal from his friends arrests his pU. pose. Here too again Evelyn meets with the person whom he had so often taken for Eva, and discovers him at last to be a younger brother of hers. Some words of explanation pass; but he is as violent as his elder brother. All is mystery to Evelyn. He cannot guess the cause of this intemperance. All, however, is now, hastening to a conclusion and eclaircisse. ment. iUmerick is reduced to extremity, and on the very day of its surrender came EvY herself, her younger brother, the wild om. niscient and ubiquious O'Nagh, and the girl who had so often shewn her devotion to Evelyn. Explanations follow; the girl confesses that love for Evelyn had seduced her to play false, to report falsely of Eva to Evelyn, and of Evelyn to Eva. At this moment comes the intelligence,-that the Rapparee commander had fillen into the hands of William's general and was just going to be shot. His friends appeal to Sarsfield, who. generously flies to his succour, solicits his pardon, and with difficulty obtains it, upon condition of his going into exile. Evelyn and Eva remain behind blessed and prosperous; and in due time, we read, inform their banished friends, of a family of three little cherubs prattling about them. Though the story creeps very tiresomely at the commencement, when once the real business of the action begins, the narrative never flags to the end; it is full of bustle and variety. The historical cbsracters are all faithfully poutrayea; sa we have all the distinguished persolS of the day, from James a Wlliam ad y, to Burnett and Walker. Several persons are introduced, whom we have found no occasion to mention; some of more, some of less importance; particularly a blind man, whose agency is of frequent recurrence, and wcho plays the traveller and guide at least as well as Mr. Holman; and a dumb man, whose gesticulations seem to be quite as expressive as language."

(Arrowsmith, fis.) 7ms is Mr. Le Gallienne's third novel, and, taken with these that preceded it?The Quest of the Golden Girl and' The Romance of Zion Chapel?it shows us clearly what, ara his powers and limitations in fiction. It shows us that tos\ the qelineation of a certain type of young man, a product of the best two decades, Mr. Le Gallienne has considerable gifts, *he young man is of the Nonconformist middle- dasses. His home ls strict arid pious. His own bent, however, is for poetry and gladness. He is frank, impulsive, enthusiastic, generous, warm-hearted, intolerant of all'tiiat is dull and mechanical, and very tolerant of whatever is "" done beautifully,"" however it may conflict with the moral code. He is an agnostic, with leanings towards elaborate ritual; a busy but superficial reader, his gods being Keats and Pater; a dilletante in art the last word being found in the pictures of Rossetti ana Burne-Jones. A sentimentalist, he oan adore many young women at once; and in rhyming "" love "" and "" dova "" and "" bosom "" and "" blossom "" he is expert If he knew more he would perhaps be more admirable, but far less "" lovable ""; and to be "" lovable"" is his end in life. That is the type of young man to whioh we refer, a type whioh at this moment is common in London and in all the great towns all over the oountry; and it is this young man whom Mr. Le Gallienne oan set down with precision and literary skill. And as we said last week, in noticing another new novel, every work that accurately reproduces a type is a contribution oi real value to fiction. Mr. Le Gallienne is not a good novelist; he has neither the concentration nor the dramatio power needful. He ia always the essayist a-story-tolling, glad of an opportunity to digress. But though he has little to toll in the book before us, and though it moves spasmodically and ends anywhere, we oan imagine a great many simple people reading it with pleasure. Especially in the provinces will it be enjoyed. The tone is bright and sunny, and the characters are pretty and gay. But the readers will have to be simple, we fear, because, with the exception of the type, who rings true, there is a great deal of chocolate-box unreality about the story. Baptist ministers, for example, on'whose shelves is ""all the most exquisite literature of doubt,"" are not really named Chrysostom Trotter. It is largely these wilful little perversions of fact, which Mr. Le Gallienne always indulges in, that keep sophisticated readers from his works. But for their especial benefit, we take it,' the author baa inserted iri thia story a chapter d clef, describing a certain literary set whom his hero meets in the rooms of an enterprising publisher. Mr. Le Gallienne here hits round him with spirit, sparing not even himself. We quote a passage: Presently there entered a tall young man with a long thin face, curtained on eaoh side with enormous messes of black hair?like a slip of the young moon glimmering through a pine wood. At the same moment there entered, as if by design, his very eatithesis, a short, firmly-built, clerkly fellow, with a head hkea billiard-ball in need of a shave, a big brown . moustitohs, aad enormous spectacles. , "" That,"" said the publisher, referring to the moon-inthe-pirie-wood young man, ""is our young apostle of sentiment, our new maa of feeling, the best-hated maa we have; and the other is our young apostle of blood. He is all .for musole aad brutality?aaa he makai all the mouser. It is oae of our many fashions just now to sing * Britain aad Brutality/ But my impression is that our yoong maa of feeling wul have his day?though he will have to wait for it. He would hasten it if he would cut his hair; but tbat, he says, he will never do. His hair is his battle-cry; aad hair, too, he says, is a gift. Well, he enjoys himself ?and loves a fight, though you mightn't think it to look at him."" In laying Young Lives .aside, we cannot, honestly say it has interested us; but it is innocent and bright and young, and it is written with care.Young Lives. Bv Richard Le Gallienne. (Bristol, Arrowsmith.) A Duet with an Occasional Chorus. By A. Conan Doyle. (Grant Richards.) Here is another volume of second-rate sentiment from Mr. Richard Le Gallienne. We cannot profess to say whether it is autobiographical or not?at any rate, it reads as if it were meant to be. It describes the little troubles and joys of a priggish literary young man in a Northern town, whose home surroundings, as is usual with literary young men of the kind who write about their homes, were uncongenial. The young man?to the benefit probably of the home, to judge from the way he describes himself as talking to his father?determined to leave these surroundings and to set up for himself in literature. He gets some poems published, he falls in love, and he keeps up his affection for his sister. But it all reads false somehow. The young man is most devoted to his sister, which is very right and proper and charming, no doubt; but he is not content with that, and must needs analyze his feelings and her feelings, and explain to all the world why he was so fond of her and she of him, as if their affection was something extraordinary and something to be inordinately proud of. It is the same with his sweetheart Angel: they go about trying to find recondite reasons and explanations for simple sentiments. They see a Rossetti picture which they admire, and they call it their Church and their altar. They are probably not conscious hypocrites, but they are the worse kind of unconscious hypocrites, who, having a fine feeling, think they have it move really as soon as they have put a label on it and talked about it to the world. The sentimentalist is the man who is not sure enough of himself to express his feelings as they are, so he clothes them in terms which he imagines add a conventional dignity. This book is full of that kind of sentimentality, and it is bad. Mr. Conan Doyle's tale, on the other hand, certainly does not err on the side of excessive sentimentality. It is a story of two very commonplace and worthy young people, who make love and get married. Their attitude towards life is profoundly unimaginative, and they would probably have been an exceedingly dull young couple to meet. But they are fine in character, and in the essentials of life are clean and straightforward. The book is an excellent picture of the best sort of honest middle-class respectability, which is unassuming and not discontented. Of the two sets of characters Mr. Doyle's characters would certainly have less to talk about than Henry and Angel; but in fiction they are distinctly more amusing and interesting, for they are genuine, and they are described simply and without affectation. If Mr. Le Gallienne did not convey the impression that he thought his people very fine they would be more tolerable; but, without a suspicion of satire, they are duller than the limited yet excellent Crosses."

This being the text, I it is not difficult to imagine that the authoress ' makes out a strong case of special pleading. j Mary Lyndon, the heroine, is a strong-minded woman,?many, many degrees ''above proof;"" ! she is also a victim and a martyr to all j the complicated distresses that can torment ' a susceptible female; but out of them all '' she comes forth triumphantly an "" emanci? pated woman,"" offering herself as an example ; and a leader to her sex. For our own part, we ! must confess, that upon closing the book we had j come round to the verdict of the sagacious Old1' ham jury, on the trial of a man for killing his ' j wife, ""that he had served her right."" Most ' ' readers will, we fancy, feel unfeigned compas! sion for Mr. Albert Hervey, who, for some sin [\ in a previous state of existence, is sentenced to become the husband of Mary Lyndon. The authoress is not without talent, but she chokes i ; all sympathy in her readers by the hard, arro( ' gant, dogmatical, self-complacency with which ' \ she puts herself forward. The book is written ' , in the worst style of American bad taste,?full , ; of pedantry and fine writing. The story is one j that, simply told and written in a better spirit, P might have been made not only interesting but profitable, for it touches upon many deeply ., j interesting points in the secret and social life of women; but, as it stands, it is only redeemed from being absurd by being detestable. The heroine begins with her early childhood, and goes through all the miseries that can beset a child, for the purpose of shoving how ignorant, foolish, and bigotted were all the people placed in authority over her. They treat her wrong? they feed her wrong?they clothe her wrong? they teach her wrong,?and she has to find herself in every thing; in fact, from her own account of herself, she seems to have been sent into the world like a bottle of patent medicine, labelled and attested to cure every imaginable female complaint, social or physical. Dissatisfied with the religious teaching she receives from her parents, she becomes a Quaker; and going to visit some Quaker friends she receives an offer from a man to whom she conceives a violent antipathy at first sight, and accepts him. Her account of the matter is, that "" his friends pleaded and besought her to marry him,"" and m "" a whirl of persuasions, that literally made me dizzy, I consented.My time was well nigh come, when Fate met me in the path of life, and I fell on my face and worshipped. A young man, such as I had seen in my daydreams, was introduced to me by Hervey. I loved,?and I awoke to the consciousness of living death. The hours I spent with my friend, whose sphere was a constant beneficence to me, were white-winged moments, such as make our ideal of Heaven: my heart sprang to him, as the flower lifts its petals to the warm sunlight."" In spite of this, she keeps her engagement, and marries Hervey,?and "" does her duty"" by him in a style that would make any husband's blood curdle in his veins at the prospect of what might have been his lot had the gods given him such a wife! She of course, as a pendant to her own portrait as a model wife and victim, paints her husband in conjugal colours that rival the superfluous blackness of an illustrious personage who must not be named to ears polite. After a while she separates from him, gives lectures at a Lyceum, and takes up a highly platonic attachment to an exquisite transcendentalist, "" with a face fair and beautiful as a babe's, ?his complexion was the rose and lily shining through a skin that was the transparent medium of hereditary scrofula.He stood radiant as the rose and pearl of a sea-shell?the blessed moon raining her silver sheen on his waving and golden hair?his broad forehead shining with unearthly lustre?his beaming eyes looking up as if in most calm and wise and loving worship.I said, ' I hope you have had a pleasant evening.'?' All evenings (he replied) are pleasant in the depths of being, when we feel our oneness with the Infinite,'"" &c. &c. The conversation continues much longer in a similar strain,?he ""looking into her being with the spell of a sweet and serene strength"";? mesmerizes her, we suppose, as she adds, ""calmly and silently I seemed to settle into the inmost of my life, till I rested as on the downy bosom of bliss""!! This remarkable man dies. The lady's husband wishes her to return to him, but she declines, as it would hurt her conscience ""to be a legal harlot"": she therefore remains ""a sad, separate wife,"" emancipates herself at last from all the limited liabilities of the female sex, and takes a regular degree as a homoeopathic physician, practising the watercure also, by which she obtains at length money, fame, and, strangely enough, respectability;? she blooms out also into a celebrated authoress; and discovers, in a highly distinguished editor, the ideal husband who would be necessary to the completion of her moral being; and, after the interchange of more than a hundred pages of love letters, which are all given at full length, finally, she resolves to obtain a divorce, if she can, from her husband; and if she cannot, to live with the man of her choice ""as his wife without the legal sanction"": however, to save the ""punctuaties,"" as the Chinese call them, the original husband applies for a divorce; and she, telling Mr. Vincent that ""if her love should ever lead her from him she must go,"" and, making a few other stipulations, consents to appoint ""a day for the ceremony"";?and the book concludes amid the same profusion of fine words and self-complacent arrogance which prevail in the beginning.

165,B4898,"['8859500', '8980030']","The Life and Works of Charlotte Bronte and I her Sitters. With Introductions to the | Works by Mrs. Humphry Ward. 6 vols. (Smith, Elder & Co.) (Fint Notice.) The true criticism of the work of the sisters Bronte ought to present to our imaginations on a general view an aspect at once large and simple. It ought to be no more complex than the sight from any vantage point of the famous moors above Haworth parsonage, or, we might add, the picture which memory would bear away even after many hours' wanderings in those almost classic haunts. The journeyings would reveal, of course, many grim or appealing details unapparent in the general prospect, but imagination, after we had come south or gone north, would but see a great picture, synthetic and simple, and would have wrought its own sense of the colour and "" spirit"" of the heath-lands. The deeper essence of the place would still be a secret of nature, that knows the meaning of matter and spirit and all their manifestations in the universe. So the general features in thoroughgoing Bronte criticism will be sheer, simple, outstanding, the details deftly set in subsidiary proportion. For Charlotte and Emily Bronte were strange and intense souls, and in their books it is the soul - fact that matters. True, there are a hundred less inspired things; let them be quietly touched and passed. The great poetic, passionate, creative stages are elemental and bold, easily seen by those that can see; and having duly marked them and told their quality, criticism has done its broad work. It cannot sound their mystery, wring out the secret of their inspiration, any more than the traveller on the heath can penetrate to the secret below the colour and the lonely beauty of nature. Mrs. Humphry Ward is sometimes thoughtful in her Bronte studies, but she also dwells unduly on none too relevant details. We could wish, on the other hand, that she had boldly considered a vital matter that must be settled before the absolute worth of the sisters' work in literature, or the evolution of literature, is satisfactorily determined. In her introduction to 'Jane Eyre,' she writes with pardonable gratification of the unquestioned spell exercised to-day by Charlotte Bronte's novels on the imagination of England. But this suggests the important, and here unconsidered, question whether the reading world on the whole realizes what great fiction ought to be, whether its general ideal is such that its enthusiasm in the case of Miss Bronte can be said to be a really critical tribute. It is to be feared, as a matter of fact, that England and the Continent have paid more attention to the body than to the spirit in fiction; and, despite Mrs. Ward's high opinion of latter-day developments of the novel, it is by no means yet certain that it can become a supreme medium of literature. A worthy instrument it has been, in some instances a noble one. We have even seen achievements that have suggested the supreme, the novelist in such rare cases showing great soul in action, giving embodiment to, as we might say, spiritual romance, indicating in characters and destinies something of the Soul above souls, vision of the Power that "" ever accompanies the march of man."" The general desire, however, is that he should walk "" rationally "" upon earth, and paint the body and circumstance of his age or another. Much ?too much?is expected of him as a delineator of daily manners, till often he becomes but the photographer of individuals, the Autolycus of data that have no more than a transient importance. It might almost seem that the great novelist must be a master of two arts?that of revealing spiritual forces, permanent passions, like a great poet or dramatist, and that of imparting imaginative significance to more ordinary actualities. The two powers?the interaction of the two worlds?make the true novel. To be thus a seer and a convincing delineator of actuality so far as actuality is essential ? a keen problem ? necessitates vision, intuition, opportunity, aud experience on such a scale that we must needs be modest in our expectations on the score of permanent fiction. The vision and the intuition are of the greater importance; on their possession and cultivation depends the fact whether fiction can be absolute literature rather than excellent description or analysis, or the work, as it were, of a syndicate of reporters in the service of a *4 time spirit,"" which may not be by any means a true daughter of the eternal. If the vision of the sisters Bronte sometimes failed them, it was uncommon at its best. And even as regards their experience or their knowledge of life, Mrs. Ward, like many critics, seems to entertain a too narrow idea. The sources of knowledge are subtle as well as obvious. Knowing the Celtic inheritance of the sisters (of which more anon), their contact with a world of great Northern tradition, the keen ordeals to which their sensitive spirits were subjected at home and abroad, which stirred unimagined forces in their natures, and made them critics of life in a higher sense than, perhaps, is commonly realized?understanding all this, and more, and remembering the subtle ways in which nature and life speak to the chosen mind, we may well be chary of complaint as to lack of knowledge in their case. It is the soul that matters, not the number of miles travelled, the number of cities seen in the actual world. Charlotte Bronte has told, as she was eminently fitted to tell, the ordeals of souls that live alone, in more senses than one?the never finished tragedies of deep natures in plain frames. Her unhappy governesses and teachers are more than governesses and teachers; they are types, old and new as the passion for sympathy, the lack of consideration in any woman's sphere. And crises and partings, journeys and reunions, in her pages sometimes seem to tell of people in more mysterious lands and on more mysterious seas than ours. They speak of souls rather than bodies. Faults and crudities of construction in 'Jane Eyre' and its successors?matters with which Mrs. Ward deals at length ? are sufficiently obvious. Had Charlotte Bronte been careful enough or courageous enough to free herself boldly from old theories of plot-making and other prepossessions, her story of the struggle of duty against affinity would have led to truer ordering, perhaps almost to real fusion, of material. But some of her critic's strictures on details are scarcely tenable. We may not always regard Mr. Rochester so gravely as his creator?he does not justify himself to the imagination in the way of Paul Emmanuel; but his early talk with Jane Eyre is scarcely the delectable food for comedy which Mrs. Ward imagines. The judgment on the country-house party, also, is much too sweeping. Without taking sides on the interesting question of governess versus provincial society, one may gently urge that a governess of genius, in her merciless way, would be likely to detect and record an ugly side of thing* possessing more or less glamour for the polite. It is not really a case of an ignorant governess passing judgment on "" high life ""; it is injured and incisive genius casting critical eyes on humanity socially more favoured, but spiritually inferior. Convention may seek to put her out of court with scorn, but the spirit of critical judgment, especially after some of Miss Bronte's own stories, recorded by Mrs. Gaskell, will not be convinced that there may not be a great deal to be urged on the other side. It were better, no doubt, to invoke the comic spirit in the treatment of puch issues, but Haworth was not meet, alas! for her airy presence. Certainly Charlotte Bronte had not always the happiness of overcoming ordinary prejudices in the gleam of larger vision, nor had she the unfailing power of shaping ordinary material to artistic ends, as we see in the often delightful and sometimes poetical ' Shirley.' The novelist, as we have suggested, is on occasions hard set to be an artistic interpreter of permanent passion and minute and mobile actuality. But it is possible to slip on points of detail, to fail, now and then, in kindling imaginative life in ordinary material, and yet to be true again and again, in the high hours, to what the imagination recognizes as aoulfact. Because Charlotte Bronte so vividly interpreted soul-fact, not occasionally, but often, we know that, however fallible at other times, she was an eminent novelist. Mrs. Ward maintains the interesting, but, of course, by no means novel theory, that the genius of Charlotte Bronte was fundamentally Celtic. The racial spirit, or rather the deep human one as affected in the light and shadow, the momentum, the environment of a race of changeful fortunes, no doubt lives long and works subtly in unconsidered regions, and is an attractive, if rather tentative study, though put to strange uses by extremists too bent on dividing humanity into compartments. But leaving temperaments and workaday selves, and looking into the souls that live deeply, the souls that create permanent literature, we feel that they are of no race, they know not geographical boundaries. As to Charlotte Bronte and Ireland, she seemed unable to create aa Irish character ? the curate Malone ia ' Shirley' and the drunken Mrs. Sweeny ia * Villette' are beneath notice in this regari ?but it is obviously true that certain qualities well marked in Celtic nature and personality are apparent in her work. It is te be feared, however, that Mrs. Ward has tee conventional an idea of Celtic characteristics. Her remarks are a little too suggestive of Matthew Arnold's lectures on the 4 Study ot Celtic Literature'?lectures fruitful in their day and still useful, but not founded on a comprehensive acquaintance with even translated Gaelic literature and Irish or general Celtic personality. "" Celtic melancholy"" is but a half-truth. Joyousness is the dominant quality of much Gaelic literature?joyousness and n fierce zest of life. The theory of tho Celt's love of loneliness seems strange when we know that the idea of contention being "" better than loneliness"" passed iuto a proverb with one order of Celts. For the theory of "" Celtic shrinking from all active competitive existence"" it would be difficult to find any generai justification ancient or modern. Nor ds Mrs. Ward convincing when she tries te explain Bronte Celticism as a growth of the Ireland of the North, ""on which commerce and Protestantism have set their grasp. This, although perhaps a popular notion, is but another half-truth; the Catholic and Celtic traditions and elements of Ulster are, in their way, outstanding. (In any case, did not the Rev. Patrick Bronte come of a south of Ireland family?) Mrs. Ward's consideration of the Celtic basis of the Bronte genius might have been much more interesting had she understood the manysidedness of the real Celticism, and that the Bronte sisters' practicality and order were no more alien to it on the whole than their share of the ""vision that remakes the world."" Were Gaelic literature accessible as a whole, it would clear away many misconceptions caused by taking it in snatches that concern widely severed years and varying circumstances, and give a disconnected and somewhat shadowy idea of the race or races. Its modern successor, Anglo-Irish literature, does not really display a true grip of later Irish realities, and political controversy has unfortunately obscured certain verities. The Celt has dreamed dreams, idealized his moors and hills, seen visions of hells and heavens that show a Dantesque feeling, without, of course, a Dantesque art; he has realized the tears of things, and known at stages the melancholy that for sensitive souls accompanies the fateful trends of life. But he framed the elaborate Brehon laws and a still more elaborate bardic system, pursued philosophic and scholastic ideals with a strange passion, and in modern days in more lands than one he has proved his genius as an empire-builder. Far from being an elusive creature, half within, half without, existence, he has shown at his highest a remarkable grip of both worlds Mrs. Ward, did ?be really know the various aspects of Celticism, might have profitably considered that phase of it which would appear to have lived a tenacious, if half-inscrutable, life in Emily Bronte rather than Charlotte. Yet the critic conscious of the highest reaches of English genius would claim much of hers as peculiar to his own race. There is truth on both sides. How much of the spiritual, the poetic, the divine even, lies below either racial consciousness, seldom coming into being or concrete embodiment ? This deeper human sub-consciousness, so to say, carno 10 consciousness in the Bronte sisters on their great moors, in their Yorkshire world of distinctive tradition, in the crises of their struggling years. It mixed with moods, and found outlet in forms in which Celt and Touton and all men find much of their more passionate selves. So, when all is said, the origins are of nature's underlying store: the result speaks for and to humanity.The Life and Works of Charlotte Bronte and her Sisters. With Introductions to the Works by Mrs. Humphry Ward. 6 vols. (Smith, Elder & Co.) (Second Notice.) Mus. Ward, inlier introduction to' Wuthering Heights,' propounds a theory of an appreciable German influence, a somewhat liberal infusion of Hoffmann and even Tieck, in Emily Bronte's work. It mu6t be said at once that Mrs. Ward, unfortunately, does not seem to realize the spirit and the stages of the "" German romantic movement."" Some of her views suggest the wild and peculiar conceptions of this German literature against which Carlyle protested in a critical essay comparatively early in the century. "" Tieck and Hoffmann,"" says Mrs, Ward, "" are full of raving and lunatic beings, who sob, shout, tear out their hair by the roots, and live in a perpetual state of personal violence both towards themselves and their neighbours."" This, to speak mildly, is not fair criticism even of Hoffmann; but how must it be regarded by the student who has a comprehensive knowledge of Tieck'} The whole trend of Mrs. Ward's critique is unjust to the German "" Romantics "" at their best: to their beauty there is only a casual allusion; there is no suggestion of those qualities, both grave and humorous, in which they are seen to differ decisively?even to the merely casual eye? from the author of 'Wuthering Heights.' It would appear that Mrs. Ward's imagination has dwelt overmuch upon the earlier Tieck; and, on the other hand, it is more than doubtful that a mind like Emily Bronte's could ever have been so much impressed as she thinks by the horrors of Hoffmann, or, indeed, of his English contemporaries of the school that would "" make Parnassus a churchyard."" In fact, critics are too apt to exaggerate the "" haunting"" effect of the ""bowl and dagger"" bookmen on the early century; we may be sure there was an esoteric English self unimpressed by their terrors. ""Monk"" Lewis, it is suggestive to remember, had no appreciable effect upon the House of Commons. And the Haworth sisters, let it never be forgotten, had a critical as well as a creative faculty. Mrs. Ward's theory, however, will be interesting to the curious who seek for the source and development of genius (as distinguished from casual shades and external dyes?some of which in Emily Bronte's case were no doubt Germanic, as some in Charlotte's were French) anywhere but in the mysterious store and order of nature. We know from Charlotte Bronte's words, and without them should realize the truth, that Emily Bronte the creator, the Emily Bronte who means much to the imagination, owed little, if anything, to literature. It lit or shadowed her mind, of course, as sun or darkness lit or shadowed her moors and heath; it did not permeate her spirit or become a second nature with her. Her distinctive work and that widespread literature which may be regarded as an outcome, so to say, of the British Museum Reading-room, seem ages asunder in point of date and method. All that places her apart owes no more to book-lore than the stories woven and rewoven by vigorous, brooding minds in the lonely Icelandic life to which we are indebted for the procession of the sagas: work to which remoteness from common actuality, and profound, aloof winters, gave so often a novel sense and depth of mood. By the way, there was, of course, a Norse element in Yorkshire tradition, and one finds it interesting to trace in Emily Bronte a certain kinship with the sagamen, though fancy might easily carry the kinship too far. A critic in the Athenaum once suggested a decisive relation in Emily Bronte's genius to something far greater than that of German romanco?which, of course, at its best had some sense of greatness, or, at least, was deeper than a cult, more than a mere fashion in fiction ? to no less than the genius of Dante himself. This is a highly interesting question, which, unfortunately?at least so far as the present writer knows?the acute critic has not considered in detail. In this connexion, and in view of Emily Bronte's Celtic ancestry, it were profitable to study that Celtic visionary spirit which made many Infernos before and during Dante's day, even though they found no comprehensive and powerful artist to shape them into concreteness and permanency. There was a potential Dante in the racial soul, and in truth some sense of it lingera to this day with the Celts. As to other aspects of the kinship, it is not merely fanciful to apprehend a certain Dantesque significance in the chief lovers in 'Wuthering Heights,' abandoned to passion in such a degree that it becomes as a great doom. Catherine, in the passionate scene where her cry is that she is Heathcliff, is no faint reminder of Francesca; but a Dante would not allow a Heathcliff or a Catherine, in hate or love, to protest so much. The tears and cries doubtless set Mrs. Ward thinking of the minor features of German romance. The passion, as the fore-mentioned critic recognized, runs too much to rhetoric. But the concentration, not only of speech but of passion, which might?nay, would surely? have come, is indicated in a few of Emily Bronte's best poems. Unfortunately enough, in treating of her virtues or defect:, Mrs. Ward?who holds the theory that "" we passionately accept her or we are untouched by her""?does not always employ felicitous figures of speech. ""Charlotte Bronte touches the shield of the reader,.she attacks him, and, complete as his ultimate surrender may be, he yields fighting;.it is still more so with Emily."" This martial stress and circumstance is rather overwhelming?and artificial. And ' Wuthering Heights,' whatever its naivete of construction, its signs of inexperience, does not suggest the artificial. It is like a grim and elemental outcome of nature, not meant either for human enjoyment or human opposition. It makes us, as it were, spectators in strange lands, where our word counts for nothing; we stand by pits of the passions. Had it been German-made to the degree Mrs. Ward imagines, instead of being virtually a creation of impersonal and independent genius, it would not have its, on the whole, decisive imaginative justification. Were it possible for Emily Bronte to have been dominated by book impressions and such casual experiences as her critic supposes?in short, were she an artist of the receptive order?she would surely have reproduced more of her overy-day life, in the manner of Anne, the frail ""little one,"" in ' Agnes Grey' and (more gloomily) in ' The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,' or in that of even Charlotte in her more porsonal and argumentative moments when the compelling new self was not active. Emily was too original for that. She obeyed that inscrutable and overmastering spirit of imagination which, as Charlotte said in a well known preface, ""strangely wills and works for itself."" Mr. Swinburne rightly finds in her "" a dark, unconscious instinct, as of primitive nature - worship."" "" Unconscious instinct "" contains more essential truth than the Germanic dissertation of Mrs. Ward. And, strangely enough, if we may touch again the question of Emily Bronte's ancestry, in the oldest known fragment of Celtic poetry, handed down for hundreds of years in Irish tradition, there is the unconscious instinct not only of worship of, but absolute identification with, nature. There is a gleam as well as darkness, and tho suggestion of a fierceness of spirit that the strenuous and conquering Emily would have understood and sympathized with readily. The singer is "" the wind which breathes upon the sea,"" ""the vulture upon the rocks,"" "" the ox of the seven combats,"" "" the fairest of plants,"" ""a wild boar in valour,"" ""a salmon in the water,"" "" a lake in the plain""?everything in his sheer primeval world, as Emily Bronte's spirit was everything in the great moorlands. The singer before the dawn of Celtic history expressed the dark, unconscious instinct; in the novelist and poet, after sophisticated ages, nature again stirred and spoke?the nature below books and beyond race. Eventually of course, as we see by the later poems, the unconscious instinct gave place in some measure to a conscious and considered philosophy. This ""Haworth Edition"" contains, besides the novels and poems of the sisters (and the * Cottage Poems' of their father), their portraits and the original title-pages and prefaces in their due places. Mrs. Gaskell's 'Life,' with an introduction and notes by Mr. Clement Shorter, will conclude the series. The style of the six volumes already issued is worthy of the house so honourably associated with Haworth, though occasionally the printer has neglected quota- tion marks. We have left to the last a reference to a feature which some will regard as special?illustrations, from photographs, of places indicated in the works. They are, of course, interesting in their way, though the way is too literal. They would bind the genius that speaks for many scenes to too local and particular ones. For instance, tho description of Lucy Snowe in London is accompanied by a picture of Ludgate Hill and St. Paul's Cathedral in 1848. The pages have as much to do with Ludgate Hill of 1828 or 2048. They are concerned with a state of soul much more than with a local habitation."

167,B1206,"['4991985', '4618505', '4337431']","I The Tenant of 9-ildfeU HaU. BYACtON BELL. Newby. - LIKE the other novels by the BELLS, there is much to object to in this. There are unnatural personages and isolated specimens. It is a tale of wonders and eccentricities, in which something of atrocity is mixed. Yet does it rivet the attention. Only its picturings offend; and they, merely on account of their truthfulness. It is not always advisable to tell the truth. Disgusting truths had, indeed, better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt. It was the error of Sir EDWARD BLULWER'S Lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement. In Wildfell Hall a would-be widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives. Now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon. Boarding-school misses would be apt to misconstrue it, and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge. No amount of beautiful writing-no intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts, can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work. In its plot Wildfell Hall is well constructed, the narrative is %vigorously sustained, and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author. We trust that in future 'Mr. ACTON BELL will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork. A*n extract or two will shew how near to the style of CURRFR BELL is the composition of this tale:WILDFVLIL HALL. Near the top of this hill, about two miles from Linden-Car, stood Wildfell Hall, a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era, built of dark grey stone,-venerable and picturesque to look at, but, doubtless, cold and gloomy enough to inhabit, with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes, its time-eaten airholes, and its too lonely, too unsheltered situation,-only shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of Scotch firs, themselves half blighted with storms, and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself. Behind it lay a few desolate fields, and then, the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill; before it (enclosed by stone walls, and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granite-similar to those which decorated the roof and gables-surmounting the gate-posts) was a gar. !den,-once stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate, and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardener's torturing shears, and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give them,-now, having been left so many years, untilled and untrimmed, abandoned to the weeds and the grass, to the frost and the wind, the rain and the drought, it presented a very singular appearance indeed. The close green walls of privet, 'that had bordered the princial walk, were two-thirds I withered away, and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds; the old boxwood swan, that sat beside the scraper, had lost its neck and half its body; the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden, the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway, and the lion that guarded the other, were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth, or in the waters under the earth; but, to my young imagination, they presented all of them a goblinish appearance, that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants. And here is A DOMESTIC PICTI'RE. I wth too late for tea; but my mother nad kindly kept too tea-pot and muffin warm upon the bobs, and though she scolded me a little, readily admitted my excuses; and when I complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea, she poured the remainder into the slop basin, and bade Rose put some fresh into the pot, and reboil the kettle, which offices were performed with great commotion, and certain re. markable comments. "" Well !-if it had been me now, I should have had no tea at all,-if it had been Fergus, even, he would have had to put up with such as there was, and been told to be thankful, for it was far too good for him; but you-we can't do too much for you.-It's always so-if there's any thing particularly nice at table, mamma winks and nods at me, to abstain from it, and if I don't attend to that, she whispers, ' Don't eat so much of that, Rose, Gilbert will like it for his supper,'-rs nothing at all-in the parlour, it's ' Come Rose, put away your things, and let's have the room nice and tidy against they come in; and keep up a good fire; Gilbert likes a cheerful fire.' In the kitchen-' Make that pie a large one, Rose, I dare say the boys '11 be hungry ;-and don't put so much pepper in, they'll not like it I'm sure,'or, ' Rose, don't put so many spices in the pudding, Gilbert likes it plain,'-or, ' Mind you put plenty of currants in the cake, Fergus likes plenty.' If I say, 'Well, mamma, I don't,' I'm told I ought not to think of myself-' You know, Rose, in all household matters, we have only two things to consider, first, what's proper to be done: and secondly, what's most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house -any thing will do for the ladies.' "" "" And very good doctrine, too,"" said my mother. "" Gilbert thinks so, I'm sure."" A. Very convenient doctrine for us at all events,"" said I; ""' but if you would really study my pleavure, mother, you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you do-as for Rose, I have no doubt she'll take care of herself; and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness, she'll take good ""are to let me know the extent of it. But for you, I might sink into the grossest condition of self-in. dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others, from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself, and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied, while left in total ignorance of what is done for me,-if Rose did not enlighten me now and then; and I should receive all your kindness as a matter of course, and never know how much I owe you."" "" Ah! and you never will know, Gilbert, till you're married. Then, when you've got some trifling, se'f cornceited girl like Eliza Millward, careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage, or some misguided, obstinate woman like Mrs. Graham, ignorant of her principal duties, and clever only in what concerns her least to know-then you'll find the difference."" "" It will do me good, mother; I was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of others-was I ?-but to exert my own towards them; and when I marry, I shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable, than in being made so by her; I would rather give than receive."" "" Oh! that's all nonsense, my dearit's mere boy's talk that ! You'll soon tire of petting and humouring your wife, be she ever so charming, aid then comes the trial."" "" Well, then, we must bear one another's burdens."" "" Then you must fall each into your proper place. You'll do your business, and she, if she's worthy of you, will do hers; but it's your business to please yourself, and hers to please you. I'm sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived, and after the first six months or so were over, I should as soon have expected him to fly, as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me. He always said I was a good wife, and did my duty; and he always did his-bless him !-he was steady and punctual, seldom found fault without a reason, always did justice to my good dinners, and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delay-and that's as much as any woman can expect of any man."" "" ' Hypocrite ! ' I exclaimed, and he held his breath, and looked very blank, turned white about the gills, and went away without another word."" "" You must not stay long, Gilbert,"" said she, when the door was closed upon us "" I'm not going to,"" said 1, somewhat testily.ftebttwo. THE TENANT OF WILDFFLL HA LL. By ACTON - .BULL. 3 vols. London: T. C. Newby. IT would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family, suffering, obviously, from the ""1 cacoethes scribendi"".-a very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under. We should almost be inclined to suppose that ""I The Tenant of Wildfell Hall "" is a family affair, in which each member of the said literary family, from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for ""I a jolly row,"" has had a scratch, each adding an incident in his own fashion. The difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel, and the effect is by no means pleasing. But it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the ""Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"" for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment, which, like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day, puzzles us to think where it can come from; whilst, at the same time, we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together, and, like the oasis in the desert, refresh the reader's wearying soul. With the plot of ""1 The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"" we shall not meddle; for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader; but may simply state, that t1he "" Tenant"" is a certain widow lady, who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen, with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant. Mrs. Graham, the widow lady in question, lives at W""'ildfell Hall with an old female servant, and occupies that portion. of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genl'temen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting, in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled. We must do her the jutice to state that, however much she may paint, we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s, razsis Wiinporte. Mrs. Graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one Gilbert Markham, a young gentleman, of a somewhat sanguine tem perament, who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood. Mr. Gilbert Markham seems to have a soul above the farm-yard and piggeries; in short, a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket, and supported by leathern gaiters and ankle-jacks. Paying a visit one evening to the Hall, for the purpose of ascertaining how Mrs. Graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame, which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood, the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence, which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat. And here we shall let this youth speak for himself, at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the ""v arm"" generally produces :"" But I gave one look back before I closed the door, and saw her leaning forward on the table, with her hands pressed against her eyes, sobbing convulsively, yet I withdrew in silence. I felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings. I"" To tell you all the questionings and conjectures, the fears and hopes, and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as I descended the hill, would almost fill a volume in itself. But before I was half way down, a sentiment of strong sympathy for her I had left behind me had displaced all other feelings, and seemed imperatively to draw me back. I began to think 'Why am I hurrying so fast inl this direction ? Can I find comfort or consolation, peace, certainty, contentment, all, or anything that I want, at home ? and can I leave all perturbation, sorrow, and anxiety behind me there? ""' Instead of going home, as he ought to have done, and taking off his half boots, and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe, and quietly toddling off to bed, he ""turned round to look at the old hall. ""' There was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon. I walked back to get a better view of it. When it rose -in sight, I stood still a moment to look, and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction. Something called me nearer-nearer still-and why nQt, pray ? Might I not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile, with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it, with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm August night, and the mistress of my soul within, than in returning to mv home, where all, comparatively, was light and life, and cheerfulness, and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind, and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins, and how could I endure to hear it openly declared, or cautiously insinuated, which was worse ! I had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear, 'It may be true,' till I had shouted aloud, 4 It is false ! I defy you to make me suppose it ! ""1 I could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlor window. I went up to the garden wall, and stood leaning over it, with my eyes fixed upon the lattice, wondering what she was doing, thinking, or suffering now, and wishing I could speak to her but one word, or even catch one glimpse of her, before I went."" There is sonmething very truthful and life-like in the preceding and following extracts, which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated. But "" I had not titus looked, and wished, and wondered long, before I vaulted over the barrier, unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window, just to see if she were more composed than when we parted; and if I found her still in deep distress, perhaps I might venture to attempt a word of comfort-to utter one of the many things I should have said before, instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity. I looked ; her chair was vacant; so was the room. But at that moment some one opened the outer door, and a voice-her voice-said, ' Come out, I want to see the moon, and breathe the evening air; they will do me good, if anything will. "" Here, then, were she and Rachel coming to take a walk in the garden. I wished myself safe back over the wall ; I stood, however, under the tally holly beach, which, standing between the window and the porch, at present screened me from observation, but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlight-Mrs. Graham, followed by another, not Rachel, but a youngt man, slender and rather tall. Oh ! Heavens! how my temples throbbed! Intense anxiety darkened my sight; but I thought-yes, and the voice confirmed it-it was Mr. Lawrence. ""' You should not let it worry you so much, Helen,' said he; ""I will be nmore cautious in future ! and in tinme,-' "" I did not hear the rest of the sentence; for he walked close beside her, and spoke so gently that I could not catch the words; my heart was splitting with hatred ; but 1 listened in tently for her reply? I heard it plainly enough. ""' But I must leave this place, Frederick,' she said; ' I never can be happy here, nor anywhere else, indeed,' she added, with a mirthless laugh; ' but I cannot rest here.""' Now, we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle. Here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral, that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with, much more so young a writer as Mr. Acton Bell. Even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight, here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable, and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility, 'which we shall presently extr.act. It is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that, in order to secure success as a romancist, an author must pander to thei vices of the age, and endeavour to display, in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character ^vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation. There can be no doubt that, owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romance-reading public, incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest; and, as a matter of course, young writers, in order to be read, seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character, which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice! But this is bad; and in young writers particularly so. It shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader; in short, how little confidence they have in themiiselves, which we regard as very essential to success. But we shall make one inore extract froin Mr. Bell, in order to show why we find fault. Mr. Gilbert Markham, the "" gentlemnan farmer "" the reader wotW of,' having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed, taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman, has the happiness to meet his rival on his ""s pretty grey poney."" The twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise; but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust, we shall append an extract, the italics and notes of admiration being our own :""As I trotted along, however, chewing the cud of bitter fancies, I heard another horse at no great distance behind me; but I never conjectured who, tihe rider might be, or troubled mv head about him!!! till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity, or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk ; for lost in my own reflections, I was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper. I lost ground, and my fellow traveller overtook me. He accosted me by name; for it was no stranger-it was Mr. Lawrence ! Instinctively the fingers of my whip-hand tingrled, and grasped their charge with convulsive energy : but I restrained the impulse, and answering his salutation with a nod, attempted to push on; but he pushed on beside me, and began to talk of the weather and the crops. 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries 'aild observations, and fell back. He fell back too, and asked if my horse was lame ! I replied with a look, at which he placidly smiled"" ! ! ! This looks something like a climax, and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs, prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street, when each is afraid to begin. But our friend the "" gentlemanfarmer"" girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to say-""s I grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before ; but still forbore to raise it, and rose in silence, waiting for some more tangible cause of offence, before I opened the floodgates of my soul, and poured out the dammed-up fury that was foaming and swelling within. ""'sMarkham,' said he in his usual quiet tone, ' why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter ? You have found your hopes defeated ; but how am I to blame for it I warned you beforehand, you know, but you would not "" He said no more.; for, impelled by some fiend at my elbow, I had seized my whip by the small end, and-swift and sudden as a flash of lightning-brought the other down upon his head."" Continuing in this silly tone of namby-pambyism, for it really is nothing else, our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant "" gentleman-farmer,"" whose sympathy for his fallen foe-for Lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeins-and whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader. He says that the "" little grey pony,"" somewhat astonished, no doubt, at this extraordinary proceeding, "" kicked and capered a little,"" and quietly cropped the grass off the hedge-bank, having "" made use of its freedom"" to do so. Mr. Markham gallops off, leaving Lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose. Having some compunctions of conscience, however, he returns to the spot, where he finds his rival, with his handkerchief still at his nose. But let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style"" I dismounted, however, and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree, first picked up his hat, intending to clap it on his head, but either he considered his head unfit for a hat, or the hat, in its present condition, unfit for his head; for shrinking away the one, he took the other from my hand, and scornfully cast it aside. I It's good enough for you,' I muttered. ""My next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him, which was soon accomplished; for the, beast was quiet enough in the main, and only winced and flirted a trifle, till I got hold of the bridle; but then I must see him in the saddle. "" 'Here you fellow-scoundrel-dog-aive me your hand and I'll help you to mount."" ""'No; he turned from me in disgust. I attempted to take him bv the arm. He shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch. "" What, you won't ? Well! You may sit there till doomsday, for what I care. But I suppose you don't want 'to lose all the blood in your body. I'll just bind that up for you."" "" Let me alone, if you please! ! !"" But we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this, nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this, even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer; but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted, being so glarinfly improbable in their action. The "" Tenant of Wildfell Mall is evidently made-manufactured, and that, too, in a very clumsy manner; and though we cannot, and will not state that it is "" a tale told by an idiot,"" we are compelled to say that it is "" full of sound and fury,"" and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnption-.and most decidedly that it "" signifies nothing.""The Tenant of WMil(dfell Hall. MIR. BELL'S NEW NOVEL. Ba Acton Bell. London, Newby. TIF. names of Acton Bell, Currer Bell, and Ellis Bell, are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms (le guerre in the literary world. The novels lately published by these supposed individuals, or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three, are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic; while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman, and, as wve suspect, a Yorkshirewoman.. Jane Eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the Bell designation ; and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. These two are, indeed, so strikingly alike in sentiment, style, and general mnodes of thought, that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other. That the author is a clever and vigorous writer, the popularity of Jane Eyre is a fair proof. She has also a certain marked tone of mind, which has impressed itself upon her books, and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels. And for the sake of the morals of the novel-reading public, we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers; and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in Jane FPyre and in the tale now before uts. We should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages, or approval of her principles, ha(d any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels, and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin, that is new. Jane Eyre is, indeed, one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever Perused. It is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc ab)solutely wrong or forbidding, or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales. It is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas, expressions, and circumstances, %hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature; and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification. The heroine, who tells the story, and who cer- tainly is iuiade to paint herself an(l her comi. panions with very considerable force and skill, is as utterly unattractive and unIfeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew. The Teniant of Wfeildrl Hail is also a species of autobiography. One third of the story is tol(l by thc lhero, a kind of gentleman farmer, whose morals, religion, cultivation, aiid talents, are about on a par with those of Jane Eyre herself; and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom, lie falls in love, not knowing that, though living in solitude, she is really married to a living husband. Throughout the whole book, there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader. All are commonplace, vulgar, rough, brusquemannered personages, whatever their supposed station in life; while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species. She is married to a man of family and fortune, to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of Iter fricnds, and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind, andl treats her with every indigniity, insult, and ill, usage which can be conceived, slhort of actual personal violence. 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands, an(l (dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher!, blasphemy, and l;rofaneness, inl whichl, with a herd of boon companjions, he (lelighted to spend his days. By and by, of course, lie dies, and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a death-bed which are tneither edifying, nor true to life, nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate. In the end, the hero and heroine nmarry, after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntn""s anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writer's creations. Nevertheless, on the whole, we should say that The Tenant of Wildfell lail is not so 1xad a book as Jane Eyre. There is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of' it-s most prominent characters. The hero and heroine are people of decent intentions; and though the same offensive element of interest (so to call it) occurs in both of the tales, and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid; yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor.

168,B7891,['3151595'],"LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS. BY Baroness von Suttner. Tranq. lated by T. Holmes. (Longmans.) THE ROMANCE OF A SCHOOLMASTER. By E. De Amicis. Translated by M. E. Craig. 3 vols. (Osgood.) Neither of these novels is of English birth. Both of them are Tendenz novels, with some similarity in their methods. There is no other reason why they should be classed together. The Baroness von Suttner's 'Waffen Nieder' has made its way slowly to this country, and, it must be said, in most unattractive guise. It has the outward look of a medical manual, and the English inside is often clumsy enough. The story will not cause the sensation here it did in its own home. We are accustomed to the mild and continuous propaganda of the Peace and Arbitration Association, and our military spirit only rises fitfully. In Austria and Germany I Waffen Nieder' came as a thunderbolt. Friedrich von Bodenstedt called it a "" glorious book,"" and said since Madame de Stacl "" no woman had wielded so potent a pen."" As an advocate Baroness von Suttner is magnificent. From the Austro-Italian, the Schleswig-Holstein, the AustroPrussian, the Franco-German wars she gathers proofs enough and to spare of the cruelty, the ghastly folly of mili- tarism. War, in her pages, has not the epic terror Tolstoi gives to it, but its ugliness, its tragedies, general and private, were never more convincingly depicted. Yet it must be owned the book is terribly dull at times. It is relentlessly exhaustive, and when the good Martha and the admirable Friedrich are sucking liberalism and opposition to the military spirit from the pages of Buckle, or when excerpts from Martha's red book are given us, with their nauseous amount of domestic sentiments and detail, one's patience is tried. Madame v. Suttner manders occionay, and does not see when a vivid fact might have saved her the trouble of a sermon. There is little art in the book, but it is a magnificent pamphlet crowded with ilusations taken from terrible reality. The theme of the other is quite different: its purpose is equally humane. The title alludes to but a small bit of it. It is not the romance, but the career, of a schoolmaster, of several schoolmasters, of many schoolmi . It is a presentment of the state of Italian elementary education, but with a distinct interest beyond the bounds of Italy. The Signor de Amicis is painfully conscientious. When he would have us know what a "" syndic,"" or a superintendent, or an inspector is like, he lets us see many syndics, many superintendents and inspectors, acting under different circumstances, actuated by various motives. He, too, is relentlessly exhaustive, which is the more courageous, as pedagogic details are not generally held to be popular. In the end, however, if we reach there, he does convince us of the romance in the lives of these A B C-grinders, whose hardships must indeed be great and whose position must be ignominious, if there be no exaggeration in this very circumstantial account. It is not a novel so much as a series of photographs, and it has the defects and the useulness of its method. In spite of its obtrusive purpose, its unblushing demand for patience, it is full of human interest and fine observation of character. Perhaps its most remarkable feature is the reverence and affection for children that pervades it."
169,B1283,['4417176'],"WUTHERING HEIGHTS.0 ELLTs BELL and Acton Bell appear in the light of two names bor. rowed to represent two totally different styles of composition and two utterly opposed models of treatment of the novel, rather than to indicate two real personages. They are names coupled together as mysteriously in the literary, as the sons of Leda are in the asterial world; and there is something at least gained by being mysterious at starting. ""Wuthering Heigrhts,"" by Ellis Bell, is a terrific story, associated with an equally fearful and repuLsive spot. It should have beei called W~ithering Heights, for any thing from. which the mind and body would nitore instinctively shrink. tltan the mansion and its tenants, cannot be easily imagined. ""W Wuthering,"" however, as expressive in provincial phraseology of ""tthe frequency of atmospheric tumults out of doors"" must do, however much the said tumults may be surpassed in frequency and violence by the disturbances that occur in dloors. Our novel reading experience does not enable us to refer to any thing to be compared with the personages we are introduced to at this desolate spot-a perfect misanthropist's heaven. ""CAgnes Grey,"" Isy Acton Bell, is a story of quite a different character. It is a simple tale oi t governess's experiences and trials of love, borne with that meekness, and nmet by that fortitude, that insure a final triumph. It hias nn alvantage over its predecessor, that while its lann'uaoe is less ambitious an(l less repulsive, it fills the mind with a lastingtr picture of love and happiness succeeding to scorn and affliction, and teaches us to put every trust in a supreme wisdoom and goodness."
170,B2456,['8526331'],"THE LITERARY EXAMINER. Great Expectations. By Charles Dickens. In Three Volumes. Chapman and Hall. All who have read this story from week to week, as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of Mr Dickens's popular journal, should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work. It is a finished work in the best sense. There are, we believe, some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of Pickwick, and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it. Such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past. Let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in Pickwick and Nicholas Nickleby, those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago, when he read only for enjoyment, delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed, and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer. Such power of enjoyment may be blunted now, but very sure we are that in the author of Pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined. Mr Dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original genius?when at his best, we say it most deliberately, the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of Europe?-but ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art. In place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will, and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy, we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes, concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole. We dwelt upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc Tale of Two Cities. In the story of Great Expectations the same thing is equally remarkable. And tbe new story has this advantage over its predecessor, that its scene is in England, and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the author's comic power. There is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch. Every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told. Thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known. Chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directly?though at the time imperceptibly?upon events to come, that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work, it is worth any man's while, and the better the man the more it is worth his while, to read the tale twice?for the second time critically, in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence, at the author's will with unsuspected subtlety, alike the cunning and the simple. Everything in art, good orbed, should have, and usually has, a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation. In Great Expectations the thought is one often enforced by Mr Dickens: that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest man's own wholesome labour. Joe Gargery lies at the core of the tale, an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart, strong as a man, simple as a child,-but like a good woman gentle and true, and unconsciously self-denying. About him revolves Pip, the orphan child he has reared and loved; good fellow enough and bright fellow enough, but not greater than the vanity of youth, he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess, and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source, transform him suddenly into a gentleman. His great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning. There is gold enough, but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in Australia, and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need. He escapes from Australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making, and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human Frankenstein monster to the youth, who is threatened with a life-long companionship, not of the monster that he made, but of the poor monster that made him. The monster, a born "" warmint"" and jail-bird, is sketched with a generous and wise humour. That he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow, Pip sees and feels. But the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows; and from tbe deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law, Pip turns to his neglected foster-father, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith; Joe, who had in these late years found the fallen Pip in his distress, tenderly nursed him in sickness, quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jeweller's bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat, and vanished when his work of patient love was done. Pip turns to the true-souled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own day-labour. One with this story is that of Miss Havisham and her foster child, Estella, who becomes the object of Pip's love, and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactor's daughter. Wealthy Miss Havisham, courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit, made manifest upon her wedding morning, turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day, stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations, and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast, is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane. Yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that, as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist, living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them. Upon Miss Havisham, who is rich, a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations, while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful Estella to win and wring the hearts of men. She lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes. But let us turn to the book for a few extracts. In the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which Great Expectations grew, and the beginning of the child's action which begot the convict's gratitude. The first chapter is with the convict on the marshes; the second is with Joe Gargery at the Forge. The delicacies of Joe's character are often suggested rather than told. We make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother; nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant Pip as his child. But we are told by himself why he leaves Mrs Gargery to develope into a shrew, to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will, without once using his blacksmith's arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her. My sister, Mrs Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up "" by hand.'' Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand. She wss not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had s general impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by band. Joe was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth (see, sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they "" to have somehow got mixed with their own whites. Hs wat a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dee,' fellow?a sort of Hercules in strength, sad also in weakness. My sister, Mrs Joe, with black hair sud eyes, had sacha prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She wss tall and bony, snd almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this apron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it at all: or why, if abe did wear it at all, she should not have taken it off, every day of her life. Joe's forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the dwellings in our oountry were?most of them, at that time. When I ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellowsufferers, and having confidences as such. Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it, sitting in the chimney corner. "" Mrs Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she's out now, making it a baker's dozen."" ""Is she?"" "" Yes, Pip,"" said Joe; "" and what's worse, she's got Tickler with her."" At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame. "" She sot down,"" said Joe, "" and she got up, and she made a grab at Tickler, and she Ram-paged out. That's what she did,"" said Joe, slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at it: "" she Ram-paged out, Pip."" "" Has she been gone long, Joe ?"" I always treated him as a larger species of child. and as no more than my equal. "" Well,"" said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, *' she's been on the Ham-page, this last spell, above five minutes, Pip. She's a coming ? Get behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you."" I took the advice. My sister, Mrs Joe, throwing the door wide open, and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by throwing me?I often served her as a connubial missile?at Joe, wbo, glad to get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg. But the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue: "" And last of all, Pip?and this I want to say very serous to you, old chap?I see so much in my poor mother, of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days, that I'm dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing what's right by a woman, and I'd fur rather of the two go wrong the t'other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn't no Tickler for you, old chap ; I wish I could take it all on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straigbt on it, Pip, and I hope you'll overlook short-comings."" There is a subtle indication, we may observe, of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as Mrs Joe would have made?of the great weakness of her sort of domineering strength?in her dealing with Dolge Orlick, of whom she alone knew, though others suspected, that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple. Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T, from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my sister's ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent. Thereupon, J had brought in all! our hammers, one after another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it, tbat we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck. When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me. '* Why, of course!"" cried Biddy, with an exultant face. ""Don't you see ? It's Aim/"" Orlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify him by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his arm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him. I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I was disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced, and motioned that she would have him given something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and tbere was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did, such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that day, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate, and without Orlick's slouching in and standing doggedly before her, as if he knew no more tban I did what to make of it. Biddy again, who is mentioned in tbat extract, is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a true-hearted working girl, wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty, can bc blended with the natural turn of her words, and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined. Poor Biddy had kept shop at the village Dame School, and had taught Pip the first mysteries of letters. When Mrs Joe was made a cripple, the old woman who had kept the school was dead, and the orphan Biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge. Imperceptibly I became conscious of s change in Biddy, however. Her shoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands were always clean. She wss not beautiful?she was common, and could not be like Estella?but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered. She bad not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly out of mourning at tbe time it struck me), when I observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes; eyes that were very pretty snd very good* __ j It cease ci my Urang onay own eyes fan ^ ?writing some psssages fros* a book, lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing Biddy observant of what I was about I laid down my pen, aad Biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down. MBiddy,"" said I, ""how do you manage it? Either I sm very stupid, or you are very clever."" ""What is it that I manage? I don't know,*returned Biddy, smiling. She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not mean that, though that made what I did mean mort surprising. ""How do you manage, Biddy,"" said I, "" to learn everything that I learn, and always to keep up with me ?"" I was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it* and set aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment ; though I hsve no doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price. "" I might as well ass you,"" said Biddy, "" how you mansge ? * ** Ko; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can aee me turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy."" "" I suppose I must catch it?like a cough,"" said Biddy, quietly; and went on with her sewing. Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her rather an extraordinary girl. For, I called to mind now, that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith as I, or better. ""Tou are one of those, Biddy,"" said I, "" who make the most of every chance. Tou never had a chance before you came here, and see how improved you are!"" Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. "" I was your first teacher though, wasn't I ? "" said she, as she sewed. "" Biddy ! "" I exclaimed, in amazement. "" Why, you are crying! "" "" No I am not,"" said Biddy, looking up and laughing. "" What put that in your head ?"" What could have put it in my head, but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been until Mr Wopsle's great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled'the hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school, with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too reserved, and should have patronised her more (though I did not use that precise word in my meditations), with my confidence. "" Tes, Biddy,"" I observed, when I had done turning it over, "" you were my first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia, in this kitchen."" "" Ah, poor thing! "" replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulncse, to transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her, making her more comfortable ; "" that's sadly true 1"" "" Well!"" said I, u We must talk together a little more, as we used to do. And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat"" Still more exquisite in the same way is tbe sketch of that long chat between Pip and Biddy. The connexion of Pip's great expectations with the great old Bailey lawyer, and the ingenious blending of Newgate associations with Pip's fortunes, before many readers will have discovered any relation between Newgate and the source of his prosperity, we may note as another instance of tbe skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout. We may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stage-struck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery; but he comes to London as an actor, Pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre, and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience, is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe. When Pip becomes a pupil of Mr Matthew Pocket, whose wife, with a grandfather who ought to have been in the Peerage, was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house, there are two fellow pupils, Startop and Bentley Drummle. They are not produced as detached sketches; each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story. Even thc audacious tailor's boy in the village, who mocks Pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes, has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot. But Mr Pumblechook docs nothing. It is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything; a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake, the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes, by no act of his own merit, a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash. We are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book, but it is in every reader's hand. Rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth, and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers, it is better that it should be read, as it is being read, in its entireness. No other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of Great Expectations; and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius."
171,B3520,['3170956'],"JUDE THE OBSCUR E.* After you have read "" Jude the Obscure,"" your thoughts run in two separate channels cut by Mr. Hardy's two nearly separate purposes. Your opinion of the book will largely depend on which you regard as the main one. These purposes are wound in with the history of Jude and the history of Sue. Their histories are intertwined, but they are not quite inevitable to each other; and so, to a greater extent than in most tragedies, you can regard the two chief actors separately. A work of the intensest human interest, it is not evenly strong: it has been written too much under the stress of feeling for that. Any discontent which is not roused by merely superficial causes, which is not finnicking, and any offence which the book may contain for timid readers, must arise, I think, from the story of Sue. Personally I feel no offence, and I speak for at least some women. But I am not * ""Jude the Obscure."" By Thomam Hardy. 6s. (Osgood aud McIlvaine.) sure if her championship might not have been bettered. In herself, she is one of Mr. Hardy's stimulating women. He is particularly anxious not to shirk the consequences of her temperament, of that free spirit of hers that gave so willingly when not coerced by laws and authority. But in exhibiting the results of this temperament acting on her circumstances-her shilly-shallying, her contrariness about the marriage tie-there is an amount of exaggeration, or of reiteration, that becomes nearly absurd, as did the fickleness in the hero of "" The Pursuit of the WVell-Beloved."" There is here something more than the ""Eeries of seemings, or personal impressions,"" spoken of in the preface. There is downright propaganda,which is always unconvincing, and even loosening to the convictions of the already converted. Sue is a woman that excites and leads. She is influential; her opinions and feelings do not need much emphasis and repetition. Wihen they are given these, she becomes too much of a pamphlet and platform victim of the cruel marriage bond. Sue could love, and was not well fitted for marriage life. There she is not so very abnormal, and this would be the sooner admitted had Mr. Hardy not taken so much trouble to justify her running to and fro between Phillotson and Jude. But I admit this is a cold reception to a warm protest; and the fault of the novelist one may readily forgive to the man of feeling, sending his chivalry bravely out in new directions. There is, perhaps, some propaganda again in his attitude towards the dreary child Time. One may shudder over the boy's dark way of cutting the knot of pecuniary misery. But even the gruesome vision of the three little innocent dead bodies is not so terrible as the doctor's suggestion of the boy's state of mind being "" the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live."" If one were to believe that the wish were to show itself first, or generally, in children, there would be good reason for immediate and comprehensive human slaughter to-day. Is there amore terrible suggestion in all modern literature ? Yet it has nothing to do with a general misundtrs:aiding of childhood. There is one picture of Sue as a child, there are several of the boy Jude that are quick %ith sympathy. But the book is not made up of theories and examples of theories. The title is truly descriptive. Jude is the real subject; and Judes story is among the most notable of Mr. Hardy's work. In bis greater books-and this is one, ur.doubtedly--he has a way of passionately identifying himself with the aims or the sorrows of one personage, whom he loves in his blackest, his sinfullest, his pitifullest moments. That he does so, and that he does not hide such moments, make him one of the very grimmest and most sympathetic of all novelists. Tess, the Mayor, Clym Yeobright, and now Jude, are of the company. Jude's history is written as life writes a history, some features being traced from the beginning, while later, from hitherto unstirred depths, circumstance calls up the others. He is a man with the defects of his amiable virtues and his sensitive nature. There is only one woman in the world for his love and reverence, but if she be not there, his loneliness may seek less good company. In strong drink he has sometimes found a refuge from overtaxed nerves. Life finds out the weak places in his very human body and soul. He is, too, and especially, a man of the people with the native instincts of the scholar. The poetry of his aspirations, the disinterestedness of his pursuit, the undyingness of his passion, are made living to you, and some of the self-taught man's vanity and his laboriousness of expression are not suppressed. You think he must be cured for ever of his ambition that day when, having received the "" terribly sensible "" repulse from the bead of Bibliol College, he stood at the Crossway, and ""began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely more palpitating, varied, and compendious than the gown life,"" and at that supreme moment when he, the obscure craftsman, wrote along the wall of the dull college from whence the repulse had come, ""I have understanding as well as you."" But the passion is in his blood. He wanders round and round the sacred places like a moth ound a candle. Christminster scenes mark the stages of his struggling, aspiring life. The imaginative child, watching from the roof of the Brown House the far-off spires and domes, the night-wandering stonemason "" under the walls and doorways, feeling with his fingers the contours of their mouldings,"" the ghosts of old scholars, comrades of his solitude, are striking pictures out of his early, hopeful time. In his sick and unfortunate days, when forced to labour at an earlier-learnt trade than hii own, he, as Arabella says, ""still harps on Christminster, even in his cakes,"" shaping these with grotesque pathos to a reminiscence of traceuied windows and cloisters. There, too, he dies, lonely and obscure, to the hum of a college chapel organ, and the shouts of Commemoration games. A poor workman to the end, a boyish imprudence for which he never shirked the payment, dogged him persistently; and the woman who had been his light and leader left him in the darkness, to fulfil, for superstition's sake, a loathed duty. Jude the law-abiding, the conservative, the kindly, uninfluenced by free thought till late in his day, is a rebel at last-perhaps from the day when this scene is gone through. ""When the house was silent, and they could do nothing but await the coroner's inquest, a subdued, large, low voice spread into the air of the room from behind the heavy walls at the back. ""' I What is it?' said Sue, her spasmodic breathing suspended. ""i' The organ of the college chapel. The organist practising, I suppose. It is the anthem from the seventy-third Psalm: "" Truly God is loving unto Israel.""' ""She sobbed again. 'O my babies ! They had done no harm! Why should they have been taken away, and not I!' ""There was another stillness-broken at last by two persons in conversation somewhere without. "" ' They are talking about us, no doubt I' moaned Sue. '""We are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men! ""' ""Jude listened. 'No-they are not talking of us,' he said. ' They are two clergymen of different views, arguing about the eastward position. ""' But the heart's bitterness came later, when Sue, in the name of religion, left him. I should like to cry out that it was against her nature to do so; but the reaction, when life had frightened her, is, I fear, not untrue to facts. Mr. Hardy does not wear rose - coloured glasses, and he does not seek to hide that a man of the people like Jude, scholar and gentleman though he is, has rough ways of going to the devil, even if he doesn't stop long in that company. But, on the other hand, his career may wholesomely astonish some middle-class readers, inasmuch as it goes to prove that aspiring and sensitive souls do not need generations of literary education and genteel incomes to breed them; and that poverty and the stress of life reveal to such sensitive souls a world that the comfortably-placed and the unimaginative only deny because they have been saved and denied the chance of entrance. Sue's story is a reality, with some unhappy exaggeration about it; but all that concerns Jude, in his strength and weakness, is masterly and written out of a deep heart. The constant lover-constant for all the Arabella incidentsmakes, perhaps, widest appeal for sympathy. But it is another Jude on which Mr. Hardy has shed the full light of his imagination; and the wandering, rejected scholar flits a pathetic ghost through college gate-ways and by college walls for evermore.

By the Author of 'Mary Barton.' 2 vols. Chapman & Hall. We imagine that this year of war will produce few better tales than ' North and South,'?which its author has gathered from the columns of a weekly contemporary, retouched and extended. The Author of ' Mary Barton' possesses some of an artist's best qualities. She will be attended to, having never as yet written without engaging the reader's interest, whether he agrees with or dissents from her philosophies. Her dialogue is natural,?her eye for character is keen. She enjoys humour, obviously,?she calls out pathos skilfully. Few things have been met in modern fiction more touching than the fading away of the poor girl to whom Margaret Hale attaches herself on removing from the South to a manufacturing town in Lancashire. The poetical Methodism of thisgirl,?111011011101)', uncomplaining affection,?the mixture of rudeness and of reverence with which she looks up to the delicately-nurtured Lady, make up an admirable picture. The Author of ' Mary Barton ' seems bent on doing for Lancashire and the Lancashire dialect what Miss Edgeworth did for Ireland and Scott for the land across the border. There has been no use of English patois in English fiction comparable to hers. She has strong Lancashire sympathies, too:?if they be class-sympathies such as propel her to a somewhat disproportionate exposure of the trials and sufferings of the poor, her excess is a generous one, and not accompanied by that offensive caricaturing of her more "" conventional "" heroes and heroines, which must always bring the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question. In another point the Author of ' North and South' is open to remonstrance. She deals with difficulties of morals needlessly, and too fearlessly, because, as we have again and again said, the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction ; and because by all one-sided handling of such matters, ? when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded, nnd when the temptation must be dwelt upon as cruel, in apology for the offence, ? there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage. The flat lie which Margaret Hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother, is gratuitous, painful,?staggering as an incident, and without useful result as a lesson. We cannot, in our hearts, blame Margaret; yet the author, by the sufferings which followed as consequence, takes pains to show how blame-worthy Margaret was. A kindred dilemma, it will be recollected, is to be found in the author's ' Ruth,'? which, in place of aiding, interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel. Here the motive of the incident is less obvious. In real, actual life, blameable, cowardly, and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible. They must be faced, with such honour, such charity, such disposition to excuse, and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned ; but to thrust them forward in Fiction (where only artistic truth is possible) amounts, in deed, if not in purpose, to a wilful "" playing with fire."" It should be added, however, that the tenor and tissue of our author's writings are such as to satisfy us that no wilfulness has been in her mind, but an earnest, if a mistaken, desire to do good."
173,B2585,"['8793448', '8688126']","MmDLEMARCH. | jfiddlemarch; a Study of Provincial Life. By George Eiiot. In Four Volumev. Blackwood. 1 ""Many Theresas have been born who found for them- i selves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the 1 offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with t he meanness of opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure f ;vhich found no sacred poet, and sank unwept into oblivion. 1 With dim lights and tangled circumstances they tried to i shape their thought and deed in noble agreement; but, after all, to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness; for these later-born T1~cresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which would perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul. Their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and a common yearning of womanhood; so that the one was disapproved as extravagance, and the other k oudemned as a lapse."" We need to recall those sentences in the ""prelude "" to ' Middlemarch ' in order to reconcile ourselves to its ""finale,"" in which our last glimpse of George Eliot's modern Theresa is as a comfortable matron, very properly devoted to her second husband, and ""only known in a certain circle as a wife and a mother."" Any other novelist would have ended the novel differently, and with a good deal more stage-effect; but George Eliot's finding is the true one, and if we part from Dorothea with somI regret that her first great failure, as the wife of Mr (iasaubon, should have no better compensation than the v'ery prosaic success of a marriage with Will Ladislaw, it is doubtless only just such a regret as the author wishes to arouse in us, as part of the regret with which every wise student of life must regard the accumulation of blunders and failures that too often befal the worthiest natures, .while those of coarser mould contrive to obtain all the happiness they are able to enjoy. The most carefully Mwrought out of all George Eliot's novels, with the exception perhaps of 'Romola,' ' Middlemarch ' is also the most uelancholy in its tone. It is a picture drawn by an artist of consummate literary power, and of intellectual strength that among novelists is altogether unique, in which are exhibited all the springs of action and all the motives of .""-haracter that go to make up our commonplace society, and the impression left by this "" study of provincial life "" is one of pftinful but healthy sadness. There is nothing of the misanthrope in George Eliot: if she laughs at t r condemns the errors and follies of the world, she does so altogether in order to help on their correction, and her ridicule and blame are more effective than the wisest preacher's sermons; but we have no more right to look for shallow merry-making in her books than to seek amusement from ' Ecclesiastes' or ' Lamentations.' She does not preach that "" all is vanity and vexation of spirit,"" or that "" the Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob and hath not pitied ;"" but she does show that society is sadly in need of mending, and that it can only be mended by a great reconstruction of the rules by which it is now hampered. It is with others, in their various ways, as with Dorothea, whose later life is ""the mixed result of young and nobler impulse struggling under prosaic conditions."" ""Among the ay Oek a her mises, it was never maid in t ighborood of Middlemarch that such mistakes could not have happened if the society into which she was born hd not smiled on propositions of marriage from a sickly man to a girl les than half his own age-on modes of education which make a woman's knowledge another name for motley ignoranceon rules of conduct which are in flat contradiction with its own fondly-asserted beliefs. While this is the social air in which mortals begin to breathe, there will be collisions such as those in Dorothea's life, where great feelings will take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion."" Dorothea is only one out of the many dwellers in Mid. dlemarch whose characters are here portrayed with wonderful truth and vigour; but she is the central figure that all the others cluster round. We see her first in striking con. trast to her simple-minded sister Celia, and her as simpleminded uncle, Mr Brooke, as a high-souled young woman, "" enamoured of intensity and greatness, and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those attributes."" The rashness causes her to embrace Mr Casaubon, the very perfection of a selfish clerical prig, and her marriage issues in nothing but bitterness, until all her ""' vague ideals "" have to give place to "" the common yearning of womanhood."" In noticing the instalments of the novel as they were published, we bave called attention to some of the stages in this change. We have seen how gradually Dorothea loses faith in her husband, without swerving at all in her duty towards him, even as the most exacting purist might define it; and how, as gradually, the way is prepared for her devotion, after her husband's death, to his cousin, Will Ladislaw. It is not easy to like young Ladislaw; one is tempted to think that, in marrying him, Dorothea makes nearly as great a blunder as she did in marrying Mr Casaubon. How much pleasanter it would have been for Lydgate to be her husband? But, unfortunately, things do not always go pleasantly in real life. and the fate that befals Dorothea is very natural, though not very welcome. Lydgate's fate is harder than Dorothea's. This portrait of the brave man of science, whose purpose in life is destroyed through his marriage with a heartless or very shallow-hearted beauty, is as wonderful in its way as the portrait of Dorothea. Lydgate and Rosamond are the chief persons in the later portions of ' Middlemarch,' and in tracing their history George Eliot has described with unrivalled force and truth the consequences of an ill-assorted marriage; not the consequences with which novel-readers are familiar, in which the silly wife runs away from her husband, or the husband is a brute to his wife; but the commonplace issues in which gradually love is killed and one heart at least is broken. Perhaps George Eliot weighs down her hero too much with misfortunes; but they serve to bring out the character she wishes to show. "" Oh, it is hard,"" says Dorothea to him, ""that all this should come to you, who had meant to lead a higher life than the common, and to find out better ways. There is no sorrow I have thought more about than that-to love what is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail."" If selfish Rosamond serves in one sense as a foil to Dorothea, unselfish Mary Garth is a no less complete foil of another sort. The really pleasantest portions of ' fiddle march' are those that recount the sayings and doings of lMary and her father, Caleb Garth. And Caleb Garth is an excellent study of a man whose religion consists in unswerving honesty and persistent well-doing that makes no pretence tovirtue. Asexcellent in itswayisthe studyof Nicholas Bulstrode, the hard hypocrite who uses the form of religion k as a cloak to his base actions, and who is at last driven into far baser actions in order that his character for rellgiuu mac 1 not be sullied. Bulstrode'3 downfall is described with great I ability, and perhaps the best part of the description is f this, which tells of the bearing of his wife just after she - has heard of his wrong-doings and of the worse doings r attributed to him: t She locked herself in her room. She needed time to get used *s to her maimed consciousness, her poor lopped life, before she . could walk steadily to the place aotted her. A new Rgicbin light had fallen on her husband's character, and she could not j ge him leniently: the twenty years in which she had believed irn him and venerated him by virtue of his coacealments came back with particulars that made them seem an odious deceit. He had married her with that bad post life hidden behind him, and she bad no faith left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him. Her honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonour as bitter as it could be to any mortal. But this imperfectly-taught woman, whose phrases and habits were an odd patchwork, had a loyal spirit within her. The man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life, and who had unvaryingly cherished her-now that punishment had l, fallen him it was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him. TIhere is a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on thie same couch with the forsaken soul, withering it the more by uloving proximity. She knew, when she locked her door, that she should unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband ald espouse his sorrow, and say of his guilt, I will mourn and not ixcproach. But she needed time to gather up her strength: she iteeded to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and prride of her ife. When she had resolved to go down, she prepared herself by t )ne little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker; t'iey were her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had begun a new life in which she embraced hiumniliation. She took off all her ornaments and put on a plain 1)'ack gown, and instead of wearing her much-adorned cap and large bows of hair, she brushed her hair down and put on a plain b{> net-cap, which made her look suddenly like an early Methodist. Bulstrode. who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying that she was not well, had spent the time in an agitation co: aal to hers. He had looked forward to her learning the truth fromn others, and had acquiesced in that probability, as something easier to him than any confession. But now that he imagined the :A;melnt of her knowledge come, he awaited the result in anguish. l1ii daughters had been obliged to consent to leave him, and t;iiugh he had allowed some food to be brought to him, he had not touched it. He felt himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery. Perhaps he should never see his wife's face with affection in it again. And if he turned to God, there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution. It was eight o'clock in the evening before the door opened and his wife entered. He dared not look up at her. He sat with is eyes bent down, and as she went towards him she thought he looked smaller-he seemed so withered and shrunken. A moveument of new compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave, and putting one hand on his which rested on the arnn of the chair, and the other on his shoulder, she said, solemnly 1,; t kindly"" Look up, Nicholas."" He raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half Damazed for a moment: her pale face, her changed, mourning <;css, the trembling about her mouth, all said, "" I know ;"" and her hands and eyes rested gently on him. He burst out crying and -tiny cried together, she sitting at his side. They could not yet steak to each other of the shame which she was bearing with hiim, or of the acts which had brought it down on them. His confession was silent, and her promise of faithfulness was silent. Open-minded as she was, she nevertheless shrank from the words ostrich would have expressed their mutual consciousness, as she w-ould have shrunk from flakes of fire. She could not say, "" How much is only slander and false suspicion ? "" and he did not say, "" I ani innocent."" The charitv of 'Middlemarch' is as notable as its wisdom. In every way it is a book to be glad of; and if it does not enhance George Eliot's fame, it will only be because she has already attained the foremost rank among novelists who write novels that contain more religion than all the sermons that were ever penned, and enough sound philosophy to make the reputation of half a dozen moralists and metaphysicians. - - I IMiddlemarch. SATURDAY, MARCH 30, 1S72. LITERATURE By George Eliot. Book III.- Waiting for Death. (Blackwood & Sons.) The third instalment of ? Middlemarch' ends in doubt?a doubt too evidently adapted to the exigencies of a serial form. Old Peter Featherstone, ""not less able than usual to enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating mankind,"" is dying fast; and, vulture-like, the Featherstones and Waules close round him with testamentary purpose. Brothers Solomon and Jonah and sisters Martha and Jane take bodily possession of Stone Court, where are also installed Mary Garth, of right, and Mrs. Viney and her son Fred, by Mr. Featherstone's request. That the Featherstones should hang together against the Vineys is natural. Still more natural is it that they should quarrel amongst themselves, and that there should be ""a general sense running in the Featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else, and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the Almighty was watching him."" No scrutiny, however, can open the secret of old Peter's iron box. True to himself, the old man snaps and snarls at everybody, is oracular as to his will, and inflicts torture with a keen sense of power. In the night, alone with Mary Garth, he dies. He has, it seems, made two wills, of which he wishes to burn one. But both remain ; and upon their tenor hangs Fred Viney's life; for Fred has borrowed money, with all belief in his powers of repayment, "" having the superfluous securities of hope at his command""; and Mary Garth's father has backed Fred's bill; and Fred has been unlucky in speculation upon horseflesh; and, "" not having occupied himself with the inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion other people,"" is now in most unhappy plight, seeing himself in his true light, as a pitiful rascal, who is robbing other people of their savings. But it is not for Fred and Mary alone that the plot is thickening. Lydgate?how or why it would be as hard to say as in real life ? finds himself engaged to Rosamond Viney; and Mr. Viney, who is expecting Stone Court for Fred, has given his consent to the arrangement "" with astonishing facility, passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens, and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch."" For "" the right word is always a power, and communicates its definiteness to our action."" And Mr. Viney has discovered that old Featherstone's death is only his "" demise""; and "" considered as a demise, old Featherstone's death assumed a merely legal aspect, so that Mr. Viney could tap his snuffbox over it and be jovial, without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity.1' And besides Lydgate and Rosamond, Dorothea, too, claims our interest, as Mr. Casaubon is too clearly dying fast,?indeed, has a fit which can have but one meaning. And Dorothea's future is still further perplexed by the fact that Mr. Brooke, who is the most goodnatured of all unwise men, has asked young Will Ladislaw to stop with him, "" feeling an interest in a young man who is starting in life with a stock of ideas."" And more than all, exactly as ? Old and Young' put the riddle of which the answer lies in ' Waiting for Death,' so in ? Waiting for Death ' a riddle is put, in the thirtieth chapter, the answer to which is even harder to guess, and ought to be the hinge of the tale. For the rest, * Middlemarch' is itself. Celia is to become Lady Chettam, and is very full of happiness. Mr. Brooke is more happily vague than ever, his advice to Casaubon after his fit being? "" Yes, yes; get Dorothea to play backgammon with you in the evenings. And shuttlecock, now? I don't know a finer game than shuttlecock for the daytime. I remember it all the fashion. To be sure, your eyes might not stand that, Casaubon. But you must unbend, you know. Why, you might take to some light study : conchology, now : I always think that must be a light study. Or get Dorothea to read you light things, Smollett? 'Roderick Random,' 'Humphrey Clinker': they are a little broad, but she may read anything now she's married, you know. I remember they made me laugh uncommonly?there's a droll bit about a postilion's breeches. We have no such humour now. I have gone through all these things, but they might be rather new to you."" And we have one or two new actors, such as Mr. Horrock, the horse-dealer, "" whose costume, at a glance, gives him a thrilling association with horses,"" and whom Nature has blessed with ** a face which by dint of Mongolian eyes, and a nose, mouth, and chin seeming to follow his hat-brim in a moderate inclination upwards, gave the effect of a subdued, unchangeable, sceptical smile, of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind, and, when accompanied by adequate silence, likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding, an infinite fund of humour?too dry to flow, and probably in a state of immovable crust,?and a critical judgment which, if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it, would be the thing and no other."" And with Mr. Horrock is Mr. Trumbull, the auctioneer, who is "" an amateur of superior phrases, never using poor language without immediately correcting himself,"" aud who, ""if anybody had observed of him that Mr. Borthrop Trumbull, being an auctioneer, was bound to know the nature of everything, would have smiled and trimmed himself silently, with the sense that he came pretty near that."" Still more heavily outlined is Solomon Featherstone, who "" thought himself much deeper than his brother Peter; indeed, not likely to be deceived in any of his fellow-men, inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being. Even the invisible powers, he thought, were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there ? coming from a man of property, who might have been as impious as others."" And there is also Mrs. Plymdale, who "" doesn't think that marrying is everything,"" and indeed, "" would have a girl first seek the kingdom of God ""; but who none the less has an eye to this world and its matters, and so holds that "" a girl should keep her heart within her own power."" What the end of * Middlemarch' may be, we hardly wish to guess. Its chief interest is as a study of English life. The action does not absorb us, as in *? Adam Bede' and 'The Mill ou the Floss.' There are too many actors for that, and too many threads woven into the one strand ; but as a thoughtful anatomy of English habits and English modes of thought, full of dry, quiet humour, 'Waiting for Death' is worthy its author. Whether ' Middlemarch,' as a whole, will suffer from the form which its periodical appearance entails, remains to be seen. Certainly, as yet, each part has been perfect of itself."
174,B2439,['8294286'],"The Life and surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, with introductory Verses by Bernard Barton, and illustrated with numerous Engravings from Drawings by George Cruikshank, expressly designcdjbr this Edition. 2 vols. 8vo. WE are here presented with a most beautiful edition of a work confessedly the first of its class. Its extraordinary success has been the very cause of its corruption; being found so peculiarly attractive to young persons, it has, to adapt it to that purpose, been abridged more and more in each edition, till it was melted down in'o a mere child's story-book. It became, on that account, difficult to procure the genuine edition as written by De Foe. The spirited Publisher therefore has performed an acceptable service, in enabling the scholar and man of taste to add to his library so beautiful an edition of a standard work. The present edition is introduced by some beautiful verses by Bernard Barton, which are entitled, "" A Poet's Memorial of Robinson Crusoe."" We shall give a few stanzas as a specimen : "" Again the tempest rises in its ire, 111 may his bark such hurricane withstand; Two hands are drown'd, and in the panic dire A third proclaims the joyful news of land ! Delusive hope;?the ship strikes on the ???p sand; [the ahore;?? They man the boat, and strive to reach One, only one?hath gain'd that lonely strand, To dwell in solitude unknown before, Than Anchorite's more strict, or Hermit's stern and hoar. ? ? ? ? Next came thy live-stock; what s group was thine I [our own ;? Thy cats,?I scarcely thought them like Thy goats,?how often have I wish'd them mine:? [prone But most of all was Childhood's fancy To envy thee thy Parrot! how its tone, When thou hadst taught it speech, must strike thine ear, In that unspeaking Solitude alone ! Tho* but an echo of thy voice, 'twas dear, Recalling thought of sounds thou never more might'st hear. * ? ? ? But what were these, or all the produce rich Of thy tobacco, lemons, grapes, and canes, Compar d with him whose name hath found a niche [retains In Childhood's heart? whose memory still Its greenness there, 'mid losses, cares, or gains, [name, Of later life : I scarce need write his Partner of all thy pleasures, and thy pains; His was a Servant's, Friend's, and Brother's claim; And peerless in all three shines faithful Friday's name."" Mr. Major's edition comes strongly recommended by the exquisite designs of Mr. George Cruikshank. This eminent artist's peculiar forte for humour is well known, and numerous subjects afford him ample scope for his singular powers in that respect; witness the inside of Crusoe's cabin, with his family around him, consisting of his parrot, dog, and two cats, p. 210; Friday and the bear in a tree, p. 480. But our readers will be highly gratified to find that in others he has infused a degree of feeling and pathos that we candidly own we were not aware that he possessed; and as examples, Crusoe on the raft, p. 72; Crusoe leaning against the Cross, p. 91; Crusoe at prayer, p. 135 ; Crusoe starting at the print of a human foot, p. 218, &c. The frontispiece, the meeting of Robinson Crusoe and Friday, is really a most charming picture. The original is sweetly painted, and the engraving by A. Fox does it justice. In some of the earlier scenes, the artist has introduced his own portrait as that of Robinson Crusoe."
