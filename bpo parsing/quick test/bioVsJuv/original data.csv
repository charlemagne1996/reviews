arose as Mr Nickleby entered but appeared incapable of advancing to meet him and leant upon the arm of a slight but very beautiful girl of about seventeen who had been sitting by her A youth who appeared a year or two olderstepped forward and saluted Ralph as bis uncle   Ohgrowled Ralph with an illfavoured frown you are Nicholas I suppose  That is my name Sir replied the youth   Put my hat down siid Ralph imperiously Will maam bow do you do You must bear up against sorrow maam  I always do   Mine was no common loss said Mrs Nickleby applying ber handkerchief to her eyes   It was no oconnnon loss maam returned Ralph as he coolly unbuttoned his spencer  flus bands die every dav maam and wives too   And brothers also Sir said Nicholas with a glance of indignation  Yes Sir and puppies mid pugdog likewise replied his uncle taking a chair  Von didnt mention in your letter what my brothers complaint was maam  The doctors could attribute it to no particular diseasesaid Mrs Nickleby shedding tears  Wo have too much reason to fear that bc died of a broken heart  Pooh  said Ralph theres no such thing I can understand a mans dying of a broken neck or mi Henna from a broken arm or a broken head or a broken leg or a broken nno but a broken heart nonsense its the cant of the day If a man cant pay his debts lie dies of a broken heart and his widows a martyr j  Some people I believe have no hearts to break j observed Nicholas quietly j  How old is this Iwiy for Gods ake  inquired Ralph wheeling hack hi chair and surveying his nephew from head to foot with intense scorn Nicholas is iry nearly nineteen replied the widow   Nineteen eli  said Ralph  and what do you mean to do for jour bread Sir  Not to lise upon my mother replied Nicholas bis heart swelling a he spoke   Youd have little tuouidi to live upon if you did retorted the uncle eyeing him contemptuously Whatever it be said Nicholas Hushed with anger  I shall not look to you to make it more   Nicholas my dear recollect yourself remonstrated Mrs Nickleby  Dear Nicholas pray urged the young lady  Hold your tongue Sir said Ralph  Ipoa my word Kine beginnings Mrs Nicklebytine beginning     Well maam said Ralph impatiently the creditors have administered you tell me iind theres nothing left for you    Nothing replied Mrs Nickleby   And you spent what little money you bad in coming all the way to London to see what I could do for you pursued RUph  I hoped faltered Mrs Nickleby that you might have an opportunity of doing something for your brothers children It was his dying wish that I should appeal to you in their Inhalf   I dont know how it is muttered Ralph walking up and down thc room  but whenever a man dies without any property of his own he always seems to think he luis a right to dispose of other peoples What is your daughter fit for maam   Kate has been well educated sobbed 31rs Nickleby Tell your uncle my dear how far you went in french and extras  The poor girl was about to murmur forth something when her uncle stopped her very unceremoniously   We inut try and get you apprenticed at some boardingschool said Ralph  You have not been brought up too delicately fur that I hope   No indeed uncle replied the weeping girl  I will try to do anything that will gain me a home and bread   Well well said Ralph a little softened either by bis nieces beauty or her distress stretch a point and say the latter  You must try it and if the life is too hard perhaps drcs3making or tambourwork will come lighter Have you ever done anything Sir turning to his nephew   No replied Nicholas bluntly   yn I thought not 1 said Ralph This is the way my brother brought up his children maam  Nicholas bas not long completed such educacation as his poor father could give him rejoined Mrs Nickleby and he was thinking of  Of making something of him some day said Ralph The old story always thinking and never doing if my brother had been a niau of activity and prudence he might have left you a rich woman maam  and if he had turned bis son into the world us my father turned mc when I wasnt as old as that boy by a year and a half he would have been in a situation to help you instead of being a burden upon you and increasing your distress My brother was a thoughtless inconsiderate man Mrs Nickleby and nobody I am sure eau have better reason to feel that than you   Are you willing to work Sir he inquired frowning on his nephew   Otcourse I am replied Nicholas haughtily Then see here Sir said his uncle This caught my eye this morning and you may thank your stars for it  With this exordium Mr Ralph Nickleby took a newspaper from his pocket and after unfolding it and looking for a short time among the advertisements read as follows   Ian ivrionAt Mr Wackford Squcerss Academy

assistant wanted Annual salary ot  A Master of Arts would be preferred There said Ralph folding the finner again Let him get that situation and his fortune is made  But he is not a Master of Arts said Mrs  Nickleby   That replied Ralph that I think can be got over   But the salary is so small and it is such a long way oil uncle  faltered Kate The scene nt thc Saracens Head on Snow Hill is in the best Pickwick manner Here is the schoolmaster from the picturesque neighbourhood of Greta Uridge   Mr Squcerss appearance was not prepossessing He hid but one eye and the popular prejudice runs in favour of two The eye he bad was unquestionably useful but decidedly not ornamental being of a greenish grey and in shape resembling the fanlight of a street door The blank side of his face was much wrinkled and puckered up which gave him a very sinister appearance especially when he smiled at which times his expression bordered closely on the vitiations His hair was very flat and shiny save at the ends where it was brushed stiffly up from a low protruding forehead which assorted well with his harsh voice and coarse manner He was about two or three iind titty and a trifle below the middle size he wore a white neckerchief with long eadsandasiiit of scholastic black but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long and his trousers a great deal too short he appeared ill at ease in bis clothes and as if he were iu a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable  Mr Squccrs was standing in a box by one of the coffeeroom fireplaces titted with one such table as is usually seen in iotfeerooms and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition In a corner of the seat was a very small deal trunk tied round with a scanty piece of cord and on the trunk was perchedbis laceup halfboots and corduroy trousers dangling in the airi diminutive boy with his shoulders drawn up to his ears and his hands planted on his knees who glanced timidly at the schoolmaster from time to time with evident dread and apprehension  Halt past threemuttered Mr Siiieersturnb from the window and looking sulkily at the cottee room clock There will be nobody hen today  Much vexed by this reflection Mr Sjiieers looked at the little boy to see whether be was dui in any thing be could beat bim tor as he happeiudiiot to bo doing anything at all he merely boxed hy ears and told him not to do it again At Midsummer muttered Mr Saucers re suming his complaint  1 took down ten hoys tva twentystwo hundred pound I go back at eight oclock tomorrow morning and have got only thu three oughts an oughttitree twos sixsixty pound Whats come of all the boys whats purer got in their betula what does it all mean  1 Tere the little boy on the top of the trunk zi a violent sneeze   Halloa Sir growled the schoolmaster turning round  Whats that Sir  Nothing please Sir replied the little boy  Nothing Sir exclaimed Mr Saucers   Please Sir I sneezed rejoined the boy tren hiing till the little trunk shook under him Oh sneezed did you  retorted Mr Squeers Then what did you say nothing for Sir  In default of a better answer to this juevaon the little boy screwed a couple of knuckles into each of his eyes and began to cry wherefore Mr Spicers knocked bini off tlie trunk with a blow on oin sule of his face and knocked him on again with u Mow on the other Wait till I get you down into Yorkshire my young gentleman said Mr Saucers and then Iii give you the rest Will you hold that noise Sir Yeyeyessobbed the little boy rnlieiij his face very hard with the Beggars Petition in printed calico Then do sn at onceSisaid S picers  I i yai hear r  As this admonition was accompanied with n threatening gesture and littered with a save ajvt the

gentleman goes  The schoolmaster had scarcely uttciv1 tiiisc words in a fierce whisper when the stranger intend Alieciing not to see him Mr Sipieers feigned to lie intent upon mending a pen and offering benevolent advice to his youthful pupil  My dear child said Mr Sfpieers  all people have their trials This early trial ol yunis that is lit to make your little heart burt and your very eyes come out of your head with crying what is it Nothing less thain nothing You are kavin yur friends but you will hine a father in nie my lear and a mother in Mrs Sipieers At the ilciiithtni village of

schoolmaster iu the rehearsal of li advertisement  Mr Saucers I believe Sir The same Sir said Mr Saucers with an assumption of extreme surprise   The gentleman said the stranger that advertised in the Times newspaper Morning Post Chronicle Herald amt Advertiser regarding the Academy called pithehoys Hall at the delightful village of Uotheboys near Greta Bridge in Yorkshire added Mr Saucers  You come on business Sir I see by my y oung friends How do you do my little gentleman and how do you do Sir With ibis salutation MiSaucers patted the heads of two holloweyed smallhoned little boys whom the applicant had brought Arith him and waited for further communications   I am in the oil and colour way My name is  pi Snawlev Sir said the stranger Thc children are cheapened for Yorkshire consumption They are not great catersbut as Mr Squeers well remarks We dont consider the bms appetites at our establishment and tliov are added to the little wretch on the corded box The schoolmaster is not abroad iu the following dialogue  lp to what age do you keep boys at your jaol then he asked at length  lust as long as their friends make the quarterly raiments to my agent in town or until

schoolmasters one eye  They ant   I thought they might be said Squeers coolly Wc have a good many of them  that boys one   Him in the next box  said Snawley  Saucers nodded in the atlirmative and his companion took another peep at the little boy on the trunk and turning round again looked as if he were iiic disappointed to see bim so much like other lo vs and said be should hardly have thought it  Ile is cried Squeers  But about these boys of lurirs you wanted to speak to me   Yes replied Snawley  The fact is I am not their father Mr Squeers Im only their fathcriniiiw   h  Is that it  said tlie

Charles Dickens Chapman and Hall Great success is a thing as little understood in literature nowadiys as great failure The tut issi mus ibis is found in the old place The sale of the Pickwick Papers was very generally held to be in the nature of a bookselling curiosity and when a j career as prosperous was foretold for a new work of the same extent by the same hand wise people j shook their heads and said it was impossible It has been proved possible notwithstanding The sale of Nicholas Nickleby is understood even thus early to have exceeded by many thousands that of l Pickwick Papers Without entering on the question of how far such a circumstance should be taken as a test of genius or even of talent it establishes tho claim of thc work to critical consideration on the highest grounds and with reference to the best models We propose in this spirit briefly to examine its pretensions to rank with thc enduring fictions of our language Since Richardson published in successive portions his famous story of Clarissa Har lo we ami enthusiastic damsels eager for the conversion of Lovelace besieged and implored the author as for a living sinner whose future state depended on thc decision to  save his soul alive no characters of an unfinished1 work of fiction have excited anything like the interest manifested by large classes of persons in all ranks fr tbe fate of the various actors in the tale of Nicholas Nicklcby The Cibbers of that day after  a delicious meal of Miss Byron  in one volume were not more anxious for  another slice of herein the next than the Cibbers of our own after regaling themselves with a Squeers or a Smike or a Newman Noggs or a Vincent Crummies in number six have been for other slices of them in number seven This shows us at the outset a great secret of the popularity of the author He seizes the eager attention of his readers by the strong power of reality Ile thoroughly individualises what he takes in hand Our sympathies are never left to wander off into quarters vague or undefined from thc flesh and blood to which he allies them And this also is the reason why we cannot associate anything that is vulgar or I w with his treatment of subjects that in themselves are avowedly so In everything of that kind that he presents to us there is in his manner of doing it the manliness and simplicity of nature or the truth of life as it is We are never repelled by the abominations of egotism conceit or dogmatism We are never disgusted by misplaced ridicule If there is good going on there is a vivid and hearty style to bring out all its beauty  and if there is evil it runs no chance of being mistaken for good The quantity of invention observation and knowledge of character observable in tl writings of Mr Dickens is never more apparent than are his kindness of heart and capacity for generous emotion Now by all the various readers of this tale of Nicholas Nichlebyand they separate themselves into classes most widely apart from each otherthese various qualities can bc in an almost equal degree appreciated and felt In this we advance further into thc causes of so remarkable a popularity Thousands read the book because it places them in the midst of scenes and characters with which they are already themselves acquainted and thousands read it with no less avidity because it introduces  them to passages of nature and life of which they before knew nothing but of the truth of which their own habits and senses suffice to assure them This is a test which only a man of genius could bear It is only in the presence of a writer of genius that the affinities and sympathies of high and low in regard to the customs and usages of life are so revealed For it is not more by the bonds of a common humanity than by the alliances of common habits that we are all linked together The highest and the lowest in these respects roost nearly approximate to each other Like effects must always more or less result from being either above or below a dependence on other peoples opinions These are elements in the wide success and popularity of this remarkable writer that would probably first suggest themselves in a critical examination of the book before in Incidentally they embrace many others His style is for the most part admirable Bating some faults of occasional exaggeration which we may presently advert to it is fresh and racy and has the surpassing charms of simplicity earnestness animal spirit and good humour A rare virtue in It is that it is always whether grave or gay thoroughly intelligible and for the most part thoroughly natural Its sparkling stream of vivacity or humour glides down by the easiest transition into deeper cuireou of seriousness and pathos It is a quick as warm as comprehensive as the sympathies it is taxed to express We know of none that csu paint more powerfully by an apposite epithet or iltostfate mot happily by n sehofeesJassion Whatever Mr Dickes knows or l9mMmLm mA tm wttM  mtmmmmmmA mmmSm

his descriptions ofthe various localities of Loudon as set down in this story of Nicholas NickUby can ever expect to forget them more A fresh glow of warmth and light plays over thc cheerful and familia places a deeper mist of misery and blackness settles on thc darker scenes With him we pass along misty streets in some cold and ogy morning while but a few meagre shadows flit to and fro or now and then a heavy outline of coach or cab or cart looms through the dull vapour yet were it oAy for the noises he strikes from time to time upon our ears distantly and indistinctly as though the o had muflicd them we could not doubt that it was London We enter with him by night through long double rows of brightly burning lamps a noisy bust lim crowded scene in which he shows us the rags of the squalid balladsinger fluttering in thc same rich light that shows thc goldsmiths glittering treasures and where one thin sheet of brittle glass is the iron wall by which vast profusions of wealth and food aro guarded from starved and pennyless men add this is the same London as before At all times and under every aspect bc gives us to feel and sec the great city as it absolutely is Its interior life is made as familiar to us as its exterior forms We come to know better the very places we have known best Wc observe more smoking and bear more singing in Golden square thc Saracens Head on Snow hill relaxes into a grim cordiality the Alphonse of Cadogan place reveal themselves plain Bills to our practised eye  and the sight of even a real butterfly fluttering among thc iron heads of dusty area railings in some retired and noiseless City square startles us no more And with all these masterly requisites for his art is Mr Dickens a perfect novelist By no means He has yet to acquire the faculty of constructing a compact and effective story without which that rank can never be attained He has yet to subdue his tendencies of exaggeration to which though wc observe it infinitely less in this work than in the Pickwick Papers he is still too prone In saying this we only carry out the spirit of the praise we have just offered him It is a due compliment to such a writer to assume that he is not one of those frail folks who must bc bolstered up good and bad together The great master in our language of thc art of constructing a plot we need hardly observe is Fielding For exquisitest contrivance for happiest extrication of story he stands quite unrivalled In this respect Tom Jones is an universally acknowledged masterpiece Not an incident occurs in it from the first page to the last which docs not more or less tell upon the story while it illustrates at thc same time the character of thc gents by which its results ure to be worked out Thus Black George is scarcely a less essential personage than Tom Jones himself and a long list of intermediate persons iu like manner combine each in his own peculiar sphere to one grand effect Its only episode the only circumstance that is ever suffered to divert our attention from thc business going on is that of thc Old Man of thc Hill introduced in mere conventional imitation of the absurd custom of Cervantes and Le Sage Passing this there is not an eddy a current scarcely a single ripple on its full and flowing stream of purest incident and art Nicholas Nie kleby could not stand such a test for an instant A want of plan is apparent in it from the first an absence of design The plot seems to have grown as the book appeared by numbers instead of having been mapped out beforehand The attention is ever and anon diverted from the story by digressions introduced for the apparent uses of mere contrast and effect while abrupt and startling recurrences are thus of course rendered necessary to recal us to the main interest and action Admirable and very plausible reasons might no doubt be urged for all this yet should none be admitted that contravene the sounder claims and more enduring requisites of high and perfect Art The consequence of it is in this case that many characters are altogether dropped as the necessities ofthe story force theimelves on tho writer and that the grander effect of some of his most masterly and powerful writing in the latter chapters is marred by the introduction of matters needful indeed to a gathering up of the loone or broken threads of an imperfect story but sounding more like the minute recitals of a lawyers deed than the natural development of a book of so much originality and ginini Of the occasional sins against verisimititode on the side of exngteration

of the tcenes wkh Kr Mefrswy Verisopht We have now and then as the work proceeded directed attention to things of this kind We are not certain even that the more amiable characters of the book are always so amiable as we are desired to suppose them and we must confess an insuperable aversion to the heroics of Nicholas Nickleby himself when as it happens sometimes they obscure even his strong and gentle mind We take him to cut a poor figure for example in that quarrel with our dear Mr Lenville how ultraexquisite saving only that are all the scenes with the strollers 1 and when he stalks out nf the green room  bowing slightly to the assembled company we long to have been there notwithstanding our seldomvarying strong affection for him to have joined the hearty laugh at his exit We can scarcely reproach ourselves for this We are not sure that even Mr Dickens himself is indisposed to quiz now and then these little foibles of his favourite hero It is we remember after a certain sort of hasty demonstration of them that one of the helpers at thc Saracens head is heard to exclaim  Hallo this is somebody in disguise this is and another follows up tbe joke with  Room for the eldest son of the Emperor of Roosher iienlimn But when we follow tbe son of the imperial potentate into bis little dark and deserted room when we see him in his tender devotion to poor Smike an always touching and most beautiful feature in the story w rought too with consummate art when we are with him in his lonely thoughts of sister and home all other vagaries are forgotten and nothing is visUie to the moistening eye save the simplicity and sweetness of his nature We have only to make one exception more We referred to it when we spoke of some exaggerations in mere style Mr Dickens occasionally overlays his thoughts with needless epithets and is over profuse in his use of adjectives It is only in his reflections we find thisand that rarelyin his descriptions never And now having hastily glanced at objectionable points in the conduct or treatment of this famous story what a host of beauties crowd on our grateful recollection for which we have not opportunity or space to give even a passing glance to With what pleasant thoughts it has stocked our memory with what true and tender sentiments enriched our hearts with what a healthy and manly moral instructed our minds With bow much vivid distinctness each character takes its place before us how plainly we pee the individualities of each the form of their faces the accident of iheir habits the nicer peculiarity of their minds These are triumphs which on I j belortg to a firstrate writer The creative powers of the novelist when properly directed and well sustained take rank with history itself The Mchylus of Parson Adams is not less real than the spectacles of Burke the trumpet of Sir Joshua or the snuffbox of Gibbon In reserve for Mr Dickens are still greater triumphs if he has patience and perseverance to prepare hiimelf by study and selfrestraint hy the pursuit of art and the pruning of commonplace exuberance for their full and satisfactory achievement We hope that he will not fail in this Great is the glory though the strife be bard and heartily do we wish him strength to surmount the one and long life to enjoy the other We see in him at no distant day if he does entire justice to hi powers the not unworthy successor of,

arose as Mr Nickleby entered but appeared incapable of advancing to meet him and leant upon the arm of a slight but very beautiful girl of about seventeen who had been sitting by her A youth who appeared a year or two olderstepped forward and saluted Ralph as bis uncle   Ohgrowled Ralph with an illfavoured frown you are Nicholas I suppose  That is my name Sir replied the youth   Put my hat down siid Ralph imperiously Will maam bow do you do You must bear up against sorrow maam  I always do   Mine was no common loss said Mrs Nickleby applying ber handkerchief to her eyes   It was no oconnnon loss maam returned Ralph as he coolly unbuttoned his spencer  flus bands die every dav maam and wives too   And brothers also Sir said Nicholas with a glance of indignation  Yes Sir and puppies mid pugdog likewise replied his uncle taking a chair  Von didnt mention in your letter what my brothers complaint was maam  The doctors could attribute it to no particular diseasesaid Mrs Nickleby shedding tears  Wo have too much reason to fear that bc died of a broken heart  Pooh  said Ralph theres no such thing I can understand a mans dying of a broken neck or mi Henna from a broken arm or a broken head or a broken leg or a broken nno but a broken heart nonsense its the cant of the day If a man cant pay his debts lie dies of a broken heart and his widows a martyr j  Some people I believe have no hearts to break j observed Nicholas quietly j  How old is this Iwiy for Gods ake  inquired Ralph wheeling hack hi chair and surveying his nephew from head to foot with intense scorn Nicholas is iry nearly nineteen replied the widow   Nineteen eli  said Ralph  and what do you mean to do for jour bread Sir  Not to lise upon my mother replied Nicholas bis heart swelling a he spoke   Youd have little tuouidi to live upon if you did retorted the uncle eyeing him contemptuously Whatever it be said Nicholas Hushed with anger  I shall not look to you to make it more   Nicholas my dear recollect yourself remonstrated Mrs Nickleby  Dear Nicholas pray urged the young lady  Hold your tongue Sir said Ralph  Ipoa my word Kine beginnings Mrs Nicklebytine beginning     Well maam said Ralph impatiently the creditors have administered you tell me iind theres nothing left for you    Nothing replied Mrs Nickleby   And you spent what little money you bad in coming all the way to London to see what I could do for you pursued RUph  I hoped faltered Mrs Nickleby that you might have an opportunity of doing something for your brothers children It was his dying wish that I should appeal to you in their Inhalf   I dont know how it is muttered Ralph walking up and down thc room  but whenever a man dies without any property of his own he always seems to think he luis a right to dispose of other peoples What is your daughter fit for maam   Kate has been well educated sobbed 31rs Nickleby Tell your uncle my dear how far you went in french and extras  The poor girl was about to murmur forth something when her uncle stopped her very unceremoniously   We inut try and get you apprenticed at some boardingschool said Ralph  You have not been brought up too delicately fur that I hope   No indeed uncle replied the weeping girl  I will try to do anything that will gain me a home and bread   Well well said Ralph a little softened either by bis nieces beauty or her distress stretch a point and say the latter  You must try it and if the life is too hard perhaps drcs3making or tambourwork will come lighter Have you ever done anything Sir turning to his nephew   No replied Nicholas bluntly   yn I thought not 1 said Ralph This is the way my brother brought up his children maam  Nicholas bas not long completed such educacation as his poor father could give him rejoined Mrs Nickleby and he was thinking of  Of making something of him some day said Ralph The old story always thinking and never doing if my brother had been a niau of activity and prudence he might have left you a rich woman maam  and if he had turned bis son into the world us my father turned mc when I wasnt as old as that boy by a year and a half he would have been in a situation to help you instead of being a burden upon you and increasing your distress My brother was a thoughtless inconsiderate man Mrs Nickleby and nobody I am sure eau have better reason to feel that than you   Are you willing to work Sir he inquired frowning on his nephew   Otcourse I am replied Nicholas haughtily Then see here Sir said his uncle This caught my eye this morning and you may thank your stars for it  With this exordium Mr Ralph Nickleby took a newspaper from his pocket and after unfolding it and looking for a short time among the advertisements read as follows   Ian ivrionAt Mr Wackford Squcerss Academy

assistant wanted Annual salary ot  A Master of Arts would be preferred There said Ralph folding the finner again Let him get that situation and his fortune is made  But he is not a Master of Arts said Mrs  Nickleby   That replied Ralph that I think can be got over   But the salary is so small and it is such a long way oil uncle  faltered Kate The scene nt thc Saracens Head on Snow Hill is in the best Pickwick manner Here is the schoolmaster from the picturesque neighbourhood of Greta Uridge   Mr Squcerss appearance was not prepossessing He hid but one eye and the popular prejudice runs in favour of two The eye he bad was unquestionably useful but decidedly not ornamental being of a greenish grey and in shape resembling the fanlight of a street door The blank side of his face was much wrinkled and puckered up which gave him a very sinister appearance especially when he smiled at which times his expression bordered closely on the vitiations His hair was very flat and shiny save at the ends where it was brushed stiffly up from a low protruding forehead which assorted well with his harsh voice and coarse manner He was about two or three iind titty and a trifle below the middle size he wore a white neckerchief with long eadsandasiiit of scholastic black but his coat sleeves being a great deal too long and his trousers a great deal too short he appeared ill at ease in bis clothes and as if he were iu a perpetual state of astonishment at finding himself so respectable  Mr Squccrs was standing in a box by one of the coffeeroom fireplaces titted with one such table as is usually seen in iotfeerooms and two of extraordinary shapes and dimensions made to suit the angles of the partition In a corner of the seat was a very small deal trunk tied round with a scanty piece of cord and on the trunk was perchedbis laceup halfboots and corduroy trousers dangling in the airi diminutive boy with his shoulders drawn up to his ears and his hands planted on his knees who glanced timidly at the schoolmaster from time to time with evident dread and apprehension  Halt past threemuttered Mr Siiieersturnb from the window and looking sulkily at the cottee room clock There will be nobody hen today  Much vexed by this reflection Mr Sjiieers looked at the little boy to see whether be was dui in any thing be could beat bim tor as he happeiudiiot to bo doing anything at all he merely boxed hy ears and told him not to do it again At Midsummer muttered Mr Saucers re suming his complaint  1 took down ten hoys tva twentystwo hundred pound I go back at eight oclock tomorrow

trunk zi a violent sneeze   Halloa Sir growled the schoolmaster turning round  Whats that Sir  Nothing please Sir replied the little boy  Nothing Sir exclaimed Mr Saucers   Please Sir I sneezed rejoined the boy tren hiing till the little trunk shook under him Oh sneezed did you  retorted Mr Squeers Then what did you say nothing for Sir  In default of a better answer to this juevaon the little boy screwed a couple of knuckles into each of his eyes and began to cry wherefore Mr Spicers knocked bini off tlie trunk with a blow on oin sule of his face and knocked him on again with u Mow on the other Wait till I get you down into Yorkshire my young gentleman said Mr Saucers and then Iii give you the rest Will you hold that noise Sir Yeyeyessobbed the little boy rnlieiij his face very

Times newspaper Morning Post Chronicle Herald amt Advertiser regarding the Academy called pithehoys Hall at the delightful village of Uotheboys near Greta Bridge in Yorkshire added Mr Saucers  You come on business Sir I see by my y oung friends How do you do my little gentleman and how do you do Sir With ibis salutation MiSaucers patted the heads of two holloweyed smallhoned little boys whom the applicant had brought Arith him and waited for further communications   I am in the oil and colour way My name is  pi Snawlev Sir said the stranger Thc children are cheapened for Yorkshire consumption They are not great catersbut as Mr Squeers well remarks We dont consider the bms appetites at our establishment and tliov are added to the little wretch on the corded box The schoolmaster

companion took another peep at the little boy on the trunk and turning round again looked as if he were iiic disappointed to see bim so much like other lo vs and said be should hardly have thought it  Ile is cried Squeers  But about these boys of lurirs you wanted to speak to me   Yes replied Snawley  The fact is I am not their father Mr Squeers Im only their fathcriniiiw   h  Is that it  said tlie

Charles Dickens Chapman and Hall Great success is a thing as little understood in literature nowadiys as great failure The tut issi mus ibis is found in the old place The sale of the Pickwick Papers was very generally held to be in the nature of a bookselling curiosity and when a j career as prosperous was foretold for a new work of the same extent by the same hand wise people j shook their heads and said it was impossible It has been proved possible notwithstanding The sale of Nicholas Nickleby is understood even thus early to have exceeded by many thousands that of l Pickwick Papers Without entering on the question of how far such a circumstance should be taken as a test of genius or even of talent it establishes tho claim of thc work to critical consideration on the highest grounds and with reference to the best models We propose in this spirit briefly to examine its pretensions to rank with thc enduring fictions of our language Since Richardson published in successive portions his famous story of Clarissa Har lo we ami enthusiastic damsels eager for the conversion of Lovelace besieged and implored the author as for a living sinner whose future state depended on thc decision to  save his soul alive no characters of an unfinished1 work of fiction have excited anything like the interest manifested by large classes of persons in all ranks fr tbe fate of the various actors in the tale of Nicholas Nicklcby The Cibbers of that day after  a delicious meal of Miss Byron  in one volume were not more anxious for  another slice of herein the next than the Cibbers of our own after regaling themselves with a Squeers or a Smike or a Newman Noggs or a Vincent Crummies in number six have been for other slices of them in number seven This shows us at the outset a great secret of the popularity of the author He seizes the eager attention of his readers by the strong power of reality Ile thoroughly individualises what he takes in hand Our sympathies are never left to wander off into quarters vague or undefined from thc flesh and blood to which he allies them And this also is the reason why we cannot associate anything that is vulgar or I w with his treatment of subjects that in themselves are avowedly so In everything of that kind that he presents to us there is in his manner of doing it the manliness and simplicity of nature or the truth of life as it is We are never repelled by the abominations of egotism conceit or dogmatism We are never disgusted by misplaced ridicule If there is good going on there is a vivid and hearty style to bring out all its beauty  and if there is evil it runs no chance of being mistaken for good The quantity of invention observation and knowledge of character observable in tl writings of Mr Dickens is never more apparent than are his kindness of heart and capacity for generous emotion Now by all the various readers of this tale of Nicholas Nichlebyand they separate themselves into classes most widely apart from each otherthese various qualities can bc in an almost equal degree appreciated and felt In this we advance further into thc causes of so remarkable a popularity Thousands read the book because it places them in the midst of scenes and characters with which they are already themselves acquainted and thousands read it with no less avidity because it introduces  them to passages of nature and life of which they before knew nothing but of the truth of which their own habits and senses suffice to assure them This is a test which only a man of genius could bear It is only in the presence of a writer of genius that the affinities and sympathies of high and low in regard to the customs and usages of life are so revealed For it is not more by the bonds of a common humanity than by the alliances of common habits that we are all linked together The highest and the lowest in these respects roost nearly approximate to each other Like effects must always more or less result from being either above or below a dependence on other peoples opinions These are elements in the wide success and popularity of this remarkable writer that would probably first suggest themselves in a critical examination of the book before in Incidentally they embrace many others His style is for the most part admirable Bating some faults of occasional exaggeration which we may presently advert to it is fresh and racy and has the surpassing charms of simplicity earnestness animal spirit and good humour A rare virtue in It is that it is always whether grave or gay thoroughly intelligible and for the most part thoroughly natural Its sparkling stream of vivacity or humour glides down by the easiest transition into deeper cuireou of seriousness and pathos It is a quick as warm as comprehensive as the sympathies it is taxed to express We know of none that csu paint more powerfully by an apposite epithet or iltostfate mot happily by n sehofeesJassion Whatever Mr Dickes knows or l9mMmLm mA tm wttM  mtmmmmmmA mmmSm

his descriptions ofthe various localities of Loudon as set down in this story of Nicholas NickUby can ever expect to forget them more A fresh glow of warmth and light plays over thc cheerful and familia places a deeper mist of misery and blackness settles on thc darker scenes With him we pass along misty streets in some cold and ogy morning while but a few meagre shadows flit to and fro or now and then a heavy outline of coach or cab or cart looms through the dull vapour yet were it oAy for the noises he strikes from time to time upon our ears distantly and indistinctly as though the o had muflicd them we could not doubt that it was London We enter with him by night through long double rows of brightly burning lamps a noisy bust lim crowded scene in which he shows us the rags of the squalid balladsinger fluttering in thc same rich light that shows thc goldsmiths glittering treasures and where one thin sheet of brittle glass is the iron wall by which vast profusions of wealth and food aro guarded from starved and pennyless men add this is the same London as before At all times and under every aspect bc gives us to feel and sec the great city as it absolutely is Its interior life is made as familiar to us as its exterior forms We come to know better the very places we have known best Wc observe more smoking and bear more singing in Golden square thc Saracens Head on Snow hill relaxes into a grim cordiality the Alphonse of Cadogan place reveal themselves plain Bills to our practised eye  and the sight of even a real butterfly fluttering among thc iron heads of dusty area railings in some retired and noiseless City square startles us no more And with all these masterly requisites for his art is Mr Dickens a perfect novelist By no means He has yet to acquire the faculty of constructing a compact and effective story without which that rank can never be attained He has yet to subdue his tendencies of exaggeration to which though wc observe it infinitely less in this work than in the Pickwick Papers he is still too prone In saying this we only carry out the spirit of the praise we have just offered him It is a due compliment to such a writer to assume that he is not one of those frail folks who must bc bolstered up good and bad together The great master in our language of thc art of constructing a plot we need hardly observe is Fielding For exquisitest contrivance for happiest extrication of story he stands quite unrivalled In this respect Tom Jones is an universally acknowledged masterpiece Not an incident occurs in it from the first page to the last which docs not more or less tell upon the story while it illustrates at thc same time the character of thc gents by which its results ure to be worked out Thus Black George is scarcely a less essential personage than Tom Jones himself and a long list of intermediate persons iu like manner combine each in his own peculiar sphere to one grand effect Its only episode the only circumstance that is ever suffered to divert our attention from thc business going on is that of thc Old Man of thc Hill introduced in mere conventional imitation of the absurd custom of Cervantes and Le Sage Passing this there is not an eddy a current scarcely a single ripple on its full and flowing stream of purest incident and art Nicholas Nie kleby could not stand such a test for an instant A want of plan is apparent in it from the first an absence of design The plot seems to have grown as the book appeared by numbers instead of having been mapped out beforehand The attention is ever and anon diverted from the story by digressions introduced for the apparent uses of mere contrast and effect while abrupt and startling recurrences are thus of course rendered necessary to recal us to the main interest and action Admirable and very plausible reasons might no doubt be urged for all this yet should none be admitted that contravene the sounder claims and more enduring requisites of high and perfect Art The consequence of it is in this case that many characters are altogether dropped as the necessities ofthe story force theimelves on tho writer and that the grander effect of some of his most masterly and powerful writing in the latter chapters is marred by the introduction of matters needful indeed to a gathering up of the loone or broken threads of an imperfect story but sounding more like the minute recitals of a lawyers deed than the natural development of a book of so much originality and ginini Of the occasional sins against verisimititode on the side of exngteration

of the tcenes wkh Kr Mefrswy Verisopht We have now and then as the work proceeded directed attention to things of this kind We are not certain even that the more amiable characters of the book are always so amiable as we are desired to suppose them and we must confess an insuperable aversion to the heroics of Nicholas Nickleby himself when as it happens sometimes they obscure even his strong and gentle mind We take him to cut a poor figure for example in that quarrel with our dear Mr Lenville how ultraexquisite saving only that are all the scenes with the strollers 1 and when he stalks out nf the green room  bowing slightly to the assembled company we long to have been there notwithstanding our seldomvarying strong affection for him to have joined the hearty laugh at his exit We can scarcely reproach ourselves for this We are not sure that even Mr Dickens himself is indisposed to quiz now and then these little foibles of his favourite hero It is we remember after a certain sort of hasty demonstration of them that one of the helpers at thc Saracens head is heard to exclaim  Hallo this is somebody in disguise this is and another follows up tbe joke with  Room for the eldest son of the Emperor of Roosher iienlimn But when we follow tbe son of the imperial potentate into bis little dark and deserted room when we see him in his tender devotion to poor Smike an always touching and most beautiful feature in the story w rought too with consummate art when we are with him in his lonely thoughts of sister and home all other vagaries are forgotten and nothing is visUie to the moistening eye save the simplicity and sweetness of his nature We have only to make one exception more We referred to it when we spoke of some exaggerations in mere style Mr Dickens occasionally overlays his thoughts with needless epithets and is over profuse in his use of adjectives It is only in his reflections we find thisand that rarelyin his descriptions never And now having hastily glanced at objectionable points in the conduct or treatment of this famous story what a host of beauties crowd on our grateful recollection for which we have not opportunity or space to give even a passing glance to With what pleasant thoughts it has stocked our memory with what true and tender sentiments enriched our hearts with what a healthy and manly moral instructed our minds With bow much vivid distinctness each character takes its place before us how plainly we pee the individualities of each the form of their faces the accident of iheir habits the nicer peculiarity of their minds These are triumphs which on I j belortg to a firstrate writer The creative powers of the novelist when properly directed and well sustained take rank with history itself The Mchylus of Parson Adams is not less real than the spectacles of Burke the trumpet of Sir Joshua or the snuffbox of Gibbon In reserve for Mr Dickens are still greater triumphs if he has patience and perseverance to prepare hiimelf by study and selfrestraint hy the pursuit of art and the pruning of commonplace exuberance for their full and satisfactory achievement We hope that he will not fail in this Great is

1 The Promised Land From the Danish of  Henrik Pontoppidan by Mrs Edgar Lucas Dent  CoWe are glad to notice that Henrik Pontoppidan is gradually becoming known among us It is now six years since the publication of 4 The Apothecarys Daughters the first of his works we believe that was ever translated into English and Messrs Dent have just brought out adequate English versions of 4 Muld and its sequel now before us 4 Det Forjrettede Land Pontoppidan possesses many of the qualities which should make him popular with all classes of the English public His art is cheerful sane and healthy  he is a genuine humourist with a keen eye but also an indulgent smile for the foibles of his fellows and his simple concise and pregnant style pointed with light irony and graceful satire reminding one occasionally of Guy de Maupassant especially in his shorter stories is that of the true raconteur The present novel as already mentioned is the sequel to 4Muld also translated by Mrs Edgar Lucas under the title of  Emanuel  or Children of the Soil The 44children of the soil are of course the peasants and Emanuel is an enthusiastic young parson who in order to realize his Socialistic ideals deliberately turns his back on all that wealth and culture can offer him takes a peasant girl to wife and settles down among the countryfolk as one of themselves  The Promised Land is the pathetic story of his gradual disenchantment and somewhat shamefaced return to civilization sacrificing in the process the noble wife of whom he is not worthy It is an exceedingly clever study of the most diverse types of character standing out against a vivid and convincing background of Danish village life and village politics The parson himself his muchenduring wife his children his selfseeking and unstable flock to whom he sacrifices in vain seven of the best years of his life and his aristocratic friends who ultimately reclaim him supply excellent entertainment The translator has on the whole done her work well Downright blunders are creditably few but her sentences are occasionally e g on pp 151 and 195 clumsy and involved faults of style which Herr Pontoppidan himself is absolutely incapable of committing The book is prettily illustrated by Nelly Erichsen,biography
A Diplomatists Wife in Many Lands 2 vols By Mrs Hugh Fraser Hutchinson  Co Animated and rather indiscreet these reminiscences should secure a wide public more especially as beneath their sparkle there lies much sound reflection Mrs Hugh Fraser who is the daughter of a wellknown American sculptor a sister of the accomplished novelist Marion Crawford and the wife of an English diplomatist has enjoyed an unusual upbringing During a girlhood spent in Italy she acquired an intimate acquaintance with society as it existed before the achievement of political unity and she remains to this day an enthusiastic defender of the old order Her arguments do not always carry persuasion but it is well to be reminded that the conquered cause was by no means destitute of ability and devotion It had also its quaint exercises of paternal authority Thus Gregory XVI displayed his zeal for morality by ordaining that the dancing girls at the opera should wear green Turkish trousers whatever the rest of their costume might be and by swaddling the figures on the tomb of Paul III in casttin draperies painted to match the colour of the marble  Officials if Prince Massimo can be taken as a type were not overscrupulous  He was for many years PostmasterGeneral and utilized hh facilities to make a valuable collection America was a long way off frcm Rome at that time  and every letter that my people received from the United States had had the ste mps boldly cut out of the envelope before it was handed over to the postman We get a pretty picture of priestly discipline in the Alban hills  The great preoccupation in the Castelli as the mountain villages are called is to keep the girls out of harms way I have heard the preacher say to the women 4 Never mind about the men they were mado of different stuff to you  They can be sometimes bad and sometimes good But you cannot A woman must be either an angel or a devil there is no place between for her  The good priest therefore used to make them work in the fields in twos and threes and he would count them at the entrance of the town when they returned to see that no girl was loitering alone Mrs Fraser does not pay compliments to those whom others would call the liberators of ItalyVictor Emmanuel for instance Farini and Garibaldi But we do not understand why a mystery should be mode of  Garibaldis Englishman His name was John Whitehead Peard he was a member of a wellknown West Country family and he died in 1880 Mrs Fraser is definite however about that staunch champion of the Temporal Power Cardinal Antonelli whom she draws with vigorous strokes  44 In appearance he was a typical South Italian small in build darkskinned with piercing narrow black eyes that seemed to see everything and tell notliing of what was passing in the busy brain behind them His face wes meant to be mobile but usually wore a fixed smile which had become a part of his armour He was a rapidly fluent talker and at once took all the burden of conversation upon himself evidently pleased with our naive admiration of the many beautiful things gathered round him in the room where he received us The Italian chapters in this book are on the whole the most interesting But Mrs Fraser seems to have a happy knack of making amusing acquaintances wherever she goes She sits opposite a benevolent old gentleman at an hotel dinner and he reveals himself as Edward Lear the author of The Book of Nonsense A firm believer in ghosts she has collected some gruesome stories about them  and it appears that Julius Hare so excelled as a narrator in that vein that he made a cousin of hers faint away In the second volume we are trans ported to Peking and confronted by the fascinating theory that there have been actually two Dowager Empresses of whom the first died during the Boxer rebellion whereupon the second who had been trained for the purpose promptly took her place Mrs Frasers argument seems to be that the redoubtable lady was too wicked at fifty to have lived to be eighty and that when eighty she looked as if she was not more than fortyfive or fifty and instead of being a tyrant had become most considerate Be that as it may she illustrates the pride of the Chinese by a significant story  after the looting of the Palace an officer offered to return some of the spoils to the Imperial family through the Chinese Ambassador Take them away exclaimed the Minister they are desecrated filthywe never want to see them again Mrs Fraser concludes with Vienna from 1880 to 1882 She does not spare the Court and some of her stories about the Empress are a little unkind She writes of the unfortunate however in a chivalrous spirit notably of Benedek the defeated at Sadowa whom she considers to have been the victim of the incompetence of others and who went to the grave without an attempt to exculpate himself In taking leave of these agreeable volumes we may remark that it was Sir Henry Wotton not Sir Thomas More who defined an ambassador as  an honest man sent to he abroad for the good of his country  p vii,biography
A Great Emergency and Oilier Tales By7 Juliana Ewing G Bell and SonsThis is a volume ot bright little stories tbe first of which is the best The boy in whose person it is written is very like a real boy and his experiences will recall many memories of private schoollife There always was sunshine when we playred cricket The hotter it was the better we liked it We had a bottle of lemonkali powder on the ground and I used to have to make fizzingcup in a tin mug for the other boys I got the water from the canal Lemonkali is delicious on a very hot dayso refreshing  But I sometimes fancied I felt a little sick afterwards if I had had a great deal The most interesting part of the story however is that which relates how the hero setting out to seek adventures and fortune was taken care of and brought safely back by a wise old bargeman and arrived at home just in time to miss taking part in the one great emergency that befell the family who were ali constantly on the lookout for opportunities of displaying presence of mind The other stories in the volume if their moral purpose is a little too obvious are at least free from any morbid cant and written with truth and liveliness,juvenile
A Hidden Foe TALES OF ADVENTURE By G A Henty Sampson Low  CoAs might be expected Mr Hentys story is emphatically a  yarn Plot and incident are its strong points The characters are simple though fairly marked and the dialogue commonplace But the veteran storyteller contrives to interest us in the difficulties Constance Corbyn has to encounter in asserting her position and vindicating the reputation of her mother  and by the time that she and her unknown cousin who has supplanted her involuntarily in the possession of the family estates have been consigned to the same ship by the astute family lawyer and thereby to romantic adventures in an open boat we become as curious in regard to the result as the hero and heroine themselves This is of a sane and optimistic order of fiction and leaves a pleasant sensation of seabreezes and ingenuous love,juvenile

A Mortal Antipathy First Opening of the JNew Portfolio By Oliver Wendell Holmes Sampson Low Tbe result of Dr Holmess first opening of his New Portfolio is a work which though a good deal of it is filled with pleasant philosophical chatmust be ranked with his novels Elsie Tenner as everyone renumbers was the tragical story of a girl who in consequence of her mother having been bitten by a rattlesnake inherited a twofold nature The interest of the second story The Guardian Angel centres round another girl whose peculiarities arise from nothing worse than a little Indian blood whioh flows in her veins The new one now before us treats of a man who through a shock in infancy caused by a heedless girlcousin has become afflicted with gynophobia For the benefit of ignorant readers it is explained that gynophobia means fear of woman The unfortunate Maurice Kirkwood had a  mortal antipathy  to all young women an antipathy so intense that the mere approach of one would put his life in danger We are introduced to him as a recluse in the village of Arrowhead where the village gossips including of course a sagacious and benevolent doctor make much more than a nine days wonder of him The book ends if not in the most natural way possible at any rate in the most pleasing way with the recovery through a fortunate peril of the sufferer and his marriage to his fair rescuer Although Dr Holmes is known to the world as a man of letters in his tastes he is evidently a doctor first and a man of letters afterwards Writing has only been his pastime He did some scribbling of which he is now ashamed in early youth and then for twentyfive years excepting when a poem was called for he put literature aside In 1857 the Atlantic Monthly was started and its then editor James Russell Lowell insisted on his friend becoming a contributor The  Breakfast Table Series  was the result The whole amount of Dr Holmess literary production is small consisting as it does tf little more than the series just named the three novels some verses and some scientific writings For the rest he has done good work in his own profession and taken little part in public matters of any kind His name appears seldom in the records of the great movements of his time He is a man who may always be trusted not to attach himself to any enterprise not eminently respectable and not to do any other outrageous thing His  mortal antipathy seems to be of anything vulgar Thoreau once said of John Brown  He would have left a Greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man   but I do not think Dr Holmes could have quite excused such a lapse and if Brown had been guilty of illusing an H he would certainly not have forgiven him The new novel like its predecessors is a study in morbid anatomy Notwithstanding j his numerous verses Dr Holmes is still a professional man and not a poet The poet finds beauty in what is natural our doctor discovers it in the abnormal To the physiologist a beautiful case is not a case of perfect health but one exhibiting wellmarked disease However interesting the cases exhibited by Dr Holmes in his novels may be to the curious student of such subjects in others they create a certain amount of disgust Elsie Fenner is the most tolerable because it is powerfully written and is relieved by studies of several healthy characters In The Guardian Anyel and still more in A Mortal Antipathy the authors professional instincts predominate Moreover in the character of Elsie Venner herself there was a certain grandeur which we fail to discover in either Myrtle Hazard or Maurice Kirkwood Dr Holmess grand personages are indeed few anywhere He concerns himself for the most part with small things blunders vulgarisms or trivial forms of virtue He can inform us that a person is heroic or great but he can rarely picture heroism or greatness to us The Introduction is perhaps the best part of the present book In it our author gives free vent to his special humour which is not rooted in wit so much as in excellent animal spirits He can bc serious of course but never solemn He is serious here looking back to his early life He has a few kindly words to say about Willis who was then  by far the most prominent American author It was a time of literary dearth when Willis and Griswold were bright particular stars No one now regards Willis as a great writer but his work was good of its kind What he undertook he did heartily and some of it is not only still readable but is still read Dr Holmes proceeds to give an account of his experience as a writer of memoirs a class of writing which involves a most intimate relation between the author and tho subject of the work  The experience of thinking another mans thoughts continuously for along time  of living oneself into another mans life for a month or a year or more is ii very curious one No matter how inuch superior to the biographer his subject may be the man who writes tlio lifo feels himself in it certain sense on the level oi tho person whose life he is writing When he sat down to write these pages ho had just finished his book on Emerson   For many months I havo been living in daily relations of intimacy with ono who seems nearer to me since lie has left us than while lie wis hore in living form and feature If the reading of biography is helpful much more so is the conscientious writing of it To share the inmost consciousness of a noble thinker to scan ones self in the white light of it pure and radiant soulthis is indeed the highest form of teaching and discipline Dr Holmess special function seems to have been to keep his contemporaries in good humour His verses havo enlivened many a social gathering and he never presents a gloomy face to the world Without the genius of Calverley in versemaking and on another side less broadly humourous than Mark Twain he yet has a place of his own of no small importance His range is narrow Perhaps it is as well his literary labours have been so much interrupted for it is easy to believe he might have written himself out Indeed his title to fame must rest finally on the  Breakfast Table Series  alone Although in these pages Dr Holmes is not at his best the book does him no discredit An author wins his laurels if at all before he is seventysix Enough if at that time of life he does nothing to dishonour them Dr Holmes unlike some othersmay still be trusted with a pen Did he not lately revise his most famous work without trying to improve it i Waltek Lewin,biography

A Year of Strangers JOYOUS ESSAYS By Yoi Pawlowska Duckworth and Co 5s net Here is the book that most of us intend to writesome day A book woven out of actual experiences owing nothing to other books to preconceived opinionsstereotyped conventions or the idle chatter of the clubs and coteries A book which expressesfaultily it may be but sincerelythe mind and soul of the author something individual and apart Our English literature which has produced many great classics contains few such books as this and they are the more valuable for their rarity It is a selfconscious age and absence of selfconsciousness is of the very essence of Yoi Pawlowskas art A certain simplicity alike of expression and of feeling is everywhere apparent Our author has wandered through Europe and into the warm mysterious lands of the near Easta solitary pilgrim But she has looked upon men and women upon small smiling cities and vast barren plains with an observant and sympathetic eye Everywhere she has found something in which to delight and she has discovered for herselfwhat we all profess to believethat there is a certain quality called  humanity  whioh binds together in an indissoluble fellowship the peoples of the world This book is full of the joy pf life of the mere delight in living One feels that each moment brings with it for the author its appropriate gift To be perfect to the present momentis not that as Pater taught us the secret of happiness  And Yoi Pawlowska is always in harmony with her surroundings whether kneeling before the dim altar of some Gothic church chatting to an unknown companion in a railway train or seeing night with the tombs and dawn with the mountains  from the Appian Way Soshe takes from lifegladly and with gratitudeall that it has to give and when she writes of  the gaiety of forest life the haunting shade of leafy valleys the laughter of running water the little cries of surprised wild things the joy of wood flowers and the glancing of sunlight on green moss through trembling branches  one is sure that these thingsseen and unnoticed each day by every one of ushave for her their message of beauty and consolation  To quote is almost an impertinence for no isolated passage can convey any idea of the delicate charm and fragrance of the whole But listen to the reflections of Yoi Pawlowska as she views Rome in the moonlight from a roof garden I move to the parapet and sit on it trying to realise all that Eome has done all that she will yet do I whisper her name softly  Roma Roma She is as beautiful now as when Neros palace crowned two of her hills She does not age because she assimilates all that conies to her becomes part of her or it cannot exist and all that belongs to her is in some ways somehowgood  Perhaps our critical faculties are dormant in great love certainly here we like what elsewhere we should find blatant and noisy She is great noble splendid What does it matter if that with which she clothes herself is sometimes glaring to our eyes P She can never be vulgar her personality is too great her simplicity too childlike She is no illusive fairy but agoddess carved in mountains free to the sky no pitiful comforter of the weak and the unfit no friend to the moral or physical degenerate but she thrusts a bar of steel into the hands of those who can fight She is a friend for the strong and the young in spirit for those who can draw strength from their dreams In every womans figure by Michael Angelo I see Rome Rome always even in the Madonna of the Pieta where a sorrowing mother sees Hope in the death of her son This  Year of Strangers  will not be exhausted by the first reading It is not perhaps a book for all readers bnt there are many who having once read it will return to it continually as to the companionship of a tried and trnsty friendA YEAR OF STRANGERS By Yoi PAWLOWSKA Duckworth  Co 5s Yoi Pawlowskas name is new to the literary world but those who read her book will not forget it These sketches are like the music of Debussy The simple unaffected literary style has that intangible undefinable quality which is in the dancing of Anna Pavlova with the same elusiveness the same tender halfsad halfloving strains in it the same vivid colour touches Written in an admirable English some of the sentences have a queerly foreign twist and this adds to rather than detracts from the charm of the book about which there is something infinitely pathetic and though there is no pathos in it once more we realise that for every real bit of art there is somewhere a broken heart Each sketch has in it a momentary lifting of the veil on the deep recesses of a soul washed white by tears each is the work of a dreamer with the heart of a child who has been face to face with the evils of life and has found beauty There is in all this an atmosphere new to literature Many have written of their travels but no one has written quite like this before Here and there we find terse bits of realism true and little understood things about men and women written by one who has proved perhaps the biggest of all truthsthat there is very little difference in the feelings of the two sexes that men as well as women are often irresponsible and unpractical even hysterical that women as well as men can be true to each other have a sense of honour and can if needs must stand alone if the common want of all creatures is a love which understands everything We have only one critical bone to pick and this is with the proof reader who has left the printer to his own devices in the matter of punctuation,biography

Afelchiors Dream and othar Tales By J H G London Bell  Daldy I870 This little volume consisting of five simple and graceful tales by Mrs Unwin which formed her first introduction into the literary arena is marked by clear promise of what has been since abundantly fulfilled It will be unnecessary to do more than give the titleof these stories which in addition to keichziors Dream are The Blackbids zVest Friedrichs Ballad A Bit of Green and l3onsieur the Viscougnts Friend A very few indications may be noticed of anunpractised hand from which later productions of the same pen are entirely free The aim of the writer is throughout pure and high but while she scorns to stop at mere entertainment she never overlooks its importance as a means of achieving a larger purpose The tales are fresh from a nature that is warm kindly and imaginative They are thoroughly permeated with a sense of the importance of the work undertaken and the wise care necessary to avoid adding one more failure to that crowd of empty moralised imbecilities which are so often thought the best pabulum for minds that are young and uninformed indeed but which have a far keener perception or rather instinct of the false and the inadequate than some good people seem aware,juvenile
Air MIidshiipman Easy By the author of PETER S1MPLI 3 vols post 8vo Saunders  Otley CAPTAIN MAIRIYAT is a deserved favourite of the public The many works which he has presented for the perusal of the novelreading worIl have all been decided hits and have wvon for him the reputation of being our best seanovelist The good qualities of his books up to the appearance of the present volumes have been progressiveand consequently from the author of Peter Simple very much was expected  nor indeed whatever blemishes the candid reviewer must point out has the hope been dlisappointed The tale is neither so full of incident nor are the characters drawn with that forcenor indeed is the whole so well finished as Peter Simple  but waith the exception of our favourite we have great pleasure in stating our conscientious opinion that Mr Midshipman Elasy is the best of the authors novels Captain Marvatt is not like mano of his tribe of litterateurs who write merely to amuse without a moral object Each of his books has a distinct end in viCe  and in each he has considered a novel as a channel through which wholesome advice may be conveyed in a palatable form and there is reason to believe that his writings have not only amused the public but have also lone no small good to the navy Whether or not  out and out radical notions are gaining ground in the service we pretend not to know if the alolbinlations of radicalism are tainting the middies all well and good  the e quality mania must be written down but if not why the gallant author has raised up a manl ot straw in order to knock him down But to tell the truth we suspect him of aiming his shafts at civil as well as naval politics Oh fie Captain MarryatThis is too bad  But to the story The hero Jack lEasv is the son of a wealthy country gentleman imbued with the revolutionary notions of equality which prevailed in England at the close of the last century which of course he is made bv the author to express in so absurd and unlimited a manner as to make the reader laugh at Mr Easys expense Jack as tiresome and obstinate a little brat as ever sucked of a wet nurse imbibes from his father at a very early period all his peculiar notions of equality and it requires all the hard discipline detailed in these three volumes to knock them out of his noddle His first acquaintance with schooldiscipline would it is reasonably supposed have opened the youngsters eves but no not even his acquaintance with the watchdog the bull and the beehive while robbing an orchard to the fruit of which in arguing the point he claims an equal right with the owner nor his ducking in the fishpond when caught poaching on a neighbours property are sufficient to convince Master Jack of the untenableness of his position The theory of equality not being satisfactorily proved on land as far as his experience goes he determines to try its truth at sea and he accordingly asserts to his father his right on the principle of equality of determining his own profession The  point is argued and Jack prevails By influence with a captain fortunately for Jack under pecuniary obligations to Mr Eiasy he is appointed midshipman on board the Harpy and in due time he makes his way to Portsmouth After enjoying his notions of equality by spending his money like a lord for three weeks and after insulting the first lieutenant of his own ship one of the best scenes in the book he goes on board and while in the service meets with a variety of adventures particularly in the Mediterranean on board in engagements and on shore all of which tend to prove the invalidity of his favourite point Jack on the whole is a lucky fellow with his vltra notions to escape mastheading or the bilbos He gets married in the end to Donna Agnes a Spanish lady whom he had once released from a prize ship and afterwards fallen in love with at Palermo Mr Easy senior becomes starkmad with the equality mania and dies Jack succeeds to eight thousand a vear leaves the navy and becomes a country gentleman and a Conservative There are some admirably humorous scenes in these volumes which might be extracted if our space allowed and we did not wish to forestall the readers lleasure Jacks learning his alphabet withhis nother and afterwards with the schoolmaster the first interview between him and the lieutenant Biggs ad venture at Gibraltar illustrative of  duty before decency and the duel scene at Malta are perhaps the best but there are many others at which we have laughed incontinently The best drawn characters are Mesty quite a bijou in his way although a black diamond Easthupp the pursers steward ci devant pickpocket Talbovs the mathematical gunner and Gascoigne the firm friend and ally of Easy the foreigners are we think rather a failure After pointing out so much that is excellent in Mr Midshipman Easy we mnay safely take up the pen to make some strictures on the book We do not go the length of saying with one of our great men that he who would make a pun would pick a pocket but we detest puns except after dinner when a few glasses of wine have made us very amiable and easy to please Written puns are absolutely intolerable need it be said that such wretched traps for horselaughers are quite unworthy of the acknowledged talents of Captain Marryat i But a much graver charge is that of representing the Roman religion and its priesthood in an odious light Such bigotry is now quite pase and can only serve to disgust the intelligent reader and injure the Captains credit The most rabid Orangemen could not paint more revolting scenes than are here given of the foul conduct of the Romish priesthood The author may have his own opinions on these matters and we will not argue the point but we question the good taste of dragging them before the public in a work of fiction Those of our readers who enjoy hearty merriment must read these volumesMr Midshipman Easy LITERATURE NOTICES OF NEW WORKS By the Author of  Peter Simple  Ja cob Faithful c 3 Vols This is a beautiful personification of a principle a working out of character that is fiction only in the events in which it is shown as in a multiplicity of mirrors hut perfectly true and real in its moral identity Had Mr Midshipman Easy existed he must per force have acted precisely as Captain Marryat has made him act and that he has actually been met with a thousand times in the naval service all who know that noble service will testify though the Midshipmen Kanya who have appeared on his Majestys books have not been placed exactly in the same situation as this Mr Midshipman Easy par excellence occupies in Captain Marryats We have given in a long extract in our preceding number a specimen of what this exciting novel is It was the opening of the tale and with the sliest humour and in the blandest style covereel the most hiting satire Of this almost every sentence was pregnant with covert wit of which not one two but three or four perusals were necessary to understand the full force The paternal Mr Kasy having allowed his goodnature to run to seed which seed proves to be the dry fruit of democratical mania carried out even to the Agrarian law anel a community of goods becomes as such a person infallibly must a madman abroad and a tyrant at home Though he finds his beloved theory of equality plants thorns on his pillow the expression is pretty though a little used and something sharper than thorns elsewhere and everywhere else he still follows it out as all other democrats do until it interferes with his own convenience and at length notwithstanding the Junior Easys assertions to the contrary the old gentleman finds it just and expedient to send his son to school This part of the story which is not at all maritime but strictly natural and highly amusing will be found philosophical also Now the embryo Mr Midshipman Easv inherits from his worthy father a most unconquerable predilection in all cases to argue the case whatever may be the tense in which he finds the circumstances or the mood in which he finds his opponent This leads the young philosopher into the most ludicrous situations out of which he always extricates himself with glory owing to the sound principle upon which he always acts of taking things easily Should he be on the horns of a bull or of a dilemma no fear for Master Easy he will contrive to lip himself ofF softly from the one without a broken bone and to extricate himself honourably from the other by making an easy cushion between them from which to combat his adversary But as neither father nor son can make many proselytes to their doctrine of equality when united like the Roman conquerors of old they resolve to divide the world between them old Easy undertaking to regenerate all that live on thc earth vonni Kasy all those who reside on the waters With a shamefully ample allowance the latter goes to sea as a midshipman Then conic thc laughable collisions between absolute authority and unqualified licence Thc reader may suppose that at first in endeavouring to take all things easy he of that name finds it goes hard with him No such tliintr He is imperturbable Command him he argues the case and produces his minorreprove him he argues the case still and produces his majorwell he is still unconquered  then to wind up the debate his superior officer proceeds to punish himbut he is not beaten  he begins logically to draw his conclusions from his premises and ultimately proves himself to be in the right by taking his punishment easily But the witty author contrives that a subject so apparently intractable shall with all his whimsies do himself great honour and his country some service By Mr Easys maimer of thinking and acting he manages to rectify errors of much better and more experienced officers and to perform achievements that would well entitle him to the epithet of more than the hero of an excellently written novel But his many droll and highly interesting adventures gradually work out an alteration in his levelling principles by teaching him that in this ever shifting world everything will ultimately find its own level worth and activity rising vice profligacy and stupidity sinking to the depths of their natural degradation lu fact Mr Easy though always liberal becomes very gentlemanly and a good Tory leaves all notions of equality to the indulgence of those who have got nothing and determines hereafter to preserve his station in society and his very excellent estate of eight thousand pounds a year with it Lucky was it for our midshipman that it was entailed  for Mr Easy senior not having been to sea to gain wisdom goes on from bad to worse from the whimsical to the extravagant and from the extravagant to thc insane All this part of the tale is a melancholy but a true picture of our fallible natures The love affair of our hero is merely an amplification of Madame de Staels aphorism that the tender passion is but an episode in the lite of man but Captain Marryat has contrived to make his midshipmans episode a very exquisite one The naval scenes as usual with this author are glorious The storm the fight the imminent danger are all portrayed in these volumes with the hand of a master The delineation of the various characters that act with Mr Easy are also first rate What a troop of creations has this writer called forth We will not use the cant of criticism and say as that cant too frequently does this is the last and best of his works It is not better than  Peter Simple nor better written than  Jacob Faithful or a more true picture of life as life really is than  Japhet in Search of a Father Each of these works has an excellence peculiar to itself which excellence could not by any possibility belong to the other Midshipman Easy is inferior to none of Captain Marryats preceding works  we think that the world will prefer it to any of them  but tliis preference ought not and will not throw his other productions into shade We shall conclude our remarks by saying that our author has given a perfect literature to the marine of our country not merely originated one to be improved by othersand the world acknowledges that the fairest and the brightest fields of fiction are now to be found on the measureless waste of thc seas over which we hope that England may be for ever

ALL THAT WAS POSSIBLE Being the Record of a Summer in the Life of Mrs Sibyl Crofts Comedian Extracted from her correspondence By Howard Overing Sturgis Osgood The author of  Tim has many friends Weak or strong Tim  was a sympathetic book the book of a man who would deal gently with human kind especially with the more fragile sensitive specimens of it Just such another is this new story but the materials and situations are entirely different  All That Was Possible deals very fearlessly with a difficult subject and though not a great nor even a remarkable book there is at least one strong thing about itthe proof it gives that the absence of prudery need abate no jot of refinement There is so little story in itthere is only a situation and its perhaps natural outcomethat it would be hardly fair to reveal it It is enough to say that the heroine whose letters to a friend tell all there is of it is a woman who has known many difficulties and has had what is known as a  past Mr Sturgiss point of view is that it has not coarsened her that she remains or rather grows more and more a woman of sensitive aspiring nature But the past dogs her footsteps then drags her back and will not let her come into social line with those who are in no way her moral superiors It is a pathetic picture What Mr Sturgiss intention was in giving this extract from her life we cannot pretend to say decisively But assuredly it was not to cry judgment on the sinner or triumphantly to show how the doors of respect must inevitably and for ever be shut on her,biography

BLACK MAGIC  Pfr Amica Silentia Lunve   is a book for the Yeats enthusiast that is to say we should not recommend it to any one who has anything else of Mr Yeatss still to read A man who knows only  Innisfree and  The Heavens Embroidered Cloths  may be left happily with the rest of the poems with the  Stories of Red Hanrahan and should he wish to know something of the poets life with the exquisite  Reveries over Childhood and Youth In  Per Amica Silentia Luna Mr Yeats is less often exquisite than affected It is not his genius that he reveals to us here but some curious crannies of his mind Of course Mr Yeatss mind is a prodigiously interesting and unusual mind and well worth exploring  but when one is following a bewildering path into a cavern one does not like the guiding light to gutter or wobble about There are moments in this volume when we fancy a bat has flown into the candle Here for instance are two consecutive sentences  One night I heard a voice that said   The love of God for every human soul is infinite for every human soul is unique  no other can satisfy the same need in God Our masters had not denied that personality outlives the body or even that its rougher shape may cling to us a while after death but only that we should seek it in those who are dead Even if we drink a glass of cold water and begin again it is impossible to make a coherent thought out of those two pieces of wisdom They need Mr George Robeys interpreting  in other words to simplify them They are the means however by which Mr Yeats softens to us the news that he believes in ghosts There was no need for Mr Yeats to protest his faith with such cocoons of Per Amica Silentia Luna By W B Yeats Macmillan  Co 45 dd net words We are too eager for knowledge at the present day to be content with derision in place of it Mr Yeats says   I have always sought to bring my mind close to the mind of Indian and Japanese poets old women in Connaught mediums in Soho because no authority seemed greater than that of this knowledge running backward to the beginning of the world We wish that he had expressed himself always as clearly and beautifully as when he says   Faith is the one gift that man can make to God It is difficult to catch the authoritative voice of conviction in a remark like the following   All souls have a vehicle or body and when one has said that with More and the Platonists one has escaped from the abstract schools who seek always the power of some Church or institution and found oneself with great poetry and superstition which is but popular poetry in a pleasant dangerous world Mr Yeats is too great an artist to make bogus confessions He is saying what he means however elaborate or deliberately casual his prose He believes that every great man has a Daemon to mingle with his life It is a Daemon literally and not figuratively speaking who inspires every man of genius the Daemon who is the creator of the work of art Mr Yeats contrasts man with his failings in daily life with man at the divine moment of artistic achievement and divides them from one another under the names of Self and AntiSelf Self is the man fretted by everyday vexations and distresses AntiSelf is the Daemon maker of a thing far greater than the man himself It is in his attempted explanation of his belief that Mr Yeats like other theologians breaks down He bases his theory in his own case on the fact that when he comes home from a dinnerparty where he has talked a great deal he experiences what one would describe if one were speaking of oneself as the feeling that one has talked for effect and made an insincere jabbering ass of oneself Mr Yeats describes his sensation thus  When I come home after meeting men who are strange to me and sometimes even after talking to women I go over all I have said in gloom and disappointment Perhaps I have overstated everything from a desire to vex or startle from hostility that is but fear or all my natural thoughts have been drowned by an undisciplined sympathy My fellow  diners have hardly seemed of mixed humanity and how should I keep my head among images of good and evil crude allegories r How indeed  Did not Charles Lamb talk for a whole evening about phrenology because a fellowguest had the misfortune to ask if Milton was a great poet   But when I shut my door and light my candle I invite a marmorean Muse an art where no thought or emotion has come to mind because another man has thought or felt something different for now there must be no reaction action only and the world must move my heart but to the hearts discovery of itselfall my thoughts have ease and joy I am all virtue and confidence It is in such moods of ecstatic confidence that Mr Yeats sees the vision that he translates for us in his work He will not accept the commonplace idea that this  heroic condition  is his true self He regards it rather as  The Lord of Terrible Aspect  who appeared to Dante and said  Egodominus tuus  the descent of the Daemon who when the moment of creation comes makes for Mr Yeats what is to him a new personality and to us his genius  When I consider the minds of my friends says Mr Yeats  among artists and emotional writers I discover a like contrast and he cites example after example of men and women who are entirely opposed in their everyday life to the nature that they reveal in their work There is an actress who is a dove upon the stage and a termagant in private life a censorious friend whose comedies are full of unpunished rogues contemporary poets who have been preoccupied with religion in their verse but with women or liquor in their lives  and Mr Yeats refers to Dantes lechery and Shakespeares  pottle pot  with the satisfaction of a man who has scored a point in a debate But this division into Self and AntiSelf is too abrupt treatment for so complicated a thing as the human mind It is impossible to divide personality with a butchers cleaver One may get interesting generalization as the result but one will not get truth If Mr Yeatss theory were correct psychologists might expect to find lyric verse behind every swollen nose The elements of a mans nature cannot be seen as separate things like the two sides of a penny but are interwoven like the branches of a tree with the air and the air with the veining branches of the tree,biography

English Fairy Tales By Joseph Jacobs D NuttAs suredly one of the most delightful collections of Fairy Tales that we possess in English and one that is of especial value since the Tales are not merely translations The word  English however is somewhat misleadingso many of the tales are Scotch It would be of interest also to know the actual source of the Tales which Mr Jacobs heard in Australia Many of the Tales are of course familiar to all students of folklore in English forms and I am not sure that Mr Jacobs versions are always the best Occasionally too one seems to miss the genuine ring not of the folktale but of the folktelling and there are certain omissions thatunless Mr Jacobs is as I hope contemplating a second volumeare difficult to account for But despite small faults of commission and omission faults one only notices because the work is so good thc volume is most welcome Only one protest  Tom Tit Tot Mr Jacobs declares is  superior to any of the Continental variants with which he is acquainted It may be that I am prejudiced and that therefore the German variant which delighted me as a child still seems to me the best Be this as it may to me at least  Rumpelstilzchen  seems more graceful more humorous and more dramatic than Tom Tit Tot But whatever the grownup folk may say the little folk will be of only one opinion concerning these  Talesthey will receive them with a chorus of delight And after all are not children the best as they are also the most honest of critics  The admirable illustrations by J D Batten are worthy of the Tales No wellregulated nursery should be without these old old stories in their charming new dressTATTERCOATS From More Erglish Fairy Tales MORE ENGLISH FAIRY TALFS Collected and Edited by IoSEPII JACOBS Illtistratel bY J  BATTEN D Nutt Mr Jacobs has kept some of the best of his tales for this volume Adhering to his former plan and stoutly defending it in his preface he has given them for the most part in the racy speech of the people but always keeping in mind that they are meant to be read and liked by children He refuses to draw a line between Scottish and English border tales and so  Rashincoatie  and  Habitrot  are here It is a delightful and at the same time a very amusing collection full of humour and insight into peasant character and customs But none of the tales are here for any such serious reason but simply because they are good to read and listen to Nfr Batten never entered more thoroughly into the spirit of the tales than he has done in this volume which should be fully as popular as any of Mr Jacobs former oncsCeltic Fain Tales Solectod and edited bv Joseph Jacobs editor of Folklore Illustrated by John D Batten Nutt Tales and Lng ends By AV Carew Hazlitt Sonnenschein  Co Mn Jacobs tolls us in the preface that his chief difficulty has been that of selecting where there is so much ready to hand His collection consists of twentysix stories representing Ireland Scotland Wales and Cornwall but chiefly Ireland and Scotland In fact tho Brythons have here onl five storiesfour from Wales  The Shepherd of Myddvai The Wooing of Olwen The Brewery of Eggshells and  Beth Gellort and one from Cornwall  The Tale of Ivan Mr Jacobs however explains that it is not his fault that Little Wales is not better represented and hopes that the Eisteddfod may do something for Welsh folklore by offering prizes for collecting folktales in the Principality This has been done to some extent but with no great rosults as yet at least so far as tho public is concerned Thus the Eisteddfod held in London a few years ago awarded a prize to the Rev Elias Owen for work done in tliis field  but what has becomo of it  We are not awaro that it has ever boon published Then as to complete stories of any length we feel pretty certain that there are none such to be found in Wales at the present day and this is our idea also as to tho time not long ago when that peculiar collector of folklore Wirt Sikes flourished Mr Jacobs gives his readers clearly to understand whero ho has found his tales and how he has dealt with them modifying or excising tho original translations from Celtic hero and there where he found them ovorliteral For his avowed object is not to appeal to English folklorists and scholars but to intorost and please a more youthful class of roaders and wo certainly think that he has boen eminently successful Mr Batten has also done his part admirably and both he and Mr Jacobs leave one under the impression that they have not themselves escaped the fascination whereby  tho captive Celt has enslaved his captor in tho realm of imagination Tho present volume accordingly attempts to begin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years and it may bo trusted to act in some measure as an antidote to the ruthless unreason of the budding Golthers of our day By no means the least interesting portion of the volume is that consisting of the thirty pages of notes to the stories These it is neodloss to say are not quite exhaustive but it would be invidious to suggest here a variety of small additions which occur to us as of interest to the specialist All the notes aro decidedly instructive reading and some such as that in which the origin of the Beth Gelert story of Llewelyn and his greyhound is traced break new ground Others illustrate accidentally the position of Mr Jacobs in the folklore world for our readers are doubtless aware that folklorists aro divided in opinion on the question of parallel developments as against borrowing Wo may cite the following passage as both explaining what we mean and dealing with a curious feature of folktales it occurs in Mr Jacobss notes on the story of  Hudden and Dudden p 248  It is indeed curious to find as M Cosquin points out a cunning fellow tied in a sack getting out by crying I wont marry the princess in countries so far apart as Ireland SicilyAfghanistanand JamaicaIt is indeed impossible to think these are disconnected and for drolls of this kind a good case has been made out for the borrowing hypotheses by M Cosquin and Mr Clouston Who borrowed from whom is another and more difficult question which has to be judged on its merits in each individual case Probably in this instance all would agree that there has been borrowing by somebody  but in some cases the other theory namely that of parallel developments in a similarity of circumstances is held by some students of folklore and to these Mr Jacobs at the recent International Folklore Congress gave the name of  casualists What is to bo the name of the other partythat to which he himself belongs Probably some such name as  niigrationists  would do as well as any other but the difference between the two schools is only one of degree the migrationists being as they themselves think more sensitive to tho numerical argument from a calculation of tho chances against independent developments in each particular instance Before we turn to Mr Hazlitts book we may bo permitted to express our regret that leisure was not found to revise the printers errols moro carefully for if words which are not English are introduced into an English book pains should be taken to have them spelt in some way recognized in the languages to which the belong  if you must needs speak of  the Cymru you should know that it means  the Wales and that you have to write  the Cymry  if you wish to allude in that way to  the Welsh people We have seen more than ono way of spelling the Gaelic word for antiquary or storyteller but ve have never before seen it made into theenachie Similarly  Archroologia Britannia and similar slips in the notes look strange and ought to disappear in future editions of which thore will we doubt not be many as the volume cannot fail to become popular and deservedly so It is difficult to know for what class of readers Mr Hazlitts book is designed Not surely for students of folklore for in the preamble to Robin Hood on his 242nd page Mr Hazlitt says that  in dealing with this ancient and favourite tradition the editor has for the first time made use of such material only as appeared to him authentic so exactly half the book is valueless for scientific purposes unless as we gather from other parts of it Mr Hazlitts command of English is not always so complete as to enable him to say what he means Students of folklore too require much more precise information than is here afforded and will naturally prefer to go to the fountain head for these interesting but wellknown old stories Neither can the book be intended for young persons  or children for various incidents are related with  the masculine frankness of the old time nor yet for lovers of ballad poetry for none such when reading a selection of ballads from the  Reliques which have been digested into prose whatever that may mean  would admit that  the probability is that many of the ancient tales here found present themselves for the first time in an intelligible form or that the handling of say for instance The Nutbrowne Maid is faithful and judicious and has made it capable of yielding to the lover of the ballad and folktale a store at once of entertainment and instruction What possible instruction is to he obtained from a translation which changes 0 lord what is

a great deal of appreciation of and contempt for theso ballads and legends we commend our readers to the preface It is written in the manner of a schoolboy who thinks that a good style can be acquired

ever the illustrations to  Powel Prince of Dyfed and  Paddy OKelly are capital He knows how to relieve his most fearsome pictures by a touch of humourEnglish Fairy Tales By Joseph Jacobs Illustrated by J D Batten Nutt The flyleaf of this book tells us how to get into it the difficulty however will not be how to get into it but how to get out of it for from first to last almost without an exception these stories are delightful There are old friends among them which never can appear too often there are others with which we have hitherto only had a bowing acquaintance and there are one or two which are entirely new We are not quite sure about the whole party being Englishone or two seem to have strayed out of Grimms  Kinder und Hausmiirchen and to have been a little weakened on the way Some of them judging from the point of view of folklore might certainly have been more appropriately included in a Scotch collection Mr Jacobs explains their appearance thus  I have also included some stories that have only been found in Lowland Scotch I have felt justified in doing this as of the twentyone folktales contained in Chamberss  Popular Rhymes of Scotland no less than sixteen are also to be found in an English form The reasoning here is not strong but the stories are good We can imagine Mr Jacobs feeling the same pious joy that thrilled the old North  Country steward who recounting to his absent lord the depredations caused by a foray made by the Scots when  the falsehearted thieving loons  drove away flocks and herds over the Border wound up by saying  But thankit be the Lord we have outstolen them The more stories of this kind that are  lifted  into books that the public are likely to read the better and as Mr Jacobs informs his readers that some day he is going  to treat the subject of the English folktale on a larger scale with all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus  his readers may for the present wink at an English fairy tale called The Laidly Worm which is avowedly patched up out of a ballad by Mr Lamb of Norham  with touches from the more ancient version  Kempton  Mr Jacobs has performed the service of compiling an excellent version of  Jack th GiantKiller from two old chapbooks itt the British Museum It is in all substantial points the same as that of which Grimm gives a summary in the notes on English folktales at the end of the  Hausmarchen A satisfactory version has long been needed for the chapbooks which told the story well seem to have been altogether superseded by those which told it badly We wonder no one took the trouble to go to the British Museum with this object before All the illustrations to this book are good but that which shows Jack entering the giants castle wearing the cap which makes him invisible is very good indeed and decidedly original In the preface to the  Cauld Lad of Hilton Mr Jacobs speaks of him as the contrariest Brownie ever known but he was not more contrary than Brownies always are or were  they always behaved just as the  Cauld Lad  did If they found things orderly and clean they at once proceeded to break furniture and crockery to turn everything topsyturvy and play uncomfortable tricks of all kinds if however the servants were dirty and disorderly and went to bed leaving their work undone the Brownie immediately began to put all in good order A Brownies mission was therefore to demoralize servants by showing them that it was wise policy to leave their work undone The servants who had to do with the Cauld Lad of Hilton Castlenot Hall by the way as Mr Jacobs has it must have been good ones or they would have suffered no inconvenience from the nightly visitant The Brownie of Hilton was however supposed to be the ghost of a poor lad working about the place who had been murdered there which may account for the servants anxiety to get rid of him Another part of a Brownies mission seems to have been to teach ingratitude for any present of clothes or of anything more substantial than a little milk or food always resulted in depriving the household of his services If a fault can be found with this book it is that we do not always quite like the way in which the stories are told Mr Jacobs says in his preface Generally speaking it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse will speak when she tells fairy tales This being the case the critic can but ask himself two questions Has Mr Jacobs done this satisfactorily  and Is it a thing that it is well to do  He has done it very well if he wishes his nurse to be a rather vulgar one of the present day It is not prudent however to adopt this form of narration unless the imaginary nurse be made to use a simple and rather antiquated phraseology as a nurse of a hundred years ago whose style was formed on the Bible might have done All the events recorded in fairy tales are supposed to have taken place long ago and seem to demand a somewhat archaic or to say the least oldfashioned form of speech The critics sense of fitness was always a little ruffled Ly Mr Dasents method of telling a tale and the same irritation is felt upon perusing such sentences as these   Dartersays she  put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em a little  or  Go you and get one o them there pies or  She sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry   or  He was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents But that did not Btop long or this in  Childe Rowland  And the thing to do is this  after you have entered the land of Fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the Burd Ellen you must out with your fathers brand and off with their head or this from  Jack and the Beanstalk    Right you are said the man  and here they are the very beans themselves he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of strangelooking beans  As you are so sharp said he I dont mind doing a swop with youyour cow for these beans  Walker  says Jack   wouldnt you like it  It is to be hoped that when Mr Jacobs republishes these stories with the  necessary paraphernalia referred to already he will carefully do away with the only thing that damps the readers pleasure in them by carefully revising the nurses languageLITERATURE FAIRY TALES Indian Fairy Tales Edited by Joseph Jacobs Nutt Fairy Tales from the Far East By Theo Gift Lawrence  Bullen Fairy Tales in other Lands By Julia Goddard Cassell  Co Scenes in Fairyland By Canon Atkinson Macmillan  Co Household Tales and Fairy Stories Routledge  Sons Mr Jacobs has put together a good collection of stories some of which were gathered into the fold of literature more than two thousand years ago in the  KathaSarit Sagara of Somadeva while others are the jetsam and flotsam of the present day rescued by Miss Frere Miss Stokes Major Temple c Here too are to be found some of the fables of Bidpai and the Jatakas Being interpreted  KathaSarit Sagara means  Ocean of the Streams of Story Did Somadevas title mean that all known stories of all known lands had streamed into the ocean of his collection and found a home there and in the country in which it was formed Mr Jacobs is evidently inclined to hold the contrary opinion and to believe that all other countries derived their fairy tales and fables from India The majority of the tales in this volume he writes  havo been known in the West in some form or other and the problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in farthest West and East Surely if as Mr Jacobs asserts they existed or began to exist at one and the same time in farthest West and East there is no problem to solve for it would be manifest that they were not transmitted from one country to another but that each had its own independent origin Some Mr Jacobs continues aa Benfey in Germany M Cosquin in France and Mr Clouston in England have declared that India is the Home of the Fairy Tale and that all European fairy tales have been brought from thence by Crusaders by Mongol missionaries by gipsies by Jews by traders by travellers We are happy to find that Mr Jacobs though he exhibits a strong leaning towards this theory does not go so far as these writers Were it true indeed we should have to believe that for more centuries than we dare to contemplate the children of rich and poor alike in Europe went supperless to bed so far as food for the imagination was concerned and that the patient peasantry spent the long dark hours when work was impossible unamused and unamusing We do not believe that they waited until the lord of the land brought back a story from the Crusades or an argosy of stories put into port from the far East we prefer to believe with the Grimmsthe farseeing fathers of all literature of research of this kindthat while the possibility nay in particular instances the probability of a story passing from one people to another and there firmly rooting itself on the foreign soil is not to be denied the property in fairy tales is common to all and that the  selfsame stories crop up again and again in places most widely remote from each other like a spring which forces its way up in spots which lie far apart and just as wherever the eye can pierce we tind domestic animals grain field and kitchen utensils household furniture armsin fact all the things without which social life would be impossibleso do we also rind sagas and stories corresponding with each other in a striking and yet independent manner They are just as much a necessity of existence as these things and only where avarice and the jarring wheels of machinery benumb every other thought can one imagine it possible to live without them This being the case in comparing the stories of various countries it is by no means necessary to attribute a storys origin to the country in which it appears to have been first current we must always remember that the number of rootstories is extremely limited so that a good deal of similarity must naturally be looked for The Jatakas or birth stories of Buddha have with the assistance of Prof RhysDavids supplied Theo Gift with nine excellent stories for children Nine however would by no means have sufficed had she not lengthened them considerably sometimes pleasantly and judiciously at others we are tempted to ask her to study one of the stories she has selected  The Tortoise that could not hold its Tongue That story bytheby in the original is told in three or four pages Theo Gift tells it in twentynine She ignores chronology and Eastern local colour with absolute frankness and courage In one sense to ignore facts of time and space is to catch the very spirit of fairyland in another to talk of perambulators in a tale which was not new when it was committed to writing in the fifth century ad gives a shock to any reader who cares about the fitness of things Deserts in Theo GiftrS stories seem to have a good deal of juicy grass interspersed with the sand  farmyards appear to be very like English farmyards  cows are called Buttercup  and buttermilk aud clover seem to be going There is a story indeed which begins Once upon a time in the days when the great great greatgrandfathers of our great great greatgrandfathers were just having their first breeches made there lived a farmer with one daughter of whom he was very fond He was a rich farmer and his fields were full of corn and clover and his orchards of apples and plums  and he had plenty of horses and cattle and sheep and poultry and pigs and pigeons and a yarddog and kitchen cat and every one of them was so well fed and cared for that even the geese in the pond said   This is the best place in the whole country to live in and so said the sage and onions too This is a hopelessly lower class nineteenth century presentment A great many more greatgreatgreatgrandfathers are needed to take us back to the time when these stories were  human natures daily food and a great deal more study to imbue us with its spirit And yet in spite of aberrations of this kind the book is often entertaining and well written We must not omit to commend Mr Oswald von Glenns illustrations The ten little stories Miss Goddard has printed will be welcomed in the nursery and probably all the better liked for bearing a strong family likeness to other stories which have long reigned supreme in that domain If the  Beauty  brings down the  Beast on the father by asking for a few samples of the great wall of China instead of the conventional rose the story is still pleasant reading and the Beast though much less interesting is as placable as the Beast of our early affections If the Japanese Red Riding Hood becomes a  Blue Mantle and the wolf turns into the allegory of the Nile the story is still a story In addition to these departures from the wellbeaten track we have a Scandinavian somewhere close to the North Pole Jack the GiantKilleronly he ought not to have been called Jan an Egyptian Puss in Boots which becomes a Cat in Yellow Slippers and a Persian Jack and the Beanstalk in which the beanstalk is turned into a carrot with a bushy top and Jack has to descend underground instead of climbing up to dangerous heights Tliis little book is sent forth with no hint of any desire to do more than amuse children From beginning to end there is not a word as to the origin of the stories or any of their incidents We accept it on its own showing the stories are prettily told Fairyland appears to be easily entered from the moorland parish over which Canon Atkinson has for forty and odd years presided and Yorkshire scenery and dialect come largely into play in his volume When they do not coin words for themselves the hero and heroine use those in vogue in Cleveland They  scuttle people off home and encounter other people who stump about cannily and laugh a ramshackle laugh The fairies too wash their clothes at  the kerd of the country side and bittle them on the big flat stones near by This is pleasant enough but when  Miss Mary who does lessons is surprised over things and continually expresses her surprise by exclaiming  Whatever will nurse say we wish she had done these lessons to more purpose Miss Mary is disappointing  instead of being witty she is snappish When she opens her mouth it is most frequently to say  Psha and in spite of her various experiences in fairyland she cannot be persuaded to believe in fairies A book of this kind makes us hasten to renew our allegiance to the incomparable Alice and the sweet unreasonableness of Lewis Carroll It is unreasonableness which never runs too long in the same groove but for ever surprises us with some unexpected change of venue while Alices good manners and politeness under trying circumstances are unfailing 4 Scenes in Fairyland shows a considerable amount of invention and fancy Were it reduced to onethird of its present length it would be infinitely better This is a description of an ingenious variation of ball playing  Then came gamea with ballsnot tennis or bowls or croquet or anything so  mortal as tehat but it was a game played in the air where the different balls chased each other as the players desired and the balls were all lustrous azure and golden and rosy and lovely green  and they wound in and out and up and down aud over and under  and when after the most amusing and intricate pursuings one players caught another playerssay a golden ball caught a blue oneit just opened and took it bodily in and became twice the size it was before And the player whose ball got most of the other balls and grew to be ad big as a great school globe as it might he was the winner It was Mr Lang who said that fairy 44 tales consist of but very few incidents grouped together in a kaleidoscopic variety of arrangement and he miht have added that the number of tales is also limited but that they are for ever and ever being grouped and regrouped that they may furnish forth a new Christmas present Let a child have the collections of Perrault Madame dAulnoy Grimm and a good collection of English fairy tales and he will henceforth see little that is new in any book of the kind The Christmas book of fairy tales seems indeed to be produced with as much regularity and in much the same way as the Christmas pudding We almost think we could give the recipe by which  Household Tales was compounded Take four or five stories from Perrault dilute those which seem to require it with good wholesome commonplace mix thoroughly with these an equal number from Madame dAulnoy a handful from Grimm and a sprinkling from Mlle de la Force or any one else who is preferred then stir in a number of old English stories and ballads and boil the mixture for six hours by the study fire Dish up in blue or scarlet and gold covers garnishing liberally with wellused illustrations  then serve 4 Cinderella is one of the stories which have been diluted Is it possible that a child can like this  44 Thero was many years ago in a distant country a gentleman who had a charming lady for his wife and very happily they lived together They had one daughter only who was very dutiful to her parents her mamma haring taken groat pains in bringing her up well But while she was still very young her mamma died to the great grief of her husband and

FA  RY tA T LES Celki ry Tals Selected and Edited by JOSEPiH JACOBS ILondon Nutt Mr Jacobs though he be editor of okLore looks not to the gay sciencc for spiritual guidaInce lie is happily conscious of the literary qIuaslity of the material he handles and remembers that rimitive man had as keen a sense of art as his mental developmnent and the hitter struggle for life would lermit And sol he has selected and edited his Celtic airy Taes not to illuminate the genesis of the human brain but with the far more laudable object of amusing the young Herein he should be successfcal At any rate he has contrived to entertain the old and perhaps the young are not vastly more ritical Mr Jacobs has thrown his net wide and has gathered in stories from the printed works of Campbell Kennedy Hyde Curtin and the rest Nor has he shrunk from editing and adapting such work as he elected to reprint Indeed his book is completely purged of pedantry his single aim being to amuse he has ingeniously blent the comic and the romantic and has positively published a book without an afterthought a conspicuous triumph in these days of moralities True in his preface he murmurs something about a union of hearts but he obtrudes no  views and one little excursion into the prevailing vice may be condoned The book has its blemishes The story of Beth Gellert for instance is wholly out of place Mr Jacobs version is a bald paraphraseworthy of a boardschool boyof the Hon W R Spencers poem Taken from an obviously literary source the narrative chimes neither in diction nor in eftect with the genuine folktale In vain does Mr Jacobs inform you that the story is an apologue which is met with in every country from India to Wales The question may scarce be answered authoritatively and there seems no reason why it should not be a record of actual experience The tidelity of the dog the sudden anger of the master may easily be matched outside the radius of folklore and once you grant the story the moral follows as a matter of course A child of six could hardly hear of elerts death and not take it as a warning against human iInPCtuLositV But even if it be a recurrence of the old type its sctting is so modern and the atsence of the supernatural and the inconsequent so marked that it were far better away However it serves to suggest to Mr Jacobs a learned note which we trust no child will be induced to read Now and then too the diction generally studied and correct descends into the commonest slang But these are venial errors  and the book in their despite is as pleasant a collection as you could wish to imeet The stories are both quaint and picturesque Of course there is not OilC that is not familiar and that has not its parallels Fair Prown anti Trei is a variant of the Cinderella or lsyche legend

Fairy Tales from Finland From the Swedish of Z Topelius by E R Christie Fisher UnwinBoth as a poet and a novelist Zacharias Topelius is undoubtedly one of the most popular of modern Scandinavian authors Tn Finland especially critics assign him a place not very far below that of Runeburg himself Abroad too his reputation is on the increase Oldfashioned folks in Germany regard him as one of the most admirably edifying of writers for the young and in America the whole cycle of his celebrated  Faltskarns Beriittelser has been translated over and over again Topelius is certainly a born teller of tales  even in that difficult genre the historical romance he has done work of merit though nobody would think of putting him on a level with such masters as Tolstoi Sienkiewicz and Jokai His tales for children are more disappointing They are full of tender feeling gentle gaiety and pretty poetical conceits but it has always seemed to us that the moral element which pervades them all more or less is somewhat too obtrusive In a word Topelius is too serious to be quite successful with children Compared with the Andersenian Miirchen the best the amiable Swede can offer us is poor indeed The present selection moreover is not a good one and a translator who could render the phrase sin mund var pi sned  his mouth was awry by his mouth was on the cross should take a few more lessons in Swedish before trying her prentice hand on a Swedish classicSOME CHILDRENS BOOKS FAIRY TALES FROM FINLAND From the Swedish of Zach Topelius by Ella k Lhristie iiiustratea by A iollana 3s 6d tinwin Even the merely domestic tales in this pretty collection those of good children rewarded and bad ones reproved have an air of romance about them Their Finnish background and allusions supply that without taking away the sympathetic homeliness from them But there are adventure stories too of children who journeyed in fairyland and held intercourse with strange and mostly delightful beings in wonderful countries that had a way of being tiansformed back into their own familiar woods and meadows before the little folks began to feel homesick Knut Fairyflute  is as pretty a tale as a child could wish for or dream aboutTALES FROM HANS ANDERSEN Illustrated by H STRATTON 2s 6d A Constable We hope Miss Stratton will make several continuations of this book Hans Andersens stories are so suggestive of From  Tales from Hans Andersen A Constable pictures that there is always an excuse for a new illustrator and this one especially in her more ambitious efforts shows so pretty a fancy and gives so graceful a reading of the favourite themes that one naturally wants her not to stop at the five tales she has treated with such marked success We should say that the type of the book makes it specially suitable for perusal by young eyes,juvenile

Faith Gartneys Girlhood childrens books By the Author of  The Gayworthys Low  Co SrEAKiNG of this delightful Btory for girls the author of  The Gayworthys says in her Preface  It makes no artistic pretension It is a simple record of something of the thought and life that lies between fourteen and twenty I dedicate it as it is to those young girls who dream and wish and strive and err and find perhaps little help to interpret their own spirits to themselves I believe and hope that there is nothing in it which shall hinder them in that which is noblest and truest May there be something that shall lift themthough by ever so littleup  Since the writer bids us regard  Faith Gartneys Girlhood  as a story for girl we must comply with her request but no rule of courtesy forbids us to say that had she neglected to define her lowly ambition we should have read the tale from beginning to end under the impression that it was a novel for adult readers and should moreover have given it a high place amongst works of prose fiction From this admission however let it not be inferred that the interest of the story lies beyond the range of any intelligent and thoughtful maidens sympathies for from first to last the book concerns itself with matters that are chief subjects for meditation and inquiry with gentle wellbred and conscientious girls who from some pointinthe period marked out by the Preface are looking forward to the coming years with hope and fear with eagerness and anxiety Beautiful accomplished and admired Faith Gartney is moving in the best society of a leading American city when a commercial crisis reduces her father from comparative opulence to very narrow circumstances Instead of crushing her powers this blow brings out the fine qualities of the girl who during her days of seeming prosperity and fivshionable gaiety has been dissatisfied with the frivolity and aimless distractions of her existence Having already often wished that life was more earnest or at least gave her a clearer field for earnest labour she finds herself face to face with misfortune and that sort of social degradation which follows upon sudden loss of wealth What shall I do  is the question forced upon her by stern circumstances In past time sho yearned for a mission in discharging which she might do good to the world and honour to herselfa career that might make others happy and herself distinguished and these old vague longings for a career Ind a dangerous tendency to make her discontented with htr worldly position and the prosaic duties of domestic life and to turn her thoughts away from tho few opportunities for useful action which every woman with a home and relatives possesses Misfortune however by rousing her affection for her brokendown father and unhappy mother gives her a wiser and more wholesome view of womans duty and in welldirected endeavours to mitigate the sorrow of her parents she loses her morbid selfconsciousness and learns by practical experience that the girl who wishes to say farewell to dejection had better think and labour as much as possible for other people and trouble herself as little as possible about her own purely selfish and earthly interests Suth is the heroine and thc tale which illustrates the graces of her moral nature and the fineness of her intellect is the brightest healthiest and most vivacious picture of domestic life in the United States that has come under our notice for many a dav In many respects tho author remiud us of M ins Yonge  but to all that ladys mst agreeable and commendable qualities she adds a wealth of racy humour and unrestrained but thoroughly feminine merriment Some of the characters are exquisitely humorous conceptions Even respect for sorrow that gnaws tho poor womans heart cannot rebliain thu reader from smiling at gaunt Miss Sampson the professional nurse who obstinately refuses to take charge of trivial cases and energetically observes  Whats the use of taking a tough job if you dont face the toughest part of it  I dont want the comfortable end of the business Somebodys got to nurse smallpox and yellow fever and ravingdistracted people and I know the Lord made me fit to do juBt that very work There aint many that he does make fit for it but Im one And if I shirked thered be a stitch dropped Capital aa two different types of American servant galism arc Miss fiattis and Gloriana MWbirk But these are only three of a dozen noticeable characters who contribute to the action of an excellent story which will be read again and again by young girls who may order what they like from the library and will find scarcely less favour with mammas Should  Faith Gartneys Girlhood teach our girls how closely English ladies resemble the gentlewomen of the American States and how much Amt rican homelife is like domestic life in England all who wish well to the two countries will have reason to thank the author,juvenile

few have been brought forward My pen has been taken up in the cause and for the benefit of my own sex for their improvemept and to their entertainment ty labosrs have been devoted Thus pompously is ushered in this work Whether in the present re finement of the world the female sex want such a champion is reasonably a subject of doubt But we trust it is nones that the triumphs it spreads by its pen will not much Tedound to its honour or augment its interests It has been observed that the heroes who win battles are seldom gainers by them this position may be extended to the combatants of the female sex whatever good they may do for othrrs they confer little on thlemselves The lady authzress before us is one who lofesses to have at heart 1 the haqpiness of the sex and thezir advancement in the graad scale of ratiopal and social existence We quote her words that the reader may judge of the pompous quaint and affected style of her writing When she wishes that the sex shoild be fired by a generous emulatiqn of those who have shone with so brighta glory in the list of female worthies we readily join with her when she wishes that they should substitute for the evanescent graces of youth

more celebrated for her wit and her dramatic powers than the scrupulous delicacy of her productions was born sometime in the reign of Charles the First By her talents she acquired the acquaintance and esteem of the wits and poets of the age Dryden Southerne Charles Cotton c c She was more than suspected of gallantry to which by her beauty her genius and situation she was peculiarly exposed Some letters addressed to a gentleman whom she poetically calls Lycidas are printed in her memoirs this attachment appears to have been no less tender than ardent and unfortunate April 16 1689 after a lingering illness Mrs Behn expired and was intered in the cloisters of WestminsterAbbey On a plain black marble stone which covers her grave is the following inscriptione Here lies a proof that wit can never be Defence enough against mortality Great Poetessoh I thy stupendous lays The world admires and the Muses praise  Much cannot be said in favour either of the trite information conveyed in the former lines of this curious epitaph or the elegance of those which followIt is said by Mr Langhame cotemporary with Mrs Behn that her memory will be long cherished among the lovers of the drama The majority of her comedies were successfulShe seems to have been a plagiarist ather from haste than sterility of imagination being at times compelled to write by pressing and urgent necessity She received the incense and compliments of the men of literature of her times among whom may be reckoned Mr Charles Cotton who prefixed to her  Lovers Watch some complimentary linesMr Charles Gibson with whom she lived in habits of friendship observes It that she extorted admiration by maintaining the force and gaiety of her genius in the midst of disappointmentHe addsI She had great strength of mind and command of her faculties being able to write in the midst of comupany and at the same time take a share in conversation Her works though reprehensible for their licentiousness abound in the language of passion Her personal qualities are thus described by the writer of her memoirs  She had an open generous temper somewhat choleric yet friendly and placable incapable of doing a wilful injury She had wit honour goodnature and judgment mistress of the arts of converration yet frank and sincere a woman of sense and a lover of pleasure more gay and free than allowed by the strict yet without transgressing tie rules af modesty The last commendation however applicable to her manners and conversation cannot it is to be regretted be extended to her writingsHer comedies and novels with the exception of Oroonoko do not serve the cause of virtue yet something must be allowed for the manners of tfe times the example of the first writers and the contagion of the court In a manuscript of Mr Oldly an attachment is mentioned between Mrs Behn and Mr Horle a gentleman of GraysIrnn who is thought to have assisted her in her literary studies Whether this gentleman was the Lycidas of whose unkindness and coldness she afterwards complains appearF though probable to be uncertain  She is thus spoken of by Mr OldlyAd Her capacity il allowed superior to most of her sex who have ventured before the public She had a command of expression and a pregnant fancy She wrote wit h facility spirit and warmth more particularly upon amatory subjects She may be called the English Sapplio She was a graceful comely woman with brown hair and a piercing eye she had a happy manner of terminating any disputes which might arise in conversation abounding in agreeable repartee and in judgment in timing her retorts She was between forty and fifty years of age age at the time of her death which was hastened by an injudicitiis physic an Besides other works she is said to have translated from the latin the last book af Mr Cowleys Poem on plants This appears inconsistent with Mr Drydens declaration in his preface to the Epistles of Ovid that the writer of the  Paraphrase of the letter of Enone

tory the common reader is perhaps not acquainted Anne Baynard only daughter of Dr Edward Baynard was born at Preston in Lancashire in 16712 Her father perceiving in her the promise of superior talents assisted their developement by a liberal education The rapid progress and improvement made by Anne in different branches of science and learning did credit to the judgment of her father and testified the promise of her early years She died prematurely in the 25th year of her age The following particulars of her character and endowments are extracted from the funeral sermon preached by John Prude at the parish church of Barnes  By this gentleman we are informed that she was well acquainted with philosophy astronomy mathematics and physics that she was snot only conversant with these sciences but a mistress of them and ihat to such a degree as few of her sex ever attained She was familiar with the writingi of the ancients in their original languages at the age of twentythree She took great pains to perfect herself in the Greek language that she might have the pleasure of reading in their native purity the works of St Chrysostom Her compositions in latin were written in a pure and elegant style I She was accustomed to declare that it was a sin to be content with alittle knowledge About twvo years previous to her death her spirits seem to have been impressed swith an idea of her early dissolution a sentiment which first suggested itself to her mind while walking alone among the tombs in a churchyard and which she indulged with a kind of superstitious complacency On her deathbed she earnestly intreated the minister who attended her to exhort all the young people of his congregation to the stud of wisdom and knowledge as the means of moral improvement and real happiness The fillowing character is given of this lady in Mr Colliers Historical Dictionary Anne Bi vnard for her prudence piety and learning deserves to have her name perpetuated She wavs not only skilled in learned languages but in all manner of literaWure and philosophy and without vanity or affectationc lJer word Were fe l il chosen and expressiveShe wvas seldom seen to snifc being rather

businegs of her life to promote his honour and glory and the great end of her study was to encounter atheists and libert nes as may appear from some severe satires written in the latin tongue in which

FICTION Set in Authority By Mrs Everard Cotes Sara Jeannette Duncan Constable 6s A novel which is serious but not dull philosophic but not dry full of purpose but not onesided is so rare and especially so among novels written by womenthat Mrs Everard Cotess new book should be read carefully and intelligently not tossed aside aa soon as the reader discovers that it is about India and the feasibility of carrying our beloved doctrines ot Liberalism into practice in that strange land Mr Broadbent himself in John Bulls Other Island was not so doughty a champion of Liberal principles as Anthony Andover Baron Tharne the Viceroy in Mrs Cotess novel In one point at any rate he was determined that a favourite doctrine of Liberalismthe equality of all men and all racesshould be made real and practical in India and so when a British private soldier is supposed to have murdered a native the Viceroy overrides the decision of the Chief Commissioner of the district in which the murder is supposed to have taken place and in effectthough the gallows are never usedprocures the condemnation of the soldier for murder And after all there was no murder and the man who is hounded to death by the Viceroy is innocent A terrible comment on the application of the principles of our glorious Liberalism to other lands than our own  But we must not give a wrong idea of this novel It is not a political objectlesson only In with the politics is wound a story of men and women of love and loss and hopes and fears which displays a number of very cleverly drawn characters whose thoughts and feelings are of deep interest The soldier by strange bonds that remain concealed till the very end is united by close ties to the Viceroy himself ancf the discovery adds pathos to the wretched muddle which everybody made ot things It is not a comforting or exhilarating story but it is a clever mature and thoughtful piece of work that will increase Mrs Cotess already high reputation,biography
FICTION THE EXQUISITE PERDITA BY E BARRINGTON Harrap 7s 6d IF anyone thinks that the historical novel is dead a perusal of the works of the lady who writes under the name of  E Barrington should undeceive him The author of these romances has a rare power of visualizing the past combined with a decided talent for dialogue and command of literary expression Though she may perhaps be charged with looking at life very largely from the standpoint of her own sex she does not make the mistake of so many clever women in treating the man as a mere foil for the portrayal of female activities and excellences In her latest book a masterly study of sentimentality the readers interest will be almost equally divided between the actress who became the first mistress of George IV as Prince of Wales and Sheridan who are represented as half in love with one another Some of the best work is in the earlier chapters where the brilliant dramatist and Drury Lane proprietor is shown cajoling Garrick to prepare Perdita for a stage career and shielding her from the advances of wouldbe admirers whilst combating his own inclinations Skilful use is made of the personality of his adorable wife Reynoldss St Cecilia in warding off undesirable complications and the latters own pathetic situation affords an effective underplot The sordid worthlessness which was hidden under the showy splendours of the prince who wooed the young actress as  Florizel is relentlessly brought out and the exposure though couched under the form of fiction is more sound historically than recent attempts to whitewash him by pseudobiography Some of the later episodes of the book though remarkable as tours de force notably the scene between Perdita and the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland the real villains of the piece are scarcely so convincing and the relations here depicted of the discarded mistress with Charles James Fox cannot be pronounced more than plausibly credible though some colour may be lent to them by the popular belief The curious in biographic fiction may contrast with the treatment of the Perdita episode the equally remarkable study on the same theme by the late Stanley Makower if they can obtain it G LE G N,biography
FICTION Tle Yewacomes By KV M THACKEIAY Londlo 3Bradbury and Evans FEW works of fict ion leave on the readers mind so strong an impression of reality as this last work of Mr Thackerays Theeasy anl indefinite yetcomplete manner in which its persons and personages are gradually set before us the unforced and apparently artless movement of the narrative tile remarkable naturalness of the conversations and eveni tile oCCaiSiOILl obscurity of some of the genealogic threads all conduce to this result and we ask ourselves like the author in his last pages can it be that the Colonel and Clive and Miss Ethel ad Lady Kew and the Reverend I Iloneyman and all their associates and1 satellites are indeedl but thin ghosts anl shadows  Vanity Fair is again the stage  the fashionable world of London fioi the p ir soseq ot the peerage to the tIpp1er stratumi of nik el folk who have no grandfathers or vorse than none the WVestend Cilus C ity sipply the wcllaccustomied scene shiftdI a littic

is not wholly owcupied in the contemplation of their virtues and glories is not much of a flatterer or toady has indeed rather a knack of bringing down these nobles to ninepence and showing that a Countess may be a mean hardhearted scheming old womana Marquis an empty coxcomb who talks very iudifflerenit Englishand that the officers of the Guards gentlemen of the clubs titled young ladies of the nobilitys ballrooms are essentially the same beings as those young bucks old fogies and pretty flirts the natives of much inferior social circles Higher up are better manners certainly as well as better wines and cookery and every variety of affair is transacted and afterwards ground into conversation with less friction and noise for which reasons no doubt among others it is that our author likes to keep good company and to write about it when he ii bent on pointing a moral and adorning a tale Besides if we receive a skilful picture of an actual phase of English society very important and interesting and hitherto one must suspect inadequately portrayed by novelwriting artists it is something to be grateful for Mr lickenss genteel people are ludicrously illcoloured and the crowd of fashionable novels are after a few patterns originally of no very clear or exact design Perhaps Mr Thackeray stands alone as the delineator of modern English aristocratic society His pictures most likely are not faultless Whose are A line here may be out of place a tint there too strong or too weak but there is quite enough evidence of faithfulness and capability in the artist to make his work a fit subject for serious study Mf r Thackerays qualiheations are peculiar and unquestionable a gentleman of education and refinement and wide knowledge of the world a practised writer with the best style for easy originality and polish of any Englishman living a deep satirist and pathetic moralist who however is cautious against overemphasis and preaching sees everything on its two sides and refuses to run wild either in objurgation or praise a lover of truth and manliness a humourist too who keeps as it were his wheels constantly lubricated with the essential oil of goodhumour and quiet drollery our author in addition to all this is one who sits at rich mens tables who knows well how the Great world is accustomed to talk and think what are its tastes and usages its opinions and prejudices and who can satirise that highbred community with so initiated an air familiar and not presumptuous censorious without boring that the Great World itself deigns to listen and murmur applause with somewhat of a new sensation A man of moral insight and high genius writing with clear understanding of his subject novels of fashionable lifethis indeed is something new in literature and deserves to make a sensation And now what is the nature of this Fashionable World according to the report of our peculiarly qualified author   Vanity Fair  Pendennis  Newcomes these three books are as far as regards their evidenee on this subject essentially one The land is a pleasant land of palaces and villas of parks and gardens of smoothrolling chariots and highstepping steeds of fair women and jewelled raiment of smiles and gayflowing chat of splendour and authority with crowds of obsequious slaves of hock and claretand cuisine for its milk and honeya land of the desire of the eyes and the pride of life Mr Thackeray has been there with observation keener than a natives and unless the witness be held dishonest or stupid we are forced from what he tells us to conclude that Haut Ton is not remarkably wise nor particularly witty nor peculiarly liberalminded nor immoderately virtuous and religions Narrow prejudices mean ambitions pride vanity pomp insolence luxury cupiditymultiform selfishness in short dressed in graceful manners and glorified with wealth and the traditions of lofty rankcan it be that any fair analysis of Haut Ton can present us for the most part with such elements as these Is the Marquis of Steyne a representative personage and his sister Lady Kew and the most noble Farintosh Is Miss Ethel to be taken as a very favourable specimen of the beautiful maidenhood of that rank and Lord Kew as of the most recommendable kind of young nobleman Does Love among these upper clwases usually signify Flirtation and Life a succession of gratiffeations and various intrigues and the World a highly artificial stage where ire always play the first parts and Nature asidesceneanddropsceneandttasugarplumand Marriage a convenient arrangement and Religion a decent bit of conservatislll sometimes rising into a temporary fashionable amusement like Potichomanie and Death a disagreeable topic and in reference to ones self a still more disagreeable occurrenceare these the polite definitions l It would appear so Perhaps our author has a spite against the upper classes But do the middle get off any better Rather worse for they are painted with all the bad qualities of their superiors with the addition of ungainly manners and a constant admiration and worship not heroic of such as live in a prouder street of Vanity Fair than themselves A doleful and depressing view of human nature surely True we have Mr Pendenniss mother and Lady Walham who are religious and selfsacrificing but depictured at the same time as somewhat narrowminded and tiresome individuals with a selfishness one degree removed as it were anl blindly devoted to their nextofkin and we have Mr Pendenniss model wife a great deal too good for him and whose principles that gentleman retaining the full consciousness of his superior wisdom condescends now and again to recognise with approbation always with the understanding that she is strictly to keep to her own place and be a model I wife and worship him The Colonel the hero of this last book an elaborate and touching portraiture is evidently brought up very close to the authors ideal of a highminded gentleman and who has read his history and failed to love him  Simple kindly generous brave full of prejudices and impulses he is perhaps the most real and certainly the most loveable of Mr i Thackerays creations We can regard him as a man whose qualities were very sweetly mixed but whose nature had struck down no deep roots and bears no fruitage of wisdom or encouragement With tears which do not brighten into fairer weather but leave a leaden cloud of despondency over the scene we quit the poor Colonels bedside in Grey Friars His son Clive is our novelists A I sample of a young man handsome lively clever generous goodnaturednon ursiteris extra Hle drinks his full share smokes immensely idles in the familiar rooms of Warrington and Mr Pendennis and talks slang there and at

cousin the beautiful flirt wishes himself a marquis or duke and hates those who are sulks over his fathers indulgence marries a plump Scotch girl and her mother and becomes permanently disgusted with existence In his companion the youngpainter John James Tidley MrThackeray seems to show a sort of half intention to illustrate the value of fixed moral principles and  the beauty of holiness  but he shies off is probably afraid of boring his readers does not feel at home here and makes the good boy a servants son a protte and humble companion of Clives and of mean and meagre person as if by way of apologising for his purity of life and simplicity of I purpose Here as it appears to us we touch on ithe worst and central fault of Mr Thackerays books The author knowing better chooses to Iwrite as  man of the world that is his platform to use a convenient Americanism his bearing towards virtue and vice is easy and genteel he is on good terms with either and patronises both We do not desire that the I novelist should be intolerant or vehement or in iany way strain his characteristic turn of thought and expression hut the question here is of the most essential of all truths and principles the opposite antagonistic nature of Virtue and Vice In manifestation they are frequently intricate and indistinguishable but radically and essentially they are in a state of infinite remotenes one from the other and on this truth depends all the grandeur inobility and awfulness of human life There can be no compromise between good and evil leniency to a sinner must not tend to the smallest toleration of his sin The application of this to the subject in hand will we believe be sufficiently clear to thoughtful readers Where the novelists lenient pencil evidently works on a firm ground of the deepest and surest principles of human life all is well but it is not so with our present author and tile result we must regard as at least very questionable We speak thus of Mr Thackeray as of a high i and influential writer and we speak with sincere and strong respect for his many admirable qualities the greater is our desire to see an end of his coquetting between good and evil bowing low to Truth with a smile or a wink to Fashion in the same moment  praising Pilgrim and Faithful yet choosing to abide with the pleasant company in Nuditty Fair The chronicler of worldly matters lie tells u4 Vol I p 365  had best be chary of applying hard names to acts which young men are doing in the world every day and so lie is he talks of blacklegs debauchees scoundrels male and female as  merry Pagans jolly rebels and repealers of the law and is never without an Horatian turn in his moralisings to the effect how pleasant those wicked days of our youth were of which we must now in due course or at least very soon begin sincerely to repent us There is more sweetness and soundness of feeling expressed in The Newcomes than in the authors previous writings his love for good and innocent people is tender and very real yet the spirit of the book is the same as that of its predecessors as The Kickleburys fur instance which the Times once attacked for its general views of society no less emphatically than it the other day eulogised the present production Let us here take the opportunity to notice a fact which we are not alone in remarking namely the striking inferiority as a general rule to which there are biilliant exceptions of the literary reviews of the Times compared with other departments of that famous paper The best available intellects of the day one would expect to find engaged here but feebleness ignorance and presumption are the frequent characteristics of a Times review In a recent article on James Montgomeryan article containing nothing of the least value and utterly contemptible in point of styleRousseau is shortly characterised as a  frantic quack  Coleridges philosophy and Swedenborgs are both of them termed enormous shamse while as a slight indication of the writers familiarity with polite literature we may mention that he spells the name of the celebrated Edinburgh Reviewer Lord Jeffrey thus Jeffery in each of the two instances where he has occasion to use it Perhaps lie is the same accurate and refined gentleman who not very long ago succeeded in making his great newspaper the laughingstock of Europe and America by reviewing Conples Positive Philosophy in despite of titlepages and biographical dictionaries and carrying the misnomer through his entire article  Returning to the Newcomes we have to observe that like Mr Pendenniss own history it is an admirably well written book the authors tolerant irony halfpathetic sarcasm manly tenderness varied experience play with soft lambency on every page Yet the traces of hurried and lesultory composition are sometimes visible and the middle portion of the book concerning  the Queen of Scots  and her bodyguard is heavy and superfluous Mr Thackeray would do better for his permanent fame though perhaps worse for his i pocket by planning his novels with more forethought and finishing them with more deliberation A great artistic fault in the present work as it appears to us is that the Colonels downfall has no relation to his character to indicate such a relation truly subtly and effectively ought to be a principal aim of the novelist or dramatist In conclusionwhat this author says of the selfishness of men and women is too true and to trace and expose the taint through its most cunning disguises is a righteous and useful work those who read with discrimination and balance may draw valuable instruction from Mr Thackerays pages but undoubtedly here is only a part of the truth and when this is displayed and philosophised about as though it were all the effect cannot but be unwholesome and degrading upon a large part of the audience Genuine unselfishness is also an element of human nature and the examples of it in real life and in the regions which great writers have the privilege of peopling are powerful to elevate and purify those by whom they are contemplated When there is exaggeration as to particulars as there often is on the part of him who displays or who contemplates such examples it is an error on the safe side a want of nicety in apportionment merely the central fact that to put it in the fewest words lMan is the child of God is infinitely great and important and admits of no exaggeration But the hard material unimaginative truth so I called which is supplied by shrewdness and knowledge of the world is a most pernicious falsity Let us never for a moment forget that the germs of the higher existence to which faith points are in being and in progress in the present and that we ought to regard our human nature and existence not only with pity and kindness and toleration but with wonder reverence and devout awe A grain of genuine imagination for that power has its moral aspect is a more enviable and valuable possession than a mine of shrewdness without it NVe speak of Mr Thackeray as of an author whose writings deservedly command a large and admiring audience and will have their place among the English classics We do not pretend to enter on an examination of their faults and merits but merely to indicate a certain tendency in them which has impressed our minds in the perusal That the same general impression will not result to every reader we can easily admit for our author is a man of true genius and his mind works in various and liberal scope Probably it is a mind not even yet arrived at its fallest maturity and culmination,biography

The Souls Destroyer appeared the lover of poetry who was fortunate enough to read it was justified in thinking that a new planet had swum within his ken The book was received with a chorus of discriminating praise and speculation became rife as to the strange and fascinating personality that lurked behind the name of William H Davies We learned just enough to whet our curiosity We learned for instance that the new poet was a onelegged man who lived in a common lodginghouse somewhere in Southwark that he enjoyed the munificent pension of 8s a week and that most wonderful of all he had contrived to publish his verses at his own expense This sounded promising  but like Oliver Twist we wanted more At length Mr Davies has taken pity on our ignorance He has told us the plain and unvarnished story of his life And a marvellous record it is  In these days incident having deserted the region of fiction is forced to fly to autobiography as to a welcome sanctuary Certainly  The Autobiography of a SuperTramp we like not the title by the way it is too slavishly Shavian contains enough adventure to fit out a dozen romances by say Mr Rolf Boldrewood Its author has tramped it up hill and down dale  he is equally at home on the highroads of America or in the slums of our English cities He has known the agonies of starvation and by dint of considerable practice has acquired the difficult art of begging His companions have been thieves vagrants and mendicants Not since Borrow it seems safe to say have we had a presentment so vivid forceful and intimate of the inner lives of these delightful people And the strange thing about it all is that Mr Davies himself appears to be a man with essentially domestic instincts a lover of the fireside and the companionship of men and books He has gone through the world weaving his wonderful experiences into song and with an eye always on the end of wanderingthe happy haven that awaits the tired voyager It is difficultindeed it is almost impossibleto quote from this volume so full is every chapter of strange and exciting matter But one incident in this Odyssey of a vagabond must not go unrecorded The scene is America Mr Davies and a companion tramp had been found guilty of the crime of trespassing on a railroad They were each fined five dollars by the Judge Hot with indignation Davies refused to disgorge a cent The remainder must be told in his own words  Judge Stevens looked at us steadily for a time and then asked this astounding question Boys how much are you prepared to pay Brum who had very little sense of justice and being such a good beggar set very little value on money asked the Judge if he would accept three dollars from each of us If I had been alone at this time I would have paid nothing but to save Brum from going to prison who I knew would support me through all I satisfied myself that if the Judge approved of this amount I would pay it without further comment The Judge appeared to weigh the matter seriously and then cried with a magnanimity that was irresistible  Pass over the dollars boys  you shall have a chance this time As a record of a life lived in defiance of all the conventional rules of our modern civilisation this volume is of priceless value Its freshness of outlook and spontaneity of expression together with its entire freedom from cant make it in every sense of the term a truly remarkable production Mr Shaw contributes a characteristic Preface,biography

ftebttwo THE TENANT OF WILDFFLL HA LL By ACTON  BULL 3 vols London T C Newby IT would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under We should almost be inclined to suppose that I The Tenant of Wildfell Hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for I a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion The difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing But it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the Tenant of Wildfell Hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul With the plot of 1 The Tenant of Wildfell Hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  Tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant Mrs Graham the widow lady in question lives at Wildfell Hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genltemen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled We must do her the jutice to state that however much she may paint we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s razsis Wiinporte Mrs Graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one Gilbert Markham a young gentleman of a somewhat sanguine tem perament who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood Mr Gilbert Markham seems to have a soul above the farmyard and piggeries in short a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket and supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks Paying a visit one evening to the Hall for the purpose of ascertaining how Mrs Graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat And here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  But I gave one look back before I closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet I withdrew in silence I felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings I To tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as I descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself But before I was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her I had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back I began to think Why am I hurrying so fast inl this direction  Can I find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that I want at home  and can I leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  Instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  There was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon I walked back to get a better view of it When it rose in sight I stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction Something called me nearernearer stilland why nQt pray  Might I not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm August night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could I endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  I had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear It may be true till I had shouted aloud 4 It is false  I defy you to make me suppose it  1 I could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlor window I went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing I could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before I went There is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated But  I had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before I vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if I found her still in deep distress perhaps I might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things I should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity I looked  her chair was vacant so was the room But at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  Come out I want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  Here then were she and Rachel coming to take a walk in the garden I wished myself safe back over the wall  I stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightMrs Graham followed by another not Rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall Oh  Heavens how my temples throbbed Intense anxiety darkened my sight but I thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was Mr Lawrence  You should not let it worry you so much Helen said he I will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  I did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that I could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply I heard it plainly enough  But I must leave this place Frederick she said  I never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but I cannot rest here Now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle Here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as Mr Acton Bell Even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract It is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to thei vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation There can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice But this is bad and in young writers particularly so It shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success But we shall make one inore extract froin Mr Bell in order to show why we find fault Mr Gilbert Markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotW of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney The twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own As I trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies I heard another horse at no great distance behind me but I never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections I was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper I lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me He accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was Mr Lawrence  Instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but I restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back He fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  I replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    This looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin But our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says I grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before I opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within sMarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  You have found your hopes defeated  but how am I to blame for it I warned you beforehand you know but you would not  He said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow I had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head Continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor Lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader He says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so Mr Markham gallops off leaving Lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose Having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose But let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style I dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside I Its good enough for you I muttered My next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till I got hold of the bridle but then I must see him in the saddle  Here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and Ill help you to mount No he turned from me in disgust I attempted to take him bv the arm He shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  What you wont  Well You may sit there till doomsday for what I care But I suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body Ill just bind that up for you  Let me alone if you please   But we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action The  Tenant of Wildfell Mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothingI The Tenant of 9ildfeU HaU BYACtON BELL Newby  LIKE the other novels by the BELLS there is much to object to in this There are unnatural personages and isolated specimens It is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed Yet does it rivet the attention Only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness It is not always advisable to tell the truth Disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt It was the error of Sir EDWARD BLULWERS Lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement In Wildfell Hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives Now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon Boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge No amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work In its plot Wildfell Hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author We trust that in future Mr ACTON BELL will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork An extract or two will shew how near to the style of CURRFR BELL is the composition of this taleWILDFVLIL HALL Near the top of this hill about two miles from LindenCar stood Wildfell Hall a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of Scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and

and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds

withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants And here is A DOMESTIC PICTIRE I wth too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when I complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade Rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain re markable comments  Well if it had been me now I should have had no tea at allif it had been Fergus even he would have had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youIts always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if I dont attend to that she whispers  Dont eat so much of that Rose Gilbert will like it for his supperrs nothing at allin the parlour its  Come Rose put

most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house any thing will do for the ladies   And very good doctrine too said my mother  Gilbert thinks so Im sure A Very convenient doctrine for us at all events said I  but if you would really study my pleavure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for Rose I have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it But for you I might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif Rose did not enlighten me now and then and I should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much I owe you  Ah and you never will know Gilbert till youre

ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference  It will do me good mother I was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas I but to exert my own towards them and when I marry I shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her I would rather give than receive  Oh thats all nonsense my dearits mere boys talk that  Youll soon tire of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming aid then comes the trial  Well then we must bear one anothers burdens  Then you must fall each into your proper place Youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its your business to please yourself and hers to please you Im sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived and after the first six months or so were over I should as soon have expected him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me He always said I was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless him he was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a reason always did justice to my good dinners and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delayand thats as much as any woman can expect of any man   Hypocrite   I exclaimed and he held his breath and looked very blank turned white about the gills and went

Bell London Newby TIF names of Acton Bell Currer Bell and Ellis Bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world The novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a Yorkshirewoman Jane Eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the Bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is The Tenant of Wildfell Hall These two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other That the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of Jane Eyre is a fair proof She has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels And for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in Jane FPyre and in the tale now before uts We should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new Jane Eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever Perused It is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales It is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification The heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unIfeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew The Teniant of Wfeildrl Hail is also a species of autobiography One third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of Jane Eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband Throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader All are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species She is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of Iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days By and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate In the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations Nevertheless on the whole we should say that The Tenant of Wildfell lail is not so 1xad a book as Jane Eyre There is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters The hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor The religioMIN seltiments wvhich the authoress puts

GEORGE ELIOT Although probably George Eliot is no longer a household word to us the literary preeminence of her work amply justifies the  conscientious anl prolonged labourr which Mliss leakin has devoted to the detail of her early life We are not indeed prepared to accept without qualification the theory said to have been established by M Ernmile Legouis that the  adolescence of genius  is not only great enough to engage the investigators concen trated powers but  from the standpoint of literarv origins more important than anv other phase of a career But no one can 1uestion the interest which must alwavs be felt about the parentage childhood and education of a favourite author especially one who seenis to identify herself so thoroughly as eorge Elliot with the dreams and sufferings of her characters 11er personality in fact will carry with it an explanation of that strange mingling of intellectual arrogance and aloofness with lassionate sympathy which characterises her art Miss D ea kin in one of her few critical comments has quoted the  wise and tender words  of Mr Gilfil ol sees us as we are altogether not in starate telitig or actions as our fellowmen do    Our thoughts

net Herbert  Daniel By teini5ssi  nof Fredhk Hollar For he had grat poaeeaaioas By G F Watts worse than we are just as they are often better than we are We are always doing each other injustice and thinking better or worse of each other than we deserve because we oniv hear andi see separate actions We dont see each others whole nature Then she says  This was one of the things George Eliot longed to sav That way that God has of seeing us is the wav the true artist has it is the way George Eliot herself had This emphatic and picturesque statement however does not cover the whole matter and somewhat depreciates the value of the personal insight which Miss DLeakin has specially set herself to afford For much of George Eliots power comes from that halfknowledge which we derive from our own experience As we all know she put much of herself into Maggie Tulliver she had faced in her own person many of the problems confronting Romola and Esther Lvon wendolen Dorothea and Will Ladislaw We mav learn from this  Early life how faithfully her novels reflect her deepest convictions on men and life It proves also that like her own heroines she seldom depended on her own judgment however tenaciouslv if not dogmatically she would pronounce upon the convictions she had acquired At every stage of her intellectual or emotional development she confesses to an  absolute need of some one person who should be all in all to her and to whom she should he all in all Probably without George  Henry Lewes she would never have written a novel Each of the many religious phases through which Miss Deakin has traced her was dlue directlv to the personal influences As Mliss NMeynell expresses it in each case the apostolic man becomes the womans conscience Such chances it will be remembered were at an end before the publication of her first novelin her thirtyninth year She had then settled town into a broad humanitarianism subscribing to no definite creed but convinced  of the efficacy thit lies in all sincere faith and the spiritual blight that comes with no faith Miss Mlevnell i n d e e d defines her ethical code as  uncom promisingly Christian  and  verv hard admitting no possibility of  compromise or dispensation the code of a woman who in her own conulict of life has broken all the pledges made and implied for her by her parentage kin and educlation On the personal aspect of this question Miss Deakin reveals more sy impathetic generositt greater subtlety andi in our opinion more justice She enleavours to show that eorge Eliot never put greater value on the restrictioins of conventionality than when she broke them In her opinion only exceptional circunimtances like her own coiuld maake reeltlion permissible She never resented  the qluick condemination  of public opinion however much the mistinderstanding of friends hurt her Privately she held herself justified and never regarded the teaching of her novels as an atonement Thev upheld what she had always believed  what in her own heart she felt she had practised Miss Deakin has justified her contention by reliable evidence perhaps the most valuable part of her work She also tells us how early in life George Eliot was puzzled by finding that glory was an attendant on luck instead of on goodness 9 and that like Maggie Tulliver  at a very early age she got the idea into her head that she would become a person of importance in the world We find her accepting a  compromise  with her father on the trying question of religious observances and are assured that however autobiographical or reminiscent her books contained no actual portraits from real life There is too an interesting passage about the  tidiness  of her writing which recalls Mrs Poysers dairy a quality evincing selfdiscipline and conscientiousness not entirely congenial to the highest art Yet surely it is as an artist that George Eliot will live by her characterization her insight and her wit her genius for dialogue invention and narrative She has given us a glorious gallery of fulllength portraits increasing the number of our intimate friends and through them the problems of life which have an endless fascination for all who care to think In that sense her work remains as Dr Herford puts it  a great and still unexhausted literary and ethical force Miss Deakin could not give us too much detail in illustration of her personality and her powers though only the serious student will wish to follow so closely her various incursions into philosophy It is not as a thinker that we value George Eliot today The quotations and deductions from her letters and journals are most welcome we could willingly have been spared some of her essays and reviews R BRIMLEY JOHNSON,biography

HERE AND THERE Durbar By Dennis Kincaid 7s 6d Chatto  Windus The Lord of Life By Neil Bell 7s 6d Collins DoverOstend By  Taffrail 7s 6d Hodder  Stoughton Mammon By Robert Neumann 7s 6d Peter Davies The Rest Is Silence Bv C and  Scharten Antink s 6d Rich  Cowan These five novels can be safely recommended to readers in search of stories which are far removed from the doings of everyday English life Mlr Kincaid takes us to an Indian native state and the two foreign novels deal with international finance and life in Italian prisons Mr Bell and  Taffrail certainly begin their stories with conventional English backgrounds but they soon sweep us into adventures and excitements which have nothing in common with our ordinary experience The most exotically minded reader can hardly complain that these five authors have not served him well  Durbar  is Mr Kincaids first novel and his account of twentyfour crowded hours in the life of an Indian state is written with freshness and vigour Some of his descriptive passages are slightly overloaded with detail but that is a small fault in a book which has so many virtues The Rajah who was educated at Oxford his unhappy wife and the Princess Indira who sponsors the plot against him are vividly realised characters and their strangeness is well contrasted with the Western equanimity of the British Resident and his wife The discovery and overthrow of the plot to assassinate the Rajah lead to an unexpected climax which brings with it the dawn of a new hope for the imaginary state in which the action has taken place The story is tense and exciting but the great value of  Durbar lies in its picture of a section of Indian life which is quite different from the usual AngloIndian scene Mr Neil Bell begins his new novel with a study of a small shopkeeper in a provincial town but the ham and beef shop at the corner of Franklin Road is swept away in the general chaos when a scientist annihilates several atoms and destroys the civilised world A number of men and one woman who were making a trial trip in a new submarine are lucky enough to survive and the responsibility for preserving the human race devolves on this small community Mr Bell has made good use of the opportunities which such a situation provides but the experiences of his solitary heroine in an otherwise male community become in the end a little monotonous There is no monotony however in  Taffrails crossChannel thriller DoverOstend An innocent lieutenant commander comes back to England for the simple delights of five weeks leave and before the first evening is over he is in the hands of a gang of villains who force him to take a reluctant part in an act of piracy in the English Channel The story is told in a pleasantly breezy manner and the author almost makes us believe that it would be quite feasible for a gang of criminals to hold up a crossChannel steamer on its way from Dover to Ostend Herr Robert Neumanns Mammon  is a strange and uneven work which seeks to depict the ramifications and chicanery of international finance Much of the book is interesting and it is often amusing but the development of the plot is so intricate that only readers with a considerable store of patience will be able to follow Herr Neumann from beginning to end The Dutch authors of  The Rest is Silence have told a simple story of a convict in an Italian prison who is sustained in his years of captivity by the vision of a womanprisoner whom he hopes to meet again when he is freed There is a certain charm in the study of peasant character but the authors have failed to create any real feelings of sympathy for their distinctly sordid hero EDGAR HOLTPhoto by E 0 oppi Don Marquis whose striking drama ox the betrayal and trial of Christ The Dark Hours was published recently by Mr Jonathan Cape HERE AND THERE Too many of the stories in Mrs Whartons new book do no more than exhibit her craftsmanship Of that there is now no doubt and it is a pity that she should expend time on themes which rouse her ingenuity challenge her skill but little and do not really move her Unmoved herself she cannot move the reader only in two tales does she achieve the effect of having something that must be said of presenting characters with whom she has lived and whom she desires us to know the fates and the mischances of them One of the stories is a tale of  beyond  Bewitched It has something of the indeterminate fear that belongs to the genuine as distinct from the manufactured ghost story How Rutledge was haunted with what ghostly visitor he made his rendezvous and how their intimacy was finally dissolved remains uncertain what is not uncertain is the power and the suggestive discomfort of the story The hard farmers Orrin Bosworth Deacon Hibben and Sylvester Brend Saul Rutledge deceiving or deceived Mrs Rutledge harsh determined not to be deceivedall these characters live and there is a deadly determination in the way in which their combined efforts do to death someone or something frail and beautiful helpless in momentary beauty Better still is  The Seed of the Faith a story of a mission in Morocco and its hopeless ignorant yet not ignoble struggle in the face of triumphant sensuality and hard bitter confident religion It is surprising in this story how Mrs Wharton contrives to make you respect and even like the old missionary half crazy in his final spurt of misguided zeal while your reason and your charity can only condemn his stupidity and his bigotry Mr OFlahertys temptation is overabundance Not since Maupassant I think has there been a writer who can so quickly make out of an incident a glimpse an overheard scrap of dialogue a broken fragment of memory something which arrests the attention quickens the blood or numbs the mind His very skill leads him at times to take subjects or incidents scarcely worthy of his power and this volume in spite of some halfdozen really magnificently wrought vignettes cannot be put on a level with that admirable and haunting novel he gave us last  The Informer The best things in this book are however equal to the best he has given usthat is they rank with Maupassants work and Kiplings early sketches as supreme examples of the realistic method Yet there is more than realism in Mr OFlahertys tales He is never as detached as Maupassantand he was never completely detachedfor he is always ridden by the angel of pity and haunted   Here and Beyond By Edith Wharton AppletonThe Tent By Liam OFlaherty Jonathan Cape Three or more Graces By Aldous Huxley Chatto  Windus The Domino Club By Allen Upward Faber  Gwyer 7s 6d each by the demon of anger and his own view of life comes out not only in his treatment but in his choice of subjects While his sketches of Irish life of rebels perverts peasants lawyers politicians are scrupulously unflattering they are never unfair If we get in  The Outcast a portrait of a priest who serves Belial rather than Christ we get in  Charity  a portrait of a kindness which only Christianity has fostered and is ready to defend the simple kindness of a child or a wise fool There is a wild humour in a few of the sketches as in  A Red Petticoat and Mr OFlaherty betrays the same flaming impatience at the war in Ireland as inspires Mr OCaseys work One story in the book a terrible even revolting story  The Sensualist might almost have been written by Tolstoy for in it Mr OFlaherty definitely abandons the pure realistic method and writes a tract of extreme bitterness and force against the crazy sensualism which indulged in carries man back to the impersonal animal life out of which he has slowly emerged That there are more ways than one of slipping back into that older world can be learnt from the first and most important of the stories in Mr Huxleys new book I cannot agree with those who see in  Three or More Graces the best work Mr Huxley has yet done It is more ambitious in theme than any he has yet attempted but he is not yet equal to the theme either emotionally o r spiritually You cannot be witty with such a subject as the dissolution of personality unless you are frankly writing farce and Mr Huxley has not helped matters by trying to soften the edges of his wit by the appalling and tiresome mono logues of Kingham Kingham seems to me a character borrowed from one of Mr D H Lawrences novels Even in the wild exotic world of that novelist it is difficult to believe that these creatures misbehaviours would be tolerated I am quite sure Kingham would be kicked often and hardactually or metaphoricallyin the politic world of Mr Huxley Grace Comfrey married to John Peddley Mr Huxley has a great talent for names is a woman who is always as it were framing herself She sees herself as this or that definite type and within the limitations of the type behaves congruously The disasters which occur to her through her lack of a fixed personality are only what might be expected in an age with no fixed standards Mr Huxley is unusual among the younger novelists in his realisation of the excessive boredom and the more excessive tiresomeness of  free  modern society It is like a dirtyminded dormitory He follows Graces changes with remarkable patience but he has not really enough imaginative sympathy to show us the woman herself or to show us the lack of a self This is not harsh criticism it is only saying that Mr Huxley has not yet got the emotional experience to deal adequately with a subject that might have taxed Dostoievsky The other stories are slighter and variations on themes which Mr Huxley has already almost exhausted  The Monocle is one more study in dirt noise inanity and vanity  HalfHoliday is a savage little attack on the more idiotic more selfish society woman  Fairy Godmother is another warning to elderly charmers to be careful when Mr Huxley is taking notes He has not been bored by vain women for nothingnro will be Mr Upward has written much better books than  The Domino Club and I hope he will do so again It is difficult to be more than politely unimpressed by this very conventional story of the young medical man and the Lady Violet Bredwardine Mr Upwards great physician Sir Frank Tarleton is an equally conventional figure and it is disappointing that this first introduction of psychoanalysis into detective fiction should result in a story that has no distinction of style or novelty of treatment R ELLIS ROBERTS,juvenile

its own After a while came The Charwomans Daurhter and showed plainly that a writer of proe had emerged too Now in The Crock of Gold this author gives the measure of a larger and more individual talent than could have been absolutely foretold His work is neither a fairy tale nor an essay nor an allegory nor a novel although it has features of all these forms there has been nothing hitherto quite like it but it is safe to prophesy that by and by there will be plenty of imitators to take it for their pattern In some respects the book is characteristically Irish Modern English writers can introduce fairies but they cannot succeed in treating them quite as a matter of course Even Mr Barrie seems to be always hinting to us how pretty and quaint his fairies are But to Mr Stephens as to Mr Yeatsand formerly to Blakefairies are as natural as sparrows neither Irishman would feel a quiver of surprise at encountering a  leprecaun  in any woodland walk nor deem that there was any incongruity in the association upon the same page of leprecauns and policemen Indeed one of the triumphs of The Crock of Gold  is the mingling of the wildest fantasies with sudden gleams of melancholy realism In chap xvi the Philosopher who forms the connecting thread of the narrative is lying awake in prison hearing the lifehistories of his two companionsunvarnished tales of contemporary poverty and privation such as might but for their beautiful simplicity of style have come straight from the registers of the Charty Organization Society In chap xvii the child ad the fosterchild of the Phlsher are carrying back a crock of gol t the leprecauns and afterwards resting themlv against the flanks of a friendly cow and hearing her highly instructive conversation with a fly We read on without a jar and every now and then some wise or whimsical saying arrests our delighted progress A lite later perhaps Aim like a view through a suddenly Unshuttered window the picture of se landscape painted in a few words The style which conveys these excellent thring reminds us now of one good writer now of another but never of a bad one and in spite of these links of kindred remains alwa personal in its flavour In short Mr Stephens has produced a remarkably fine and attractive work of artThe Crock of Gold Fiction By James Stephens Macmillan and Co 5s IT is a very excellent thing when the watcher on the toweras the reviewer is imagined to be by the guileless of heartmay leave his post and simply pull a joyous peal on the bells of praise It is splendid to sheathe the sword on ones hipto think for one moment of the petty scalpel of criticism by so dignified a titleand to pull vigorously on because the merry clangour over ones head is the only thing proportionate to the joy in the soul Really that office is won more often than it would appear when it takes a little courage to fulfil it but no courage should be needed in the case of the  Crock of Gold The Crock of Gold itself has little to do with the subject Neither have the two Philosophers nor their two respective wives the Grey Woman of Dun Gorrin and the Thin Woman of Inis Magrath nor for that matter their two children nor the Leprechauns nor Pan nor Angus Og nor Caitilin Ni Murrachu There is only one person who has anything to do with the book and that is Mr Stephens who has given some considerable care to Blake and a good deal of care to his own devilment In fact he has given so much care to Blake that he has not altogether digested that mighty mans st heme of things being too content to give it speech cn his own lips with a disorder of idea that it had not in its originators brain That is an incidental complaint common to most of Blakes readers who cannot step quite as decisively as the strong man himself did in the involutions of his scheme of things But the inspiring spirit is here and it gives a singing beauty to Mr Stephens own devilment That devilment is undeniable It both makes and mars the book It was a very good thing for one of the two philosophers and his wife the Grey Woman of Dun Gortin that they in a surfeit of life spun round like tops till they died or they would have added to the number of people in whom our interest is aroused to remain unresolved at the end of the book Caitilin Ni Murrachu leaves Pan for Angus Og and that is an end of herand a very good end too one may say But her father Meehawl MacMurrachu who stole the Crock of Gold and was singularly afflicted by the Leprechauns in consequence is never heard of again The surviving philosopher is rescued from prison by the Shoe after their hosting we are told but the manner of it we are not told nor are we told why the Shee hosted nor what came of it in the larger purpose of things The book concludes with four dots to signify a conclusion that is no conclusion The remaining half a page should have been filled with dots had Mr Stephens wished adequately to signify the unconcluded interest But the characters happen not to be the matter of our interest It is Mr Stephens who provides that interest and the characters are only by way of a framework on which he may stretch himself We have spoken of hts spirit in the book as one of devilment but it must be understood that it is that manner of devilment that is full of wisdom the inspiration of which indeed is wisdom No man can dance down the road and leap and laugh in the sun and pluck flowers where he will and stretch in the fields when he will without having joy in his heart and he cannot have that joy in his heart without having wisdom in his soul He cannot tell us that wisdom since wisdom defies the intellect He can only communicate that joy to us and we may find the wisdom for ourselves The phrase of his song the light in his eyes the sunlight on a blossom in his hand may communicate that joy to us but if it cannot it will not so irresponsible is it And such is the procedure of the book Being what it is it is a little matter that it is unconcluded or that its characters are not taken to the end of their history in the tangle of interest aroused by the Crock of Gold even as it is a small matter that the song sung on the roadside should lack an ending The manner of the singing was all there and the manner of the telling is all here It is such chance things that recreate the sunshine that is the air of joy and wisdom not a wellframed tale and a concluded interest We can scarcely imagine anyone reading this book without having a sunshine kindled in his soul and without looking with a kindlier and wiser eye on his dear Mother Earth and his Brother Man And if Mr Stephens wants a better praise than that then he is a different man from that we have taken him forTHE CROCK OF GOLD BY JAMES STEPHENS London Macmillan Ss net MR STEPHENS makes a mortal maid and her divine bridegroom sing to the lovers of gaiety a song which ends  Has the attorney enchanted thee    Come away for the game has begun lightly the wind is sounding over the hill the sun laughs down into the valley and the sea leaps upon the shingle panting for joy dancing dancing dancing for joy No one who knows Mr Stephens poetry will doubt that he can very well sing such a song as might undo the attorneys enchantment He has a capacity for lightness and gaiety which can only be called blitheness a very rare quality Blitheness runs and dances all through this narrative saves it and makes it It is unconsciously and alas too consciously also aimed against the sadness which is due to the fact that man has departed from nature and lives by crafty and twisted thought It asserts and when it does not assert it almost proves that a Leprecaun is of more value to the Earth than is a Prime Minister or a stockbroker because a Leprecaun dances and makes merry while a Prime Minister knows nothing of these natural virtues We are positivelv assured that the Crown of Life is to be found not by the Thoughtful or the Good but the Gay Ones the Adventurous Ones the Careless Plungers An old thief declares that it is easy enough to have brains but not a little gaiety or carelessness or childishness It is however the chief merit of the book that it unconsciously declares what by an indiscretion of art it makes the subject of half a dozen sermons We are a little tired of hearing that The good are always the merry save by an evil chance but we shall never be tired of a merry heart that goes all the way through a novel of over three hundred pages The story has flaws in it which possibly Mr Stephens would laugh at and he can afford to since he trips on and on with so agreeable a mixture of naivete and choiceness He has never written a poem so pleasant to read nor is he likely soon to find a rival for lightness quickness and gaiety

I The Tenant of 9ildfeU HaU BYACtON BELL Newby  LIKE the other novels by the BELLS there is much to object to in this There are unnatural personages and isolated specimens It is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed Yet does it rivet the attention Only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness It is not always advisable to tell the truth Disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt It was the error of Sir EDWARD BLULWERS Lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement In Wildfell Hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives Now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon Boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge No amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work In its plot Wildfell Hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author We trust that in future Mr ACTON BELL will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork An extract or two will shew how near to the style of CURRFR BELL is the composition of this taleWILDFVLIL HALL Near the top of this hill about two miles from LindenCar stood Wildfell Hall a superannuated mansion of the Elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of Scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself Behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed The close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds I withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants And here is A DOMESTIC PICTIRE I wth too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when I complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade Rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain re markable comments  Well if it had been me now I should have had no tea at allif it had been Fergus even he would have had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youIts always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if I dont attend to that she whispers  Dont eat so much of that Rose Gilbert will like it for his

you put plenty of currants in the cake Fergus likes plenty If I say Well mamma I dont Im told I ought not to think of myself You know Rose in all household matters we have only two things to consider first whats proper to be done and secondly whats most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house any thing will do for the ladies   And very good doctrine too said my mother  Gilbert thinks so Im sure A Very convenient doctrine for us at all events said I  but if you would really study my pleavure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for Rose I have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it But for you I might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif Rose did not enlighten me now and then and I should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much I owe you  Ah and you never will know Gilbert till youre married Then when youve got some trifling sef cornceited girl like Eliza Millward careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage or some misguided obstinate woman like Mrs Graham ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference  It will do me good mother I was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas I but to exert my own towards them and when I marry I shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her I would rather give than receive  Oh thats all nonsense my dearits mere boys talk that  Youll soon tire of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming aid then comes the trial  Well then we must bear one anothers burdens  Then you must fall each into your proper place Youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its

him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me He always said I was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless him he was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a

THE TENANT OF WILDFFLL HA LL By ACTON  BULL 3 vols London T C Newby IT would seem that the author of these volumes we are about to notice is one of a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under We should almost be inclined to suppose that I The Tenant of Wildfell Hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for I a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion The difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing But it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the Tenant of Wildfell Hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul With the plot of 1 The Tenant of Wildfell Hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  Tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant Mrs Graham the widow lady in question lives at Wildfell Hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of the said genltemen in the somewhat refilled amusement of painting in which delightful art she is somewhat skilled We must do her the jutice to state that however much she may paint we leave no evidence that s4ie rouge s razsis Wiinporte Mrs Graham has made a decided conquest in the person of one Gilbert Markham a young gentleman of a somewhat sanguine tem perament who farms a few acres in the neighbourhood Mr Gilbert Markham seems to have a soul above the farmyard and piggeries in short a more sentimental one than is generally met with under cover of a fustian shooting jacket and supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks Paying a visit one evening to the Hall for the purpose of ascertaining how Mrs Graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat And here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  But I gave one look back before I closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet I withdrew in silence I felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings I To tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as I descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself But before I was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her I had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back I began to think Why am I hurrying so fast inl this direction  Can I find comfort or consolation peace certainty contentment all or anything that I want at home  and can I leave all perturbation sorrow and anxiety behind me there  Instead of going home as he ought to have done and taking off his half boots and solacing his perturbed spirit with a glass of small beer and a pipe and quietly toddling off to bed he turned round to look at the old hall  There was little besides the chiinnies visible above my contracted horizon I walked back to get a better view of it When it rose in sight I stood still a moment to look and then continued moving towards the gloomy object of attraction Something called me nearernearer stilland why nQt pray  Might I not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm August night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could I endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  I had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear It may be true till I had shouted aloud 4 It is false  I defy you to make me suppose it  1 I could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlor window I went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing I could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before I went There is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated But  I had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before I vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if I found her still in deep distress perhaps I might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things I should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity I looked  her chair was vacant so was the room But at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  Come out I want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  Here then were she and Rachel coming to take a walk in the garden I wished myself safe back over the wall  I stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightMrs Graham followed by another not Rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall Oh  Heavens how my temples throbbed Intense anxiety darkened my sight but I thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was Mr Lawrence  You should not let it worry you so much Helen said he I will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  I did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that I could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply I heard it plainly enough  But I must leave this place Frederick she said  I never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but I cannot rest here Now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle Here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as Mr Acton Bell Even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract It is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to thei vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation There can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice But this is bad and in young writers particularly so It shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success But we shall make one inore extract froin Mr Bell in order to show why we find fault Mr Gilbert Markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotW of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney The twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own As I trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies I heard another horse at no great distance behind me but I never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections I was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper I lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me He accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was Mr Lawrence  Instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but I restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back He fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  I replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    This looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin But our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says I grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before I opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within sMarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  You have found your hopes defeated  but how am I to blame for it I warned you beforehand you know but you would not  He said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow I had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head Continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor Lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader He says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so Mr Markham gallops off leaving Lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose Having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose But let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style I dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside I Its good enough for you I muttered My next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till I got hold of the bridle but then I must see him in the saddle  Here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and Ill help you to mount No he turned from me in disgust I attempted to take him bv the arm He shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  What you wont  Well You may sit there till doomsday for what I care But I suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body Ill just bind that up for you  Let me alone if you please   But we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action The  Tenant of Wildfell Mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothingThe Tenant of WMildfell Hall MIR BELLS NEW NOVEL Ba Acton Bell London Newby TIF names of Acton Bell Currer Bell and Ellis Bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world The novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a Yorkshirewoman Jane Eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the Bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is The Tenant of Wildfell Hall These two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other That the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of Jane Eyre is a fair proof She has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels And for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in Jane FPyre and in the tale now before uts We should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new Jane Eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever Perused It is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales It is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification The heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unIfeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew The Teniant of Wfeildrl Hail is also a species of autobiography One third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of Jane Eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband Throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader All are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species She is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of Iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days By and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate In the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations Nevertheless on the whole we should say that The Tenant of Wildfell lail is not so 1xad a book as Jane Eyre There is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters The hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor The religioMIN seltiments wvhich the authoress puts

If I Were King lunn Ha 1 By Justin Huntly McCarthy Heine mann Gs Mr McCarthy cannot in any real sense he said to have made a study of Villon Ile gives us certain historical facts and weaves about them a narrative wellconstructed melodramatic briskbut the book has no psychology Now it is precisely the psychology of Villon which should appeal to the artist as the psychology of Ferdinand Lassalle appeared to Mr Meredith when he wrote Tl ie TragicComedians There is really no reason why Villon should be the hero of this story any sentimental rascal would have done just as well The quality of Villons rascality and sentiment Mr McCarthy does not succeed in conveying to us and Katherine de Vaucelles is no more than a figure moving prettily in stage gardens and the like places In a word If I Were King is a story of pose of crude colour and of superficial sentiment Indeed the sentiment throughout is cloying and sometimes almost nauseating To write  the cup of her heart seemed to run over with red tears is frankly to write nonsense of a particularly objectionable kind and there is much more of the same sort But we have no doubt that to many readers If I Were King will make quite a strong appeal They will not however be readers who know Villon at first hand To them the book will hardly countIf I were King By Justin Huntly J McCarthy Hei nemann It would be superfluous to judge Mr McCarthys novel from an historical standpoint since the characters whom he introduces are bent entirely to the authors own ends and are historical in little else than name His portrait of Louis XI may be sufficiently striking to impress those readers whose knowledge of the cynical sovereign is not too intimate B ut it requires more than Mr McCarthys undeniable brilliancy of narrative and picturesqueness of detail to enable us to recognize in the highsouled gentleman who as Grand Constable of France for one short week saves his country and wins the love of the Lady Katharine de Vaudelles the sordid unscrupulous rogue whose rhymes alone have redeemed the memory of Villon from the stigma of complete ruffianism Mr McCarthy in his anxiety to present a vivid picture of the Fircone tavern and its frequenters errs on the side of unnecessary coarseness but the story is certainly not wanting in melodramatic incident and for this reason is probably better suited to the stage  which it has already reachedthan to a form of literature demanding serious criticism of another kind,biography

Impzressitons of Theophsrastu Such By George Eliot W Blackwood  Sons THE interest which is felt when a distinguished cultivator of one branch of literature takes to the cultivation of anotber branch is a perfectly natural and legitimate interest There is certainly no reason why an excellent novelist should not be a good poet and still less reason why an excellent novelist should not write excellent essays A reader therefore may be pardoned who takes up the Impressicm8 of Theophrastus Such with a pleasant anticipation of finding something good there It is not to be for gotten that George Eliots special excellences in novel writing are such as might with reason be thought likelv to enable her to write good essays of the moralist kind She has at any rate in her best novel work displayed in occasional reflections and apophthegms exactly the acuteness of observation and the power of expressing its results which the ethi cal essayist most needs and pearls are usually no worse for being strung in connexion instead of scattered at hazard It so happens too though perhaps this is a consider ation of a rather doubleedged character that we have very little essay work nowadays of the kind which England and France pro duced so abundantly between the middle of the seventeenth and the middle of the eighteenth century There is an immense amount of diluted matter of a not dissimilar kind published in weekly and daily journals and now and then a writer may attempt something more mature and concentrated in magazines and reviews But on the whole no collection of the British essayists is in the near future likely to go much beyond Eliaalthough a smart journalist did remark the other day that the only reason for the popularity of Lambs Essays was that few people could do the thing then whereas if they had appeared today they would have been lost amid the superior work of the same kind now daily appearing That the reader who takes up Theop7lastus Such in such a mood as that which we have indicated is likely to be a good deal dis appointed may be as well said at once and frankly The author has attempted a form which is not an easy one and has not observed its limitations Before we have got very far into the book and still more when we Jay it down we feel that there is either too much or too little of Mr Such The essayist who wishes to utter his opinions through the mouth of a feigned personage must give him at least something of a body for our thoughts to take hold of Mr Such is little more than a disembodied shadow with a name attached to it and this being the case we feel that we could do without his shadow and his name altogether A more doubtful point is the adoption more majorun of fictitious but halfsignificant names for the minor characters introduced or discussed in passing There is perhaps something a little cumbrous about this to the taste of the present day but it is a matter of no great consequence The reader would probably be prepared to pardon a good many imperfections in the setting if the stones set were abundant of pure water and cut in a workmanlike manner It is however hereto drop the metaphor it is in the quality and wording of the thoughts it containsthat the principal weakness of the book consists The essayist has two different manners in which he may allowably and successfully put what he has to say There is the garrulous fluent and somewhat buttonholing manner and there is the manner in which the writer devotes his utmost energies to compressing and polishing his phrase till it has at least something of the pregnancy and of the brilliancy of Joubert or of Rochefoucauld There may be third fourth or fifth manners which are allowable but they have not hitherto been tried at any rate successfully in literature Now we hardly think that George Eliot has succeeded in working up her matter in either of these possible ways No one expects her to be easily garrulous but she might have been expected to be full and at the same time terse and clearcut There is too much in Theophrastus Stich to which these epithets can by no stretch of compliment be applied Sometimes though it must be confessed not so often as might have been expected the fault lies in the use of unfamiliar and technical expressions When we are presented with such a pensie as the following  May there not be at least a partial release from the imprisoning verdict that a mans philo sophy is the formula of his personality  it must be a very dull or a very easy literary sense upon which the use of the word formula does not jar But there is not very much of this error A worse and a more frequent one may be best illustrated by a couple of quota tions  One wonders whether the remarkable originatorm who first had the notion of digging wells or of churning for butter and who certainly were very useful to their own time as well as to ours were left quite free from invidious comparisons with predecessors who let the water and the milk alone or whether some rhetorical nomad as he stretched himself on the grass with a good appetite for contemporary butter became loud on the virtues of ancestors who were uncorrupted by the produce of the cow  nay whether in a high flight of imaginative sacrificeafter swallowing the butterhe even wished himself earlier born and already eaten for the sustenance of a generation more naive than his own  It has sometimes occurred to me when I have been taking a slice of excellent ham that from a too tenable point of view I was breakfasting on a small squealing black pig which more than half a century ago was the unwilling representative of spiritual advantages not otherwise acknowledged by tie grudgingfarmer or dairyman who parted with him One enters on a fearful labyrinth in tracing compound interest backward and such complications of thought have reduced the flavour of the ham but since I have nevertheless eaten it the chief effect has been to moderate the severity of my radicalism which was not part of my paternal inheritance and to raise the assuaging reflection that if the pig and the parishioner had been intelligent enough to anticipate my historical point of view they would have seen themselves and the rector in a light that would have made tithe voluntary Now we are very far from thinking that there is nothing worth saying in these ponderous sentences But it is evident that the author instead of seeking to compress and point her thought has allowed it to bulge in any and every direction She has constantly inserted side reflections as they occurred to her regardless of the total effect and pitiless to the unfortunate reader who has begun a sympathetic grin and has to keep his muscles on the stretch for half a page before he is allowed to relax them She has reversed Jouberts process and appears to be tormented by the ambition of putting a word into a paragraph and a para graph into a chapter and a chapter into a book This inability to stop when enough has been said is still more remarkable inl such a sentence as the following Not that Merman had a wrangling disposition he put all his doubts and queries and paradoxes deferentially contended without unpleasant heat and only with a sonorous eagerness against the personality of Homer expressed himself civilly though formally on the origin of language and had tact enough to drop at the right moment such subjects as the ultimate reduction of all the socalled elementary substances his own total scepticism concerning Manethos Chronology or even the relation between the magnetic condition of the earth and the outbreak of revolutionary tendencies Surely George Eliots daemon must have whispered Stop suggestivelyat Homer imperatively at the origin of language and despairingly at elementary substances The sentence as it stands is not a witticism but a catalogue Although however this fatal error per vades the book and deprives it of a claim to rank with essay work of the best kind the reader unless he is a very unreasonable person is not likely to think his time wasted or to complain that he is sent away empty No one of George Eliots powers could pro duce reflections on subjects of interestand such are nearly all the matters touched upon in this volume  without those reflections being themselves interesting With the ast essay a vigorous Apologia for the Jews we have little to do here because it is entirely political in tone and hardly touches at all on the purely literary objections to the handling of the Jewish element in Daniel Derondd The best of the essays beyond all question is Looking Backward a charming description with hardly any veil of the writers earlier days in the midland counties The description of English scenery on page 50 is equal to the very best thing she has ever done So again is the short episode of the manservant Pummel in  The Watchdog of Knowledge This delightful person who on being asked the cause of the tides answers Well sir nobody rightly knows Many gives their opinion but if I was to give mine it ud be different  and who is troubled to think of Adams surprise at the assembled animals  for he was not like us sir used from a by to Wombwells showswould redeem many times the number of dull pages or illconstructed phrases that are to be found in Theophrastus Such Nor are there wanting abundant flashes of really terse and well oxpressed reflection elsewhere The political molecule who 1 occasionally sat alone in the same room with his books is not a person to be forgotten There could hardly be a betterput rebuke to cheap cynicism than this  If the human race has a bad reputation I perceive that I cannot escape being compromised AnotherThe sea lion plunges and swims the more energetically because his limbs are of a sort to make him shambling on land  bears a strange likeness to the thought of a French poet on the albatross  Ses ailes de g6ant lempAchent de marcher There is all the old psychological acuteness in the comment on a statement of a foolish contemner of modern poetry that he himself had never written anything but  often composed as he went along  I was per r suaded that the birth with which his mind I was pregnant was not poetry but I did not I question that he composed as he went along x and that the exercise was attended by a e great sense of power I There is too a fable about a badger and t a bee and a bear which is told to perfection 1 Nor are the figures of Touchwood the man r with only a temper of Vorticella the small t author of Pepin the too ready writer i though perhaps there is a touch of personal r feeling in this which does not improve it I of the Watchdog of Knowledge Mordax c and of the too deferential Hinze un i worthy of a place in the gallery appointed c for such types The most elaborate thing t in the book the Sorrows of Merman or as E it is headed How we Encourage Re t search pleases us less The defect of over i minuteness and voluminousness which we have noticed comes in very strongly here 4 the playfulness is distinctly elephantine and I though it has some of the elements of a good X comedy yet we are by no means sorry when I it is done Lastly the protests against 1 Moral Swindlers  and Debasing the I Moral Currency  deserve notice The 1 latter is directed against the modern I tendency to parody and burlesque of noble work and sentiment the former to the false and foolish use of the words  moral and morality  which have led to various con fusions and mistakes as to their acceptation Neither is exactly novel but both are vigorous and well worth reading On the whole then Theophrastus Such may be pronounced to be a book containing more good things than bad but spoilt by an insufficient attention to form and an insufficient recognition of its necessity It is never likely to be among the most popular of its authors books nor perhaps does it deserve this popularity But still it will be found in all probability very quotable not to say plunderable all the more so perhaps because many of its good things are in their present habit not set off to the best advantage and therefore are not likely to stock the general memory as they stand l GEORGE SAINTSBURY,biography

Joseph Vance an IlUwritten Autobio graphy By William De Morgan Heinemann The complaint mav possibly be made that  Joseph Vance has little or no plot But is a plot a necessary part of a book which professes to be an autobiography  The life of the average man is neither a tragedy nor a comedy and it would be hard to find in his autobiography a satisfactory plot  Joseph Vance  impresses the reader as the truthful record of a life and as that is what the author intended we need not lament the absence of a plot The book is written in a leisurely fashion It suggests the talk of an intelligent man who has something to say and all night in which to say it and the listener must be unusually obtuse who does not find pleasure in listening There is abundance of humour in Mr De Morgans story and it is found not only in the humorous remarks made by the author but also in the essentially humorous characteristics of several of the people to whom he introduces us The reader may fancy that the task of reading will be long enough to be tiresome  but if he has any appreciation of work that is humorous thoughtful pathetic and thoroughly entertaining he will not regret the length of the story  Joseph Vance  is fresh original and unusually clever If it is the authors first effort as is apparently the case his next book will le looked for with interest,biography

JUDE THE OBSCUR E After you have read  Jude the Obscure your thoughts run in two separate channels cut by Mr Hardys two nearly separate purposes Your opinion of the book will largely depend on which you regard as the main one These purposes are wound in with the history of Jude and the history of Sue Their histories are intertwined but they are not quite inevitable to each other and so to a greater extent than in most tragedies you can regard the two chief actors separately A work of the intensest human interest it is not evenly strong it has been written too much under the stress of feeling for that Any discontent which is not roused by merely superficial causes which is not finnicking and any offence which the book may contain for timid readers must arise I think from the story of Sue Personally I feel no offence and I speak for at least some women But I am not  Jude the Obscure By Thomam Hardy 6s Osgood aud McIlvaine sure if her championship might not have been bettered In herself she is one of Mr Hardys stimulating women He is particularly anxious not to shirk the consequences of her temperament of that free spirit of hers that gave so willingly when not coerced by laws and authority But in exhibiting the results of this temperament acting on her circumstancesher shillyshallying her contrariness about the marriage tiethere is an amount of exaggeration or of reiteration that becomes nearly absurd as did the fickleness in the hero of  The Pursuit of the WVellBeloved There is here something more than the Eeries of seemings or personal impressions spoken of in the preface There is downright propagandawhich is always unconvincing and even loosening to the convictions of the already converted Sue is a woman that excites and leads She is influential her opinions and feelings do not need much emphasis and repetition Wihen they are given these she becomes too much of a pamphlet and platform victim of the cruel marriage bond Sue could love and was not well fitted for marriage life There she is not so very abnormal and this would be the sooner admitted had Mr Hardy not taken so much trouble to justify her running to and fro between Phillotson and Jude But I admit this is a cold reception to a warm protest and the fault of the novelist one may readily forgive to the man of feeling sending his chivalry bravely out in new directions There is perhaps some propaganda again in his attitude towards the dreary child Time One may shudder over the boys dark way of cutting the knot of pecuniary misery But even the gruesome vision of the three little innocent dead bodies is not so terrible as the doctors suggestion of the boys state of mind being  the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live If one were to believe that the wish were to show itself first or generally in children there would be good reason for immediate and comprehensive human slaughter today Is there amore terrible suggestion in all modern literature  Yet it has nothing to do with a general misundtrsaiding of childhood There is one picture of Sue as a child there are several of the boy Jude that are quick ith sympathy But the book is not made up of theories and examples of theories The title is truly descriptive Jude is the real subject and Judes story is among the most notable of Mr Hardys work In bis greater booksand this is one urdoubtedlyhe has a way of passionately identifying himself with the aims or the sorrows of one personage whom he loves in his blackest his sinfullest his pitifullest moments That he does so and that he does not hide such moments make him one of the very grimmest and most sympathetic of all novelists Tess the Mayor Clym Yeobright and now Jude are of the company Judes history is written as life writes a history some features being traced from the beginning while later from hitherto unstirred depths circumstance calls up the others He is a man with the defects of his amiable virtues and his sensitive nature There is only one woman in the world for his love and reverence but if she be not there his loneliness may seek less good company In strong drink he has sometimes found a refuge from overtaxed nerves Life finds out the weak places in his very human body and soul He is too and especially a man of the people with the native instincts of the scholar The poetry of his aspirations the disinterestedness of his pursuit the undyingness of his passion are made living to you and some of the selftaught mans vanity and his laboriousness of expression are not suppressed You think he must be cured for ever of his ambition that day when having received the  terribly sensible  repulse from the bead of Bibliol College he stood at the Crossway and began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely more palpitating varied and compendious than the gown life and at that supreme moment when he the obscure craftsman wrote along the wall of the dull college from whence the repulse had come I have understanding as well as you But the passion is in his blood He wanders round and round the sacred places like a moth ound a candle Christminster scenes mark the stages of his struggling aspiring life The imaginative child watching from the roof of the Brown House the faroff spires and domes the nightwandering stonemason  under the walls and doorways feeling with his fingers the contours of their mouldings the ghosts of old scholars comrades of his solitude are striking pictures out of his early hopeful time In his sick and unfortunate days when forced to labour at an earlierlearnt trade than hii own he as Arabella says still harps on Christminster even in his cakes shaping these with grotesque pathos to a reminiscence of traceuied windows and cloisters There too he dies lonely and obscure to the hum of a college chapel organ and the shouts of Commemoration games A poor workman to the end a boyish imprudence for which he never shirked the payment dogged him persistently and the woman who had been his light and leader left him in the darkness to fulfil for superstitions sake a loathed duty Jude the lawabiding the conservative the kindly uninfluenced by free thought till late in his day is a rebel at lastperhaps from the day when this scene is gone through When the house was silent and they could do nothing but await the coroners inquest a subdued large low voice spread into the air of the room from behind the heavy walls at the back  I What is it said Sue her spasmodic breathing suspended i The organ of the college chapel The organist practising I suppose It is the anthem from the seventythird Psalm  Truly God is loving unto Israel She sobbed again O my babies  They had done no harm Why should they have been taken away and not I There was another stillnessbroken at last by two persons in conversation somewhere without   They are talking about us no doubt I moaned Sue We are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men  Jude listened Nothey are not talking of us he said  They are two clergymen of different views arguing about the eastward position  But the hearts bitterness came later when Sue in the name of religion left him I should like to cry out that it was against her nature to do so but the reaction when life had frightened her is I fear not untrue to facts Mr Hardy does not wear rose  coloured glasses and he does not seek to hide that a man of the people like Jude scholar and gentleman though he is has rough ways of going to the devil even if he doesnt stop long in that company But on the other hand his career may wholesomely astonish some middleclass readers inasmuch as it goes to prove that aspiring and sensitive souls do not need generations of literary education and genteel incomes to breed them and that poverty and the stress of life reveal to such sensitive souls a world that the comfortablyplaced and the unimaginative only deny because they have been saved and denied the chance of entrance Sues story is a reality with some unhappy exaggeration about it but all that concerns Jude in his strength and weakness is masterly and written out of a deep heart The constant loverconstant for all the Arabella incidentsmakes perhaps widest appeal for sympathy But it is another Jude on which Mr Hardy has shed the full light of his imagination and the wandering rejected scholar flits a pathetic ghost through college gateways and by college walls for evermore A M,biography
Kaffir Folklore or a Selection from the Traditional Tales current among the People living on the Eastern Border of the Cape Colony By George McCall Theal Son nenschein  Co The stories which Mr Theal has collected during a residence of twenty years among the Kaffirs are very curious and interesting and the information ho gives in his introduction and notes about these wild people among whom he has exercised many functions including those of a mission teacher and a border magistrateis most valuable The word Kaffir he remarks is often used to signify any black native who is not the descendant of an imported slave but it is applied on the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony only to a member of the Amaxosa tribe From these Amaxosa the tales in Mr Theals volume were obtained The Kaffir of the coast region ia described as  a model of a wellformed man possessing reasoning powers  quite equal to those of a white man It appears that for anything approaching frivolity he has a supreme contempt and therefore it is to be feared that any distinguished representative of his race who may visit London will carry away an unfavourable impression as regards fashionable society The language of the Amaxosa is  rich in words and is musical in expression and it contains three clicks which are now represented in writing by the superfluous letters c q and x It is at first encouraging to be told that they are easily sounded separately by Europeans  the c by withdrawing the tongue sharply from the front teeth the q by doing the same from the roof of the mouth and the x by drawing the breath in a peculiar way between the tongue and the side teeth But Mr Theal afterwards saddens his readers by the information that these clicks generally prove an insurmountable difficulty to an adult who wishes to learn to speak the language The language of the women varies a good deal from that of the men on account of  the custom called ukuhlonipa which prohibits females from pronouncing the names of any of their husbands male relatives in the ascending line or any words whatever in which the principal syllables of such names occur Of many other curious customs Mr Theal supplies an interesting account especially as regards marriage death and witchcraft He gives a couple of curious instances of their superstitions which came under his own notice In 1875 a Kaffir girl was drowned while bathing Her companions ran away home and declared that she had been lured away into a dark hole by a spirit and that she cried out just before sinking for the last time  Go and tell my father and mother that it took me Her father immediately collected his cattle drove them into the water and implored the spirit  to take the choicest of them and restore his daughter He spoke in vain but  the failure to get the exchange effected is still attributed by the relatives of the drowned girl to the absence of one skilful to work with medicines In July 1881 a Kaffir woman sorrowfully sought Mr Theals assistance The  witch  finder of the village had pointed her out as the person who had caused the death of a neighbours child The result of her being thus smelt out was that no one would so much as speak to her and even her own children avoided her Such treatment was unendurable and Mr Theal interfered on her behalf The witchfinder was sent for and a large number of Kaffirs appeared to judge the case It is pleasant to know that the witchfinder failed to satisfy the judges when the ordinary tests were put to him and when he was compelled to admit that he had never held converse with the people under the water he was convicted of imposition and his victim was acquitted of the terrible charge he had brought against her One of the most unreasonable of the ideas indulged in by Kaffirs is that in consequence of which they use no kinds of fish as an article of diet and call them all snakes without distinction But they do not intend by so doing to insult the fishy race for  the snake is treated with great respect by the Kaffirs If one is found in a hut the people will move out and wait patiently until it leaves The owner will say that it is perhaps the spirit of one of his ancestors who has come to visit him in this form The Kaffir stories are for the most part wild and all but unintelligible A few of them appear to show traces of foreign influence and may possibly have adapted to South African uses certain incidents properly belonging to Asiatic tales This may account for the resemblance between part of The Story of the Girl and the Mbulu and the numberless Asiatic and European variants of the tale which it has been proposed to call The Substituted Bride In the Kaffir story the girl is induced to bathe and the mbulua fabulous being which can assume the human form but cannot part with its tailputs on her clothes and assumes her place passing itself off as a chiefs daughter and making the girl act as its servant The girl lightens her cares by song and sings the tale of her woes The neighbours who hear her test the truth of her metrical assertions satisfy themselves that the substituted bride for a wedding has taken place  has a mbulus tail and put the interloper to death The deceived bridegroom then marries the girl whose place the mbulu had usurped The story ends after a fashion which may be said to be original  She had a child and one day when it was playing a square pumpkin came out of the ground where the mbulu was buried and tried to kill the infant But the people chopped the pumpkin into pieces and burned it They afterwards threw the ashes into a river so that nothing more could come of that mbulu  Tho Story of Five Heads also is one which resembles to a suspicious extent the numerous popular tales which tell how a foolish or haughty maiden turns a deaf ear to the good advice which is given to her while she is on her way to the dwelling of a demon or witch and suffers in consequence and how her wise or humble sister listens to similar counsel and is rewarded The demoniacal being in the Kaffir tale is  a big snake with five heads and large eyes a creature of a foreign aspect closely akin to the sevenheaded snakes which are part of the stockintrade of Russian and other storytellers One of the beings about whom a piece of advice is given to the Kaffir damsel differs from those we are accustomed to hear of in European tales She is told that she will meet a man  whose head is under his armand she is advised not to take water from him She meets  a man carrying his head under his arm and takes water to drink from him In consequence the snake eventually kills her with his tail being discontented with the bread she has made for him The opening of  The Story of the Girl who disregarded the Custom of Ntonjane in which a snake comes out of a pool wherein a number of girls are bathing and takes possession of the clothes they have left on the bank is very like that of the Russian story of  The WaterSnake which again is closely akin to a Burmese tale of a waterspirit who marries a mortal maiden but the incidents which follow are entirely different There are several Kaffir stories also which describe the apparent destruction of men and beasts by some monster and their ultimate rescue uninjured from its inside just as in the Norse tale of  The Devouring Cat or the Indian story of  The Voracious Frog In one of the Kaffir variants of what seems to be a naturemyth which has dwindled into a grotesque story for children a monster called an inabulele swallows a young hero who finds inside it  his father and his mother and many people and cattle He pierces his living prison with his assagai and the captives escape In another tale two boys kill a glutton and their mother opens it whereupon people came out and cattle and dogs In a third the devouring creature is a monstrous cannibal  The men went and skinned the cannibal when a great number of people came from him One of tho most thoroughgoing parallels with alien folktales is afforded by  The Story of Sikulume That hero wins the heart of the daughter of a demoniacal being named Mangangezulu and flies with her from her fathers house The bereaved parent pursues but the girl throws down successively  an egg a milksack a pot and a smooth stone The demon is for a time baffled by the mist into which the egg turns the sheet of water which comes out of the milksack and the thick darkness due to the flinging down of the pot but he is not completely foiled until the smooth stone is thrown It became a rock a big rock with one side steep as a wall He could not climb up that rock and so he returned to his own village In European folktales a brush and a comb are the objects most often relied upon by similar fugitives Very quaint though not absolutely novel is the story of the  big ugly cannibal with only one leg who took home a bag into which he had inserted a very nice girl and called all the other cannibals to come to a feast and they came expecting to get something nice But when the bag was opened it was found to contain  only snakes and toads for the girls father had effected an unwelcome substitution The other cannibals were so angry when they saw this that they killed him and made their feast off him Quaint also is the  person with only one arm one side and one leg who kindly cries to Magodas runaway children  See the cannibal has eaten the rest of me take care of yourselves The opening of the story of the cannibal who calls to Demazana pretending to be her brother Demana is singularly like that of the German story of  The Wolf and the Seven Kids The Kaffir girl replies  Go away you cannibal your voice is hoarse you are not my brother He consults with another cannibal who advises him to burn his throat with a hot iron  He did so and then no longer spoke hoarse The girl admits him into the cave in which she lives and he carries her off In the German story Grimm No 5 the wolf detected by the gruffness of its voice  went to a shop and bought a great piece of chalk which it ate and by that means rendered its voice more gentle By way of conclusion we may mention as an original story and one which is in accordance with the already mentioned Kaffir idea about drowning  The Story of Tangalimlibo That lady who made it a rule never to go out in the daytime and was therefore known as the walker by moonlight was drawn under water one day when she had broken her rule in deference to her fatherinlaws repeated requests for water In vain did her fatherinlaw offer the riverspirit an ox in exchange for her She remained unseen all day When the night came her child cried so bitterly that its nurse carried it down to the river  Then the mother of the child came out of the river and sang a sad song and afterwards took her child and put it to her breast to suck The story ends more happily than the Russian tale of the dead mother who used to suckle her wasting child by night for a fat ox having been offered to the riverspirit by  a woman skilful in the use of medicines the demon was appeased  There was a great shaking and a rising up of the river and Tangalimlibo came out There was great joy among those people when they took her home to her husband We trust that we have quoted enough from Mr Theals book to prove that it is one which may be cordially recommended,juvenile

LAY DOWN YOUR ARMS BY Baroness von Suttner Tranq lated by T Holmes Longmans THE ROMANCE OF A SCHOOLMASTER By E De Amicis Translated by M E Craig 3 vols Osgood Neither of these novels is of English birth Both of them are Tendenz novels with some similarity in their methods There is no other reason why they should be classed together The Baroness von Suttners Waffen Nieder has made its way slowly to this country and it must be said in most unattractive guise It has the outward look of a medical manual and the English inside is often clumsy enough The story will not cause the sensation here it did in its own home We are accustomed to the mild and continuous propaganda of the Peace and Arbitration Association and our military spirit only rises fitfully In Austria and Germany I Waffen Nieder came as a thunderbolt Friedrich von Bodenstedt called it a  glorious book and said since Madame de Stacl  no woman had wielded so potent a pen As an advocate Baroness von Suttner is magnificent From the AustroItalian the SchleswigHolstein the AustroPrussian the FrancoGerman wars she gathers proofs enough and to spare of the cruelty the ghastly folly of mili tarism War in her pages has not the epic terror Tolstoi gives to it but its ugliness its tragedies general and private were never more convincingly depicted Yet it must be owned the book is terribly dull at times It is relentlessly exhaustive and when the good Martha and the admirable Friedrich are sucking liberalism and opposition to the military spirit from the pages of Buckle or when excerpts from Marthas red book are given us with their nauseous amount of domestic sentiments and detail ones patience is tried Madame v Suttner manders occionay and does not see when a vivid fact might have saved her the trouble of a sermon There is little art in the book but it is a magnificent pamphlet crowded with ilusations taken from terrible reality The theme of the other is quite different its purpose is equally humane The title alludes to but a small bit of it It is not the romance but the career of a schoolmaster of several schoolmasters of many schoolmi  It is a presentment of the state of Italian elementary education but with a distinct interest beyond the bounds of Italy The Signor de Amicis is painfully conscientious When he would have us know what a  syndic or a superintendent or an inspector is like he lets us see many syndics many superintendents and inspectors acting under different circumstances actuated by various motives He too is relentlessly exhaustive which is the more courageous as pedagogic details are not generally held to be popular In the end however if we reach there he does convince us of the romance in the lives of these A B Cgrinders whose hardships must indeed be great and whose position must be ignominious if there be no exaggeration in this very circumstantial account It is not a novel so much as a series of photographs and it has the defects and the useulness of its method In spite of its obtrusive purpose its unblushing demand for patience it is full of human interest and fine observation of character Perhaps its most remarkable feature is the reverence and affection for children that pervades it,biography

LITERATURE More Leaves from the Journal of a Life in the Highlands from 1862 to 1882 Smith Elder  Co It is impossible to regard this book otherwise than with feelings of respect and that not merely on its authors account but because it is exactly what it professes to be The twenty years with which the Journal has to do was indeed an eventful period It was marked by such important incidents as thc FrancoGerman and RussoTurkish Wars not to mention the many minor campaigns in which our own armies were engaged and the grave political complications which from time to time presented themselves But with these matters the Journal is altogether unconcerned It deals solely with the Queens life in the Highlands and though it is quite natural that her Majestys subjects should wish to know what were the Queens thoughts and feelings about things and people outside the narrow limits thus laid down we certainly cannot find fault with the almost absolute reticence which is preserved throughout the volume upon all questions of national importance Such silence seems to us to bc as discreet as it is rare and as there is nothing in the title of the book which is calculated to mislead we are unable to justify a disappointment in which we do not share Having said so much we shall bc understood when we add that the most remarkable thing about the book is that there is nothing very remarkable in it It records no thrilling adventures A carriage accident an arrival without bag or baggage a near chance of being benighted upon the mountain sidethese are almost the only  situations which the Journal offers to its readers The interest of the book is if we may use a muchabused phrase subjective rather than objective We look through it at the writer and are brought face to face with her As a rule diaries which record anything more than bare facts betray tho selfconsciousness of their authors and make us feel that we are only so far taken into confidence as may bo necessary to produce a certain effect An art which strives to look like artlessness is their commonest characteristic And the special value of the Queens Journal is its genuine simplicity and perfect candour In these pages she is no longer the lofty abstraction of royalty who lends dignity to a pageant but otherwise is hedged about with a divinity through which it would be profane to penetrate Here we are permitted to look upon the woman rather than the monarch and to repay with sympathy the sympathy which she is so ready to extend towards her subjects It is sometimes asked with some little jealousy why the Queen is so fond of Scotland This book answers the question It is because there and especially in the Highlands she can gratify that intense love of nature which she possesses and which shows itself in keen appreciation not merely of wild and beautiful scenery but also of characters and modes of life as yet in somewhat of their primitive simplicity The Queen too isas she confesses with evident pridea descendant of tho House of Stuart and for her each scene she looks upon recalls some romantic incident in connexion with the fortunes of her ancestors Heredity asserts itself Mr Galton would tell us in this particular but not in this alone For we arc insensibly reminded of King George III Farmer George when wo read the Queens account of juicing the sheep  and the interest she took in the more familiar operation of clipping But although the Journal recounts the Queens participation in many simple pleasures and none seem too homely for her enjoyment there is throughout her diary an undertone of sadness which the writer never attempts to conceal Visits paid to old friends and old places bring back the memories of a happier past and the very warmth of affection with which the Queen speaks of and treats those whether gentle or simple who have attached themselves to her seems like the yeanling of an empty heart for a consolation still denied But we are perhaps intruding upon matters with which the reviewer has no concern The book is emphatically one to be read rather than criticised and cannot fail to deepen thc respect and sympathy already felt towards its author Charles J

hour of desolation which comes to many good women and must be borne by all to whom it comes How will the Queen bear it was the question everywhere asked on that early morning twentytwo years ago when the tolling of the bell of St Pauls after midnight carried the mournful intelligence that an hour earlier the Queens consort had died at Windsor This book contains the answer to that question Its tone is one of calm resignation brightened by peaceful and confident hope Of the Queens personal character tlie volume contains naturally enough many indications That character is here as elsewhere seen to be eminent in womanliness Without being deficient in fibre and with abundance of volition it loves best to trust to a higher strength and lean on a firmer will It was so in those early days of her sovereignty when Lord Melbourne told the Queen in a fatherly way that no woman whatever her position could Eve happily I for long without a mans arintb rest on And when by the bereavement of 1861 the support of her husbands strength was withdrawn the Queen turned for solace to that daughter whose fortitude during her fathers sufferings and subsequent motherly devotion find a fitting record hero This womanly trait is obviously a key to the Queens intimacy with Dr Norman Macleod to whose guidance amid many difficulties and consolation in many troubles she has offered tho tribute of an I abundant gratitude A keener sense of humour might have modified some of these reminiscences Occasionally however a smile betrays itself behind the record of a solemn incident as when we are told that Principal Campbells prayer was very trying because very long on the day of the unveiling of tho statue of the Prince Consort at Aberdeen when it rained in torrents In other places the manifest sincerity saves everything The book contains some few indications of the Queens taste in literature We gather that she is a warm lover of Scott and this passion probably came to her through her husband from his and her grandmother the Duchess of SaxeCoburga remarkable woman of a powerful energetic and almost masculine mind whose pleasure it was of an evening to tell Scotts stories  to Prince Albert and his brother The  Queen herself appears to be familiar with Scottespecially perhaps with his poetry j We are told that Brown gave her a copy of the poems of the Ettrick Shepherd and that she found them full of beautiful things It is said in various places that Lady Churchill read after dinner  but except in one instance of no special moment we are left in ignorance of the books This is to be regretted Tho anxiety to avoid controversial topics which has wisely restrained the Queenfrom almost all allusion to political affairs need hardly have operatedin restraining her from all mention of the literature that has cheered her leisure A similar silence is observed with respect to the Queens tastes in the arts Wo have heard elsewhere that she took lessons in singing from Labluche and that the attained to marked proficiency as an executant on the pianoforte That her skill with the pencil is at least such as to enable her to seize the broad features of a landscape the illustrations to the present volume bear evidence It is scarcely conceivable that one who possesses such attainments should be destitute of opinions on artistic questions Nor would the expression of these opinions havo been foreign to the revelations of domestic lifo which it is tho sole business of the book to present But while a certain reticence must have been judicious and necessary respecting artists in many walks who might be irritated by the preference shown to a rival it is surely a loss that we are deprived of all mention of those who are beyond that infirmity and about whom the Queen must have thought and written frequently The following passage on a visit to Abbotsford is full of the kind of interest of which we could almost wish that the book had yet more Another twenty minutes or halfhour brought us to Abbotsford the wellknown residence of Sir Walter Scott It lies low and looks rather gloomy Mr Hope Scott and Lady Victoria my goddaughter and sister to the present Duke of Norfolk with their children the young Duke of Norfolk and some other relations received us Mr Hope Scott married first Miss Lockhart the last surviving grandchild of Sir Walter Scott and she died leaving only one daughter a pretty girl of eleven to whom this place will go and who is the only surviving descendant of Sir Walter They showed us the part of the house in which Sir Walter lived and all his roomshis drawingroom with the same furniture and carpet the library where we saw his MS of Ivanhoe and several others of his novels and poems in a beautiful handwriting with hardly any erasures and other relics whiclx Sir Walter had himself collected Then his study a small dark room with a little turret in which is a bust in bronze done from a cast taken after death of Sir Walter In the study we saw his journal in which Mr Hope Scott asked me to write my name which I felt it to be a presumption in me to do as also the others We went through some passages into two or three rooms where were collected fine specimens of old armour c and where in a glass case are Sir Walters last clothes We ended by going into the diningrcom in which Sir Walter Scott died where we took tea In this connexion it may be mentioned that when the Queens uncle and early guardian Leopold King of the Belgians travelled in Scotland as a solace for his bereavement on the death of the Princess Charlotte he was for a few days the guest of Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford While there his pride of descent peeped out in a curious way An aged Scotch divine alluded to the fact that tho king was descended from Frederick the Wise Elector of Saxony who was one of the first to embrace the principles of the Reformation and to become a protector of Martin Luther Thereupon Leopold said that he felt more honoured by tho mention of this circumstance than by anything that had been said of him and his family during his stay The relevancy of the story will be felt by those who have been arrested by what the Queen herself says in these  Leaves of the strong Protestant basis which she rejoices to find in the larger religious bodies of Scotland Her Majesty s love of the Highlands is too well known to require illustrative comment That she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale cloud and mist that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder and their brighter and sunnier effects is obvious enough Above all things the Queens natureworship is healthy and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when according to Carlyle Goethe was the first to say  Come let us make a description It will be remembered that the passages of the Queens book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her Majestys visits to poor Highland women There was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old bodies to say just what was uppermost and not what was  fut and to talk to tho Queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman The present volume contains two such peep into Highland life and the one we quote fresents us with tho last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure widow Grant On Sunday August 22 1869 I went to see old Mn Grant whom I was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows and her poor feet r used upon cushions very much altered in her face and I fear dying of dropsy On August 20 I again saw her and gave her a shawl and pair of socks and found the poor old soul in bed looking very weak and very ill but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way I took her hand and held it On the 27th she died On the 28th I stopped at her cottage and went in with Louise and Leopold We found all so clean and tidy but all so silent Mrs Gordon her daughter was there having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her  and then she lifted the sheet and there the poor old woman whom we had known and seen from the first here these twentyone years lay on a bier in her shroud but with her usual cap on peaceful and little altered her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death She had on the socks I gave her the day before yesterday She was in her eightyninth year Probably the most enjoyable of these  Leaves are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the Highlands Here is a sketch of the juicing of the sheep At a quarter to twelve I drove off with Louise and Leopold in the waggonette up to near the  Bush the residence of William Brown the farmer to see them  juice the sheep This is a practice pursued all over the Highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter lt is done to preserve the wool Not far from the burnside where there are a few hillocks was a pen in which the sheep were placed and then just outside it a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other one man James Brown my shepherd tho elder brother who came up on purpose to help took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs  and then William and he holding them by their legs dipped them well in after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened and here they had to remain to dry To the left a little lower down was a cauldron boiling over a tire and containing the tobacco with water and soap  this was then emptied into a tub from which it was transferred into the trough A very rosyfaced lassie with a plaid over her head was superintending this part of the work and helped to fetch the water from the burn while children and many collie dogs were grouped about and several men and shepherds were helping It was a very curious and picturesque sight More pathetic is the following  Tuesday June ll 1872  Brown came in soon after four oclock saying he had been down at the waterside for a child had fallen into the water and the whole district was out to try and recover itbut it must be drowned long before this time I was dreadfully shocked It was the child of a man named Rattray who lives at CairnnaCraig just above where the new woodmerchant has built a house and quite close to the keeper Abercrombies house not far from Monaltrie Farmhouse in the street At a little before five set off in the waggonette with Beatrice and Janie Ely and drove along the north side of the river We stopped a little way beyond Tynebaich and saw the people wandering along the riverside Two women told us that two children had fallen in how terrible and that one  had been gottenthe little een  as the people pronounce one but not the eldest They were searching everywhere While we were there the ol grandmother Catenach by name who lives at Souttar Hole came running along in a great state of distress She is Rattrays mother We drove on a little way and then turned round We heard from the people that the two boys one of ten or eleven and the other only three were at Monaltrie Burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below Mrs Pattersons shop passing under a little bridge and running into the Dee This burn is generally very low and small but had risen to a great heightthe Dee itself being tremendously highnot a stone to be seen The little child fell in while the eldest was fishing  the other jumped in after him trying to save his little brother  and before any one could come out to save them though the screams of Abercrombies children who were with them were heard they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the Dee and carried along Too dreadful  It seems from what I heard coming back that the poor mother was away from home having gone to see her own mother who was dying and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one We drove back and up to Mrs Grants where we took tea and then walked up along the river side and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back  but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching amongst them was the poor fathera sad and piteous sightcrying and looking so anxiously for his poor childs body  Wednesday June 12  Drove up to the Bush to warn Mrs William Brown never to let dear little Albert run about alone or near to the burn of tho danger of which she was quite aware She said her husband William had started off early at three this morning Some people went down to Abergeldie and as far as the Girnoch to search and others were up and below the castle No word of the poor child being found All were to start early to search That the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the Queens domestic life In truth her Majestys participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment So long ago as the year of the Queens accession the Marquis of Londonderry writing to the Duke of Buckingham said I hear Melbourne says in all his numerous conversations with the Queen ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection Thia fact her Premier seems to have stated with some surprise but probably the last of her seven subsequent Premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience That these  Leaves contain much moro about Mr John Brown than about Lord Beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise The book is exclusively a record of home life and in the domestic circle the Queens personal attendant was obviously a more important personas contributing more to her comfortthan even the most admired of her first ministers Naturally enough Brown became essential to the Queen whose health sorely tried and weakened stood moro immediately in need of such simpleminded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy It is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of Browns robust independence and simple usefulness We do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kindhearted and devoted servant whose discretion and faithfulness were rewarded by gratitude and even friendship ,biography

to require illustrative comment That she has an eye for the changing phenomena of hill and dale cloud and mist that she enters with equal enjoyment into their sterner and wilder and their brighter and sunnier effects is obvious enough Above all things the Queens natureworship is healthy and gives way to no freakish spasms such as have too frequently haracterized much irrational idolatry of the external world since the days when according to Carlyle Goethe was the first to say  Come let us make a description It will be remembered that the passages of the Queens book published fifteen years ago which evoked the most direct sympathy were those which dealt with her Majestys visits to poor Highland women There was something natural and refreshing in the apparent unconsciousness of all social distinctions which prompted the good old bodies to say just what was uppermost and not what was  fut and to talk to tho Queen with the cheerful directness and homely spontaneity of woman to woman The present volume contains two such peep into Highland life and the one we quote fresents us with tho last passages in the ife of a not unfamiliar figure widow Grant On Sunday August 22 1869 I went to see old Mn Grant whom I was grieved to see sitting in her chair supported by pillows and her poor feet r used upon cushions very much altered in her face and I fear dying of dropsy On August 20 I again saw her and gave her a shawl and pair of socks and found the poor old soul in bed looking very weak and very ill but bowing her head and thanking me in her usual way I took her hand and held it On the 27th she died On the 28th I stopped at her cottage and went in with Louise and Leopold We found all so clean and tidy but all so silent Mrs Gordon her daughter was there having arrived just in time to spend the last evening and night with her  and then she lifted the sheet and there the poor old woman whom we had known and seen from the first here these twentyone years lay on a bier in her shroud but with her usual cap on peaceful and little altered her dark skin taking away from the usual terrible pallor of death She had on the socks I gave her the day before yesterday She was in her eightyninth year Probably the most enjoyable of these  Leaves are those which afford us glimpses of rural life in the Highlands Here is a sketch of the juicing of the sheep At a quarter to twelve I drove off with Louise and Leopold in the waggonette up to near the  Bush the residence of William Brown the farmer to see them  juice the sheep This is a practice pursued all over the Highlands before the sheep are sent down to the low country for the winter lt is done to preserve the wool Not far from the burnside where there are a few hillocks was a pen in which the sheep were placed and then just outside it a large sort of trough filled with liquid tobacco and soap and into this the sheep were dipped one after the other one man James Brown my shepherd tho elder brother who came up on purpose to help took the sheep one by one out of the pen and turned them on their backs  and then William and he holding them by their legs dipped them well in after which they were let into another pen into which this trough opened and here they had to remain to dry To the left a little lower down was a cauldron boiling over a tire and containing the tobacco with water and soap  this was then emptied into a tub from which it was transferred into the trough A very rosyfaced lassie with a plaid over her head was superintending this part of the work and helped to fetch the water from the burn while children and many collie dogs were grouped about and several men and shepherds were helping It was a very curious and picturesque sight More pathetic is the following  Tuesday June ll 1872  Brown came in soon after four oclock saying he had been down at the waterside for a child had fallen into the water and the whole district was out to try and recover itbut it must be drowned long before this time I was dreadfully shocked It was the child of a man named Rattray who lives at CairnnaCraig just above where the new woodmerchant has built a house and quite close to the keeper Abercrombies house not far from Monaltrie Farmhouse in the street At a little before five set off in the waggonette with Beatrice and Janie Ely and drove along the north side of the river We stopped a little way beyond Tynebaich and saw the people wandering along the riverside Two women told us that two children had fallen in how terrible and that one  had been gottenthe little een  as the people pronounce one but not the eldest They were searching everywhere While we were there the ol grandmother Catenach by name who lives at Souttar Hole came running along in a great state of distress She is Rattrays mother We drove on a little way and then turned round We heard from the people that the two boys one of ten or eleven and the other only three were at Monaltrie Burn which comes down close to the farmhouse and below Mrs Pattersons shop passing under a little bridge and running into the Dee This burn is generally very low and small but had risen to a great heightthe Dee itself being tremendously highnot a stone to be seen The little child fell in while the eldest was fishing  the other jumped in after him trying to save his little brother  and before any one could come out to save them though the screams of Abercrombies children who were with them were heard they were carried away and swept by the violence of the current into the Dee and carried along Too dreadful  It seems from what I heard coming back that the poor mother was away from home having gone to see her own mother who was dying and that she purposely kept this eldest boy back from school to watch the little one We drove back and up to Mrs Grants where we took tea and then walked up along the river side and heard that nothing had been found and that the boat had gone back  but as we approached nearer to the castle we saw people on the banks and rocks with sticks searching amongst them was the poor fathera sad and piteous sightcrying and looking so anxiously for his poor childs body  Wednesday June 12  Drove up to the Bush to warn Mrs William Brown never to let dear little Albert run about alone or near to the burn of tho danger of which she was quite aware She said her husband William had started off early at three this morning Some people went down to Abergeldie and as far as the Girnoch to search and others were up and below the castle No word of the poor child being found All were to start early to search That the book does not contain important political revelations might have gone without saying for it would have been only less than an impertinence to look for the discussion of controversial subjects of any kind in a volume that claims to be no more than a memorial of twenty years of the Queens domestic life In truth her Majestys participation in political struggles has throughout been under the control of a restraining judgment So long ago as the year of the Queens accession the Marquis of Londonderry writing to the Duke of Buckingham said I hear Melbourne says in all his numerous conversations with the Queen ho never has been able to extract an opinion in what quarter she has a predilection Thia fact her Premier seems to have stated with some surprise but probably the last of her seven subsequent Premiers could say as much with the added element of surprise that would come of a longer experience That these  Leaves contain much moro about Mr John Brown than about Lord Beaconsfield ought not to bo a matter for surprise The book is exclusively a record of home life and in the domestic circle the Queens personal attendant was obviously a more important personas contributing more to her comfortthan even the most admired of her first ministers Naturally enough Brown became essential to the Queen whose health sorely tried and weakened stood moro immediately in need of such simpleminded personal devotion as he could give than of the most astute political diplomacy It is easy to feel a good deal of honest admiration for a mau of Browns robust independence and simple usefulness We do not gather from these memorials that he was more than a kindhearted and devoted servant whose discretion and faithfulness were rewarded by gratitude and even friendship ,biography
LITERATURE TifIq Ilandican  Beine Stories of Mine I Own People By Rudyard Kipling Macmillans Mu KirueG has gathered into a volume twentyseven stories the best of them have been already recognised by readers of the magazines as Mr Kiplings finest work The book is so characteristic for good and bad of its author that it may be interesting to attempt a classification of these twentyseven stories Eight of them with certain limitations are excellent  The Incarnation of Krishna Mulvaney The Courting of Dinah Shadd  On Greenhow Hill  The Man who Was Without Benefit of Clergy Through the Fire The Finances of the Gods and  Little Tobrah To these may be added the Preface They deal with the famous triumvirate of privates with the British army and with the comedy and tragedy of native life and character Two stories  At the End of the Passage  and  The Mark of the Boast are concerned with the grim and terriblepossibilities and impossibilities of sickness weariness fear superstition climate work and to put it plainly the devil as shown by the experiences of Englishmen in India Three more  The Return of Inray  Bubbling Well Road and  Bertran and Bimi are owerful stories of the horrible without any mixture of mystery and impossibility Three The Mutiny of the Mavericks  The Head of the District and  Naingay Doola have more or less directly a political moral wrapped up in them Five more  The Amirs Homily Jews in Shushan  The Limitations of Pambe Serang The City of Dreadful Night and  The Dream of Duncan Parreness are mediocre examples of Mr Kiplings various manners and of these the fourth is the most striking The remaining six in my sincere and humble opinion do not deserve publication The Lang Men o Larut Reingelder and the German Flag  The Wandering Jew  Moti Guj  Georgie Porgie and  Naboth The volume ends with some of Mr Kiplings best verses This is of course merely a classification male according to the mind of one particular reader with his own tastes and prejudices Among the stories which I think the worst is one which many readers have ranked among the best But upon the whole I think that most readers would accept the classification in its spirit and intention The one great fault in Mr Kiplings work is not its  brutality nor its fondness for strong effects but a certain taint of bad manners from the literary point of view He insists upon spicing his stories with an illflavoured kind of gossip wholly irrelevant and very offensive For example  The Man who Was an admirable story full of that indefinable spirit military patriotism and regimental pride is spoilt by this pointless passage  And indeed they were a regiment to be admired When Lady Durgan widow of the late Sir John Durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar Wherefore she wedded a little man in a Rifle Regiment being by nature contradictious and the White Hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach She had jilted them all from BassetHolmer the senior captain to little Mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title I hate to mutilate a book but I hope to read this story often and rather than meet the offenco and the annoyance of that silly stuff in a story otherwise splendid I have obliterated the passage Too often in reading Mr Kipling we are forced to say  That would make a good spccial report or  Thats a telling bit of war correspondence  yet special reports and war correspondence are good things of their hind But the passage just quoted shows merely the contemptible smartness of a society journal and of a very inferior specimen I do not say that the thing did not could not or should not happen  I do say that Mr Kipling as an artist one careful to preserve the tone and the proportion of his work commits a grave offence against his art by such a fall from the fline to the tiivial without just cause And from the frequeucy of his offence in every book that he has written it would seem that he does not feel the common sentiments of natural good breeding and of artistic reticence Two expressions in a stirring passage of the same story jar upon us in the same way  The talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the inunemorial custom till all tonIgues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said  Mr Vice the Queen and little Mildred from the bottom of the table answered  The Queen God bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the Queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their mess bills That sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of tbe listener wherever lie be by sea or by land What is the point here of dragging in the familiar fact that the Queens pay is insufficient for a modern officer under modern circumstances  It sounds like the petty illconditioned criticism of some cockney moneylender it is a crying false note coming just in that place Again  toast of obligation and  sacrament of the mess are phrases in which it is difficult not to see a flippant reference to two ecclesiastical and sacred terms These things are fatal to the perfection of a story and Mr Kiplings taste for them is his worst enemy But it may be observed that they do not occur except when Mr Kipling is dealing with English officers and civilians his common soldiers and his Indian natives under all circumstances and conditions talk and are treated by Mr Kipling without these petty offences against good taste Ortheris and Mulvaney Ameera and Khoda Dad Khan in every mood or situation are allowed by Mr Kipling to live without those peculiar tricks and tones which in his stories are the essential notes of the English gentleman in India His officers and his civil servants Orde Tallantire Hummil Spurstow Lowudes Mottram Strickland and 1I one and all talk with a strained intensity a bitter tone a sharp concisoness an abbreviation of epigram a clever slang which are meant to denote partly their cultured intellects and partly that sentiment of fatality and dogged endurance which Mr Kipling would have us believe to be the invariable result of official work in India The Empire the Administration the Government become in Mr Kiplings hands necessary and yet amusing powers in whose service Englishmen are willing to toil and sweat knowing that il ny pals 1omne necessaire but content to go on relieved by making cynical epigrams about life and death and everything before between or after them The consciousness of duty becomes the consciousness of a mechanical necessity the sentiment of loyalty is caricatured into a cynical perseverance Ono thinks of Dalhousie and of the Lawrences Mr Kipling has had experience of English life and work in India his reader for the most part have not But I would ask any reader who has known Engliih offlears and civilians before during anl after their Indian service whether he has found then quito s brilliant or quite so illbred quite so opigrammatic or quite so selfconscious as these creatures of Mr Kipling Is it that befoe leaving home or while home on leave or when done with India they are natural Englishmen but that an Indian climate and a share in Iidian administration turn them into m1iachines  men who seem to talk like telegrams and to think in shorthand and to pose each as a modern Atlas helping to uphold the Indian Empire and swearing pessimist oaths at its weight  Mr Kipling presents English rule in India for purposes of effective fiction as a huge and ironical joke or to use one of his favourite words as a  grim  comedy In fact whenever he gives us the views of life held by men of education and official responsibility they are tho views expressed by his title Lafe8 JIHndicap You start with your chances and make the best of the race sure to be triped up half way by the irony of the fates and powers or baulked at the very finish In the  Head of the District a dying main sees his wife crossing the river to meet him and knows that she will come too late and his last words are  Thats Polly he sail simply though his mouth was wried with agony  Polly and the grimnicst proaticl jb r  pVolayj d on a man Dickvuul lEv to  exptil The one story in the look adhnirall from first to

LITEtATURE DANIEL DERONDA Daniel Deronda By George Eliot London W Blackwood and Sons We know not which to admire most in  Daniel Deronda the profound moral earnestness which could create two such characters as Gwendolen and Daniel Deronda or the giggling flippancy wbich could place at Derondas wedding feast  the entire Cohen family with the one exception of tho baby who carried on her teething intelligently at home In none of George Eliots novels have her sense of humour and her conviction of the supreme duty of earnestness come so flagrantly into conflict as in the present One cannot lay down tho last volume of  Daniel Deronda without some tribute of astonishment at tho vast range of the authors powers It is possible to regard her last novel either as a sermon in disguise or as an impartial picture of existing phases of English societya great work of course in either view On the whole perhaps ones impression is that in  Daniel Deronda George Eliot is a preacher and teacher in the first place and a novelist in the second The purely pictorial purpose in this as in others of her novels is subordinate to the ethical In  Daniel Deronda strange as it may seem in the production of such a humorist the dominant motive as revealed in the last volume of the work is a protest against the vanity and frivolity of the time In its last pages instead of an invitation to esthetic or humorous reverie we seem to find a trumpetcall to young men and maidensto young men to take example by the noble gravity of Daniel Deronda and to maidens to take warning by the frivolity of Gwendolen Harleth and its tragic consequences A protest against low sordid personal aims an incentive to a higher worthier more aspiring and humane life such would seem to be the ruling intention of Daniel Deronda wrought subtly into a humorous picture of things as they are which may satisfy tho flaunting Gallio to whom the enthusiasm of humanity is merely one among its many diverse qualities The earlier volumes of the work gave little hint of tho elevated strain which predominates in the later volumes and the full earnestness of the authors purpose was not certain till the very last and even then it is open to argument for the subtle mind This says much for tho success with which George Eliot can subdue herself into the attitude of dramatic impartiality even while she retains as a governing idea in her work that it should as a whole point somewhere teach some lesson have some aspiration towards the infinite All through the skilful dissection of Gwendolens heartlessness which seems to leave not a nook or corner in ber being unsearched and unexhibited exposing the most secret and unacknowledged of her little vanities we are left to speculate as we may upon the phenomenon We feel as if we were present at a lecture in social pathology by a most skilful professor of the social microscope This creature a product of the generation is dissected before us and put piece by piece nnder the glass wo look on peep in our turn through the instrument and admire the skill of the anatomist as she flourishes her keen knife Whether the structure is a diseased or a healthy structure Professor Eliot does not say till she has anatomised it to its minutest filaments But having completed her pathological lecture she next proceeds to indicate what an abominable perversion of nature this creature is and how it is possible to reform it into the likeness of something nobler Several times in the course of the lecture she has drawn marked attention to a certain rudimentary part of the creature an undeveloped organ  Note this I will return to it another time In tho course of tho exposition we have become deeply interested in this organ and byandby our curiosity is gratified We aro shown how the whole nature has been perverted by the starvation of this part and by what means it is possible to nourish it till it attains its proper strength and restore the natural balance of the system It seems as if George Eliot had feared lest the baser tendencies of the age should take heart and flourish from the discomfiture of the nnworldly aspirations of Dorothea and the ridiculous collapse of the ambitions of Casaubon and had resolved to concoct an antidote in the careers of Gwendolen and Mordecai to show the danger which sometimes attends calculating selfishness and lightheaded conceit and the sweet reward which sometimes waits npon disinterested enthusiasm There must be hundreds of girls more or less like Gwendolen among George Eliots readers and the exposure of her shallow frivolous aims is meant to make them ashamed of themselves and to lift them into a higher conception of their duties and destinies Perhaps if George Eliot had thought fit to make this lesson to the girls of the period more than a gentle hint she ought to have increased Gwendolens punishment for after all Gwendolen comes very comfortably out of her troubles being left with two thousand ayear and a developed conscience and free to marry if she chooses a hearty handsome young cousin whose addresses she had slighted in her unregenerate days But then Gwendolens crime after all was girlish giddiness and thoughtlessness and the justice of the circulating library is completely satisfied if her heart is softened and her wicked husband is drowned If Grandcourt had turned np again or if he had left her as poor as she was when she came to him her fate would perhaps have been a moro terrible warning but it would have been too miserable besides that if sho had been left in physical misery we could not have had tho same assurance of the reality of her moral regeneration If Gwendolen is a warning to the girl of the period Daniel Deronda is equally an example to the young man of tho period in the gravity and loftiness of his aims Our flippant youth would probably call him a visionary or a prig and would jeer at his relations with Gwendolen as impossible  and their judgment of his impossibility would probably be right if he were meant as a type of our own race His grave meditative nature his profound composure and selfcontrol his steady persistent passion are eminently Hebraic and are meant to be so He is an illustration of an element in our complex insular life that is not of indigenous origin It is an influence too to which in our earnest moments we are not incapable of yielding ourselves and with the healthiest of results There is a something in it also which is repellent to the average common sense of Englishmen That something is well expressed by Sir Hugo Mullinger an admirably drawn type of the cultivated English squire I have long expected something remarkable from you Dan  but for Gods sake dont go into any eccentricities I can tolerate any mans difference of opinion hut let him tell it me without getting himself up as a lunatic At this stago of tho world if a man wants to be tikn seriously ho must keep clear of melodrama Dont misunderstand mo I am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account I only think you might easily bo led arm in ann with a lunatic especially if he wanted defending You have a passion for people who arc pelted Dan Im sorry for them too but so far as company goes its a Kid ground of selection Still Sir Hugo does not quarrel with Daniel Deronda for his Innacy ho respects his earnestness and here again he is typical of his countrymen By far the most wonderful part of  Daniel Deronda its chief claim to admiration as an achievement is its picture of the Jews its exemplification and analysis of different forms of Jewish life some of them not so estimable as Deronda and Mordecai We have spoken of the Cohen family in noticing previous numbers of the work In the last volume there is a notable addition to the gallery in thc portrait of Lapidoth Mirahs father who verities her presentiments by suddenly arresting her one clay in the street as she is walking homo from giving some musiclessons Ho is one of the most perfectly drawn and lifelike figures in thc book Who has not seen him with his ineffaceable air of jauntiness duo to his small hands and feet and the bushy locks that escape from under his hat  Thc look of impudent suavity the result of a habit of courting favour while accepting disrespect is a look which lives of social struggle have stamped npon the features of many of the Hebrew race The interview between this glib unconscionable vagabond who has something of the character of Charles Mathewss Awful Dad and the son and daughter from whom he has been so long separated is very finely conceived There are very few students of human nature who would have conceived the idea of making Lapidoths impudence break down in so hysterical a way beneath his sons stern rebuke  or who having done so would have made the fit of repentance so transient that he is making capital of his tears before they have dried on his cheek The humour of Lapidoths subsequent attempts to make himself agreeable to Mordecai and Deronda and of the irksomeness of his feigned industry is exquisite George Eliot shows due regard for the requirements of the comic muse in getting rid of the old knave so lightly Among the minor characters in  Daniel Deronda  there are many charmingly delicate and truthful studies but perhaps the finest and certainly not the least difficult of all is Lapidoth When we think of all that there is in Daniel Deronda we are much more disposed to admire the stupendous genius of the work than to regret the absence of any of the qualities of the novelist Still wThen wc look upon the novel merely as a work of art we must admit that it has deficiencies It is a subepidermic subcutaneous kind of art the figures are too much like elaborately dissected specimens laid out upon the table of a professor of psychology It is not to be deniedt hat the novel has in many passages a tendency to dulness and that dulness comes from the action of the story and the portraits of the characters being too much overlaid with professorial comment The novel is not a work of art pure and simple but a novel mixed up with an elaborate running criticism of all its parts There is a want of courage in George Eliot she cannot leave her characters to explain themselves She must always be telling us why they do this and say the other thing what principles of their nature they are illustrating She is too professorial too much like a professor who bores the average members of his class by overanxiety to take the dunces along with him Nevertheless she is a great writer a great genius and if the homage which she receives is sometimes misdirected no one will contend that it is excessive in its sum totalLITERATURE Daniel Deronda By George Eliot Edin burgh and London W Blackwood  Sons 187G Independently of its interest as a mere story and as a vehicle for reflections Daniel Deronda is eminently interesting because it presents in a fresh and brilliant light tho merits as well as the faults of its writer merits and faults which are here sharply accentuated and are not as is too frequently the case blurred and confused by the wearing of the plate Both classes of peculiarities should be by this time pretty well known to the student of English letters On the one hand we are prepared to find and we do find an extraordinarily sustained and competent grasp of certain phases of character  a capacity of rendering minute effects of light and shade attitudes transient moods of mind complex feelings and the like which is simply unparalleled in any other prose writer  an aptitude for minting sharply ethical maxims and a wonderful sympathy with humanity so far at least as it is congenial to the writer On the wrong side of the account must be placed a tendency to talk about personages instead of allowing them to develop themselves a somewhat lavish profusion of sententious utterance a preference for technical terms in lieu of the common dialect which is the fitter language of the novelist and a proneness to rank certain debateable positions and onesided points of view among the truths to which it is safe to demand universal assent To this black list must be added some decided faults in style In discussing a book which is in everybodys hands it will be well to show how the above points are brought out and how they affect the general merit of the book rather than to indulge in superfluous description of the plot In the matter of character then wo find two signal triumphs of portraiture Tlie part of Gwendolen Harleth is throughout an overwhelming success and the minutest and least friendly examination will hardly discover a false note or a dropped stitch Her selfwilled youth the curious counterfeit of superiority in intellect and character which her selfconfidence and her ignorance of control temporarily give her her instant surrender at tho touch of material discomfort  the collapse of her confidence in the presence of a stronger spirit the helpless outbursts of selfpity of rage of supplication which follow that collapse  the struggle between blind hatred and almost equally blind glimmerings of conscience  the torrent of remorse and final prostration of willare all imagined with a firmness and succeed each other with an undoubted right of sequence which cannot but command admiration The husband is almost equally admirable  indeed ones admiration is here increased by the perception that the hand which is so faithful is distinctly unfriendly and that the author would like ns to detest Grandcourt Yet there is not the slightest exaggeration in the portrait as he appears before us acting with strict politeness to his wife in no way violent towards ber if we except the occasional use of somewhat forcible language and employing for the purposes of his refined tyranny nothing stronger than the methods of  awful rule and right supremacy If he should appear to anyone all the more detestable it may be suggested that it is difficult for any husband to extricate himself handsomely from the position of being hated by his wife and having that hatred confided to a bewitching rival The more study we give to these wonderful creations the better we like them and an additional interest is impaitcd by the discovery that Gwendolen is at heart a counterfoil of Dorothea animated by an undisciplined egotism instead of an undisciplined altruism and by the fanaticism of enjoyment instead of the fanaticism of sympathy It might even suggest itself to a symmetrical imagination that tho soul of Casaubon clothed with the circumstances and temperament of a fine gentleman would animate just such a personage as Grandcourt But these nro fancies The point of present importance is that tho interest of the story undoubtedly tends to centre in these two admirable characters and is unfortunately not allowed to do so Of the third according to tho authors design the first personage wo cannot speak as we have just spoken The blameless young man of faultless feature who clutches his coatcollar continually who at the age of some twenty years wished  to get rid of a merely English attitude in studies  who in the words of his best friend was disposed  to take an antediluvian point of view lest he should do injustice to the megatherium   of whom it was impossible to believe in the still more graphic words of the friends sister  that he had a tailors bill and used boothooks who never does a wicked thing and never says one that is not priggishis a person so intolerably dreadful that we not only dislike but refuse to admit him as possible Only once perhaps is he humanwhen he persuades himself on all sorts of ethicophysicohistorical grounds that he should like to be a Jew solely becauso as that very sensible woman his mother the Princess discovers at once he wishes to marry a fascinating Jewess We cannot accept as an excuse for the selection of this  faultless monster  as hero tho pleas put forward in the book that it is only tho  average man  and the  dull man  that will not understand him and that the average man is not very clear about tho structure of his own retina and the dull mans  dulness subsists notwithstanding his lack of belief in it In the first place the cases are not parallel for though the average man may know very little about the structure of his retina he can tell a real eye from a glass one well enough And in the second place tho dull man may fairly retort  If you are a great novelist make me believe in your characters In this dearth or rather distortion of central interest the minor characters do not help us much They are far less individual and far less elaborate than is usual with George Eliot Daniel Deronda does not supply a fifth to join the noble quartette of Mdmes Holt and Cadwalladcr Poy ser and Glegg Sir Hugo Mullinger with Hans Meyrick and his sister Mab makes a shift to fill up the gap but it is but a shift Lapidoth the unwelcome father is chiefly welcome to us the readers because ol the happy boldness of the incident which finally unites the lovers Mordecai we must not we suppose call a minor character but of him more hereafter There is no lack in these volumes of thc exqtxisite cabinet pictures to which George Eliot has accustomed us Tho account of Gwendolens grounds of confidence  the charming etching of tho waggon passing Pennieote Keeto ry tlie scene of thc first ride with Grandcourt Gwendolen nfl cr Klesmer has crushed her hopes of artistic success and again immediately before she at last accepts her lover the wonderful sketch of Grandcourt sitting meditatively on a sofa and abstainingfroiu literature Deronda in the synagogue the stables at the Abbey  thc waiting at Genoa for the Princess  and lastly Gwendolens retrospect of Ofleiulonc are all effects ofthe finest in this kind But this good gift and other good gifts have been somewhat repressed as it seems t o us in order that certain tendencies not so excellent in themselves and very much the reverse of excellent when inordinately indulged might have freer play No one can read Daniel De rt nt da without perceiving and regretting thc singular way in which the characters are incessantly pushed back iu order that tho author may talk about them and about everything in heaven and cart li while the action stands still Very sparingly used this practice is not ineffective hut the unsparing uso of it is certainly bad especially when we consider in what kind of language these parabases or excursus are expressed We cannot away in a novel with emotive memory and dynamic quality with  hymning of cancerous vices  and keenly perceptive sympathetic emotivencss with  coercive types  and  spiritual perpetuation still less with hundreds ol phrases less notable because bulkier Xo doubt many of these expressions are appropriate enough and they are all more or less intelligible to decentlyeducated people No doubt tho truths of science mental and physical are here as elsewhere in our authors works rendered with astonishing correctness and facility But it appears to us that the technical language of psychology is as much out of place in prose fiction as illustration of its facts is appropriate In philosophy in politics in religion in art a novelist when he speaks in his own person should have no opinion should be of no sect should indulge in no argot If we are dissatisfied with tho Jewish episode which is so remarkable in this book it is not merely because it has supplied temptations to indulge in psychological disquisition We do not in the slightest degree feel  imperfect sympathy with Jews and we hold that Shylock had the best of the argument But the question here is whether the phase of Judaism now exhibited the mystical enthusiasm for race and nation has sufficient connexion with broad human feeling to be stuff for prose fiction to handle We think that it has not and we are not to be converted by references to the average man The average man has never experienced the passion of Hamlet of Othello or of Lear he is not capable of the chivalry of Esmond of the devotion of Des Grieux of the charity of the Vicar of Wakefield But he has experienced and he is capable of something of which all theso sublime instances are merely exalted forms Now the  Samothracian mysteries of bottled moonshine to borrow a phrase from Allon Locke into which Mordecai initiates Deronda are not thus connected with anything broadly human They aro not only  willworship but they have a provincial character which excludes fellow feeling Poetry could legitimately treat them indeed many of Mordecais traits may be recognised as we think moro happily placedin tho Sephardo of The Spanish Gypsy They are no doubt interesting historically they throw light on the character and aspirations of a curious people and supply an admirable subject for a scientific monograph But for all this they are not the stuff of which the main interest or even a prominent interest or anything but a very carefully reduced side interest of prose novels should be wrought It is hardly necessary to say that this dissatisfaction with tho manner and scale of his appearances does not blind us to the skill applied in the construction of Mordecai Probably no other living writer is capable of the patient care with which these intricate and unfamiliar paths aro followed certainly no other is master of the pathos which half reconciles the reluctant critic If tho thing was to be done it could hardly have been done better assuredly it could not have deen done with greater cunning of analysis or in a manner more suggestive We should have no right to complain that to the simplicity and passion whieh characterise the subjects and situations of the authors earlier books there has succeeded something more complex and analytic in the present it is a timehonoured transition and one which has before now yielded excellent results But in reality the transition is not in this case great because the subjectmatter really remains the same although there may be somewhat less directness of treatment The book is little more than a fresh variation on the theme which has informed so much of George Eliots work which lurks even in the Scenes of Clerical Life which is hardly in abeyance in Adam Bede which is tho professed motive of The Mill on the Floss of The Spanish Gypsy and of Romola which gives charm to the slightness of Silas Mar uer  to wit the excellence of obeying the instigations of kinship and duty Hither than the op posing instinct All for Love and the World well Lost Perhaps the motive has hardly depth and volume enough to bear such constant application But this is matter of opinion The matter of fact remains that we have once more presented to us in the contrast between Gwendolens misery and the prosperity of the sleek Deronda the same moral as we had in Hettys catastrophe in the fate which punished Maggie Tullivers partial declension from the standard in the ruin and disgrace that sprang from Duke Silvas passion in the degradation and death of Tito Melema tho same theories which led to the sympathetic selection of Felix Holt for a hero and of Dorothea Brooke for a heroine The moral and the standard and the theories aro doubtless of a fine severity and deal deserved rebuke to tho lax pleasureseeking which has been considered a vice at all times and is not openly considered a virtue even yet In tho illustrations of these doctrines the author has again given us admirable portraits and much exquisitelydrawn surrounding But perhaps she has also once moro illustrated the immutable law that no perfect novel can ever be written in designed illustration of a theory whether moral or immoral and that art like Atticus and the Turk will bear no rival near the throne George Saintsijury,biography
Litth Women or Meg Jo Beth and Amy Part Second By Louisa M Alcott Low  Co Tms is a cheerful domestic story which appears to be written for the especial use and behoof of the fair sex as it deals with the gradual development of character which takes place in the four young heroines whose earlier years have been described in a previous work The scene is in the United States and our fair countrywomen will find here portrayed a state of society to which they are utterly unaccustomed although at the same time the book abounds with touches of human nature and traits of character which are common to all the world Probably but we speak on such topics with diffidence there is something very lifelike in Miss Jos confession some time after refusing an offer of marriage that perhaps if Teddy had tried again she might have said  Yesnot because she loved him any more but because she cared more to be loved than when he went away But Teddy has now found elsewhere the haven of rest which Jo denied him and Jo has to content herself with the gift of an awakened but as yet unsatisfied heart It is almost needless to say that Miss Jo is one of the strongminded race of young women and that she has started in life with the fallacious idea that a mans love is by no means essential to a womans happiness Now she has found out her mistake and deigns to make confession to her mother who congratulates her on her progress in natural feelings Tm glad of that Jo says the calm but sympathising parent for it shows that you are getting on There are plenty to love you so try to be satisfied with father and mother sisters and brothers friends and babies till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward Jo takes the advice very kindly but assures her mother that her heart has become so elastic lately that it cannot be properly filled as of yore with family affections I used to be quite contented with my family I dont understand it says poor Jo I do says her mother with a meaning smile This seems all very pretty and sensible and it is a fact we believe that young ladies do sometimes get confidential with their mammas on these subjects when softened by a little disappointment Miss Jo in her early days aspires to literary success the other sisters one artistic one consumptive and so on follow out their several destinies and most of them get  settled  in due time though not so to speak according to the  first intention There is a good deal of innocent fun in the book and there is no lack of quaint Transatlantic expressions and turns of thought She never broke her word and was much exercised in her mind how to get round it You must promise not to cut up any pranksDont be a peacock I only moaned a trifle just to keep the other girls company  I dont wish to get raspy so lets change the subject No wonder that young Mr Lawrence the hero gives up all thought of Jo the individual who doesnt wish to  get raspy and seeks happiness with the gentle Amy who vows that she is prouder of her handsome husband than of all his money and addresses him with the tender words  Dont laughbut your nose is such a comfort to me  The reader will find more truth and more humour in this story than in many works of fiction of a more pretentious character,juvenile
Little Journeys to the Homes of Good Men and Great By Elbert Hubbard G P f utnams Sons It must be confessed that Mr Elbert Hubbard has selected a most unfortunate title for his book It has about it a distinct flavour of the Young Mens Christian Society and conveys to the literary reader an entirely false impression of the nature of its contents As a matter of fact these twelve essays are particularly free from faults of the kind their illchosen title suggests Jejune they are not neither are they amateurish Indeed it is not to praise them too highly to say that they are free from conspicuous faults of any kind We receive another check in attacking the book almost immediately we open it It was a mistake to couple George Eliots name with Shaksperes treating the two as equals It was a mistake too to assume that George Eliot occupies the place among women conceded by all the world to Shakspere as a man It is true that when we challenge ourselves to instance her superiors we feel somewhat confused but this only emphasises the fact that at present at all events it is ridiculous to assume that in the aggregate there is anything like equality between men and women writers However we may let that pass It is a small fault and it is almost ungenerous to mention it As we dip deeper into Mr Hubbards pages the simplicity and grace of his narrative compel confidence He has the true instinct of compression and the skill to seize essentials He paints pictures for us with the directness of a Degas but he infuses into them the idealism of a Millet He tells the story of Mary Ann Evanss association with George Lewes with sympathetic insight and completeness nothing extenuating and setting naught down in malice His description of hie stay at Warwick of tho inn there and of his walk over to Nuneaton is written with cameolike distinction The present writer has made the same pilgrimage and in doing so he has communed in spirit with the essayist The writer next takes us into the company of Thomas Carlyle and his wife Herein he shows that ho possesses the gift of sympathy and iosight into the complexity of human character I have never read a more understanding story of the relations between these two  Jeannie Welsh Carlyle writes Mr Hubbard  bad oapacity for pain as r seems all great souls have She Bufferedbut then suffering is not all suffering and pain is not all pain And again  His Carlyles was a masculine mind Tbe discrimination and subtle intuitions which are k found to be scattered through his pages like t violets growing among the rank swale of the prairies all these sweet odorous things came from his wife She gave him her best thoughts and he greedily absorbed and unconsciously wrote it down as his own The excellent taste of Mr Hubbards brief biography makes it of more value than many ponderous tomes written about Carlyle The picture of John Ruskin too if as vivid as it is characteristic Incidentally it must be remarked that in this essay Mr Hubbard is betrayed into indulging in some cheap and inconclusive remarks on the nature of genius and on the position of the woman married to a man of genius His premises are wrong and bis deductions are false and the several examples upon which he bases his contentions are absolutely without point Mr Gladstones picture has been so often drawn that Mr Hubbard could not be expected to make his version of that manysided man stand out He gives us however an excellent sketch of Chester and of a wellknown hostelry there But Mr Hubbard is at fault in speaking of Lord Brougham as a Scotchman He prefaces his eulogium of Turner wiih that sentence of Ruskins which is more remarkable for the generous wholeheartedness of its praise than for its critical accuracy To speak of any work of Turners as incapable of any improvement conceivable by the human mind is simply to descend into rhapsody However the responsibility for this extravagance may be borne by Mr Ruskin The tale of Turners early struggles is told with sympathy and knowledge For a long time his pictures were not popular  First the public says Mr Hubbard scorned Turner Next Turner scorned the public In the beginning it would not buy his pictures and later it could not    For merit there is a recompense in sneers and a benefit in sarcasms and a compensation in hate This essay on Turner is among the most illumined of the series  If Swift says Mr Hubbard had possessed only his mothers merits without his fathers faults he would never have shaken the world with laughter and we should never have heard of him In other words no man is supremely great unless he has a dash of the devil in him And Swift is certainly a striking example of this truth  His misanthropy as the writer remarks  defeated his purpose thwarted his ambition ruined his aims andmade his name illustrious For think what a small meed of fame would have been his had he achieved the summit of his desires and been enthroned as Primate of England The profession of letters was hateful to him he despised it Social precedence was his aim even more than political power The last was in his eyes a passport to the first But Swift had not the patience to wait his stomach was too high to permit him to crawl into the office he coveted 4 To succeed in winning a bishopric requires a sagacity as keen as that needed to become a governor of New York The man bides his time makes himself popular secures advocates lubricates the way pulls the wires and slides noiselessly into place As a Churchman Swift was an Erastian of the purest type He was as Mr Hubbard says  as incapable of spirituality as he was of the grand passion Not an amiable man assuredly a man to respect perhaps but not to love Frond severe cruel calculatingthere were no bounds to his ambition The philosophy which comes with years did not serve to allay the smart of his bruised and wounded spirit He was of the earth earthy a materialist and so far as essentials go a sceptic His undying literary creations wera evolved to give vent to his spleen That Swift wai congenitally mad his recent biographers see fit to deny but to the present writer the denial seems to be based on grounds which only pedantry can accept His overweening vanity was the outcome of incipient madnees of which indeed it was a symptom Mr Hubbard tells a characteristic story of Victor Hugo What he had once written  down Beelzebub and all his hosts could not make him change At a rehearsal of  Hernani Mlle Man expressed a dislike to rn certain word and asked the author to change it  I wrote it and it must stand was his answer But Mlle Mars persisted in using another expression instead of the authors whereupon Hugo asked her to resign her part The lady wept promised to adhere to the text and was reinstated Fiftythree times thereafter she played the part and she did not once speak what the author had written  The moral of this is that even a strong man cannot cope with a small woman who weeps at the right time The next two essays those on Wordsworth and Thackeray are less effective Thousands of pens have written about Dickens but bis works and his haunts have rarely been treated more luminously than by the writer under consideration It would be difficult to commend too highly his lightness of touch or the philosophic tolerance with which he deals with his subject And in estimating Dickenss place among the novelists of all time Mr Hubbard is as critical as he is just  The novelist says he  must have lived and the novelist must have imagination But this is not enough He must have power to analyse and separate and then he should have the good taste to select and group forming his parts into a harmonious whole It must be admitted that Mr Hubbards defence of Dickens against his severest critics is scarcely convincing He tacitly admits that many of his characters arenot really alive but only seem to be  By rummaging he says  over the commercial world you can collect the harshness greed avarice selfishness and vanity from a thousand men With these sins you can if you are very skilful construot a Ralph Nicklcby a Scrooge a Jonas Chuzzlewit an Alderman Cute a Mr Murdstone a Bounderby or Gradgrind at will A little more pride a trifle less hypocrisy a molecule extra of untruth and flavour with this fault or that and your man is ready to place up against the fence to dry Mr Hubbard discourses on Dickens admirably and entertainingly and he says some acute things on his own account He thus sums up his qualities and limitations 44 He has a watch that starts in a way of its own never mind the sun He lets you see the wheels go round but he never tells you why the wheels go round He knows little of psychologythat curious unseen thing that stands behind every act He knows not the highest love therefore he never depiots the highest joy Nowhere does he show the gradual awakening in man of Godlike passion nowhere does he show the evolution of a soul very very seldom does he touch the sublime But he has given the Athenians a day of pleasure and for this let us all devoutly give thanks After Dickens Goldsmith About that wayward son of genius Mr Hubbard writes entrancingly He takes us through the land of his birth in a coach and fourthe good steeds of fancy sympathy charity and Ehilosophy And when he leaves Goldsmith e takes up his parable again with Shakspere Then he makes his bow and we are sincerely sorry Jas Stanley Little,biography

LllrrLl DORRIT Lttle Dorrnt By Charles Dickens With Illustrations by II K Drowns Bradbury sad 1u TInE completion of one of Mr Dickenss monthly number books is to the critic what the termination of a year of great events is to the politiciat I the close of an epoch to the historian The general reader may PAN fraO the perusal of the last chapter to the first chapter of some new work wilhdd endeavouring to harmonise and arrange the various impressions and emohe has derived fromx the whole but it is the duty as well as the plesas Of the critic to turn the completed globe round upon its axis and tr i various lines as they converge towards the filial result Even to him ho ever the task is not easy There is such an affluence of life in all Mr Dickenss booksso vast a rance of character and observation of the wold so broad a canvas crowded with so many shapes and incidentsthat te effect on the mind is not so much that of gllancing over a finished stor that of looking at an epitome of life itself If this involves some dege of imperfection in the mere matter of storytelling it also miodeI M highest eIogy that can be pronounced oil j tiovolit w19QU Sppook Di is the portryal of human nature and humian action Air Dickens i the most dramatic of the novelists lie reflects the whole round of life from the richest and most refined circles to thle humblest and roughest and looks with a penetrating eye and with the intuition of intense sympathy into all h depths of the human heart all the secret nooks of the affections all the crooked subtleties of villany all the tanigled combinations of good and bad which make us what we are We do not exaggerate when we say that his enius possesses sonie poilnts of resemblance to that of Shakspearesorucig of the very thing which more than anything else makes Shakspeare the greatest of dramatic poets It is not nierely tat Dickens is himself a poet and in nothing so much as in his exquisite sensitiveness to those fine treads of analogy which conllect thle anliminate with the inanimate world so that the still life of his scenes is constauitly mnade to reflect the loiinant emotion of the characters ill a manner which imay appear extravagant to matteroffact linls but wlhich is woilerflully true to all who have ever felt emotionit is not inerely thlat iiiany of his characters have in them such a stronm and sclf existent vitality that they have already become 1art of our actua experience anld remain there like renieinbrances of our own lifeit is not mertly that Dickens has adled phrases to the language which are to be found in almost alny column of a newspaper you may takc up to read haphazardit is not simply on these accounts that Dickens shows some a nity with Shakspeare but niuch more on account of that feeling of universal sympathy with human nature which breathes through his pages like the broad and general atmlosphlerc lie soars above all considerations of sect above all narrow isolations of erceil andl though a niorc deeply religious writer is not to be foundl in all those elemnents of religion which rise eternally from thle niatural emotions of love and reverence lhe is never disputatiously theological or acadeiiiically dogniatic Certain Universitybred reviewers whose shrivelled souls cannott understand the fresh spon taneous efflorescence of genius and who will accept no gold that does not come to them impressed with the college stamp may affect to despise the large regard of Dickens hut the world will recognise its great ones whether or not they wear the unitinrm of cap and gown As with his other works so is it with Litle irrit The whole picture is quick and warm with lite Passing from the hot southern flush and glare of Marseilles in the opening chiapter to the grimn old twilight house in London with its haunting omysteries anrd uneasy secrets in which MIrs Clennam anrd Mr lFlintwinch plot anid counterlplotchangwing from the dull prison rooms and yard with their attendaiint poverty made glorious by the divine light and love of Little lorrit to the stately palaces of Rome and Venice glowing with the poinp of wealtheverywhere and unider all circumstances the vitality of the conceptions asserts itself with all the supremacy of genius A comitlete character will start before you within the compins of a tew lines as in the case of the little Frenchiwonian of whom Mr liorrit purcluses the gifts for Mrs General 0r in that of the Swiss bost whom Air Iorrit alniost annihilates for a tfhncied slight or in that ot the landlady of the Break of Day att Clialons But these are the mere overflowings of thle cup Te main chliaraeters are those to which we must chiefly look And first of Al Iorrit What awful truth and solenin voice of warning is there in tLat weak selfish pompous insanely proud manlproud and vain in his poverty while descending to depthis of ieanness flaunting his shabby family sctitclieon in the face of the visitors of whom lie and pretending to a gentlemanly independence while his daughter t wheor nl almost starves for him  equally but not more proudl and vain when he suddenly becomes wNealthy and fancies himself compelled to resort to miserable shifts to conceal his former state which his daughters devotion should have miade noble in his eyes Proud and vain to the last though when the overexcitenient ot his changed lite topples over his reason and his health he divulges in his mintal wanderings the fact ot his previous poverty and lies with the shdlowv of the Aazrshalsea upon hinm Air Dorrit is the very type of flunkeyism  and our time stanls in need of a lesson against that sordil viece tit a nianly detestation of servility is one of the most prominent elemenits in this tale We see it again in the character of Mr Alerdile the swinrlhing speculator Air Ilerdle it is well known is a portrait from life but it may be as well to recollect that lie is not merely a reflex of one individual Ile is true to a very large arid it is to be fered an increasing class a class of individuals not merely corrupt in themselves but the cause of corruptioni in others What matter that the Slerdles of real life like the AMerdle of

toces minute in themselves but showing the finest wit and the deepes lede of character We find the same courageous independence of thought one ore exhibited in the scorching satire directed against our  Circumlocution o0ge and  Tite Barnacle legislators How much truth there is in that satir is shown by the fact of its being at once adopted by the popular mind Against these shadows in the general

Justice on that chief of impostors and the purely disinterested agent in reco g their for tune tor the lorrit family These are the golden rays Mtlighten the story the chief of course being Clennam and Little Dorit From thoeo two characters a soft mild grave sad radiance streams fhm tbeginning to the end of the book And by a beautiful sense of poetical fitness Lfttle Dorrit is brought back again to Clennam after her long absence abroad in the very prison and the very room where he had often been so great a fried to her and where she is now to be so priceless a boon and agelical a comforter to him And in the neighbouring church they are married in the calm autumn weather which seems to typify their lives WYe must confess to some disappointment at the explanation towards the close of the book of the mystery connected with Mrs Clennam and dte old house with its strange noises It is deficient in clearness and doe not fulfil the expectations of the reader which have been wound up to a high pitch Indeed the woof of the entire story does not hold together with suflicient closenessa fault perhaps inseparable from the mode of publics tion The writing however shows all Mr Dickenss singular union of close observation arad rich fancy A few instances suggest themselves as e wurite Of Jeremiah Flintwinch whose head is always on one side so that the knotted ends of his cravat dangle under one ear and who has a swollen and suffused look we arc told that he had a weird appearance of having hanged himself at one time or other and of having gone about ever since halter and all exactly as some timely hand had cut him down The watch worn by the same old man was deposited in a deep pocket  and had a tarnished copper key moored aIbove it to hotw where it was mxk The garret bedroom of the old house contains a lean set of fire irons like the skeeton of a set deceased nnd  a bedstead with four bare atomio of poser each terminating in a spike as if for the diunal accovrodatiox of ogm who htiyit prejer to ilrnale themselves Very poeticaL also is the identfiation of the pentup fire in Airs Clennams sickroom with the invalid herself  The fire shone sullenl all day and sullenly all night On rare occasions it flashed up pasionately as she dlid  but for the most part it was Suppred like her and preyed upon itself evenly and Slowly The light of this fire throws the shadows of Airs Clennam old Flintwinch and his wife Mistress Affiery on a gateway opposite like figures from a magic lantern I As the roomridden invalid settled for the night these would gradually disappear Mistress Afferys magnified shadow always flitting about last until it fnlly glided away into the air as though she were off upon a withexcursoe lThenr the solitary light would burn unebangingly until it burned paebeor the dawn and at last died unider the breati of Mistress Afery as her shadow descended on it from the witchregion of sleep bhis is true poetry but there are a thousand such touches in the book as in all Mr Dickesas books which ever reader of cultivated pelceptions will perceive for himself In Little onrrit Mr Dickens has made another imperishable addition to the literature of his countryLittle Dorrit NEW NOVELS By Charles Dickens Bradbury and Evans Dark and Fair By the Author of  Rockingham 3 vols Hurst and Blackett Barchester Towers By Anthony

By Margaret Oliphant 3 vols Blackwood Tte Professor By Currer Bell 2 vols Smith and Elder The completion of a periodical by Charles Dickens has usually been regarded with sensations similar to those with which we witness the last glass poured from a bottle of good claret or contemplate the preparations for breaking up a pleasant family circle In the novel we have it is true one compensation which does not occur in the other cases Against the annoyance of parting with our friend we have to set the gratification of our curiosity revelling in the solution of some mystery which has tantalized it at intervals during the space of twenty months The familiar green cover no longer makes its appearance to be snatched at and eagerly read while the other serials and magazines lie neglected and uncut but on the other hand we know all about itwe are informed of the relationships legitimate or illegitimate of the dramatis personalwe have the satisfaction of feeling that the proper people are made happy and that the murderer is detected and exposed When we say that the above sentences which describe with sufficient fidelity the reception which Mr Dickenss novels have usually met with are in no respect applicable to the case of  Little Dorrit we believe we are only giving a voice to the dissatisfaction which the story even very soon after its commencement began to excite and which has been brought to a head hy its extremely lame and impotent conclusion In a preface which he vainly strives to divest of the air of an apology Mr Dickens assures us that he has more readers than ever We are far from doubting the assertion  we can only say that it proves very little if any thing at all The number of novelreaders increases so largely every year that a great many inferior writers could make a similar boast The material questions to ask are Does Mr Dickens keep his plat e in comparison with other novelists Are all his old subscribers faithful to him  Is his present public an addition to or in part a substitution for his former onol Unless these questions can be auswered in the affirmative we submit that the mere fact of an increased sale is no proof of real and enduring popularity  least of nil of such a popularity as a man of Mr Dickenss genius ought if he does himself justice to demand and receive at our hands Mr Dickens and his critics will respectively  speak as they find we can only say that in a tolerably large and very miscellaneous acquaintance we have found that the greater number of persons have either left off reading Little Dorrit after two or three numbers or if they have persevered to the end have in the end unanimously condemned it We will hs briefly as possible indicate the grounds on which we are for the most part inclined to agree with them That Mr Dickenss genius is wholly comic and that his proper line is to speak roundly rather that of the buffoon than of the tragedian a view frequently held and set forth with remarkable ability in a recent number of Blackwoodis a proposition we are disposed wholly to deny Those who would affirm it consider Pickwick his greatest work and every other of his tales inferior in proportion as it recedes from the Pickwickian standard According to such critics Mr Dickens was bound to  draw all the stableyards in London for comic ostlers and all the suburbs for humorous retired linendrapers and plethoric coachmen before presuming to strike out a new line and attempt to excite other emotions than those of laughter He was to be ant Democritus aut nullvs These persons do not reflect that such a law if applied to other artists who have done well would have deprived the world of all the novels of Scott and half the poetry of Byron and Goethe Eschylus might have been told to stick to his ships and not attempt to exhibit the Persians ns well as conquer them If a man can make us laugh the probability is that he can make us ciy  indeed it is not unlikely  Though wit may flash from fluent lips and mirth distract the breast that he cries himself much oftener than his friends imagine Not to pursuethistheme beyond reasonable limits we hold that Mr Dickens was not only perfectly right to attempt something of an extraPickwickian nature but that moreover he has succeeded in producing it He has not only excited laughter but teais and shuddering Far from having retrograded because he ceased to confine himself to exhibiting the salient points of exceptional characters the peculiarities of speech and gesture and the rich absurdities which so often pass before us and are forgotten he made decided and valuable steps as an artist and a describer of life in bringing before us the pathos of the Old Curiosity Shop the powerful and thrilling description which raises Martin Chvzzleunt above every similar chronicle of murder and in sounding the deep moral abyss of meditated crime which in Bleak House opens before the recoiling eyes of Lady Dedlock To have adequately grasped and embodied in fiction not the oddities which arc peculiar to each but the emotions which are common to all and while generalizing the latter sufficiently to excite wide sympathy to have individualized them so as to accord with the idiosyncrasy of the characters by whom they were respectively manifestedis not a retrogression but an advance and one which lifts the author who makes it out of the comparatively low rank of comic writers and sets him in the same category at however great an interval as Homer Scott and Shakspeare And to  expostulate  with him for wiping the paint from his face and scold him for aspiring to the high moral elevations on which he has so successfully tried his powers is as sensible as to expect a coquette not to exercise her powers of fascination or a soldier to box with his fists when he is armed with a revolver Coincidently however with the exhibition of the remarkable creations to which we have adverted Mr Dickens has developed two characteristics which go far to neutralize the admiration which such great merits are calculated to excite In the first place the comic veiu which flowed so abundantly in Pickwick has in later works run with a weaker and a drier stream Like the sherry in Leechs caricature it has be come a udder and a thinner wineby the addition of much water and some other very unpleasant ingredients His comic characters have become more and more exceptional and iu some cases the emotion they create is simply that of disgust They have every year less resemblance to human nature and the amusement if any which they excite is by degrees more dependent upon some quaintness of manner or speech which might serve once or twice but is reiterated ad nauseam whenever they make their appearance and less upon that display of the inward nature which properly constitutes humour Place oue of these hideous beiugs by the side of an earlier charaoter and the contrast will be like that of passing from a stall at the Haymarket when Buokstone is playing to the grating of a cell in Bedlam Imagine the family of the Smallweeds introduced to the genial society of Sam Weller or even of the Bath footman  They would have been kicked out instantly And as for Mr Weller senior he would havesat upon them These wretched creaturesand they are not the only instance in Mr Dickenss later writingsexemplify another fault which seems io be growing upon himthat of choosing to describe people who are not so properly comic as fantastic and as frequently remarkable for physical infirmity as for mental absurdity Where is the fun of laughing at a dwarf au idiot or a paralytic  or what purpose can be served by the exhibition iu the same novel of the hideous beast who slowly soddens himself with strong drink and the nauseous chemical components of whose person stream down through the floor to regale his fellowlodgers after his spontaneous combustion  Whether the promotion of good feeling between the different classes of societythe trump card of Mr Dickenss schoolbe likely to be attained by his writings is another very doubtful point If he has succeeded in showing the upper class that there is a great deal of good in the lower he has certainly shown the lower that there is a great deal of bad in the one above them All his allusions to the higher ranks of society are distinguished by a spirit not of satire but of illnatured sarcasm which seems to be roused quite as much by mere differences of habits and manners as by any deficiency in respect of moral qualities Formerly he laid his task on all alike and visited selfishness or cruelty with its due punishment in whatever quarter it might be fouud Now he exclusively appeals to the gallery and tells them that all the virtues are to be found only south of the Thames and west of Tottenham Court Road Extrema per illos Justina excedeus terris vertigii fecit and has left to their deserved fate the regions of Whitehall and Belgravia utterly incapable of managing the business of the country which should be exclusively intrusted to the hands of the virtuous shopkeeper and the intelligent mechanic And this brings us to the second fault which we have mentioned as observable in his later works In saying that it is absurd to require that a novelist should restrict himself to the delineation of one special part of humanity we do not therefore imply that he is to rush blindly into a number of other subjects which are not in themselves pectiliarly appropriate to fiction and which besides are not to be understood by the light of nature alone Now Mr Dickens being gifted with a keen observation ready sympathies an effective style and a good knowledge of certain limited sections of English life has on this slender stock of materials set up latterly as a Social Reformer There is in his works no evidence of any reading of the sort which is usually considered necessary for comprehending law politics or education and there is no method of instruction as at present practised on which he has not bestowed some very telling and malignant sneers Nor does he seem to have paid much attention to business or to take much part in any of these matters except as connected with charitable objects in the promotion of which his bitterest enemy could not deny him to be meritoriously distinguished In spite however of these very obvious deficiencies he has come forward for the instruction of the public and his views have found very general acceptance with the class of persons who take their politics from Punch and never open a serious book but are happy to raise their voices in any cry which their favourite novelist will suggest to them Mr Dickens is quite as destructive in his tendencies as Mr Carlyle but he is not quite so courageous The author of Latterday Pamphlets attacked the public offices when no one else thought of saying a word against them Mr Dickens prefers to kick an institution when it is down or at least when it is being taken down to be mended When some one else has scotched the snake he comes and sets his heel upon it but he is not the man to drag it out of its hole into the light of day Enough however on this subject were we to pursue it further we should only be going over the objections which have been already set forth in our opinion with perfect justice by the Saturday and Edinburgh Reviews and which Mr Dickenss sworn band of followers in the weekly press have been unable to controvert except either by the clumsy adulation which a man with Mr Dickenss sense of humour doubt less appreciates at its true value or by the same sort of swaggering impertinence by which they have tried to bully the public into posthumous admiration for their hero the late Mr Jerrold The chief objection which on our own part we have to make to Little Dorrit is that as a story it is insufferably dull and that it does not contain a single character whom we can love admire or respect The heroine herself who is evidently meant to be an embodiment of all that is charming and meritorious in woman has we regret to say failed to touch our feelings She seems merely a fresh version of Esther Summerson and from her perfections almost as remote from our sympathies as that very priggish character We tire of hearing Aristides called just and we would give the world for Little Dorrit to make a little mistake short of a faux pas or commit herself in some way so as to be brought down to the level of ordinary mortals So muoh moral sunshine is wearisome and as Colton said of religion we would die for it fight for it spend for itanything but live with it And as has been acutely remarked by one of our contemporaries  her size is against hershe is made almost quaint In this instance  the virtuous Marcia does not  tower above her sex aud the effect is detrimental to her Her sister is almost preferable notwithstanding her coquetry It would have been only charitable to have given this young lady an opportunity of becoming something better but Mr Dickens with his passion for stereotypes gives her in marriage to one who is little better than an idiot and over the rest of her life draws a veil which no one who knows what this kind of marriage generally comes to will like to lift Of the remaining characters Mr Dorrit himself is much the best His meanness in adversity and his contemptible insolence in prosperity are excellently described One of the best scenes in the b wk is the one where John Chivery brings his offering of cigars to the old man who had been only too glad of such gifts in his Marshalsea state of existence but with true snobbishness is now afraid of being compromised by communication with such a low fellow as  youug John To the whole account too of Mr Merdles career the highest praise may be given The accouut of his suicide and the state of the public mind upon the occasion is in Mr Dickenss most finished and telling style It is lucky that we have these characters aud scenes for it takes a good deal to compensate for the exhibition of such a grotesque absurdity as Pancks whose perpetual steaming is one of the nuisances of the book and of such a hideous impossibility as Mrs Clennam We are it is true limier a certain disadvantage in criticising what this lady says and does because we do not very clearly understand the narrative which is meant to explain her conduct nor have we met with any one who does Thucydides in his darkest moments was never more hopelessly obscure than Mr Dickens has contrived to be in the few pages where he professes to give the solution of the enigma on which we have been allowed to expend our ingenuity through so many previous numbers We have heard of the old gentlemau who taught his grandson draughts till his pupil beat him and we think that the author of the Dead Secret has set his master an example of neatness in the development of plot and of lucid explanation when there is no longer any necessity for concealment which the author of Little Dorrit would have done well to copy In the latter work we are distracted with a variety of threads which uever seem to converge and tantalized so long with the mystery suggested in the outset that we overstay our appetite for it and it is then presented in such a form that to make head or tail of it must require a far severer exercise of the analytical faculty than most novelreaders will care to undertake Like the champagne which Mr Albert Smith carried with him to the summit of Mont Blanc it foams out in one unintelligible spirt delivered in far too startling and hysterical a fashion for any thing like enjoyment Mr Dickens has never been eminent for the judicious management of his plots having probably preferred to depend for success on brilliant execution and picturesqueness of characterisation He seems to have written this story from month to month and either uever to have clearly conceived the development of it beforehand or if he formed a plan not to have cared to adhere to it This practice while it of course gives opportunities for working up any fire or railway accident that may occur in the interval is not particularly favourable to the unity and comprehensibility of a novel Whether Mr Dickens has gained any thing by impressing into his service the fall of the houses in Tottenham Court Road is a question which will easily be answered by any one who reads Little Dorrit a year or two hence when the dust of that frightful accident shall have finally cleared off For our own parts we do not see any moral lesson in killing off your villain in a fortuitous manner totally unconnected with any thing he has done or means to do Ii real life the wicked often go on  flourishing like a green baytree Poetical justice disposes of them in some way appropriate to their crimes and pursuits But to make use of a mere accident for this purpose is to miss both the truth of realism and the satisfaction of romance If Mr Dickens has not met with his wonted success in appealing to our feelings of pity and terror still less has he attained it by that exuberance of comic humours which has so often lightened the hearts and brightened the eyes of his readers What there is of comedy in Little Dorrit must we suppose be referred to the characters of Flora Mr Rs aunt and the redoubtable Mr Pancks The latter is simply a bore who comes on the stage makes his accustomed grimace and disappears The aunt is in a certain way ridiculous but after all affords only the same kind of amusement that is produced by the vagaries of a drunken man Flora is a weak reproduction of Mrs Nickleby without Mrs Nicklebys resemblance to nature Even the names of the characters are hardly so happy as usual What facetiousness is there in calling a woman  Mrs Generala name simply unmeaning and absurd with not even probability to recommend it There is something too ia the sound of  Clennam and  Meagles which is positively nasty The London Directory which has so often assisted Mr Dickens might surely have supplied him with something more appropriate than these In making the above remarks we are not unmindful of the fact that an author of established merit ought not even when he makes a slip to be visited with the castigation due to a mere pretender in literature But there are one or two points in Little Dorrit which go far to disentitle its author even to this allowance In the first place while some of the best and oldest blood in the country was being lavishly poured forth in the Crimea he waa unpatriotic enough to hold up the enemy with whom England was at war as the model of all that England ought to imitate In the next place in the full face of the Robson and Redpath frauds of peculation and adulteration in almost every department of trade and commerce and in strange inconsistency with his portraiture of Mr Merdle he describes the middle and lower classes exclusively as the embodiment of all that is highminded and straightforward in business Probably all associations are liable to the same faults of divided responsibility and official insolence If Mr Dickens has found that railway companies boards of directors and their underlings and other public bodies of a similar description are less obstructive and more courteous than the clerks at Whitehall we can only say that he has been much more fortunate than the rest of mankind In criticising his present work we have of course judged him by the standard he has created and the taste he has formed Little Dorrit which might make an inferior man famous is very very far below the merit of what its author has almost uniformly taught us to expect from him In his present story the author of Rockingham has produced a tale of less romantic interest than those by which he is already known  but he exhibits greater oommand over his materials,
Lords of the North By A C Laut v  VJ VIV ATUf Ul V   Heinemann In the first volume of  The Dollar Library  Mr E Hough gave an excellent romance of the westward migration in the United States which followed upon the struggles of the war of attempted secession in this later volume of the same series Mr Laut does something of a like nature for the Dominion of Canada The romance is built up about the rivalries of the Honourable Hudsons Bay Company and of Les Bourgeois de la Compagnie du NordOuest and if less successful than the work with which we have compared it it is nevertheless far better than the majority of presentday stories The story is supposed to be told by one Rufus Gillespie who took service under the NorthWest Company partly to indulge his desire for travel in the fascinating west and more urgently with the desire of tracing a friends wife and child who had been mysteriously kidnapped by a desperate Indian known as Le Grand Diable After many exciting adventures Rufus is instrumental in recovering the stolen whites and incidentally finds a wife for himself during his adventurings It is a capital story giving an excellent idea of the growth of our dominion in Canada during the earlier part of the nineteenth century it is full of life and action and what is more it is well and carefully written,juvenile
Love and Longitude By R Scot Skirving The subtitle is A Story of the Pacific in the Year 1900 The volume has pictures and an appendix at the end  for seafaring people only The appendix is scientific and the whole story has a strong smack of the scientific about it The ship in which the narrator sailed forth on the adventurous voyage was called the  Pandora  What is our destination    Well he replied  thats a secret Angus 68Love and Lonaitude By R Scot Skirvincr Sydney and Melbourne Angus  Robertson This is a cheery breezy amateurish sort of book The matter is lively enough and the story is as full of incident and movement as its treatment is of solecisms and crudities It deals with a schooners voyage to an uncharted guano island in the South Pacific and its author would appear to possess one qualification for his work which is but seldom found in the books of those who romance about the sea he writes as one who could sail and probably has sailed a schooner His plot is threadbare his characters are more puppets his principal situations are drawn from the stock properties of fiction  but his navigation is as sound as his seamanship These things are rare in fiction and in this case lend distinction to an otherwise colourless narrative Why is Alf modelled on Dickensian lines No Sydney larrikin was ever in the least like this tiresome character and the author who appears to know his Sydney from Woolloomooloo to Potts Point must know this,biography

MADAME DE MAINTENON Her Life and Times 1635 1719 By C C Dyson 12S 6d net Lane The writing of popular books on the fascinating women of history has long been a French fashion Fifty years ago and more while we waere still modest and early Victorian authors like Capefiguc and Lescure had created a whole library of works dealing with the lives of the favourites of kings Now such works it seems can scarcely come fast enough from English printing presses Madame de Maintenon is of course one of the ladies to be dealt with but while the interest of many of these beauties is wholly or mainly scandalous Louis XIV s wife has other and more venerable characteristics Her present biographer indeed is extremely anxious to explain that she was not scandalous at all She was far from the narrow coldhearted woman and  successful adventuress  of ultraProtestant historians She has been blamed for the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes but the most that can be laid to her charge is that she did not use her great influence to stop the atrocities which followed that abominable decree Much good is certainly to be accounted unto her A genuinely pious woman it was her ambition to wean Louis from that attitude towards her sex wvhich resulted in the illicit splendours of Louise de la Vallivre and Madame de Alontespan But her greatest work was the foundation of that college for the orphan daughters of nobles and officers of wvhich Boileau said   If any gentleman should venture to speak wvith detraction of Madamne de AMaintenon his name ought to be erased from the Roll of the Nobility so base would be his ingratitude after the great benefits her foundation has conferred on his class Mr Dyson has written an interesting account of the long life of the foundress of St Cvr as a needv child as wife to the brilliant crooked Scarron as gouvernante to Madame de Montespans children as the Kings wife and councillor His facts however which have been collected with great industry might have been a little better digested His proofs too might haive been read a little more carefully Bossuet is called Bssnet three times in two pages Tll origin of  God save the King as stated on the last palge is surely inaccurateMADAME DE MAINTENON by Maud Cruttwell Dent 15s net Miss Cruttwell already known for her carful and scholarly studies in French history and memoirs has produced a handsome exhaustive and extremely welldocumented account of the most outstanding figure in a brilliant Court Madame de Maintenon in her lifetime was an enigma to her contemporaries Pursued by envy and scandal traduced by her enmies and by her biographers she went on her way reserved dignified untroubled Devoted to God and to her King she who had endured poverty and ignominy in her youth scorned either wealth or advanement if they were to be purchased as the wages of personal sin or by stooping to disloyalty Yet an enigma she remains Very simple very straightforward Wqemely charitable a saint whose sole ambitions were to convert her King and alleviate the misery caused by his wars D her latest biographer sums her up Yet tis  Saint  accepted the position of pfo ante to the Kings bastards complait companion to his mistress and Tuirator of silence to safeguard that mistresss frailty and its results from a jealous and outraged husband Autres temp autres mocursl We should nowadays want other evidences of sainthood But it is indisputable that as Louis Egeria she induced him to show decency to his discarded mistress and humanity to his neglected wife and that when after the death of the Queen she consented to take the place of both she refused to do it without the sanction of marriage And so great was her loyalty that she accepted almost without complaint the secrecy and consequent slights of an equivocal position for thirty years and scrupulously destroyed every scrap of evidence which would have proved her right to the privileges of the Kings wife Though Miss Cruttwells book begins slowly and looks a little difficult of attack no one who perseveres beyond the first fifty pages will fail to follow to the end her absorbing story JANzT E Coutnwm,biography
Marie Tarnowska By A Vivanti Chartres Heinemann 6 net The tragedy that ended in the murder of Count Paul Kamarowsky in September 1907 seems more in keeping with the Court of the Borgias than with the Venice of our own day Though the idea of retelling the story came from Prof Rossi the chief medical expert for the defence who has made a lifestudy of the relations between criminal impulse and morbid physical condition in women this is no scientific treatise Mrs Chartres has heard the details from the lips of the Countess Tarnowska herself to whose notes written in prison before the trial she has also had access and  moved by the puissant influence of art she tells her tale with a power and a vividness that cannot fail to impress her readers A letter from the prisoner authorizing the publication of the narrative is included in the volume It is clear from her family history and from other detaite given here that the Countess Tarnowska can never have been a normal woman and the life into which she was plunged on her marriage when a mere girl to the man of her choice obviously reacted with fatal effect on the morbid strain in her But how far her physical condition may be considered to free her from moral responsibility is another question An Italian court which is always inclined to be indulgent towards her sex unhesitatingly gave its verdict against her Even in Mrs Chartress narrative it is difficult to sympathize with her in many of the crises of her existence Who for instance could well blame her husband for shooting her lover as he did in a country where duelling is still in fashion after the provocation he had received  Prilukov does not appear as a pleasant character yet he owed his ruin to the influence the Countess exercised on every man who came into her power For Count Kamarowsky the one good man who entered her life she seems at times to have felt a positive aversion according to her own account so different was he from the others to whom she was accustomed The picture of this unhappy woman pursuing her weary course from hotel to hotel with her boy and her faithful maid accompanied by the Count to whom she was now engaged yet shadowed all the time by the evil spirit of her former lover Prilukov is tragic in the extreme The motives which a woman of this sort may discover for a crime after the event are notoriously untrustworthy and it is impossible to put from ones mind the pecuniary advantages she was to gain by the murder But her statement that she believed the recovery of her boy from a serious illness to be due to her swearing to fulfil the oath she had taken upon his life to murder Kamarowsky though she had already induced Prilukov to release her from it is certainly worth attention,biography

MARY BARTON IT has seldom fallen to our lot to read a work written with more earnestness of purpose or more feeling than  Mary Barton a Tale of Manchester Life It excels in pathos and descriptive power There may not be the little touches of humour or the sly insights into nature of Charles Dickens there is not the childlike simplicity of Andersen but there is surpassing energy and vitality It is a painful book to read but it is also impossible to do so without being benefited by the perusal Mary Barton a Tab oat M chester Life In 2 vols Chapman and Hall Every scene is indeed a touch of nature almost sanctified by its wholesome truthfulness The meeting of the friends in  Green Heys Fields the earnest selfwilled John Barton the future Chartist an intellect struggling against poverty and want of proper information George Wilson a working man yet in his own way a philosopher and a philanthropist the two wives weeping and condoling for one poor sheep that has gone astray a pretty pert young maiden the heroine Mary and her lover hardworking steady and  gallant Jem Wilson gallant 1 the reader will exclaim can a workman be gallant  yes read that most stirring scene of a fire in a factory in which Jeni Wilson saves so many lives at the peril of his own and gllantry will not be denied to rude coarse men akin to that of any knights most glorious deeds A teaparty of the poor pleasantly sketched is followed by a scene full of pathos the sudden death of Mrs Barton One of the ties which bound John Barton to the gentle humanities of earth being thus loosened he became more obstinate in his aversion to the rich and his gloom and his sternness became habitual The authoress professes to have nothing to do with political economy or the theories of trade she says that she merely wishes to impress what the workman feels and thinks but she allows the discontented to murmur in prolonged strains without an attempt to chasten the heart or to correct the understanding Barton rails at all capitalists as being so only through the toil of the poor This would be staunch communism There surely must be capitalists or the condition of the poor would be worse than ever We are told in Scripture that the poor shall never cease out of the land but we are also told that their expectation shall not perish and that those who trust shall be fed and be delivered out of affliction Further than this we are told that the person of the poor should no more be respected than that of the rich should be honoured and while it is sinful to oppress and a duty to assist so also to the poor that will not hear rebuke their poverty is their destruction While the father gets more and more involved in Chartist plots Mary engages herself as an apprentice to a milliner in a little street leading off Ardwick Green and where she is seen and admired by Harry Carson son of the opulent millowner The interest of the rivalry of the workingengineer and the young gentleman is however for a time absorbed by passing scenes descriptive of the sore afflictions of the poor The cellar to which Barton and Wilson repair to carry comfort to a starving familythree or four little children rolling on the damp nay wet brick floor through which the stagnant filthy moisture of the street oozed up the fireplace empty and black the husband dying of typhus the wife crying in the dark loneliness of the dying man s lair is appalling in its horrors These poor people have strange superstitions too in the midst of their trying afflictions Wilson carried home the typhus to his own home and two children fell victinms to the infection One is already gone 1 Is there any chance for the other one think you  inquired Mary who had come upon a Samaritan errand of rather rare occurrence since she had now the affections of a young gentleman Alice shook her head and told with a look that she believed there was none She next endeavoured to lift the little body and carry it to its oldaccuistomed bed in its parents room But earnest as the father was in watching the yetliving he had eyes and ears for all that concerned the dead and sprang gently up mid took his deadamumbl baod a h in his arm with tender strength and credhm afsid of wakening him The other chiM Pe logr louder with more of effort Wemun get hDaway from his mother He cannot die whilst shes wish1 shim Wishing him  said Mary in a tone of inquiry Ay  domoy know what wishing  means  Theres none can die in the am of thoewbo are wishing them sort to tay on earth The soul o them s holds them wont let the dyling soul go free so it has a hard struggle for the quiet of death We mun get him away fra his mother or hell have a hard death poor lile fellowr So without circumlocution she went and offered to take the sinking child But the mother would not let him go and looking in Alices face with brimming and imploring eyes declared in earnest whispers that she was not wishing him that she would fain have him released from his suffering Alice and Mary stood by with eyes fixed on the poor child whose struggles seemed to increase till at last his mother said with a choking voice  May happen yOd better take him Alice I believe my hearts wishing hiim a this while for I cannot no I cannot bring mysel to let my two childer go in one day I cannot help longing to keep him and yet he shanot suffer longer for me She bent down and fondly oh with what passionate fondness kissed her child and then gave him up to Alice who took him with tender care Natures stnrggles were soon exhausted and he breathed his little life away in peace Mary in the pride of her new conquest discards the young engineer and refuse his offer of marriage only to repent a moment after and that so bitterly that she follows up one refusal by another and loses both lovers at the same time She is the more confirmed in her resolve in respect to Henry Carson as he intimated that his intentions had not at first been of an honourable character The pith of the story hangs upon the events which follow upon the dismissal of the two lovers The fallen Esther warns Jem Wilson that a fate similar to hers awaits Mary and in an attempt to prevent this the workman assaults his young master Not long after this John Barton worked up to madness by his false notions of the relation of master and workman shoots Henry Carson with Jem Wilsons gun The young engineer is tried and only saved by an alibi The manner in which Mary Barton declares her preference for the prisoner then at the bar is a most effective scene The old man acknowledges his guilt to the father of young Carson who at first full of revenge is at the conclusion made to feel that those who are strong in Gods gifts are meant to help the weak and that a perfect understanding and complete confidence aud love may exist between masters and men the interests of the one being the interests of all,biography

Memoirs of a Highland Lady LITERATURE Edited by Lady Strachey Murray We were once shown a picture by Raeburn of an elderly Scotchman an elderly Scotch gentlewoman and a beautiful Scotch girl They were said the owner an uncle who had fought under Clive his maiden sister and their nieceall Johnstones of Alva if memory serves aright That group has been recalled by this most charming book which like the picture suggests a Scotch Jane Austen much more JaneAustenish than Susan Ferrier Its author Elizabeth Grant was born in Edinburgh May 7th 1797 had an unhappy first love in 1815 was married in 1829 in Bombay Cathedral to Col afterwards General Henry Smith of Baltiboys lived thereafter in Ireland and died November 16th 1885 She was the eldest of the five childrentwo sons and three daughtersof Sir John Peter Grant of Eothiemurchus 1774  1848 by his English wife Jane Ironside whose father was a long  descended clergyman at Houghtonle Spring Sir John Peter the only son of a doctor had succeeded in 1790 to the Rothiemurchus property by the death of his uncle He was an Edinburgh advocate and London barrister sat as Whig member for Grimsby and Tavistock and in 1827 having frittered away his 2000 a year and gone bankrupt was appointed a judge in Bombay and knighted later he was Chief Justice at Calcutta These memoirs written by Mrs Smith for her children during 184567 come down only to 1830 and record her life in London at Thorley Hall Hertfordshire at the Doune in Rothiemurchus on Speyside at University College Oxford of which Dr James Griffith one of her numberless cousins was Master in London again in Edinburgh and in India They have already been privately printed and now are generously given to the world with a brieftoo briefintroduction by a niece Lady Strachey No book of the kind has proved more delightful  If ever I write a novel Mrs Smith says once and about 1826 she and a sister Mary did between them produce  a bundle of rubbish for some forgotten Inspector and received 40 in return That rubbish might repay recovery but a novel by her yes we could wish she had written a novel As it is these five hundred pages would set up a dozen presentday novelists and might have furnished themes to the great poets of the past Here is one that is truly Wordsworthian The young people were not of Rothiemurchus They lived up in Glen Feshie a great way from our march and they had not long been married He was either a small farmer or the son of one or merely shepherd to a more wealthy man I am not sure which but his business was to mind a large Hock that pastured on the mountainsAt the beginning of a heavy snowstorm our young husband departed on his round of duty The wife was preparing for her first baby  she was also busy with her wheel the first work of a newlymarried notable Highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband She baked the bread she trimmed her fire and she busked her house then took her wheel and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winters night Ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door which poor young thing she was never to hear again for he never returned from those wild mountains They sought him for days  no trace of him could be discovered When the snow melted and the summer flowers burst into bloom party after party set out in quest of his remains all unsuccessfully It was not till late in autumn when our gamekeeper was on the BraeRiach shooting grouse that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure It was all that was left of the missing shepherd and his collie lay dead beside him Deceived by the snow he had wandered miles away from his own ground and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot His widow was past all knowledge of his fate  her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth fever ensued and though she recovered her strength her mind was gone She lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband went cheerfully about her usual work preparing things for him going through the same routine as on the day she lost him  baking sweeping putting on fresh peats and ending with her wheel by the side of the clean hearth in the evening She would show her balls of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard Sometimes in the evening they said she would look wearily round and sigh heavily and wander a little in her talk but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever She was never in want for every one helped her but though she was so much pitied she was in their sober way much blamed The Highlanders are fatalists what is to be must be  what happens must be borne patiently We must  dree our weird all of us This needs no praise of ours for it could not have been told more beautifully And it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the Highlanders There was no deep religious feeling among them in those preDisruption days fairy legends old clan tales forebodings and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the Bible The minister of Duthil possessed only two English sermons though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety His brother of Alvie known as Parson John used often for lack of matter to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers Once learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours he next Sunday after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text raised his hands and ejaculated  My brethren it was a lees I told you last Sabbath day The fusion of classes from duke to peasant was singular yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited These were Grants and of Grants Grants Grants nearly seventy figure in the excellent index not all of them quite entitled to the surname Thus there was Annie Grant the accidental daughter of Mrs Smiths great  great  uncle a bare  footed herdlassie once she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to Sir John Peters family and marrying an Indian general became a welcome guest at Newstead and Kensington Palace The consumption of whisky was vast At the Doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the sidetable and another was the allowance in the pantry in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared  for the first time in the drawingroom to teaand sober The very poorest cottages could offer whisky and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day One day a woman  with a child in her arms and another bit thing at her knee came up to the house  the horn cup was duly handed to her she took a  gey guid drap herself and then gave a little to each of tne babies  My goodness child said my mother to the wee thing that was trotting by the mothers side 4doesnt it bite you  Ay but I like the bite replied the creature The book is not purely Highland Scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of wellknown even great people Shelley was at University when in 1810 Elizabeth Grant went to stay there with her cousin She describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate and as making when reprimanded extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor At the Hampstead villa of an uncle William Frere she sometimes in 1823 met that poor mad poet Coleridge who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist Edward Irving too came there he struck her as very dirty and Joanna Baillie  a nice old lady Scott she was never in company with and the idea of the Highlands given by  Waverley seemed to Her utterly at variance with truth None the less this passage under 18178 ii interesting  Walter Scott went out very little and when he did go he was not agreeable generally sitting very silent looking dull and listless unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance In his own house he was another character especially if he liked his guests It was odd but Sir Walter never had the reputation in Edinburgh he had elsewherewas not the lion I mean His wonderful works were looked for read with avidity praised on all hands yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad The fat vulgar Mrs Jobson whose low husband had made his large fortune at Dundee by pickling herrings on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to Sir Walters son said the young people were attached otherwise her Jane might have looked higher it was  only a baronetcy and quite a late creation  Then there are stories of Lady Eldon and her sisterinlaw Lady Stowellone thrifty one something more For the first when her husband was earning thousands a year would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars she herself standing at the window of her lords fine mansion and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement whilst the second grudged her husband his clean daily shirt and used herself to take a nights wear out of the cast one for a bedgown The future Lady Byron Burnss BonnieLeslie one of the cleverest women of her age Mrs Thrale Catalani Mrs Siddons Sir Augustus dEete the original we believe of Harry Richmonds father Basil Hall John Clerk of Eldin Jeffrey Canning the Abbe Sieves and many more emerge and disappear In connexion with Prince Augustus anice point of etiquette comes up  that with royalty to dinner one must not have fingerglasses for nobody ever washes before royalty Still after all we like the Highland folk best There was old Lovat who when on a visit to Cluny in 1809 took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen  44 And so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage and filled it with eggs and a large stone and there he sat hatching never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl and having his supplies of food brought to him They had at last to get Lady Clunys henwife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their Elace when Lovat satisfied he had accomplished ia task went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them There was Elizabeths greatgreatgrandfather Patrick Grant surnamed Macalpine 16651743 who never slept at night without praying for two men Rob Roy and the Duke of Gordon Rob Roy having helped him at a pinch to best the Mackintosh Macalpine whose soft white womanish hands could draw blood from any other mans fingernails himself always went about with twentyfour gaily dressed followers  he was judge and jury in one and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences He married twicefirst the highborn Mary Grant and then in old age a lowborn Rachel Grant who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the  Spreckled Laird her stepson  Once after the service in the kirk was over poor Lady Rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husbands grave crying out through her tears  Macalpine Macalpine  rise up for ae halfhour and see me richted   She had borne him four sons the third of whom Elizabeth saw often for he lived until 1813 or a hundred and fortyeight years from the birth of his father This was dapper little Capt Lewis Grant who was also twice married and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word though they occupied the same rooms and every night played backgammon together And there was in 1814 a very old Mrs Macintosh of Borlam  Mackintosh of Borium a daughterinlaw of the brigadier who lived at Kin gussie with her daughter the widow of a Major Macpherson and a comely widow too   The Leddy Borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age upright active slender richly dressed for her station and with a pleasant countenance Her handsome silks caused many a sly remark She was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom Sir Thomas Dick Lauder endeavoured to portray as  Lochandhu There were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country A cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at Belleville for he did not deal in black cattle only  no traveller was safe when Borlam wanted His wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime  seemingly a true suspicion for the Lady Borlams silks would stand alone and she had plenty of them With them she wore the Highland mutch the high clear cap of fine muslin trimmed in her case with Flanders lace and calm as a princess she moved about in her illgotten gear She was a wonderful old woman keen merry kindly and as cute as an Irishwoman never tripping in her talk or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband We had marked for quotation a score of other things as the Dutchlike interior of the inn at Seaham the floating of the timber to the Spey the floaters ball the eagles  ospreys that built upon LochanEilein the bediamonded aldermanesses at Margate with their tumblers of brandyandwater the middleaged beauty who wriggled about like an eel at the mention of any of her numerous fancied admirers and the horrible upbringing of the Grant children icy baths through the winter the fathers whip on occasion the dark closet and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten But we must leave a few lines for faultfindinga very few will suffice The typethat of the private issueis cramped and repellent a future edition should be in two volumes with a portrait if possible of Mrs Smith and with views of the Doune Thorley Hall Belugas c Though not without interest the thirty pages on the tour in Holland might perhaps be omitted and the sixty on India  but there should certainly be a few footnotes explanatory and sometimes corrective The Northern Meeting was started in 1788 not soon after 1797 the Eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend whom to see is madness and to meet inexorable death the account of the Sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong alike by their own legend and by known facts certain books like the Autobiography of Mrs Fletcher might here and there be cited with advantage a small hexameter on p 125 must be a misprint and  expletives is oddly misused on p 230 But what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 Memoirs We admire them greatly but cannot feel certain we should have loved their authorMemoirs of a Highland Lady the Autobiography of Elizabeth Grant of Kathie murehua 1797  1830 A HIGHLAND LADY Edited by Lady otracney Jolin Murray The Grants of Kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of Grant which by judicious obedience to the powers that were succeededin keeping their lands in the North at tunes when more hotheaded dans were disinherited Rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods and the stock which dwelt there has always been a vigorous one giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history This book is the autobiography of a lady of the house written many years latera sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of Highland gentlefolk in England and at home in the faroff days of the early century The extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity One might compare it with the gossip of Dorothy Osborne or the memoirs of another Highland lady of the same clan Mrs Grant of Laggan who told the story of the Princes arrival at Gortuleg after Culloden but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity Miss Grant of Rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the readers eye She confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess and she is quite open with her dislikes In its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family tells it too with no omission of darker scenes till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin We hear of the early days in Lincolns Inn Fields and of the holidays at wateringplaces then of the long years in the Highlands varied with seasons in Edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south and then at the last of the money troubles consequent upon an injudicious union of Highland hospitality with political ambition of the Indian judgeship for the father and of the marriage of the diarist when Eliza Grant takes final leave of us It is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter The style is without art but direct vivid and at times fired with a genuine emotion Parts might have been left put without hurting the book but as it was originally published for the family there is reason for its completeness But even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory By far the best are the Rothiemurchus chapters but the early days in England were not without interest The children were brought up on a Spartan planup at six cold water summer and winter and a breakfast of porridge But they were a set of little madcaps even in those primdays and were none the worse for the training The long journeys between the Highlands and London gave food for childs fancy What impressed the small Elizabeth in Edinburgh was the  size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny Nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere She meets Lord Lovat is much impressed and little wonder for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage In 1810 she went with her sister to Orford to stay with the Master of University and a dreary place she found it  Two facts struck me young as I was during our residence in Oxford she writes  the ultra  Tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society She carried on a childs flirtation with a young gentleman who played the French horn and she was much shocked by young Mr Shelley  The ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was Mr Shelley afterwards so celebrated though I should think to the end halfcrazy He was very insubordinate at University always infringing some rule the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked He was slovenly in his dress and when spoken to about these and other irregularities he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures expressive of his humility under reproof as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor Soon after the whole family retired to the Highlands for good and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at Kothiemurchus where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs On the way to the North the father read Childe Harold then newly out to the children   I was not given to poetry generally says the chronicler then as now it required  thoughts that rouse aud words that burn to affect me with aught but weariness but when after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment saying  Thia is poetry I felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure  The whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done and so too the account of the simple household and its retainers among them  old John Mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires pumped the water turned the mangle lighted the oven brewed the beer bottled the whiskey kept the yard tidy and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp like Daavid  The Grants were a remarkable clan for the cotters and foresters sons had a ueer habit of suddenly leaving home and generally getting somehow or other to India whence they returned Generals and Baronets and men of fortune Nothing indeed in the whole book is so extra ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these Highland adventurers who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize Distinctions between classes too were not rigid in the North Miss Grant has a deep scorn of the English lower and middle classes but in Scotland all are gentlefolka belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest Grant to his chief  And certainly we find barefooted Highland girls making great marriages and every social barrier turned topsyturvy There are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages for Miss Grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words Take this of the Highland kirk The girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees I do not know if it improved or hurt the hair but it agreeably scented the kirk which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peatreek for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the English sermon they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste The old women snuffed too and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit lapses from faith was their grand selfaccusation lapses from virtue were alas little commented on temperance and chastity were not in the Highland code of morality Both in the Highlands and in Edinburgh where the family went in the season there was no lack of great folk to be seen Across the river at Kinrara the famous Duchess of Gordonthe friend of Burnsentertained large house parties The writers comments on people are forcible and plainspoken She objected to Lord Tweeddale because he had that flat Maitland face which when it once gets into a family never can be got out of it The account of the old Edinburgh society is entertaining She classifies it into setsthe exclusive the cardplaying the quiet countrygentleman the fashionable and the literary She met all varietiesthe Jeffreys Sir David Brewster  the crazy Lord Buchan who collected such relics as a tooth of Queen Marys and a bone of James the Fifth Harry Erskine John Clerk of Eldin about whom she has many stories to tell and Sir Walter himself There is also a welldrawn portrait of Canning whom she met in Holland She is most fearless in confessing her opinions She confesses that she found Waverley intolerably dull Peter the Great she thought only a  lunatic barbarian   Coleridge whom she met at Highgate is a poor mad poet who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist The chief thing that impressed her about Edward Irving was that he was  very dirty She is severe on the two Sobieski Stuarts and is highly scornful about their pedigree but one might say something on the other side Her sister Jane goes to Abbotsford on a visit Jane was in an ecstasy the whole time Sir Walter Scott took to her as who would not P They rode together on two rough ponies with the Ettrick Shepherd and all the dogs and Sir Walter gave her all the Border legends and she corrected his mistakes about the Highlands We h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of Miss Grants stories The book is not all comedy for the account of the final parting from Rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader But the prevailing tone is a cheerful one and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales  A coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the Dukes Arms at Dunkeld to Blair during the summer season The announcement read as follows Pleasing intelligence The Duchess of Athol starts every morning from the  Dukes Arms at eight oclock The other is told of Lord Eldin  Some one having died a man of birth and fortune in the West Country celebrated in his life for drawing pretty freely with the longbow it was remarked that the heir had buried him with much pomp and had ordered for his remains a handsome monument  wi an epitaph said John Clerk in his broadest Border dialect  he must hae an epitaph an appropriate epitaph an well change the exordium out o respect Instead o the usual Here lies well begin his epitaph wi Here continues to lie,biography

one from a footboy had risen to be general whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited These were Grants and of Grants Grants Grants nearly seventy figure in the excellent index not all of them quite entitled to the surname Thus there was Annie Grant the accidental daughter of Mrs Smiths great  great  uncle a bare  footed herdlassie once she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to Sir John Peters family and marrying an Indian general became a welcome guest at Newstead and Kensington Palace The consumption of whisky was vast At the Doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the sidetable and another was the allowance in the pantry in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared  for the first time in the drawingroom to teaand sober The very poorest cottages could offer whisky and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day One day a woman  with a child in her arms and another bit thing at her knee came up to the house  the horn cup was duly handed to her she took a  gey guid drap herself and then gave a little to each of tne babies  My goodness child said my mother to the wee thing that was trotting by the mothers side 4doesnt it bite you  Ay but I like the bite replied the creature The book is not purely Highland Scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of wellknown even great people Shelley was at University when in 1810 Elizabeth Grant went to stay there with her cousin She describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate and as making when reprimanded extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor At the Hampstead villa of an uncle William Frere she sometimes in 1823 met that poor mad poet Coleridge who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist Edward Irving too came there he struck her as very dirty and Joanna Baillie  a nice old lady Scott she was never in company with and the idea of the Highlands given by  Waverley seemed to Her utterly at variance with truth None the less this passage under 18178 ii interesting  Walter Scott went out very little and when he did go he was not agreeable generally sitting very silent looking dull and listless unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance In his own house he was another character especially if he liked his guests It was odd but Sir Walter never had the reputation in Edinburgh he had elsewherewas not the lion I mean His wonderful works were looked for read with avidity praised on all hands yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad The fat vulgar Mrs Jobson whose low husband had made his large fortune at Dundee by pickling herrings on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to Sir Walters son said the young people were attached otherwise her Jane might have looked higher it was  only a baronetcy and quite a late creation  Then there are stories of Lady Eldon and her sisterinlaw Lady Stowellone thrifty one something more For the first when her husband was earning thousands a year would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars she herself standing at the window of her lords fine mansion and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement whilst the second grudged her husband his clean daily shirt and used herself to take a nights wear out of the cast one for a bedgown The future Lady Byron Burnss BonnieLeslie one of the cleverest women of her age Mrs Thrale Catalani Mrs Siddons Sir Augustus dEete the original we believe of Harry Richmonds father Basil Hall John Clerk of Eldin Jeffrey Canning the Abbe Sieves and many more emerge and disappear In connexion with Prince Augustus anice point of etiquette comes up  that with royalty to dinner one must not have fingerglasses for nobody ever washes before royalty Still after all we like the Highland folk best There was old Lovat who when on a visit to Cluny in 1809 took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen  44 And so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage and filled it with eggs and a large stone and there he sat hatching never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl and having his supplies of food brought to him They had at last to get Lady Clunys henwife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their Elace when Lovat satisfied he had accomplished ia task went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them There was Elizabeths greatgreatgrandfather Patrick Grant surnamed Macalpine 16651743 who never slept at night without praying for two men Rob Roy and the Duke of Gordon Rob Roy having helped him at a pinch to best the Mackintosh Macalpine whose soft white womanish hands could draw blood from any other mans fingernails himself always went about with twentyfour gaily dressed followers  he was judge and jury in one and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences He married twicefirst the highborn Mary Grant and then in old age a lowborn Rachel Grant who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the  Spreckled Laird her stepson  Once after the service in the kirk was over poor Lady Rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husbands grave crying out through her tears  Macalpine Macalpine  rise up for ae halfhour and see me richted   She had borne him four sons the third of whom Elizabeth saw often for he lived until 1813 or a hundred and fortyeight years from the birth of his father This was dapper little Capt Lewis Grant who was also twice married and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word though they occupied the same rooms and every night played backgammon together And there was in 1814 a very old Mrs Macintosh of Borlam  Mackintosh of Borium a daughterinlaw of the brigadier who lived at Kin gussie with her daughter the widow of a Major Macpherson and a comely widow too   The Leddy Borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age upright active slender richly dressed for her station and with a pleasant countenance Her handsome silks caused many a sly remark She was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom Sir Thomas Dick Lauder endeavoured to portray as  Lochandhu There were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country A cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at Belleville for he did not deal in black cattle only  no traveller was safe when Borlam wanted His wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime  seemingly a true suspicion for the Lady Borlams silks would stand alone and she had plenty of them With them she wore the Highland mutch the high clear cap of fine muslin trimmed in her case with Flanders lace and calm as a princess she moved about in her illgotten gear She was a wonderful old woman keen merry kindly and as cute as an Irishwoman never tripping in her talk or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband We had marked for quotation a score of other things as the Dutchlike interior of the inn at Seaham the floating of the timber to the Spey the floaters ball the eagles  ospreys that built upon LochanEilein the bediamonded aldermanesses at Margate with their tumblers of brandyandwater the middleaged beauty who wriggled about like an eel at the mention of any of her numerous fancied admirers and the horrible upbringing of the Grant children icy baths through the winter the fathers whip on occasion the dark closet and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten But we must leave a few lines for faultfindinga very few will suffice The typethat of the private issueis cramped and repellent a future edition should be in two volumes with a portrait if possible of Mrs Smith and with views of the Doune Thorley Hall Belugas c Though not without interest the thirty pages on the tour in Holland might perhaps be omitted and the sixty on India  but there should certainly be a few footnotes explanatory and sometimes corrective The Northern Meeting was started in 1788 not soon after 1797 the Eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend whom to see is madness and to meet inexorable death the account of the Sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong alike by their own legend and by known facts certain books like the Autobiography of Mrs Fletcher might here and there be cited with advantage a small hexameter on p 125 must be a misprint and  expletives is oddly misused on p 230 But what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 Memoirs We admire them greatly but cannot feel certain we should have loved their authorMemoirs of a Highland Lady the Autobiography of Elizabeth Grant of Kathie murehua 1797  1830 A HIGHLAND LADY Edited by Lady otracney Jolin Murray The Grants of Kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of Grant which by judicious obedience to the powers that were succeededin keeping their lands in the North at tunes when more hotheaded dans were disinherited Rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods and the stock which dwelt there has always been a vigorous one giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history This book is the autobiography of a lady of the house written many years latera sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of Highland gentlefolk in England and at home in the faroff days of the early century The extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity One might compare it with the gossip of Dorothy Osborne or the memoirs of another Highland lady of the same clan Mrs Grant of Laggan who told the story of the Princes arrival at Gortuleg after Culloden but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity Miss Grant of Rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the readers eye She confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess and she is quite open with her dislikes In its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family tells it too with no omission of darker scenes till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin We hear of the early days in Lincolns Inn Fields and of the holidays at wateringplaces then of the long years in the Highlands varied with seasons in Edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south and then at the last of the money troubles consequent upon an injudicious union of Highland hospitality with political ambition of the Indian judgeship for the father and of the marriage of the diarist when Eliza Grant takes final leave of us It is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter The style is without art but direct vivid and at times fired with a genuine emotion Parts might have been left put without hurting the book but as it was originally published for the family there is reason for its completeness But even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory By far the best are the Rothiemurchus chapters but the early days in England were not without interest The children were brought up on a Spartan planup at six cold water summer and winter and a breakfast of porridge But they were a set of little madcaps even in those primdays and were none the worse for the training The long journeys between the Highlands and London gave food for childs fancy What impressed the small Elizabeth in Edinburgh was the  size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny Nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere She meets Lord Lovat is much impressed and little wonder for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage In 1810 she went with her sister to Orford to stay with the Master of University and a dreary place she found it  Two facts struck me young as I was during our residence in Oxford she writes  the ultra  Tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society She carried on a childs flirtation with a young gentleman who played the French horn and she was much shocked by young Mr Shelley  The ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was Mr Shelley afterwards so celebrated though I should think to the end halfcrazy He was very insubordinate at University always infringing some rule the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked He was slovenly in his dress and when spoken to about these and other irregularities he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures expressive of his humility under reproof as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor Soon after the whole family retired to the Highlands for good and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at Kothiemurchus where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs On the way to the North the father read Childe Harold then newly out to the children   I was not given to poetry generally says the chronicler then as now it required  thoughts that rouse aud words that burn to affect me with aught but weariness but when after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment saying  Thia is poetry I felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure  The whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done and so too the account of the simple household and its retainers among them  old John Mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires pumped the water turned the mangle lighted the oven brewed the beer bottled the whiskey kept the yard tidy and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp like Daavid  The Grants were a remarkable clan for the cotters and foresters sons had a ueer habit of suddenly leaving home and generally getting somehow or other to India whence they returned Generals and Baronets and men of fortune Nothing indeed in the whole book is so extra ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these Highland adventurers who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize Distinctions between classes too were not rigid in the North Miss Grant has a deep scorn of the English lower and middle classes but in Scotland all are gentlefolka belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest Grant to his chief  And certainly we find barefooted Highland girls making great marriages and every social barrier turned topsyturvy There are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages for Miss Grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words Take this of the Highland kirk The girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees I do not know if it improved or hurt the hair but it agreeably scented the kirk which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peatreek for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the English sermon they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste The old women snuffed too and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit lapses from faith was their grand selfaccusation lapses from virtue were alas little commented on temperance and chastity were not in the Highland code of morality Both in the Highlands and in Edinburgh where the family went in the season there was no lack of great folk to be seen Across the river at Kinrara the famous Duchess of Gordonthe friend of Burnsentertained large house parties The writers comments on people are forcible and plainspoken She objected to Lord Tweeddale because he had that flat Maitland face which when it once gets into a family never can be got out of it The account of the old Edinburgh society is entertaining She classifies it into setsthe exclusive the cardplaying the quiet countrygentleman the fashionable and the literary She met all varietiesthe Jeffreys Sir David Brewster  the crazy Lord Buchan who collected such relics as a tooth of Queen Marys and a bone of James the Fifth Harry Erskine John Clerk of Eldin about whom she has many stories to tell and Sir Walter himself There is also a welldrawn portrait of Canning whom she met in Holland She is most fearless in confessing her opinions She confesses that she found Waverley intolerably dull Peter the Great she thought only a  lunatic barbarian   Coleridge whom she met at Highgate is a poor mad poet who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist The chief thing that impressed her about Edward Irving was that he was  very dirty She is severe on the two Sobieski Stuarts and is highly scornful about their pedigree but one might say something on the other side Her sister Jane goes to Abbotsford on a visit Jane was in an ecstasy the whole time Sir Walter Scott took to her as who would not P They rode together on two rough ponies with the Ettrick Shepherd and all the dogs and Sir Walter gave her all the Border legends and she corrected his mistakes about the Highlands We h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of Miss Grants stories The book is not all comedy for the account of the final parting from Rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader But the prevailing tone is a cheerful one and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales  A coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the Dukes Arms at Dunkeld to Blair during the summer season The announcement read as follows Pleasing intelligence The Duchess of Athol starts every morning from the  Dukes Arms at eight oclock The other is told of Lord Eldin  Some one having died a man of birth and fortune in the West Country celebrated in his life for drawing pretty freely with the longbow it was remarked that the heir had buried him with much pomp and had ordered for his remains a handsome monument  wi an epitaph said John Clerk in his broadest Border dialect  he must hae an epitaph an appropriate epitaph an well change the exordium out o respect Instead o the usual Here lies well begin his epitaph wi Here continues to lie,biography
Memoirs of the Comtesse de Boigne 1781181M INTERESTING MEMOIRS Edited from the original Manuscript by M Charles Nicoullaud Heinemann 10s net These memoirs are exactly what memoirs should beto be of value and interest No attempt is made to write history there is nothing pretentious about them nothing dull A great misfortune fell upon a brilliant lady whose salon in her day bad a European reputation the brilliant lady had lived through times of extraordinary interest the past years of her youth became more living to her than sorrow allowed the present to be So she began to write down her memories of this past youth that her nephews might read the account of her life and perhaps learn something of life itself from her experience  If I had been obliged to undertake any researches elsewhere than in my memory I should have given up my project for I desired a distraction and not a laborious work Hence if my nephews should ever glance at these writings they must not expect to find a book but merely the chatter of an old woman  I regard the result of no more importance than a piece of fancy work I have successively used my pen to rest my needle and my needle to rest my pen and my heirs will receive my manuscript as they might receive an old armchair So writes the Comtesse de Boigne There is an element of sadness in the memories of a dead ladys life especially when she belonged to a time which is recent enough to be remembered and of which the very nearness yet seems to make it more remote There is pathos too in the history of the manuscript as there was pathos in its production Death plays too prominent a part When the Comtesse de Boigne was fiftyfour years old she lost by a terrible accident a child of fourteen whom she had been bringing up for twelve years and whom she loved as a mother After this catastrophe the saddest hours of my sad days were those which I had been wont to spend in developing a keen and youthful mind  I attempted to cheat my grief with this task undertaken during the painful moments which had once been pleasantly employed  The following pages are the result of these efforts and their object was to drive away the thoughts which I could hardly bear Begun in this manner as so many memoirs are begun to turn the mind from brooding on calamity the work laid its kind hold upon her and she was able to keep herself fresh and alive to old age by living again through the happy stirring days of her youth And the work developed and she carried it on to the time in which she was living as she wrote she was able to watch and live in the present with the strange peace of aloofness that memory is able to lend to the past she lived as it were through the medium of her work She lost the personal anguish of things without losing her interest in life In this way as the brave among men and women are wont to do she turned necessity to gain There is sadness too in the history of the manuscript itself The Comtesse de Boigne nee Charlotte Louise Eleonore Adelaide dOsmond loved her name as well she might And she was childless From the company of her nephews and nieces she chose her grandnephew Osmond who became the Marquis dOsmond to be her heir He was ten years old in 1866 when she died He came into the possessions which she left him in August 1881 in accordance with the terms of the will on his twentyfifth birthday With his intimate friend M Charles Nicollaud the present editor he found the manuscript volumes there were cogent reasons for delay in giving them to the world For twentyfive years they remained in the possession of M Nicollaud to whom the Marquis dOsmond entrusted them During that time death was busy among the family and the Marquis dOsmond himself at length died  The family name is extinct The estate of Osmond has been sold piecemeal The castle has passed into other hands and the archives are dispersed But into the memoirs themselves no trace of this sadness has penetrated What is most apparent is the keenness of intellect and insight of the grand dame who writes them Always it is the grande dame the royalist who recognises her prejudices and who cannot help feeling pride in them She makes no attempt to be impartial she records what she saw and she gives her own opinion of men and of matters Whether she is picturing the strange society of the emigres in London or the last days of the Court at Versailles or the bivouac of Cossacks in the Champs Elysees at the Restoration whether she is describing the eccentricities of Sir John Legard with whom her family stayed in Yorkshire or summing up the character of such notables as Chateaubriand or Talleyrand or Madame de Stael or the Emperor Alexander her point of view is always marked by a kind of strong shrewdness which can pierce below the surface and by a distinction which is at ease with greatness without ever becoming familiar The attitude is exactly expressed in the description of the salons in the Tuileries where the ladies of the Empire met the ladies of the old Court after the return of Monsieur There is a certain ease a certain freedom in the manner of women of good society which gives them the appearance of being at home everywhere and of doing the honours wherever they may be Women of the other class are often shocked at this consequently the pettinesses and the little jealousies of the bourgeoises were stirred beneath the jewels which adorned their breasts The memoirs of a woman of this kind who lived through all the upheavals of the Revolution the Empire and the Restoration must be of supreme interest and value The translation is good And the notes which the editor M Nicollaud has appended are always to the point and expressed with admirable clearness The present volume contains the first instalment only of the memoirs The second volume bringing the narrative to the Revolution of 1830 is in preparation and a third will continue the story down to the fall of Louis Philippe,biography

MmDLEMARCH  jfiddlemarch a Study of Provincial Life By George Eiiot In Four Volumev Blackwood 1 Many Theresas have been born who found for them i selves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of farresonant action perhaps only a life of mistakes the 1 offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur illmatched with t he meanness of opportunity perhaps a tragic failure f vhich found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion 1 With dim lights and tangled circumstances they tried to i shape their thought and deed in noble agreement but after all to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness for these laterborn T1cresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which would perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul Their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and a common yearning of womanhood so that the one was disapproved as extravagance and the other k oudemned as a lapse We need to recall those sentences in the prelude  to  Middlemarch  in order to reconcile ourselves to its finale in which our last glimpse of George Eliots modern Theresa is as a comfortable matron very properly devoted to her second husband and only known in a certain circle as a wife and a mother Any other novelist would have ended the novel differently and with a good deal more stageeffect but George Eliots finding is the true one and if we part from Dorothea with somI regret that her first great failure as the wife of Mr iasaubon should have no better compensation than the very prosaic success of a marriage with Will Ladislaw it is doubtless only just such a regret as the author wishes to arouse in us as part of the regret with which every wise student of life must regard the accumulation of blunders and failures that too often befal the worthiest natures while those of coarser mould contrive to obtain all the happiness they are able to enjoy The most carefully Mwrought out of all George Eliots novels with the exception perhaps of Romola  Middlemarch  is also the most uelancholy in its tone It is a picture drawn by an artist of consummate literary power and of intellectual strength that among novelists is altogether unique in which are exhibited all the springs of action and all the motives of haracter that go to make up our commonplace society and the impression left by this  study of provincial life  is one of pftinful but healthy sadness There is nothing of the misanthrope in George Eliot if she laughs at t r condemns the errors and follies of the world she does so altogether in order to help on their correction and her ridicule and blame are more effective than the wisest preachers sermons but we have no more right to look for shallow merrymaking in her books than to seek amusement from  Ecclesiastes or  Lamentations She does not preach that  all is vanity and vexation of spirit or that  the Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob and hath not pitied  but she does show that society is sadly in need of mending and that it can only be mended by a great reconstruction of the rules by which it is now hampered It is with others in their various ways as with Dorothea whose later life is the mixed result of young and nobler impulse struggling under prosaic conditions Among the ay Oek a her mises it was never maid in t ighborood of Middlemarch that such mistakes could not have happened if the society into which she was born hd not smiled on propositions of marriage from a sickly man to a girl les than half his own ageon modes of education which make a womans knowledge another name for motley ignoranceon rules of conduct which are in flat contradiction with its own fondlyasserted beliefs While this is the social air in which mortals begin to breathe there will be collisions such as those in Dorotheas life where great feelings will take the aspect of error and great faith the aspect of illusion Dorothea is only one out of the many dwellers in Mid dlemarch whose characters are here portrayed with wonderful truth and vigour but she is the central figure that all the others cluster round We see her first in striking con trast to her simpleminded sister Celia and her as simpleminded uncle Mr Brooke as a highsouled young woman  enamoured of intensity and greatness and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those attributes The rashness causes her to embrace Mr Casaubon the very perfection of a selfish clerical prig and her marriage issues in nothing but bitterness until all her  vague ideals  have to give place to  the common yearning of womanhood In noticing the instalments of the novel as they were published we bave called attention to some of the stages in this change We have seen how gradually Dorothea loses faith in her husband without swerving at all in her duty towards him even as the most exacting purist might define it and how as gradually the way is prepared for her devotion after her husbands death to his cousin Will Ladislaw It is not easy to like young Ladislaw one is tempted to think that in marrying him Dorothea makes nearly as great a blunder as she did in marrying Mr Casaubon How much pleasanter it would have been for Lydgate to be her husband But unfortunately things do not always go pleasantly in real life and the fate that befals Dorothea is very natural though not very welcome Lydgates fate is harder than Dorotheas This portrait of the brave man of science whose purpose in life is destroyed through his marriage with a heartless or very shallowhearted beauty is as wonderful in its way as the portrait of Dorothea Lydgate and Rosamond are the chief persons in the later portions of  Middlemarch and in tracing their history George Eliot has described with unrivalled force and truth the consequences of an illassorted marriage not the consequences with which novelreaders are familiar in which the silly wife runs away from her husband or the husband is a brute to his wife but the commonplace issues in which gradually love is killed and one heart at least is broken Perhaps George Eliot weighs down her hero too much with misfortunes but they serve to bring out the character she wishes to show  Oh it is hard says Dorothea to him that all this should come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways There is no sorrow I have thought more about than thatto love what is great and try to reach it and yet to fail If selfish Rosamond serves in one sense as a foil to Dorothea unselfish Mary Garth is a no less complete foil of another sort The really pleasantest portions of  fiddle march are those that recount the sayings and doings of lMary and her father Caleb Garth And Caleb Garth is an excellent study of a man whose religion consists in unswerving honesty and persistent welldoing that makes no pretence tovirtue Asexcellent in itswayisthe studyof Nicholas Bulstrode the hard hypocrite who uses the form of religion k as a cloak to his base actions and who is at last driven into far baser actions in order that his character for rellgiuu mac 1 not be sullied Bulstrode3 downfall is described with great I ability and perhaps the best part of the description is f this which tells of the bearing of his wife just after she  has heard of his wrongdoings and of the worse doings r attributed to him t She locked herself in her room She needed time to get used s to her maimed consciousness her poor lopped life before she  could walk steadily to the place aotted her A new Rgicbin light had fallen on her husbands character and she could not j ge him leniently the twenty years in which she had believed irn him and venerated him by virtue of his coacealments came back with particulars that made them seem an odious deceit He had married her with that bad post life hidden behind him and she bad no faith left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him Her honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonour as bitter as it could be to any mortal But this imperfectlytaught woman whose phrases and habits were an odd patchwork had a loyal spirit within her The man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life and who had unvaryingly cherished hernow that punishment had l fallen him it was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him TIhere is a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on thie same couch with the forsaken soul withering it the more by uloving proximity She knew when she locked her door that she should unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband ald espouse his sorrow and say of his guilt I will mourn and not ixcproach But she needed time to gather up her strength she iteeded to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and prride of her ife When she had resolved to go down she prepared herself by t ne little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker tiey were her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had begun a new life in which she embraced hiumniliation She took off all her ornaments and put on a plain 1ack gown and instead of wearing her muchadorned cap and large bows of hair she brushed her hair down and put on a plain b netcap which made her look suddenly like an early Methodist Bulstrode who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying that she was not well had spent the time in an agitation co aal to hers He had looked forward to her learning the truth fromn others and had acquiesced in that probability as something easier to him than any confession But now that he imagined the Amelnt of her knowledge come he awaited the result in anguish l1ii daughters had been obliged to consent to leave him and tiiugh he had allowed some food to be brought to him he had not touched it He felt himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery Perhaps he should never see his wifes face with affection in it again And if he turned to God there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution It was eight oclock in the evening before the door opened and his wife entered He dared not look up at her He sat with is eyes bent down and as she went towards him she thought he looked smallerhe seemed so withered and shrunken A moveument of new compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave and putting one hand on his which rested on the arnn of the chair and the other on his shoulder she said solemnly 1 t kindly Look up Nicholas He raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half Damazed for a moment her pale face her changed mourning css the trembling about her mouth all said  I know  and her hands and eyes rested gently on him He burst out crying and tiny cried together she sitting at his side They could not yet steak to each other of the shame which she was bearing with hiim or of the acts which had brought it down on them His confession was silent and her promise of faithfulness was silent Openminded as she was she nevertheless shrank from the words ostrich would have expressed their mutual consciousness as she would have shrunk from flakes of fire She could not say  How much is only slander and false suspicion   and he did not say  I ani innocent The charitv of Middlemarch is as notable as its wisdom In every way it is a book to be glad of and if it does not enhance George Eliots fame it will only be because she has already attained the foremost rank among novelists who write novels that contain more religion than all the sermons that were ever penned and enough sound philosophy to make the reputation of half a dozen moralists and metaphysicians   I IMiddlemarch SATURDAY MARCH 30 1S72 LITERATURE By George Eliot Book III Waiting for Death Blackwood  Sons The third instalment of  Middlemarch ends in doubta doubt too evidently adapted to the exigencies of a serial form Old Peter Featherstone not less able than usual to enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating mankind is dying fast and vulturelike the Featherstones and Waules close round him with testamentary purpose Brothers Solomon and Jonah and sisters Martha and Jane take bodily possession of Stone Court where are also installed Mary Garth of right and Mrs Viney and her son Fred by Mr Featherstones request That the Featherstones should hang together against the Vineys is natural Still more natural is it that they should quarrel amongst themselves and that there should be a general sense running in the Featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the Almighty was watching him No scrutiny however can open the secret of old Peters iron box True to himself the old man snaps and snarls at everybody is oracular as to his will and inflicts torture with a keen sense of power In the night alone with Mary Garth he dies He has it seems made two wills of which he wishes to burn one But both remain  and upon their tenor hangs Fred Vineys life for Fred has borrowed money with all belief in his powers of repayment  having the superfluous securities of hope at his command and Mary Garths father has backed Freds bill and Fred has been unlucky in speculation upon horseflesh and  not having occupied himself with the inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion other people is now in most unhappy plight seeing himself in his true light as a pitiful rascal who is robbing other people of their savings But it is not for Fred and Mary alone that the plot is thickening Lydgatehow or why it would be as hard to say as in real life  finds himself engaged to Rosamond Viney and Mr Viney who is expecting Stone Court for Fred has given his consent to the arrangement  with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch For  the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action And Mr Viney has discovered that old Featherstones death is only his  demise and  considered as a demise old Featherstones death assumed a merely legal aspect so that Mr Viney could tap his snuffbox over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity1 And besides Lydgate and Rosamond Dorothea too claims our interest as Mr Casaubon is too clearly dying fastindeed has a fit which can have but one meaning And Dorotheas future is still further perplexed by the fact that Mr Brooke who is the most goodnatured of all unwise men has asked young Will Ladislaw to stop with him  feeling an interest in a young man who is starting in life with a stock of ideas And more than all exactly as  Old and Young put the riddle of which the answer lies in  Waiting for Death so in  Waiting for Death  a riddle is put in the thirtieth chapter the answer to which is even harder to guess and ought to be the hinge of the tale For the rest  Middlemarch is itself Celia is to become Lady Chettam and is very full of happiness Mr Brooke is more happily vague than ever his advice to Casaubon after his fit being  Yes yes get Dorothea to play backgammon with you in the evenings And shuttlecock now I dont know a finer game than shuttlecock for the daytime I remember it all the fashion To be sure your eyes might not stand that Casaubon But you must unbend you know Why you might take to some light study  conchology now  I always think that must be a light study Or get Dorothea to read you light things Smollett Roderick Random Humphrey Clinker they are a little broad but she may read anything now shes married you know I remember they made me laugh uncommonlytheres a droll bit about a postilions breeches We have no such humour now I have gone through all these things but they might be rather new to you And we have one or two new actors such as Mr Horrock the horsedealer  whose costume at a glance gives him a thrilling association with horses and whom Nature has blessed with  a face which by dint of Mongolian eyes and a nose mouth and chin seeming to follow his hatbrim in a moderate inclination upwards gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind and when accompanied by adequate silence likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding an infinite fund of humourtoo dry to flow and probably in a state of immovable crustand a critical judgment which if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it would be the thing and no other And with Mr Horrock is Mr Trumbull the auctioneer who is  an amateur of superior phrases never using poor language without immediately correcting himself aud who if anybody had observed of him that Mr Borthrop Trumbull being an auctioneer was bound to know the nature of everything would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came pretty near that Still more heavily outlined is Solomon Featherstone who  thought himself much deeper than his brother Peter indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellowmen inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being Even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there  coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others And there is also Mrs Plymdale who  doesnt think that marrying is everything and indeed  would have a girl first seek the kingdom of God  but who none the less has an eye to this world and its matters and so holds that  a girl should keep her heart within her own power What the end of  Middlemarch may be we hardly wish to guess Its chief interest is as a study of English life The action does not absorb us as in  Adam Bede and The Mill ou the Floss There are too many actors for that and too many threads woven into the one strand  but as a thoughtful anatomy of English habits and English modes of thought full of dry quiet humour Waiting for Death is worthy its author Whether  Middlemarch as a whole will suffer from the form which its periodical appearance entails remains to be seen Certainly as yet each part has been perfect of itself,biography
Moltke in his Home By F A Dressler Translated by Mrs C E BarrettLennard Murray 6s The private life of a great soldier is not often so interesting as that which already well known is once more described in Herr Dresslers recollections Lord Methuen in a brief introduction to the book remarks on the simplicity and refinement of the Marshal and contrasts him with the other great creator of the German Empire Bismarck The comparison is fair and natural enough but it is more amusing to compare von Moltke in private life with Frederick the Great We have it is true no portrait of the former with a phial of poison in one pocket and a quire of bad verses in the other and in lesser details the comparison emphasises the fact that Moltke was a gentleman and Frederick was not The comparison may have been for this reason fanciful but it is inevitably suggested by this book Herr Dressier tells us nothing very new and a good deal of what he has to say is very small beer yet his book is interesting because he had excellent opportunities as a musician in great favour of observing Moltke in every aspect of private life Nor does he spare his patron for instance he tells how Moltke disliked losing at cards so that his family were trained to let him win But the great man showed to better advantage on his country estate or as a musical critic than as a cardplayer and best of all on the battlefield or during those arduous years of preparation for the strife When there was a torchlight procession in his honour on his ninetieth birthday he whispered to his adjutant  Had I but lost a battle they would be saying  There goes the old donkey The remark may be true but Moltke was spared the illusage which has befallen many great and successful generals To soldiers writes Lord Methuen he set the example of how to work through and for others not to play for our own hand and not to seek to enhance our own interest by means of selfadvertisement That epitaph rings all the more true for having come from the pen of one of the most modest of our living generals,biography

n Boyne Water a Talc by te O1Ha Famity a  3 vols 12moAnotber tale of the Waely school Mth  ft Werly school with Jreland for the 5CC and Irelands History for the subject Sated as we have been with Scottish story we are quite ready to turn to the records of another country and Ireland as well as or better than any other She furnishes materials in abundance She has been oppressed for ages and her oppressors have been her historians She is Catholic and we have her story told by protestants misrepresentations inevitably followed and prejudices have now rooted in the hearts of successive generations It is high time to hear the other side freely and fully and no way half so effective as the medium of tales for nothing else nowadays gets regarded The writer of the tale before us is well qualified to play the part of national historian under the guise of the national novelist Ile knows the country and its history and is deeply stung with a sense of that country injuries He wants nothing but a little more resolution to cut away superfluities and a little more address in conduicting us at once medias in res He is too fond of surprises he attempts by crowding incidents to give that life and reality which would be better accomplished by lopping off the incumbrances of minor ones and the flow of his language is too frequently checked by breaks and parentheses but these are curable defects He has the stuff and staple of a good narrator in him when he comes to the action and warms in the business of his tale he is vivid and vigorous scenes of bustle and confusion rouse his best energies and his powers of description mental moral and natural are of no ordinary cast Historical novelists at least those of any value have an object distinct from the tale That of the author of the Scotch novels is sufficiently obvious and the views of the writer of the Boyne Water are equally conspicuous He regards the struggle of the Revolution as one of religious parties He gives James credit for moderation and believes he had no other view in any of his attempts than to rescue Catholics from their oppressions and to establish general toleration Of course the Revolution itself was gratuitous On the other hand he considers William to have been influenced by the same views but overborne by the fears and bigotries of the protestant clergy Of the latter there can be little question but quite as little we think that James whatever were his private wishes never would have been sutf fered to stop at all short of the reestablishment of Catholic superiority The main object of the novel is to give a representation of the state of Ireland from Jamess abdication as his expulsion is still curiously phrased to the Treaty of Limerick though the tale commences with his accession just to give the author an Opportunity of exhibiting the feelings of expectation which that event excited among all partie To the principat characters of I the tale we are introduced on their way from Belfast to Cushindoll a village on the northeast coast The travellers consist of Evelyn and his sister both very young ver handsome and very amiable in the style of those who are destined to figure in  modern story with their guardians and attendants of whom in our brief sketch we shall have no occasion to speak In crossing the hills the topography of which is very elaborately described extraordinary difficulties are encounteredroads were not Macadamized in those daysand to fill up the measure of their alarms and embarrassments a tremendous storma tornado such an one as is now never seen without the tropics overtakes them A sweeping dispersion ensues one falls to the earth another performs a series of somersets down the hills and Miss Evelyn is luckily rescued from destructionher frightened jennet backing to the very edge of a precipice7by the critical appearance and fearless energies of a young gentleman and lady These young natives of the hills a brother and sister prove to be persons of most surprising excellence vigorous and resolute as the mountaineers of romance are of course entitled to be To the house of their parent a ruined chieftain of the clan McDonnel the young Evelyn and the party are finally carried for shelter Intimacy soon grows up among the young people and they are speedily betrothed to each other Out of these sudden engagements spring the subsequent interests and perplexities of the talethe McDonnels being Catho lies and the Evelyns Protestants Evelyn just to give him time to reach his majority is dispatched to the WestIndies for a couple of years and returns to Ireland to consummate his marriage with Eva McDonnel at the period when every body was in a state of excitement respecting the invasion of William McDonnel meets his friend on landing at Carrickfergus aid in a few hours each of them unknown to the other is enlisted on opposite sides Evelyn is encountered by George Walker the well known defender of Derry and by the urgency of that wily agitator is engaged to take part in the approaching struggle and at the same moment the Jesuit OHaggerty presents McDonnel with a commission of dragoons in the service of James Walker labours hard to break off the match with the Catholic Eva and at last exacts a promise to be summoned to the nuptials On the day of the double marriage the ceremony delayed by the nonarival of Walker at length proceeds and Eva and Evelyn are coupled by the Catholic Priest but just as the second ceremony is commencing strange noises are heard and a furious gust of wind extinguishes most of the lights and in rushes Walker declaring the marriage illegal and announcing the landing in England of William the deliverer Confusion follows the ceremony suspends Walker calls upon Evelyn and OHaggerty upon McDonnel to fulfil their respective engagements and sacrifice their private wishes to public duties Each is surprised by the discovery of the others engagement sitspicion spring up in the breast of each their passions kindle high words follow and brides and bridegrooms separate Impelled by Walker Evelyn joins the Ulster Union and accepts a commission in Williams name but before joining the troops he conducts his distressed sister to her friends at Derry and proceeds himself to look after his family estate on the Lough Neagh On advancing up the avenue he perceives unusual stirrings in the house and while hastening forward to ascertain the cause lie strikes against the legs of his own servant dangling from a tree Alarmed and retiring his retreat is instantly cut off on all sides by armed men who force him to go forward to the house which he now discovers to be in the full possession of a party of Rapparees He receives a very hearty welcome from them to his own home and is hospitably entertained by them with a supper provided from his own stores and by his own cook The feast is suddenly interrupted by the intelligence of an enemy at hand Up starts the party measures are instantly taken for defense and the commander places a guard over Evelyn with orders to shoot him on the spot should the invaders prevail These invaders prove to be Evelyns friends headed by Walker The Rapparees were defeated and Evelyn was rescued from his fate by the artifice of a young lass who had taken a fancy to him and threw some water on the lock of the Guards pistol which was thus snapped at him in vain Evelyn now joined the forces under Lord Mount Alexander and was wounded in the first battle fought at Dromore on the retreat from Newry and left bleeding on the field On recovering his senses he seizes a stray horse and sets out for the north Beyond Carrickfergus the Redshanks Lord Antrims dragoons a troop of which McDonnel commanded were scouring the country and lhe quickly found himself pursued His horse failing he betook himself to his legs and after flying across we know not how many hills and dales and endeavouring to descend a steep declivity he sunk at last exhausted in a hole of the rock till his pursuers came up with him at the first of whom he dis charged a pistol It was McDonnel himself No harm was done they recognize each other and a reconciliation follows He refuses to take Evelyn prisoner in spite of the sulky remonstrances of his men but dismissing them to the next town himsclf to the neglect apparently of his military duties engages to Eonthllet h    I  L4L1JZ friend to a place of safety This hoevesr is not so easily aecomllised Prodigious diffieultwis are encountered a most painful and laborious succession of elimubgi id slippings and escapes By the wq t is a vast deal too much of diffia if this kind the realities are intoe enough but the descriptions are s momt so Byandbye however Eva m them and Evelyn and his bride explyn All are now proceeding very hkarmoniou together when suddenly a party of Ulsgi dragoons come upon them and McDow is instantly taken prisoner but placed Aid the charge of his friend Eva now gees to her friends and Evelyn with McDound on parole proceeds to Derry to visit his sin ter and McDonnel and Miss Evelyn SWh of course come again to a perfect under standing The memorable siege had already orn menced and Evelyn takes an active pm in the defence under Walker whose cleo racter is here ably developed a singular union of energy craft and fanaticism The whole progress of the siege to the final relief by the arrival of Kirke is faith fiully and vigorously detailed and presents many a striking picture of the miseries sus tained by that devoted city fromn the can nonadingy without and the famine within with the unresisting submission of the citi zens and Walker and his few energetic apprenticeboys In the course of the siege an attempt is again made to celebrate the marriage between McDonnel and Evelyns sister which is again interrupted by the mysterious agency of a wild Irishwomn possessed of something like the attributes of omniscience and ubiquity and the poor girl at last dies from the combined effects of fright famine and fever On the raising of the siege the McDlon nels and Evelyn being again all together and passes and protections obtained they proceed towards old McDonnels ButbY this time Schomberg had landed 2O000 men and Kirke had set out to join him to wards the south Old McDonnels unluckily lay in his way and there was danger let he should be beforehand with them They speeded therefore with all their migh1 and in the deepest anxietyall too late Kirke and his troops had just quitted the smoking ruins and the followers of the deA were hanging on the trees by dozens TIe shrieks of poor Eva over the deadbody of her father bring Kirke and his fellov sljk again Evelyn presents the protections fov his companions in vain At the moment Of imminent peril a party of Rapparees cowe suddenly upon them a skirmish ensue Evelyn is cut down and on waking to life agrain finds his head resting on the lap of I young woman whrom he recognizes to be the same who had before saved his life Ad who now informs him that McDonnel bid perished and Eva was carried off by KirkC The recollection of Kirkes wellknT1O character threw him into a storm of bh ror and he makes desperate efforts tO pMr slue him in spite of his weakness and the I rls efforts to detain Shim They had not roceeded far before they were challenged by the troops of his own volunteercorps from the commander of whom Evelyn forthwith solicits a horse and attendants to enable him to overtake Kirke when to his confusion and despair he learns that Kirke had left orders to put him under arrest Resistance is vain but three or four days bringt up the corps to Schombergs camp Schomberg with Kirke by his side was reviewing the troops Evelyn advances in front of the line and in the presence of Schomberg demands of Kirke the cause of his arrest who charges him with aiding and abetting rcbels He appeals to the old Duke and exhibits his passes and protections and is immediately released Then finding Schomberg disposed to befriend him he demands of Kirke an account of Eva Kirke haughtily refuses Evelyn challenges and Schlomberg sanctions the challenge and witnesses the conflict on the spot By an accidental slip Evelyn is finally worsted and having put his cause upon his failing sword is thus left without redress Eva appears lost to him for ever Schomberg appoints him his aiddecamp retains him about him for the remainder of the campaign and at the end of it sends him with despatcles to England In London or rather at Kensington where Wiliam resided he is detained for the winter The interior of the court is thrown open and we have William and Mary and Ben tinck and Burnett very characteristically exhibited Two or three times in the gar dens he gets a glimpse of a person in a male dress whom he believes to be Eva but in spite of his efforts he is unable to speak with her In the spring he returns to Schomberg and at last gets a short leave of absence to attend to his private affairs His first step is to go straight to Sarsfields camp then at Dublin Sarsfield had saved the life of Evelyn and his friend before Derry wlhen they had indiscreetly accompanied the deputation of the city to Jamess camp and on this ground of acquaintanceship Evelyn ventures to introduce hiwrself to that brave man to procure intelligence of Eva He gets detained by the outposts and meets again with the girl who had twice saved his life and also with the figure whom he had taken for Eva but again is baffled in his attempts to speak with her Sarsfield receives him with kindness and testifies an interest in his distress though knowing nothing whatever of the fate of McDonnel or Eva he recollects there is a lady of the name at Jamess court and he engages to take him in the evening to the Castle There he is noticed as a stranger by James who enters into conversation with him defending his conduct and vindicating his rights Blat what is most interesting to Evelyn he recognizes among the attendants of Lady lYreonnel the Ladv Lieutenant bis own Eva but again every attempt to addres her is defeated Hisinterview with James is thus suddenly interrupted by the junex pected announcement of Willias landim and having actually been six days in the country The party breaks up Sersfield dismisses Evelyn with a pass and hi makes his speedy way to rejoin Schomberg Now comes on Williams brief campaign and we fight the battle of the Boyne bravely over again Evelyn who in the engagement had acted as Aiddecamp to Wit liam is takeni prisoner and after Jamess desertion of his cause and country accompanies Sarsfield to Limerick where he has the luck again to undergo the harassings and miseries of a siege Here too he aocompanies Sarsfield on the memorable ex pedition in which with the aid of the Rap parees he succeeded in destroying Williams ammunition and baggage The commander of these Rapparees turns out to be his long lost friend Mc Donnel whose kindness to him had brought suspicion upon himself and finally dismissal from the service Resentment and despair drove him to head a band of these desperadoes He ipeets with Evelyn and while pouring curses upon him and preparing to cut him down a signal from his friends arrests his pU pose Here too again Evelyn meets with the person whom he had so often taken for Eva and discovers him at last to be a younger brother of hers Some words of explanation pass but he is as violent as his elder brother All is mystery to Evelyn He cannot guess the cause of this intemperance All however is now hastening to a conclusion and eclaircisse ment iUmerick is reduced to extremity and on the very day of its surrender came EvY herself her younger brother the wild om niscient and ubiquious ONagh and the girl who had so often shewn her devotion to Evelyn Explanations follow the girl confesses that love for Evelyn had seduced her to play false to report falsely of Eva to Evelyn and of Evelyn to Eva At this moment comes the intelligencethat the Rapparee commander had fillen into the hands of Williams general and was just going to be shot His friends appeal to Sarsfield who generously flies to his succour solicits his pardon and with difficulty obtains it upon condition of his going into exile Evelyn and Eva remain behind blessed and prosperous and in due time we read inform their banished friends of a family of three little cherubs prattling about them Though the story creeps very tiresomely at the commencement when once the real business of the action begins the narrative never flags to the end it is full of bustle and variety The historical cbsracters are all faithfully poutrayea sa we have all the distinguished persolS of the day from James a Wlliam ad y to Burnett and Walker Several persons are introduced whom we have found no occasion to mention some of more some of less importance particularly a blind man whose agency is of frequent recurrence and wcho plays the traveller and guide at least as well as Mr Holman and a dumb man whose gesticulations seem to be quite as expressive as language,biography

before they have had time to efface the signs of the murders a manofwar appears they assume the identity of the dead crew and under their names are rescued and landed at San Francisco They make their report the wreck is put up for auction and then they disappear All this is excellent and excellently told but alas how shortly three chapters only and those at the very end of the book I Well on landing Carthew hears that he has come into his estates and to prevent awkward discoveries gets an agent to run up the price of the wreck to a fabulous sum It is however secured by the hero Dodd and his partner Jim who stake their all on the venture naturally suspecting a hidden treasure of opium or gold Dodd starts for the wreck in a strange state of detective exaltation Here we are teased by a good deal of the usual Gaboriau business the discovery of new clues the fitting in of missing links the reiterated pronouncements of the actors that they can make nothing out of it True the secret is well kept because as yet we have not had a word about Carthew and his ship though of course we smell blood from the first but it is all the more worrying for that In Gaboriau one always guesses about the second chapter what he is after and then the dues are quite easy to remember and one takes a sort of sardonic pleasure in the bungling and sapient wonderment of the poor dear detectives To properly grasp The Wrecker you must read itover again for a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse The clues turn out all right in the end when the problem is solved and xoone Mr Carthew and a totally distinct and separate story till then it is just algebra Well this replica of  Treasure Island ends tamely enough the Flyixg Scd is disembowelled and sunk but nothing of value beyond clues is found and Dodd return to his partner and ruin Having thus wound up the second part of the story the authors then set about the beginning How do they piece the head on to the tail  Very simply Dodd comes into money He is haunted by the mystery he feels a strange a very strange yearning for the unknown Englishman who is somehow mixed up in it he knows a blackmailer is on the trail he will take a holiday by following the clues to England and warn the victim He tracks him to Paris hears his story and they swear eternal friendship But unluckily we now feel less inclined to emba on a second or shall we boldly say a third  cruise to the same Treasure Island through the same seas and with comrades not wholly differing from our former crew It is a beautiful voyage most exciting most tragical it is the very cream of the book butit is only an appendix The lat chapter which is called an Epilogue is singularly illadvised It assumes the form of a letter to Mr W H Low whose name is to my ignorance a name only Mr Stevenson not unfrequently takes a cruel delight in destroying our illusions and throwing cold water on the dying embes of the fire round which he has allowed us to sit Here he begins by relating how the other day he came across his friend Dodd who of course proceeds to wind up the story by giving the last news of the various characters But why this sudden intrusion of the author in the Epilogue  In the Prologue Dodds story was told to a merchant named Havens What is the object of this confused and confusing setting Mr Stevenson then in his airy coaxing way throws the whole fiction aside and professes to reveal the genesis of the storyhow he and his colleague resolved to work up some incident they heard into a popular cartbeforethehorse detective novel how keenly they appreciated the inherent defects of such a planthe defects which I have just been illustratingand how they hoped to disguise or palliate them by sundry devices But Mr Stevenson does not beguile me so easily He is no acquaintance of yesterday I have learnt to catch the light shadows of feeling which flit across his sunny pages better than he thinks This is no Epilogueit is an Apology But of all acts an apology is about the most graceful and the most righteous though fools do not think so It Mr Stevenson were not a little wearied nay disgusted with his excursion into the realms of anical detectivism he would be no longer to my mind the author of Prince Otto Once he has relieved our anxiety by hinting his contempt for the whole business he resumes his reign over us After all he has but done well what inferior hands can do much better But he should not have tried I would not for the world pit myself against a morning governess at Compound Division or Mangnalls Questions But to end thus churlishly I too should be but a wrecker and of the graceless literary breed For though Mr Stevensons last ship steers an unsteady course she carries a goodly freight There are dramatic scenes in this book which he has never yet surpassed and characters which stand out among his best These and other fine things let the delighted reader find out for himself Two points only may be noticed From an advertisement I gather that Mr Lang is most impressed with the character of the Captain Which captain  There are several If he means Nares I cannot agree with him I do not believe in the virtues of wicked men least of all in those of the FarWestern cardsharping cutthroat nay why shrink from the degrading confession I believe there is more virtue in one Bethesda of sleek Anabaptist chandlers and their snoring spouses than in all the gambling hells of the Golden Gates We meet too many ruffians in The Wrecker but one highly elaborated though somewhat neutral character it does present that of Dodd the artist nature dragged into the vortex of coarse reality The other point is the grave and subtle satire on American institutions which underlies the fun of the earlier chapters The Commercial Academy may be an exaggeration but it is an instructive parable Possibly here Mr Stevenson is indebted to others for the incidents and local colour but the style is clearly his own and reveals vet a new phase of his genius y yLiterature The Wrecker By Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne Cassells In one of his early essays Mr Stevenson played with the charming fancy that the conduct of life depends upon skill in literature not indeed wholly but in a great measure It is no light task he insisted to communicate your precise sense of things in set phrase to another man the choice of words the nicety and exactitude of them may fail to impress your companion as you would have him impressed All speech all intercourse by word of mouth or by  hand of write is so much practice of the literary art and human converse is thus encompassed with peril The world was made before the English language and seemingly upon a different design Suppose we held our converse not in words but in music those who have a bad ear would find themselves cut off from all near commerce and no better than foreigners in this big world But we do not consider how many have 4a bad ear for words nor how often the most eloquent find nothing to reply From the first this whimsical commonplace has powerfully influenced Mr Stevenson it has made of him an aesthetic casuist anxious about the veracity of his least word its minutest tone and accent Be it a story a piece of criticism an essay in ethics a personal reminiscence or a private adventure each of his words is positively tremulous with its desire to tell the truth Since the whole of life is a continuous and coherent affair he refuses to isolate literature in a secluded palace of art or bookworms study he wants to know life upon all sides and he wants to express it upon all sides by the use of words Thus it is that his choice of an adjective his composition of a phrase or his disposition of incidents is for him an exercise in good conduct a trial of truthfulness We live in a very rich full world our behaviour in it and out attitude towards it expressed in words comprehend all matters of belief and conduct Of modern writers only Mr Pater shares with Mr Stevenson this fine anxiety not to play life false by using inaccurate expressions He also whether he write essays or imaginative studies or more formal narratives shows this care for the truth as he apprehends it To Mr Pater an Italian church or a French landscape an ancient liturgy or a classical rite is a thing with definite values of its own a thing with claims and rights towards which he has duties a shipwreck or a walking tour an American man of business or a French artist is the same to Mr Stevenson The one is more meditative more learned more gentle than the other but both are men who feel the pathos the heroism the living significance of thingsVirgils  sense of tears in mortal things  and Brownings  How good is mans life the mere living  how flt to employ All the heart and the soul and the senses for ever in joy It is curious to reflect that many critics have found in Mr Pater and Mr Stevenson two intensely practical humane and sympathetic writerslittle more than unreal eclectic profundities intricacies and extravagances The Wrecker contains as it were in solution all the perfections of Mr Stevenson upon the face of it it has all the stirring romance of adventure which we enjoyed in Treasure Island it displays two characters with all the impressive fidelity which made Alan Breck and the Master of Ballantrae so wonderful it includes episodes and sketches varieties of life such as those in the two books of travel in the Silverado Squatters and many single essays it has much of that fantastic humour which adorns the New Arabian Nights it provides us with more of those brilliancies of moral sentiment already so characteristic of Mr Stevenson The result is a delightful and imperfect book a saturn  farrago in which every reader can come upon something to his taste and no reader feels satisfied throughout The writers explain how it all came about in an ingenious epilogue or apology they determined one moonlit night in the Pacific to write a story about the tale of a wreck often the occasion of a rascally romance in commerce  Before we turned in the scaffolding of the tale had been put together But thc question of treatment was as usual more obscure We had long been at once attracted and repelled by that very modern form of tho police novel or mystery story which consists in beginning your yarn anywhere but at the beginning and finishing it anywhere but at the end attracted by its peculiar interest when done and the peculiar difficulties that attend its execution repelled by that appearance of insincerity and shallowness of tone which seems its inevitable drawback They determined by a more artistic method by a gradual approach to the story making tho chief character familiar from the first among many various scenes to give an air of reality to the central mystery To this end the story flies from Muskegon to Edinburgh from Edinburgh to Paris from Paris to San Francisco before the puzzle of the wreck in the Pacific is introduced and to solve that puzzle the story flies from San Francisco to Dorsetshire and to Barbizon where the answer is given The answer takes us to Australia the Pacific and San Francisco once more I do not know that courtesy compels me to accept for literal truth the authors explanation but it is more convincing at least than Poes account of his evolution of the Raven in his essay upon the Philosophy of Composition To Mr Stevensons method are due at once the charm and the defect of The Wrecker The charm lies in single episodes the bohemian life of art in Paris the bohemian life of commerce in San Francisco the splendid voyage to the Pacific islands the search for treasure upon the abandoned ship and in certain characters Pinkerton the tactless and romantic speculator  Nares the brutal philosophical and cordial seaman But the central facts of the story are obscured by the very means employed to make them plausible and natural The story begins and ends with some lack of symmetry and rounded form The last details are told by Mr Stevenson propria persona in a letter of dedication to a friend It reminds us of Scotts intricate prefaces introductions and involved machinery for getting his main story under weigh Pleasant in themselves these contrivances do but embarrass the story which they are meant to serve In the present case the difficulties of the narrative are pardonable enough for they help us to realise that variety and richness of life which Mr Stevenson never wearies of praising It may be objected to this story that it contains episodes of brutal violence murder and bloodshedding which its author presents with a certain callousness if not with a certain gusto But Mr Stevenson himself supplies an answer by his constant trust in human nature To him every man has some nobility and we are all incomprehensible together Captain Nares was full of barbarity vanity illconditioned humours but  he won me to a kind of unconsenting fondness Lastly the faults were all embraced in a more generous view I saw them in thoir place like discords in a musical progression tu ul accepted them and found them picturesque as we accept and admire in tho habitable lace of nature the smoky head of tho volcano or the pernicious thicket of the swamp Tho world is a pageant of vicos and of virtues to be endured by all means to bo enjoyed if may be Our vices have something good in them and our virtuos are not all pure Dodd tho narrator of tho story is grossly ungrateful to his strange lovable comrade Pinkorton he writes him pages of penitence  Wonderful are the consolations of literature As soon as that letter was written and posted the consciousness of virtue glowed in my veins like some rare vintage In tho thick of a dangerous storm Nares was happy Well theres always something sublime about a big deal like that and it lund of raises a man in his own liking Were a queer kind of beasts Mr Dodd Bellaire a  shyster or disbarred lawyer with qualms of conscience goes to blackmail an unfortunate man Dodd comments I used to wonder whether I most admired or most despised this quivering heroism for evil Mr Stevenson feels to the full what Mr Watson has expressed in four lines  Momentous to himself as I to me Hath each man been that ever woman bore  Once in a lightning Hash of sympathy I fdl this truth an instant and no more But with Mr Stevenson this truth is always present and it has preserved him from that easy contempt for whole classes of men which so many brilliant living writers lovo to express It is instructive to compare Mr Stevensons praise of a free natural life of work under sun and wind and rain with Mr Kiplings praise of a strenuous rapid active lifethe ona so simply honest and exhilarating the other so merely hitter and exasperating The two writers have something in common  Mr Stevenson make us interested in such things as a  deepwater tramp limejuicing around between big ports Calcutta and Rangoon and Frisco and the Canton River  Mr Kipling in such experience us loafing from Lima to Auckland in a big old condemned passengership turned into a cargoboat and owned by a secondhand

NEW NOVELS The Little White Bird By J M Barrie Hodder  Stoughton Since the days of the Children of Lir the wandering seabird has typified the souls of men Mr Barrie with a quainter imagining has derived babies by transmigration from birds The little boy with whose ways and fancies this book is chiefly concerned firmly believes the theory and it is the basis of much fairy lore which converts Kensington Gardens into a haunt of delightful mystery The birds island in the Serpentine is the otficina gentium and the fairies who inhabit the gardens after sundown know it well It will be seen what possibilities these ideas Eresent for long and discursive narrative etween the old bachelor soldier and the little friend whom he sets himself to win with toys and talk The man has had a love story and has a fund of affection left which is honestly at the service of the boys mother whom he has befriended at a distance as he learns to know for the sake of that very memory All this is very well handled and the charm of the bookfor it has great charmconsists in the revelation at times weirdly feminine of the delights of babyhood in its dressing and undressing its attitude to mothers and others its early cricket also as it were involuntarily which is good art of an entirely sweet and kindly nature in the soldier One cannot help guessing that one is really learning all about the author io the character of a parent even as before we met him not altogether without a hint of undue expansiveness in that of a son The book would form an excellent textbook for parents learning their business but hardly is one we fancy that childish readers would appreciate Such episodes as that of the inconsiderate waiter whose throes between humanity and conventionality are entertaining to older folks would be lost on children The story of Peter Pan who fled back to birdlife in his infancy would engross them more though it is complicated with ideas addressed to the adult and educated Mr Barries book has as we have said great charm otherwise we should not be able to read a thing so discursive and casual Arrangement there is none episodes are far too lengthy and the whole thing if one may say so bulges in the wrong places There is cheap work too in the fabric which a good craftsman ought not to pass Why does Mr Barrie use an odious and unnecessary verb like  to suspicion  He can as the cosmopolitan man says hit us where we live and he can make the best of most things Why does he not make the best of the English language ,juvenile

Southwhich its author has gathered from the columns of a weekly contemporary retouched and extended The Author of  Mary Barton possesses some of an artists best qualities She will be attended to having never as yet written without engaging the readers interest whether he agrees with or dissents from her philosophies Her dialogue is naturalher eye for character is keen She enjoys humour obviouslyshe calls out pathos skilfully Few things have been met in modern fiction more touching than the fading away of the poor girl to whom Margaret Hale attaches herself on removing from the South to a manufacturing town in Lancashire The poetical Methodism of thisgirl111011011101 uncomplaining affectionthe mixture of rudeness and of reverence with which she looks up to the delicatelynurtured Lady make up an admirable picture The Author of  Mary Barton  seems bent on doing for Lancashire and the Lancashire dialect what Miss Edgeworth did for Ireland and Scott for the land across the border There has been no use of English patois in English fiction comparable to hers She has strong Lancashire sympathies tooif they be classsympathies such as propel her to a somewhat disproportionate exposure of the trials and sufferings of the poor her excess is a generous one and not accompanied by that offensive caricaturing of her more  conventional  heroes and heroines which must always bring the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question In another point the Author of  North and South is open to remonstrance She deals with difficulties of morals needlessly and too fearlessly because as we have again and again said the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction  and because by all onesided handling of such matters  when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded nnd when the temptation must be dwelt upon as cruel in apology for the offence  there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage The flat lie which Margaret Hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother is gratuitous painfulstaggering as an incident and without useful result as a lesson We cannot in our hearts blame Margaret yet the author by the sufferings which followed as consequence takes pains to show how blameworthy Margaret was A kindred dilemma it will be recollected is to be found in the authors  Ruth which in place of aiding interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel Here the motive of the incident is less obvious In real actual life blameable cowardly and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible They must be faced with such honour such charity such disposition to excuse and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned  but to thrust them forward in Fiction where only artistic truth is possible amounts in deed if not in purpose to a wilful  playing with fire It should be added however that the tenor and tissue of our authors writings are such as to satisfy us that no wilfulness has been in her mind but an earnest if a mistaken desire to do good,biography
Nostromo a Tale of the Seaboard By Joseph Conrad Harper  Brothers This is a perfectly amazing book Opinions may vary according to the varying degrees of comprehension brought to bear upon it with reference to its interest its charm its artistic completeness and so forth but all will agree that it is an amazing piece of work It is less a novel than an opera in prosethe longest ever written Its division into chapters and books appears to be purely arbitrary gratuitous and unnecessary perhaps probably an authors tribute to the fixity of the canons and standards of his art But they have no particular meaning these printed divisions the sounding musio of the tale rises and falls fades and swells advancing ever to the ordered crash of its finale without reference to parts and chapters and with a force and certainty that are at once splendid and fascinating The authors favourite knack of making his characters tell his story for him in narrative style one to another is freely indulged here and with a magnificent disregard for the dangers of digression and retrospection Fifty pages of retrospection are as nothing to Mr Conrad and so fine and strong is his prose so brilliant are the colours he uses that only the trained reader is likely to recognize the daring nature of his method For grim ironic humour it would be hard to match the passage describing the handling by a brutal soldiery of the terrorsmitten Israelite Hirsch There are whole pages in which every word seems deeply charged with thought though every sentence is vivid and melodious Nostromo is a romantic tale of politics adventure and intrigue in a maritime republic of South America yet before all eke it is a novel of character One is inclined to dispute the authors apparent conviction that the man Nostromo is the principal figure but that may be only on account of the wealth of characterization lavished upon innumerable other figures in this fine achievement,biography

NOVEL NOTES TROOPER PETER HALKET OF MASHONALAND By Olive Schreiner 6s Unwin He revealed Himself unto babes Separated from his company and lost in the great veldt Trooper Peter Halket dreams by his fire of the fortune he is going to make before he leaves South Africa He does not know how but others have done it before him out of the Mashonas and Matabeles or in some other vague way His mother had had a hard struggle but when riches come she shall have the best of times A tall dark man clad in a loose linen garment joins him sits with him by the fire and Peter getting the better of his awe questions the stranger and not understanding who He may be pours out his own history and his crude views on white men and black The visionary interview is bold but it is reverent and earnest The effect produced on readers by the Lord Jesus Christ discussing South African politics will certainly be various Perhaps it is enough for us to acknowledge the serious purpose of this first part The second which describes Halkets application of his vision to the circumstances attendant on his service as trooper actively engaged against the blacks is far stronger and far more sympathetic The last scenes of Halket trooper and martyr ignorant fool and yet under the influence of the light just shed on him a saint reckless of earthly fate are described with a calm restrained power which marks the highest point the writers powers have reached as yet,biography
Oorr the Teaps By the Author of  The I Autocrat of the BreakfastTable Sampson Low DR HOLMES in the manSions of British aristocrats felt himself  at home but his truest admirers preferred to meet him at the famous breakfasttable These will now gladly welcome him again  over the teacups where lie discourses genially and wisely of men ard manners It is unnecessary to draw comparisons between his present conversations and those which some thirty years ago made him famous That he  feels he has something he would like to say  is his sufficient justification for the present work and there are plenty of people on both sides of the Atlantic who will listen to him gladly We may however note in passing that the always genial Doctor is now if possible more genial than ever Even his old friend the New England deacon is not held up to ridicule Among the characters that assemble around the teatable are two of our old familiar friends the Autocrat himselfnow known as the  Dictator though he dictates very little and indeed takes ostensibly only a small part of the conversationand the Professor All the rest of the old company have departed and given place to new and not uninteresting guests Among these is of course a doctor who is one of the parties in the slight loveromance that runs through the book That much of the talk relates to old age is natural enough seeing that the author has now completed his eightyone years and is not anxious to conceal the fact He seems to regard himself at this stage of life with something of the curious scientific or semiscientific interest which hitherto he has always manifested with reference to external things He studies his sensations and notes the gain and the lossbeing quite alive to the privileges as well as to the imonveniences connected with his time of life Ie is of opinion that 4 old age is infinitely more cheerful for intelli gent people at least than it was two or three thousand years ago It is our duty so far as we can to keep it so There will always be enough about it that is solemn and more than enough alas that is saddening But how much there is in our times to lighten its burdens  If they that look out at the windows be darkened the optician is happy to supply them with eyeglasses for use before the public and spectacles for their hours of privacy If the grinders cease because they are few they can be made many again by a third dentition which brings no toothache in the train By temperance and good habits of life proper clothing wellwarmed welldrained and wellventilated dwellings and sufficient but not too much exercise the old man of our time may keep his muscular strength in very good condition Dr Holmes is by no means an enthusiastic admirer of 1the good old times le believes in the things and the men of today If the match were possible he says he would be prepared to back Mr Gladstone for a hundred shekels against Caleb that overconfident old Israelite to cut down and chop up a cedar of Lebanon About many other topics which interest him Dr Holmes takes the present opportunity of discoursing He is somewhat severe on the persons he styles braintappers those literary operatives who address persons whose names are well known to the public asking their opinions or their experiences on subjects which are at the time of general interest The object with which the braintapper puts his questions may lie admits be a purely benevolent and entirely disinterested one But this is not always the case In many instances the braintapper  is acting much as those persons do who stop a physician in the street to talk with him about their livers or stomachs or other internal arrangements instead of going to his office and consulting him expecting to pay for his advice Others are more like those busy women who having the generous intention of making a handsome present to their pastor at as little expense as may be send to all their neighbours and acquaintances for scraps of various materials out of which the imposing bedspread or counterpane is to be elaborated Akin to the braintapper  is the writer of unnecessary communications who desires to express admiration or to seek information or to procure an autograph Dr Holmes confesses he has encouraged this vice He was willing to answer all correspondents as long as he was able but at length it became necessary to give notice that the letters books and pamphlets which reached him were too numerous to be attended to If he undertook to read and answer them all he would have little time for anything else It is gratifying to receive them no doubt When large numbers of strangers insist on claiming one as a friend on the strength of what he has written it tends to make him think of himself somewhat indulgently Dr Holmes hints at the difference that exists between the written and the unwritten answers to correspondents and remarks that 1the hypocrisy of kindhearted people is one of the most painful exhibitions of human weakness He gives a few specimens of the unwritten answers of which one may be quoted by way of example Think the lines you mention are by far the best I ever wrote hey Well I didnt write those lines What is more I think they are as detestable a string of rhymes as I could wish my worst enemy had written Dr Holmes concludes his present series of papers with the hope that he may yet meet his readers  in the now and then of the future We hope so too for many years to come lie has given us his views about old age and the world in general from the standpoint of eighty years We shall hope in due time to learn how he regards them at ninety WVALTER LEWIN,biography
PARABLES FROM NATURE By MARGARET GATT r With Illustrations by ALIcE B WOODWARD 3A 6d net Bell  Sons There are certain books which should be in every library nursery or adult and one of these books is  Parables from Nature Every child who is old enough to have stories told to it will love to hear Mlrs Gattys little tales of birds and animals and flowers and children The grownups love the same tales because they are already old friends and because of the simple beautiful style of their telling This edition of the  Parables  is a most desirable volume to possess it is handsome tasteful and generously illustrated Miss Woodward has evidently found herself quite in sympathy with her subjects  and her frontispiece illustrating what is perhaps the best known of all the  Parables  A Lesson of Faithgives the keynote to the whole it is original natural simple and without violating the limitations of bird and insect life gives just the right suggestion of thought and speech in that life As a giftbook for children this collection of stories is perennially suitable for not onlv does it captivate the childmind by its intimacy with the animal and vegetable world but the nature lessons being always accurate thiey inform withouit tears so to speak and the happy child learns scientific facts while drinking in romanceIParables from Nature By MARGARET GATTY Illustrated by ALICE WOODWARD G Bell and Sons 5s net THIs new edition of Mrs Gattys wellknown parables has some charming illustrations and is prefaced by a brief note or biography of the writer Margaret Scott the daughter of Dr Scott who had been foreign secretary to Nelson and his chaplain on board the Victory was born in 1809 After the battle of Trafalgar Dr Scott became vicar of Southminster and of Catterick where Margaret and her sister led a life of cultivated leisure such as does not seem possible to those of this generation who rush along through existence in the present hurry of tbe world The girl became a good French and Italian scholar but her strong taste for natural history did not develop until much later in life when during a stay at Hastings in 1848 she began to take an interest in seaweeds and zoophytes Her  History of British Seaweeds came out in 1862 There is little to record in her serene and uneventful lifeMrs Gatty never went beyond the United Kingdombut her marriage to the Rev Alfred Gatty vicar of Ecclesfield and her death in 1873 Her Parables have survived the test of time and are remarkable for a certain sobriety a freshness of humour and for an unaffectedness rare in the style of literature to which they belong Her knowledge of birds and beasts was minute and conscientious she cculd neve acquiesce in making scientific statements without ascertaining their accuracy and  when writing her  Parables she was aided in verifying her facts by two scientific friends This truthfulness of her presentment of nature has much to do with the enduring vitality of her work its permanent charm to more than one generationParables from Nature By Margaret Gatty With Notes on the Natural History and Illustrations by W Holman Hunt and others New and Complete Edition with Memoir of the Author by her Daughter Juliana Horatia Ewing G Bell  Sons Mrs Gattys Parables from Nature have so high and permanent a place among childrens classics that a standard edition of them has become desirable With this we are furnished in the handsome volumo before us wherein the interpretation of the Parables is rendered easy by means of instructive annotations  and the charms of the authors fancy are increased by the artists responsive skill Nothing that we can say is wanted to procure a welcome for Mrs Gatty in every home where there are children or those who sympathise with children but her many admirers will be grateful to Mrs Ewing for having in the present edition of her mothers bestknown work given them svh particulars of the authors life as wili bie them to ralise the scenes and circumstances which fed her fertile fancy and bent it in that direction where she achieved so much success Margaret Gatty waa the younger of the two daughters of Dr Scott Lord Nelsons chaplain and inherited both from her father and mother a love of learning and a power of turning it to account Left motherless in her infancy she grew up within the quiet walls of a Yorkshire parsonage Books were her chief companions and from these as well as from constant intercourse with men of culture her education was derived It does not seem that she underwent any systematic course of training but her innate love of study and the abundant materials around her supplied her with all that she needed That her time was well employed is obvious from the facts that she attained considerable proficiency in art before her childhood was over and that when she was seventeen she began to translate Dantes Inferno into English verse and to illustrate each canto with appropriate designs In 1839 she married the Rev Alfred Gatty DD Vicar of Ecclesfield where the remainder and most productive period of her life was spent Her marriage says her daughter  like that of her parents was founded upon congeniality of aims and pursuits and her work met only with additional help and encouragement in her new home Her first book entitled The Fairy Godmothers was published in 1851 and four years afterwardsthe first series of Parables from Nature with illustrations by the author herself appeared It is interesting to trace the origin of this Mrs Gattys most characteristic work She had been much struck with the beauty of Adamss Allegories and especially with that of  The Old Mans Home and The Kings Messengers  but she was very much distressed that the mosses and green lizards should have been made emblems of sin in the story of  The Distant Hills and thought it a very undesirable association of ideas for the minds of children The subject awakened in her mind the memory of Quarless Emblems which had been her delight in childhood and prompted her to her first essay in morai teaching through natural objects With these her acquaintance was something more than superficial as the notes to the present edition abundantly show Her powers of imagination and extensive range of reading enabled her to carry on with much success the plan she had adopted and five volumes of Parables appeared between 1855 and 1870 On these her reputation is mainly based but we should not be doing justice to her industry and enterprise if we omitted to mention that within the same period she published numerous volumes of tales and a scientific treatise on British Seaweeds and also started upon its successful course the admirable serial known to all children as Aunt Judys Magazine Mrs Gatty died on October 4 1873 working almost to the end in spite of the disease which during the last ten years had invaded limb after limb and function after function until the intellect alone remained unimpaired Her daughters criticism upon her writing is one in which most readers will concur and if we cannot call Mrs Gatty a genius we may readily allow that her sincerity commonsense and unaffected love of goodness render her a far better companion for children than many an author to whom that terra has been applied Her tales are uniformly wholesome as well as attractive and it is in our opinion no slight recommendation that  not one of them depends for its pathos upon early deathbeds or unavailing regrets I Charles J Robinson f,juvenile
Peg Woffington  a Novel By Charles Reade  Bentley This is a very clever epigrammatic hook and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in London between 1740 and 1760 The story is all but identical with the play called  Masks and Faces recently produced at the Haymarket Theatre and Known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of Mr Tom Taylor and Mr Charles Reade We spoke highly of the play on its appearanceand must speak highly now of the novel but really we are at a loss to know to whom and in what proportion this praise properly belongs Mr Reade whose name alone appears on the titlepage of the novel speaks nevertheless of Mr Tom Taylor as his friend and coadjutor to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale and pays him with a Dedication This seams to us something very like dedicating a maBs work to himself Or the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of Mr Reade Mr Taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what Garrick was pleased to call the  concoction of the piece and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the novel aa Golman and Garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in  The Clandestine Marriage Leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can we must tnrn to the book itself There has been of late  an amiable weakness in favour of one or two once wellknown actresses Mr Cunningham in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of Charles the Second gave an undue importance to Nell Gwyn and Mr Reade and Mr Taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to Peg Woffington Not much is known of either actressand Peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of Nelly Margaret Woffington was an Irish girl of great beauty who came from the Dublin stage and made her first appearance on the London boards in 1740the year before Garrick appeared at Goodman8 Fields She  took  at oncebut as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses there was a diversity of feeling about her Walpole speaks of her to Mann in 1741 as a had actress who was much in vogue adding  but she has life He would seem to have disliked her from the first but then he admired Kitty Clive for his friend General Conway writes to him in 1740 So you cannot bear Mrs Woffington  yet all the town is in love with her To say the truth I am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance for I think she is an impudent Irishfaced girl She was in short what Tate Wilkinson called her a wanton arch wagadmirably adapted for certain characters which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation She died unmarried in the year 17G0 Wore she was forty and was buried in Teddington Church on the banks of the Thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet Such was Peg Woffingtons story  and if the Wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to Fabers engraving of her as Mrs Ford  to Van Bleeks engraving of her as Phoebe in a hatand better still to MArdells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand If from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown Mrs Woffington let him go to Bowood and there he will see what the Woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter Hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject We remember the Bowood picture well There Pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face The picture is worthy of Rembrandt if Rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas The characters in this storyas in the play are Peg Woffington herselfa Mr Vane a Shropshire Squire having a young and lovely wife yet in love with Mrs Woffingtona Sir Charles Pomander a second edition of Lord Foppingtona poor poetpainter namedTriplet and his wifeColley CibberMr Quinand a few others The scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of Mrs Wofflngtons nature The heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  Mrs Woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender She played Sir Harry Wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that Garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   She was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare She was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him It certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile But she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside Margaret Woffingtons In person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure At one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another She was Juno Psyche Hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   Her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling She used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning From her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry Her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was Hogarths line itself She stood like Mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill She placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   This lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness About twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful Sir Charles Pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  This Sir Charles Pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it Mr Vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in Shropshire Sir Charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month His object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals Here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressMrs Oldfieldinto life  I saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her Indiana I have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer I have seen her then spring upon the stage as Lady Townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms She was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her The fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked Heaven for her if they thanked it for anything Colley Cibber is thus described This Cibber was the only actor since Shakespeares time who had both acted and written well Popes personal resentment misleads the reader of English poetry as to Cibbers real place among the wits of the day The mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral Pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and Cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day Ile also succeeded where Dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed He tampered successfully with Shakespeare Colley Cibbers version of Richard the Third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective It has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know Shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as Shakespeares  Richard are Cibbers Mr Cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own Lord Foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived He was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it Mr Vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many Woffingtons He fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart He asked Mr Cibber what he thought of Mrs Woffington The old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates Mdlle Dumesnil of the Theatre Francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress The next question was not so fortunate  Did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholeMr Cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   I have not only seen many equal many superior to her but I have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  The stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of Cibber  When I was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas They played Roxana and Statira in the Rival Queens Rival queenB of ait themselves they put out all their strength In the middle of the last act the town gave judgment ia favour of Statira What did Roxana Did she spill grease on Statiras robe as Peg Woffington would J or btab her as I believe Kitty here capable of doing  No Statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me Roxana bade tlie theatre farewell that night and wrote to Statira thusI give you word for word Madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour I shall never play second on a stage where I have been first so long but I shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than I who have felt its weight My wardrobe one of the best in Europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and I shall fancy I see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeAnd what did Statin answer Sir said Mr Vane eagerlyShe answered thus Madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that I vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here Madam I am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me I shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  Whatacouple of stiff old things said Mrs Clive Here is Vanes description of Mrs Woffington  He drew Pomander aside  What a simplicity there is in Mrs Woffington said Vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural They are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the May dew on it What you take for simplicity is her refined art replied Sir Charles No said Vane  I never saw a more innocent creature Pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive He was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her He was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by Cibber felling on Garrick whom Pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of Colley Cibbers day  I tell you cried the veteran that this Garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour His manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle This is his idea of a tragic scene A littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out Here Mr Cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  Give me another horse Well wheres the horse dont you see Im waiting for him Bind up my wounds Look sharp now with these wounds Have mercy Heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for Heaven Bustle bustle bustle The old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh A good scene in the novel as it was in the is that wherein Vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when Mrs Woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house Here is a portion of it  I beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen I hope you will forgive me It is six months since I saw him jo you understandI warrant me you did not look forme so soon ladies Some of us did not look for you at all Madam aid Mrs Woffington What Ernest did not tell you he expected meNo He told us this banquet was in honour of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife Vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  He intended to steal a march on us said Pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on Mrs Woffington  But Madam said Mr Quin the moment you did arrive I kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which I am sure you must be ready Pass her plate Not at present Mr Quin said Mr Vane hastily  She is about to retire and change her travelling dress Yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends Will you not introduce me to them firstNo no cried Vane in trepidation It is not usual to introduce in the beau monde We always introduce ourselvesrejoined Mrs Woffington and she rose slowly with her eye on Vane He cost a look of abject entreaty cm her but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye He closed his own eyes and waited for the blow Sir Charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion Mrs Woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while At length  The Honourable Mrs Quickly Madam said she indicating Mrs Clive This turn took them all by surprise Pomander bit his lip  Sir John Brute Falstaff cried Quin hang itSir John Brute Falstaff resumed Mrs Woffington We call him for brevity Brute Vane drew a long breath  Your neighbour is Lord Foppington a butterfly of some standing and a little goutySir Charles Pomander Oh cried Mrs Vane  It is the good gentleman who helped us out of the slough near Huntingdon Ernest if it had not been j for this gentleman I should not have had the pleasure of being here now And she beamed on the good Pomander Mr Vane did not rise and embrace Sir Charles  A more touching scene is that between Sir Charles Pomander and Mrs VaneSir Charles is in love with Mrs Vane  Now Sir Charles was naturally welcome to Mrs Vane for all 6he knew of him was that he bad helped her on the road to her husband Pomander  What Madam all alone here as in ShropshireMabel For the moment Sir Pomander  Force of habit A husband with a wife in Shropshire is so like a bachelorMabel SirPomander And our excellent Ernest is such a favouriteMabel No wonder SirPomander  Few can so pass from the larva state of

roomMabel  The green room  Where is that You mean kindly Sir but you make me unhappyPomander  The green room my dear Madam is the bower where houris put off their wings and goddesses become dowdies where Lady Macbeth weeps over her lapdog dead from repletion and Belvidere soothes her broken heart with a dozen of oysters in a word it is the place where actors and actresses become men and women and act their own parts with skill instead of a poets clumsilyMabel Actors actresses Does Mr Vane frequent suchPomander  He has earned in six months a reputation many a fine gentleman would give his ears for Not a scandalous journal his initials have not figured in not an actress of reputation gossip has not given him for a conquest How dare you say this to me cried Mrs Vane with a sudden flash of indignation and then the tears streamed over her lovely cheeks and even a Pomander might have forborne to torture her so but Sir Charles had no mercy  You would be sure to learn itsaid he and with malicious additions It is better to hear the truth from a friendA friend  He is no friend to a house who calumniates the husband to the wife Is it the part of a friend to distort dear Ernests kindliness and gaiety into ill morals to pervert his love of poetry and plays into an unworthy attachment to actors andoh  and the tears would come But she dried them for now she hated this man  with all the little power of hatred she had she detested him Do you suppose I did not know Mrs Woffington was to come to us today  cried she struggling passionately against her own fears and Sir Charless innuendoes What cried he you recognized her You detected the actress of all work under the airs of Lady Betty Modish Lady Betty Modish cried Mabel that good beautiful faceAh cried Sir Charles I see you did not Well Lady Betty was Mrs WoffingtonWhom my husband I know had invited here to present her with these verses which I shall take him for her and her poor little lip trembled  Had the visit been in any other character as you are so base so cruel as to insinuate what have I done to you that you kill me so you wicked gentleman  would he have chosen the day of my arrivalNot if he knew you were coming was the cool reply And he did knowI wrote to him Indeed  said Pomander fairly puzzled Mrs Vane caught sight of her handwriting on the tray and darted to it and seized her letter and mid triumphantly  My last letter written upon th roadsee Sir Charles took it with surprise but turning it in his hand a cool satirical smile came to his face He handed it back and said coldly  Read me the passage Madam on which you argue1 Poor Mrs Vane turned the letter in her hand and her eye became instantly glazed the seal was un broken She gave a sharp cry of agony like a wounded deer She saw Pomander no longer she was alone with her great anguish  I had but my husband and my God in the world cried she  My mother is gone My God have pity on me my husband does not love me There is a mistake in this book which the author will do well to amend in another edition The very clever scene in which Mrs Woffington imitates Mrs Bracegirdles acting and leads Cibber to believe that the real Bracegirdle is before himcould not have occurred we conceive as far as Cibber was concernedWhat Mrs Woffington who had never seen Mrs Bracegirdle act deceive by an imitation of that lady the best judge of acting  witness the famous Apology  that this country has yet seen  The thing is impossible for Cibber had acted in the same plays with her hundreds of times and had his eyes and his senses to the last Mr Vane might have been deceivedbut not Colley Cibber,biography

Puppets a WorkaDay Philosophy By GEORGE FORBES Macmillan and Co 3s 6d net IT is stated in the opening chapters that this book is  not a novel and although a dainty little love story shimmers now and again as it weaves its silken way the main threads of the garment as it were consist of what the author is pleased to call a workaday philosophy The puppets in question according to James Gordon the philosopher of the story are the human forms which each immortal soul on taking a share in the working of this world has to assumeThe intelligence shown by babies when interpreting their sensations so as to mean this world and the fact that they all arrive at the same scheme of a world prove that they have known all about the world before they were born We believe that some such idea as this was put forward by Miss Marie Corelli in her book  Boy the reason she gave for it being the faraway look so often to be read in a childs expression Be this as it may we cannot say that we are one with our author when he states that  as far as toothache goes I am sure that its terrors are largely due to imagination We wonder has he ever experienced the pain  It is strange also that with such a profound belief in the intercourse of a previous existence with the only one the majority of us know anything about he should not have any faith in telepathy Philosophical opinions however give place to ordinary events and the curtain is rung down at the end of the last chapter amid much rejoicing and the peal of weddingbells,juvenile

REVIEW OF CURRENT LITERATURE SYLVIAS LOVERS Three Vols Post Svo j Smith and Elder 1863 WHATEVER defects may be justly imputed to the present age the most prejudiced praiser of past time would hardly grudge to it the tribute of having excited in the minds of all classes a preeminent sense of the claims and interest in the fortunes of the poor We may be less full of enthusiasm than our fathers the rapid progress of luxury may have made us more selfindulgent than they the relaxa tion of authority may have made us less reverent but we have a sense of respon sibility in our dealings willi the poor as a body nnd consequently of interest in their condition which is altogether a new thing The world of Addison and Fielding and Pope is in this respect a different world It is not that uneducated people do not play a large part in the novels of Fielding for instanceperhaps larger than would be thc case in the same kind of novel at the present day But they are strictly accessories their ruggedness is only brought out to set off the polite life in subordination to which they are all arranged This is true to a considerable degree even of Sir Walter Scott and Miss Edgeworth who both be long unquestionably to the new age They linger over their sketches of the lower orders with a far more loving pencil than they bestow on the more elaborate portraits of their superiors in rankbut it is the latter after all which form the centre of j the picture That this rugged life can be an object large enough to engross the canvass to itself is the discover of our own day To us it appears that the reaction against eighteenth century gentility has been in some directions excessive and we should as much regret that all writers of fiction should draw their materials from clav hovels and crowded back lanes or even from farm houses and shops as we should that all educated women who arc without the re sources assigned to them in Popes hack neyed line should devote themselves to visiting the poor Still it cannot be denied that a fiction representing the life of uneducated people has certain advantages over one equally good in which the subjectmatter is different The aim of literature and especially of fiction ought to be the enlargement and elevation of sympathy the cultivation of a catholic interest in all nonmoral differences of character and life For this object it is well that we should be sometimes taken out of our own atmo spherethat we should look at the pro blem of life under those simpler aspects which it wears to those who are hemmed in on every side by its humbler necessities This is a very desirable result and the power of producing it is rare Few edu cated people really know the poor and still fewer can translate that knowledge into fiction When we say therefore that the novel here noticed is one of the very best of this kind we award it no slight praise It will somewhat unfortunately we think remind most readers of Mrs Gaskells only rival in this field but though we cannot think it bears any approach to the rich and vigorous colouring of the author of  Adam Bede in the outline of an interesting plot which we have thc selfdenial to refrain from extracting the superiority lies with it  Sylvias Lovers although we look upon it as a better novel than Marv Barton will not for several reasons share thc popularity of its predecessor Some of these reasons might be reckoned by many among its merits Those who re member the state of feeling with regard to the relations of labour and capital fifteen years ago will not doubt that some part of thc very lively interest excited by tho novel of Manchester life was due to its entanglement with a complex problem of thc day But critics who believe all adventitious interest of this kind to be as dangerous to the effect of art as a CT stripe of bright colour running across a beautiful pattern who doubt whether problems of this kind are a good field for the powers of womennay who feel quite certain that novels are not a good occasion for discussing such will find with un mixed satisfaction that Mrs GaskelFs last novel opens no issues of this nature Our attention to an interesting and pathetic story is not carried out of the picture as it were by any introduction of an element foreign to art Mrs Gaskells last novel is moreover very superior to her first in the absolute exclusion of all gentility She keeps on her own peculiar ground from the beginning of the book to the end and those feebler touches which her vigorous style iii dealing with favourable material brought out so forciblv in her earlier novels are  thereby avoided The quality of the novel  which will we imagine most detract from its general popularity is its exceeding  painfulness This in itself is neither good j nor bada tragedy cannot bc too tragic j But wc do not find all that in a verv pain  ful story we unconsciously demand Thack j cray had a good right to give us a novel  without a hero but a novelist who takes  us into the dark recesses which onlv a few  human beings are called upon to tread j owes us the compensation of a central j image of large and lofty proportions ex j celling not necessarily in virtue but in j energy in elevation in strengthowes us  in short the relief of poetry as it is denned j in the noble words of Bacon The use j of this feigned histoiy hath been to give  some shadow of satisfaction to the mind in j those points wherein the nature of things j doth deny it    A more  ample greatness a more exact goodness  and a more absolute variety than is to be foundin the nature of things he con j eludes but wc would alter it to  the j nature of man Here our author fails She does indeed j leave a large space for her central figure and spend much pains in the elaboration of his portrait but the conception is feeble and the execution indistinct Philip Hep burn is Sylvias lover and nothing more Take from him the love which leads him into the basest perfidy and which there fore eminently needs the background of a rich and glowing character and he becomes a mere blank while his wife is drawn with so much force and soliditv that the extreme flatness of his portrait tells like a false note We cannot help comparing him with Adam Bede and the difference of the two im pressions of character is thc differencebetween a name written on loose sand and one engraved on a gem Thc dashing young sailor whose gallantry wins him a cap taincy is a stock novel character it is true but the superior crispness and de cision of execution so far compensates for the commonplace ideal that we timi our selves regretting at every turn that he instead of his uncouth and yet insipid rival does not occupy the place of honour in the story This is the capital flaw in tlie book and it is to our thinking something more than an artistic flaw Hepburn is so evi dently intended to interest us on the moral side of his character that the absence of any remorse for his treachery apart from the fear of and regret for its consequences strikes us somewhat painfully And though the occasion demands the exclusion of ali bitter feeling we yet are somewhat revolted when his wife repenting of what seems to us her righteous indigna tion against him laments him with the words  Oh Philip my Philip tender and true f Mrs Gaskell is too much inclined to confuse the sharp line whieh divides those temptations whieh are and are not possible to a character she intends to retain its hold on our respect Nevertheless the story has a noble moral put in the mouth of the dying Philip Child he said I ha made thee my idol and if I could live my life oer again  I would love my God more and thee less and then I shouldnt have sinned this sin against thee This is the keynote of the book but to give it full effect the character j of Philip should have been altogether dif ferent Miltons division  He for God i  only she for God in him might be owing  to a low conception of the womans ideal  but to sacrifice honour and dutv for one I beloved object is the womans temptation 1 and the character which is to vield to it j and vet retain our svmpathv should retain  the attraction of a somewhat feminine  grace This the uncouth shopman is entirelv and desijmedlv without and loses i therebv as much in an artistic as in a mond j point ef view We have dwelt too long on the one great 1 want of a storv whose excellence forces us i to try it by a very high standard to do j more than indicate very slightly either its  few remaining defects or its many lesser merits Our favourite passages are those fresh country scenes where we seem to  breathe the pure dewy air of the Georgies though there are not wanting passages of great vigour as for instance the description of the lire  which will excite more general admiration We cannot reckon the scene at the storming of St Jean dAcre among these but it is the only too ambitious passage in thc book We regret this failure the more as the author might easily have spared us this journey to Palestine and back by merely giving a letter actually tjuoted When we have added that thc first half of the first volume is very de cidedly inferior to the rest and that there is a superficial resemblance to George Eliots Hetty in the heroine which is quite lost sight of as we advance we havo noticed almost everything we regret in a book the merits of which could not be exhausted in a much longer space Rumour assigns a vcr similar plot as a subject for the labours of the laureate We can hardly expect even from him a more pathetic rendering of it The delineation of in dividual character is not the forte of our author but she has wisely chosen a subject in which her almost unequalled power of painting the character of a class and those deeper emotions which bring out not what is individual but what is universal has enabled her to give us a fiction which will take its place above the high watermark of the fashion or caprice of the daySlhins Tjorors By Mrs Haskell Author of The Life of Charlotte Bronte  Mary Barton c In Three Volumes Smith Elder and Co Second Notice Monkshaven is a little seaport town upon the coast of Yorkshire depending for all its prosperity upon the whale fishery It has two busy seasons one in spring when the whalers are sent out and another in autumn when they return In Monkshaven and upon the adjacent coasts and moors especially at an outlying farm of llaytersbank where at thc beginning of the story Sylvia lives thc one pretty spoilt child of her parents nearly the whole action occurs Thc characters are Sylvia a rustic beauty jher simple easy father Daniel Robson proud of his small brains once a whalefisher who when impressed had as be likes to tell his friends chopped off thumb and forefinger to escape the Kings service then a smuggler next a farmer at Haytersbank At Haytersbank we find him with the child of his heart Sylvia a faithful farm servant Rester and a staid good wife Bella who is full of household loves and household cares She dotes not less than her man on the pretty generous impulsive loving maid but she is by nature more reserved As Sylvia tells her young neighbour Molly Corney when we first see the two girls as they are tripping to market with butter and eggs  Feythers liker  me and we talk a deal o rubble but mothers words  are liker to hewn stono She puts a deal of meaning in  them Bella Robson quietly hopes that time will bring together Sylvia her daughter and Philip Hepburn her nephew as man and wife Fhilip is but an assistant at the chief shop in Monkshaven for drapery and general stores kept by the kindly quakers John and Jeremiah Foster he had entered the shop as an errand boy but has by honest patient industry and a good mother wit risen to confidence and respect He has taught himself some book learning with which and with all that he does he is a little pedantic and formal He carries an old head on young shoulders has a dry manner a long sallow face  only bright honest eyes to recommend him to the eyesight of a girl but his unflinching patient life of duty faithfully performed has made him a hero in the eyes of the yet more quiet Hester Rose Hester serves with Philip in the shop and lives in one household with him for he and the other shop assistant William Coulson lodge with her mother Alice Rose Alice is a devout and careworn woman who with a mothers eye has seen her girls closely enshrined secret as Philip to the end of his life never does Coulson would marry Hester if she would Why will she not  asks Philip at his friend Coulsons request but he is none the wiser for Alices wrath and her dismissal of him as  one too blind to see through a win dow Throughout the tale Hester loves suffers and serves In his unconscious adoption of the relation of brother and sister and his sense that Hester never will refuse to do a kind act Philip tries her heart to the utmost but she conquers every rebellious pang Philips whole soul is set upon his cousin Sylvia She is his idol and he loves her with a strength and constancy that has its reward from her only in the hour of death And yet he marries her But Sylvia has another lover When we first meet her on her way to market she is rejoiced at the commission to buy herself duffel for a cloak Her mother has suggested that it should be grey  I wish she said  mother hadnt spoken up for t grey and after all since it must be bought at Fosters shop and Philip is there and Philip advises her against scarlet she wilfully pleases her own fancy and buys the scarlet Philip himself with his long dry face his formal manner and his strong enduring love is as the grey duffel that does not please the maidens fancy The scarlet is Charley Kinraid a gay  speck sioneer who first appears before her as the wounded hero of a battle with the pressgang and who is bright in manly youth and beauty with the gay kindly manner of a light o love who can win womans hearts and break them without meaning harm He wins Sylvia and is won by her but how should Philip know that he is won or that he is worth winning  He has trifled with and deserted Coulsons sister who is dead of grief That Philip knows When Philip has seen him kidnapped by a chance crew from a passing manofwar while on his way to join his whalevessel with Sylvias love tokena ribbon Philip had given herin his hat and has been charged by him to carry word to her that Charley Kinraid will remember her and will come back subtle and sore is the temptation to keep silence Halting at the next roadside inn for he is on his way to London honoured with a trust by the Fosters and will be away a month Philip means to write what he has seen but he hears sailors who know Kiuruid talking of him and celebrating his gay conquests among the girls Ay there was Coulsons sister too and Sylvias mother had bidden Philip keep harm from her girl Was not Kinraid too fickle to be true to Sylvia even if he lived through the war and did return  Philip would say nothing till he returned to Monkshaven And when he did return Kinralds hat had been found on the water no pressing had been seen in the neighbourhood and all thought Kinraid dead Was it not better thought Philip that a man like Kinraid should thus die out of Sylvias Hie and leave open for her thc way to his own great deep j earnest love The message was not delivered  Thc pressgang came afterwards again into those parts  At Shields it was riotously fought against and for a time j beaten by the people At Monkshaven thc ablebodied sailors I of the returned whaling vessels were lured to the market  place one night bv the ringing of the fire bell and sur rounded by the armed gang Farmer Robson who was then in the town suggested rescue to halfadozen ready old salts who stood with bim in a court the rescue was planned and effected In the heat of triumph old Robson further suggested that thc fire bell should not have been rung for nothing and straightway fire was set to tho old inn that hud been used by thc pressgang for headquarters and in which thc rescued men had been imprisoned Very proud was Daniel Bobson of thc head he had shown in setting all this work afoot and he went homo smoky bruised und tired to be honoured for his deed even by his good and prudent wife to have thc warming pan taken down for his special comfort and when he was got with aching bones between the warm sheets he thanked Sylvia and her mother in a sleepy voice adding Its a vast o comfort to think on yon poor lads as is sleeping in  their own homes this night and then slumber fell upon him and he was hardly roused by Bells softly kissing his weatherbeaten cheek and saying low  God bless thee  my man Thou was allays for them that was down and  put upon1 But the burning of the inn was hanging matter in those days and honest Daniel was hanged for it Mrs Gaskell doea not describe either the trial or the execution After Daniel Robson has been carried to the county jail we hear only of the home from which he has been wrenched of the love that yearns to him and labours for him A single fine touch indicates the completion of the tragedy behind the scenes And in those days who so firm so true so gentle as Philip so sure a support to the widow who gropes for her lost husband through a darkened mind so true in love to Sylvia Philip and Coulson have been made by the kindly Fosters their successors in the shop Haytersbank must be given up Philip and Sylvia are married and the widow is their common care But Philips conscience is mindful of the undelivered message and it tortures him to see that Sylvia gives him wifely service and friendship while even after their child is born her heart yearns still towards her old idol Charley Kinraid And a day comes when Kinraid does return preternaturally faithful His reappearance handsome goodnatured and for once not careless severs Sylvia and Philip He himself goes away disappointed in a few months marries a rich and pretty cousin and is perfectly hippy and goodnatured as before But Philips life becomes a tragedy Before he dies Sylvia has seen KinraidY happy wife has learnt that on a distant battlefield the banished Philip who had enlisted ns a common soldier saved Kinraids life She has outlived her girlish illusion for the gay  specksioncer when she weeps by the deathbed of the grave longfaced shopkeeper who had proved himself the better hero although the less brilliant and the nobler lover though his love had stooped to one unhappy breach of a trust thrust on him against his will The end of the book is like the burden of some truehearted old ballad tale and in its whole substance there is not only the refinement of plot that contrasts so forcibly with the coarse fiction now in request but also a charm of style and a poetical conception of detail that leaves the reader when he closes the book with such memories as might be carried from a gallery of choice cabinet pictures But in a former notice we have expressed our sense of the general character of this welcome addition to the sterling literature of our day Now therefore we will leave the book to be read by all who desire better entertainment than is to be found in the bad grammar of Mrs Henry Wood and the coarse kitchen literature of Miss Braddon The graceful and shrewd humour of Mrs Gaskells Cranford lives again in the first half of Sylvias Lovers The character painting is throughout exquisite and the picture of trouble at Haytersbank consequent upon Daniel Robsons fatal arrest has been equalled in pathos only occasionally by the best masters of fiction How cleverly Mrs Gaskell manages the dialect she has here given to her humble characters we must be content to show by taking a group or two from a picture of a Yorkshire farmhouse festival Bessy a daughter of the house has fetched her married sister Molly who is well settled in Newcastle and affects matronly townbred airs to see the supper tbat has been laid out Bessy was full of admiration There Molly 1 aaid she Yo never saw more vittle brought together i Newcassel Ill be bound

 Sylvia Lovers By Mrs Gaakell Author of  Tho Life J of Charlotte Bronte1  Mary Barton Ac Volumes Smith Elder and Co In Three This is a novel to read slowly as one reads a poem Its plot is of such a tale as Crabbe might have chosen for his verse and although written in prose it deals among simple and unfashionable people with the truest poetry of life in thought feeling and action Every incident hi alive with subtle tooohea of humour or pathos and in ita harmony of colouring the skilful grouping of ito characters and the quiok sense of life and nature shown in ita minutest detail stands before the reader as a picture by a sterling artist Mrs Gaskell has never written with mon care than in this novel The Yorkshire dialect of nearly all the dialogues is so skilfully managed that without being a stumblingblock to any reader it gives the charm of a Doric simplicity to the whole idyll The shrewd character painting the incessant blending of the sights and sounds of nature with the action of tip story the spirit of kindly human fellowship and the high sense of human duty belong to the unaffected English of the narrative itself rich in fresh thought and true refinement of expression Were the story of the book poor it would be commended by the manner of the telling In its whola texture Sylvia Lovers is as lawn to sackcloth compared with the coarse  sensa tion  tales of late forced irtfjMlion which produce a striking plot as one might jfroTOe a striking pattern by daubs with a tar brush on the millers sacking In story as in style the oontrast is complete In Sylvia Lovers though strong interest is excited and none who have tears for an imagined grief will pass with dry eyes through the closing chapters either of the second or of the third volume there is no bigamist no murderer no villain at all There are the shortcomings of human weakness common to us all the lesser conflicts of character wherein no small part of all human life consists but there is not a person in the book of either sex who does not accredit the sound doctrine at which they who live healthily must needs arrive in their mature years although ito evidences are not clear to youth that men and women are good fellows in the main The true artist shrinks from nothing so much as the mere dull reproduction of deformity Crime of course must be always a common element in tragic narrative but then it must be introduced not for its own sake but as an active power through which souls are tried and the great depths of mans nature may be stirred A great crime establishes among a group of surrounding persons strong exceptional conditions of life exceptional because it is below the common nature of men to be greatly criminal The true poet novelist or dramatist uses the crime not as a condition interesting in itself but as productive of conditions under which the spirit of man shows in its strong emotion forces that would in repose not be apparent The objection against such books as 4 Lady Audleys Secret apart from the fact that they show only the coarsest sense of literature in their writing is not that they are tales of crime but that they are illwritten talcs of sordid crime of crimes meanly committed for poor sneaking ends and dilated upon for their own sake as interesting matters of concealment and detection Writers of such books would make a  sensation novel of  Goneril out of the play of  King Lear add Regans share of cruelty to Gonerils cut out Cordelia reduce Lear to a  softy and make him creep nnder his daughters bed with a lighted chambercandle All the stir of emotion that can be produced by a great crime Mrs Gaskell has obtained in Sylvia Lovers without the production of a criminal There is great iniquity but it is the iniquity of an abstraction relentless powerful impalpable as the Fate of a Greek tragedy iniquity of Law mainly in the activity of the pressgang among the seafaring men of coast towns during the war with France at the close of the last century and subordinately in the undue severity of penal law at the same date We are reminded that there was no deliberate wickedness in the motives that maintained at that time in great vigour the system of impressment and that backed it with the strong arm of the law Those persons concerned in execution of the law who appear in the tale are represented only as men with the same kindly sympathies as their neighbours But the evil Law is the dread shadowy Fate against which hearts beat and souls chafe in vain Today we only express an opinion of this tale but we shall return to it and justify it fullyREVIEWS OF BOOKS SYLVIAS LOVERS Tie success of Adan Bede and its successors attestcd the oSs1bility of a delineation of peasant life sutfficiently humorous and athetic to stimulate the inquisitiveness and enlist the symiptthies of a fastidious highly educated and hlasl  audience The frwiio prettiness of Hetty the saintship of the interesting Diah th1e ententious comicality of Mrs Poyserall were too striking in ttheir way to fade easily front the minld and from that time to this the dispensers of fictitious literature have favoured us With a suecession of  cottage interiors  as inuilite if not as spirited a those of the Dutch School of Painting Mrs Gaskell has miiany qualitications for success in this line of art She s Chasc 11o11nd of a vernacular which is piquant picturesque and sometimes toucliillul Her north country talk if not invariably well sustained and sometimes a little theatrical is at any rate sufficiently good for the general public  she has a quick eye for the effective points in Scenic grouping and there is a geniiuine touch of pathos about those parts of her writIngs in wlhich she is herself sincerely interested Moreover she seems to have studied Yorkshire and Lancashire life to good effect and sonic of the characters introluced into her latest story such for instance as that of Kester a srt of half farm servant half confidential friend are suffilciently removed from the conventional types of modern life to attract us by their curious originality And yet the efiect0 of the whole story is to disappoint those who remember the g low with which they followed Mrs Gaskells earlier romances to their novuewent and the firstrate artistic ability displayel in the compilation of such a biography as that of Charlotte Ilronte For one thing  Sylvias Lovers  is eminently an  unsatisfactory novel The goodnatured inclination to make everything Co righlt in the long run and to believe that this is after all the best of all possible worlds is absolutely set at naught The book is full of gratuitous suffering nor does the conclusion leave us any reason to fancy that when the dark cloud of tragedy has drawn off the mournful landscape will be in any material respect altered for the better The chief incidents upon which the tale turns are as old as the history of storytelling A serious sentimental youth falls desperately in love with a flighty girl who after leading him for some time along the stony path of adverse courtship proceeds herself at last to fall desperately in love with a roving rmarine Don Juan whose personal charms and audacious behaviour make him secure of feminine conquests wherever he conies Upon this primitive foundation the whole superstructure of the tale is raised and as the scene lies at the close of the last century the authoress has the opportunity of interweaving sone capital pressgang stories and the execution of a man for riot which are the real backbone of the book Novelists who wish to be effective always stand in need of a grievance and the political position of England at this period of her history involved many grievances of the most serious description No more tyrannical interference with the liberties of the subject has probably ever been attempted than the 1 arbitrary impressment of sailors for the royal service and nothing but the desperate struggle in which England was engaged couldbe i held to justify a measure which hurt niutch and terrified even more than it hurt That it often resulted in intolerable hardshipthat it entailed dreadful sufferingsthat it roused a furious spirit of discontent and disloyalty among the classes whom it principally affectedmight be conceived without the aid of Mrs Gaskelis vivid delinieiation but in no part of the story are her powers so thoroufhly aroused as when she describes the several seizures of the Monkhaven fishermen the fights which resulted therefrom and the miserable doom to which through their instrumentality a simple wellmeaning old man was brought It is in resisting one of the raids of the pressganc that Kincaid the hero of the piece first makes his appearance and nothing can be better than the description of the sort of charm which the prestige of personal bravery and a desperate wound received in opposing a supposed outralre invested him in the eyes of an impressible passionate and enthusiastic girl A nation stirred to its depths by a worldwide struggle dazzled by great military achievements fretted by oppressive laws is far better material for the novelists purposes than the uninteresting prosperity which in modern times drives the framers of fiction into the invention of imaginary grievances and chequers their pages with tragical catastrophes too wildly impossible even for the most willing and eager credulity Real life then is full of re,
REVIIWS OF BOOKs OUR MUTUAL FRIEN MR DICKENS has now been so long before the public and his name is associated with so many triumphs some of which were achieved before the present generation of young men and women was born that he has already obtained the position of a classic and we judge him by the standard of names consecrated by time He has exhibited a degree of productiveness rarely seen except in combination with a marked and melancholy falling off from the freshness and power of early manhood The collected editions of his works now spread over many volumes the characters he has invented would almost people a town and we might well excuse an author who has done so much if we found in him some slackening of the creative force which has been at work for such a length of time But Mr Dickens stands in need of no allowance on the sooe of having outwritten himselfL His fancy his pathos his hmour his wonderful powers of observation his picturesqueness and his versatility are as remarkable now as they were twenty yea ago In some respects they are seen to still greater advantage The energy of youth yet remains but it is united with the deeper insight of maturer years Not that we mean to say Mr Dickenshas outgrown his faults They are as obvious as eversometimes even trying our patience rather hard A certain extr vagnce in particular scenes and personsa tendency to caricature and grotesquenessand a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic as if the author had been considering how the thiqwroulld  tell  on the stageare to be found in  Our Mutual Fried as in all this great novelists productions But when a writer of genius has fully settled his style and maintained it through a core of many yerswhen his mind has pused beyond the period of pliability and growth and ca only deepen without essenthlly angingit is the merest vanity on the part of a critic to dwdl at any great length on general faults of manner There they are mA there they will remamy ws hat we will The tender rind wein they were cut in youth has become hard bark ong ice and the incisions are fixed for ever To rail at them is simple wa of time besides implying a great deal of iatitude on the part of the railer We shall therefore make but br allsi here to th characters of Wegg and Venus who appeartous in he high degree unnaturalthe one being a mere phantasm and the other a nonentityand shall pass on to a c eran of the ore solidprts of the book in which Mr Dickenss old mastery over huma nature is once more made splendidly apparent 1s n its authors previous

characters TheInd explanation is a disappointment The whole plot in which the deceased Harmon Boffin Wegg and John Rokeemith are concerned is wild and fantastic wanting in reality and leading to a degree of confusion which is not compensated by any additional interest in the story Mr Dickens seems to be aware that his tale is liable to this objection for in the very interesting  Postscript in Lieu of Preface which he has appended to the second volume he says There is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction what are the commonest e eriences in fact Therefore I note here though it may not be at al necessay that there are hundreds of Will Cases as they are called far more remarkable than that fancied in this book and that the stores of the Prerogative Office teem with instances of testators who have made changed contradicted hidden forgotten left cancelled and leftuncancelled each many more wills than were ever made by the elder Mr Harmon of Harmony Jail We do notfor a moment doubt that this is the fact and it is not to the terms of Mr Harmons will that we object but to the circumstances flowing from that source That the son John Harmon known through the greater part of the book as John Rokesmith should come baok to gland under the circunstances related should disappear as related should live for montbs at the house of his childhoods friends the Boffins without being discovered and should then be suddenly found out without any sucint explanation that Mr Boffin should get entangled with a man Ie Wegg  that

hear me coming out a rglar brown one Mr Boffins designation for a bear  Couldnt abear to make believe as I meant it In consequence of which we was everlastingly in danger with her We venture to think that most readers will feel that the story loses in verisimilitude and interest by such a mode of winding it up The termination of Mr Dickenss novels is often hurried and such is the case in the present instance The complication of events does not work itself clear by a slow and natural process but is so to speak roughly ton open And even before we are half through the book the mystery concerning John Rokesmith is explained in an equally objectionable manner Young Rokesmith or Harmon tells himself his own previous history in a sort of mental soliloquy in which a long series of events is minutely narrated evidently for no other purpose than to inform the reader It is surprising that so experienced a romancewriter as Mr Dickens could not have devised some more artful means of revealing that portion of his design Yet notwithstanding these defects which we have pointed out with the greater freedom because such a writer demands the utmost candour from his critic the story of  Our Mutual Friend is interesting for its own sake even apart from its treatment which we need not say is that of a master if we except these points already objected to We repeat what we said at the commencementthat in conception and evolution of character and in power of writing this latest work of the pen that has so often delighted and astonished us shows not the slightest symptom of exhaustion or decline Perhaps the most admirable of the dramatis personw considered on artistic grounds are Eugene Wrayburn Lizzie Hexam Bradley Headstone and Bella Wilfer The first of these characters is a consummate representation of a nature originally noble degenerating under the effects of a bad education and of subsequent idleness into a laughing indifference to all things worthyinto a gay and sportive disbelief in itself in manhood in womanhood and in the world From first to last the conception is wonderfully developed and the change that is afterwards wrought in Eugenes disposition is worked out without the smallest violence In strong contrast with the goodnatured levity of Wrayburn is the stern selfcontained narrow yet within its contracted and mechanical limits earnest nature of Bradley Headstone the selfeducated schoolmaster Liue Hexam is the cause of bringing these two men into dangerous contact She is the daughter of a man who drags the river for anything he can getdead bodies among the restand who is sometimes suspected of having more to do with the dead bodies than he would like to confess The girl  however is a fine sensitive being handsome and of a deep tender nature and when Eugene Wrayburn sees her after the death of her father on the rver he takes an interest in her fate and has her educated His interest deepens into love yet he cannot brine himself to make an honest offer of marriage to one who comes of such humble and even questionable parentage Bradley Headstone also is in love with Lizzie and the way in which his impassive artificiallyrestrained nature breaks up into raging fury under the combined influences of hopeless love jealousy and some pungent taunts which Wrayburn gaily flings at him is exhibited by Mr Dickens with marvellous power and truthfulness The transformation of this pattern of all the decencies into a dark haggard selftormenting evil genius per tually dogging the steps of Eugene Wrayburn and at length making a murderous attack on hi in a lonely place up the river is one of the finest things in fiction Bradley Headstone is a psychological study of the deepest interest and we are peruaded of the profoundest truth Natures like his originally cold and still further repressed by the routine of a dry and formal education are no doubt especially liable to outbreaks of ungovernable passion when some great emotion at length sweeps away the old habits of selfcontroL Mr Dickens has traced this with a sinjularly close and analytical eye and nothing can be more tragic and impressive than the culmination of Bradley Headstones wrath in the attempted murder of Eugene All the preparations for that at and all the acoessories in the way of scenery and atmospherical conditions are managed in Mr Dickenss highest style and the mental state of a man about to commit the greatest of crimes has seldom been depicted with such elaboration and apparent truthfulness We are prepared to hear from a certain class of critics who can tolerate nothing beyond the civilities of everyday life and who seem to think that great passions are among those vulgar mistake of nature to which novelists should be superior that this carcter is sensational  but the genius that could conceive it has Dothilg to fear from such objectors Very touching and beautifsl the character of Lizzie Hexam but probably the greatest favourite in the book will beor rather is alreadyBella wilfer She is evidently a pet of the authors and she will long r m the darling of half the households of England and America Pererse petulant wil wrongheaded not a little inclined at first to be selfish and aneyloving she is yet a bewitching little creare and it is no surprise to find that in the end all the good in her impulsive nature bursts into efflorescence beneath the sunshine of a happy love Of the less important characters of the book it is impossible to speak they are so numerous but reference shoeld be made to the lathetic sketch of Betty Higden and 1ittle Johnny her gre andchild That the poor old creatures pod defince of workhouse charity is true to a large number of ourm glialower clam is but too certain from cases with which we are all familiar and the sketch is more especially interesting as having drawn from Mr Dickens in the final words from which we have already quoted a declaration of his views on the present administration of the Poor Laws  In my social experiences since Mrs Betty Higden came upon the scene and left it I have found Circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the Poor Law My friend M1r Bounderby could never see any differenoe between leaving the Coketown hands exactly as they were and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons Idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance and I have been called upon to admit that I would give Poor Law relief to anybody anywhere anyhow Patting this nonsense aside I have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties the ote contending that there are no deserving poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather to the mercies of some relieving officers and some Union houses the other admitting that there are such pcor but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do The records in our newspapers the late exposure by the Lancet and the common sense and senses of common people furnish too abundant evidence against both defences But that my view of the Poor Law may not be amk or misrepresented I will state it I believe there has been in England since the days of the Stuarts no law so often infimously administered no law so often openly violated no law habitually so ill supervised In the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution that shock the public and disgrace the country the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanityand known language could say no more of their lawlessnes We must also instance among the creations of this book the little deformed dolls dressmaker fantastic and semipoetical yet with a deep instinct of truth her drunken fathera sketch in which tragedy and comedy are mingled in a way wherein Mr Dickens is quite unrivalled Bellas father a beautiful specimen of a truly loveable nature the Podsnaps and Veneerings and the crew of rapscallions and adventurers male and female by whom they are surroundedportraits admirable for the social satire they embody Rogue Riderhood and some of the other hangerson about the river We might almost mention the river itself as a character It plays a most important part in the story and always with great picturesqueness We cannot refain ere we conclude from referring once more to the Postscript for the sake of its allusion to an event in whidh at the time we were all deeply interested On Friday the 9th of June in the present year Mr and Do Boffin in their manuscript dress of receiving Mr ad Ms at breakfast were on the SouthEastern Railway with in a terribly destructive accident When I had done what I sol4itp others I climbed back into

wedding day andMr Riderhood inspecting Bradley Headstones red neckerchief an be lay asleep I remember with devout thankfulness that I can never be much nearer parting company with my readers for ever than I me then until there shall be written against my life the two words withwhich I have this day closed this bookTHz END In that  devout thankfulness  the whole Englishspea g will share We cannot afford to lose such a writer as Mr Dik A man of original creative genius dying in the fulnes of bis strength leaves a gap which nothing can fill and a regt which the memory of his past triumphs only deepens and embitterOur Mutual Friend By Charles Dickens With Illustrations by Marcus Stone 2 vols Chapman  Hall A new novel by the greatest novelist living is not to be dismissed with a few jaunty phrases of rapture or of qualification for a simple yet serious reason Those who with understanding as distinct from that wonderment which belongs to the foolish face of praise have followed Mr Dickens throughout his career of authorship cannot fail to have perceived that time and success have not made him carelesswhether as concerns his art his public or himself As little have they spoilt or dimmed or turned aside his quick sympathies his power of minute observation his keen desire to advocate what he deems right his wondrous force of hand and colour as a painter in words Every true and conscientious man becomes increasingly solicitous on these points with time and success The boy may dash off a brilliant sketch as a matter of course the ripe artist will ponder over his coming picture But may he not ponder too long and oversolicitously  This question we fancy may be asked with respect to  Our Mutual Friend Only the other day ita author gave us that French story of Little Bebelle one of the most exquisite pieces of pathos in fiction the value of which will be best tested by comparing it with Sternes Shandyisms Only yesterday out of a dingy street in the Strand from no more promising place than a lodginghouse the artist by a touch brought to light a homely loving fellowcreature worthy to  sit above the salt among the best of the best Mrs Lirriperas real  a being of the mind  as Mr Pickwick as Mrs Gamp as the Micaivbersas any of the long line of living creatures called up by the novelist whom we know intimately in all their strength and weakness and whose deeds and sayings have passed into household words If therefore we say that during its course of fragmentary publication  Our Mutual Friend has raised more question than certain of its predecessors the circumstance arises from the nature of the story and not because the fountain of variety shows signs of exhaustion None of the series is so intricate in plot as this tale It would be wasted labour to detail or analyze a chain of events which every one has already handled Enough to state our conviction that the closest attention is required to hold certain of its connecting links From the first number it was evident to us that the murdered John Harmon was not murdered but had set himself down in the household of the wife allotted to him by a fantastic will for the purpose of testing her real nature The circumstances of the deed which led to his shipmate Radfoot being mistaken for and murdered with himself are mistily revealed in the long soliloquy during which he determines on the renunciation of his identity Some incompleteness referable to partial recollection may have been an intentional stroke of art on the novelists partmay belong to the nature of the catastrophe but it produces an impression of uncertainty Then again the complications of the story may have necessitated sharp turns and surprises which bear unfavourably on some of the characters We fancy the conversion of Bella Wilfer the capricious beauty longing for wealth and emancipation from her portentous mother and shrewish sister to be somewhat too suddeneven though it did grow out of her dismal experience of the simulated avarice overgrowing Mr Boffin This avarice again however adroitly devised and minutely wrought out as a piece of masquerade leading to a final surprise for which no one can have been prepared has of necessity implied the introduction of some elements discordant with those of the character so forcibly conceived and broadly sketched The honest truthful Boffin of the Mounds whose simple rightmindedness virtually overruled his wretched old misermaster who had the fortune to leave might have been led by his desire to right what was wrong and to regenerate what was defective to connive in the scheme of amending the coquetries of Bella the oddlydesignated bride ofthe great fortune but his inability to carry such a longdrawn piece of subtle comedy through we beg respectfully to our great novel ist to question And we are satisfied that bo greathearted a man should not on any excuse of plot or plan whatsoever or any desire to lead on a miserable knave to the full display of his greed and knavery have been submitted to the degradation of the scene with Wegg after the discovery of old Harmons second mil in the house of the anatomical curiositymonger That which belongs and befits a detective policeman apt at disguises as Mr Bucket of nevertobeforgotten memory sits ill on an honest ignorant affectionate creature such as he is And though we love Mrs Boffin the comfortable and instinctivelydelicate woman one of Mr Dickenss most genial creations with all our hearts we cannot but feel as if we owed her a grudge for her connivance Truth and nature are here strained in subservience to the requirements of literary art We fancy that the necessity of conducting an unusually large crowd of characters through a maze of unusual intricacy has told on other of the personages of the story Harmon its hero is by his position betwixt light and dark inevitably partially effaced Bella the coquetish daughter of Mrs Wilfer the stupendous is capitally touched in the cameleon hues of her character and royally righted at last but during a large part of the tale she keeps us in a state of perpetual uneasiness hardly justifying the love she is described as inspiring Then Lizzie Hexam though not precisely a sketch has not substance enough for the place she is expected to fill in the readers interest Lastly we cannot conceive the possibility of a man so holy humble affectionate and beneficent as Riah the Hebrew on any grounds of compact obligation or sophistry lending himself one hour after it was known to the hypocritical wickedness of such a tyrant as Fledgeby the usurer the meanest creature this is saying much as yet created by the hand that painted the moneylenders in  Nickleby and Brats and Kroolc and Fagin and Uriah Heep The explanation made by him at last to the little weird dolls dressmaker shows us that Mr Dickens has felt the necessity of some explanation which is insufficient to convince us We cannot but be reminded by it of an awkwardness somewhat similar in Miss Edgeworths  Ormonda tale expressly undertaken by her in atonement for what had been represented to her as too wholesale a depreciation of a people against whom  every man has his hand Thus much by way of qualificationor call it speculation ratherconcerning a novel which gains immensely by being perused without stop let or hindrance On returning to the characters that of Bradley Headstone the schoolmaster dogged sensual unreadyhis tremendous passions compressed by the responsibilities and respectabilities of his position takes the foremost place among them as an original conception Frightfully though he suffers even though when he confronts Wrayburn his pococurante rival there is a show of reason and of championship on his side there is no possibility of any ones feeling a moments pity on his behalf so utterly is the masterdesire of his life rendered unlovable by the forms in which it is clad There have been many murders and many pictures of remorse in novelsand none more powerful than the pages in which we were shown the wanderings of Bill Sykes and the slinking home of Jonas Chuzdewit after his bloody deed in the wood but Mr Dickens has exceeded even those in the scene where the wretched criminal tortured by the rebuking consciousness of his having failed in his diabolical design is dogged and dragged back to the fatal spot by his nideous confidant Nothing can be mon masterly as a display of blank inevitable retri j bution and wretchedness Redeeming touch  there is none about Bradley Headstone  even j the concealed love for him of the softhearted I prim little schoolmistress delicately indicated as it ia fails to furnish it To change the fancythe author of  Pickwick never revelled among richer whimsies than are to be found in the comic parts of this talein the Veneering household and the guests assembled by it The mistress of the man  sion and of the camels on the dinnertable with her readiness to weep her

they say on the stage Boots and Brewerare all new people in print whom every dinerout has met every  week of his life in private The vivacity and  variety of this division of the novel are admirable But when talking of dinners in Our Mutual Friend we nuit not forget the most  incomparable dinner of all that of the newly  married couple Bella and John at Greenwich for the sake of the sentimental waiter the young man on liking so ignominiously thrust aside by the archpotentate in waiting who conceived that he had alone a right to the solemn monopoly of the secret of the day j We must stop  though touchesand traits rise  on us hythe hundred justifying what has been said that Our Mutual Friend is one of Mr Dickenss richest and most carefullywrought books If we demur to Wegg and to Miss Jenny Wren as to a pair of eccentrics approaching that boundaryline of caricature towards which their creator is by fits tempted wecannot recall anything more real more cheering than the sketch of the Milveysclergyman and clergymans wife lxth so unconscious in their selfsacrificing virtue and goodness yet the two so capitally discriminated by the extra touch of zeal and briskness and suspicion of the Jews on the womans part It might be suggested that too much space is given to the impostorcouple the Lammles and their designs on Podsnaps poor foolish little daughter but again how capitally thrown in to the womans part is its scrap of shame and of remorseful feeling Her figure ere she quits the scene unconsciously sketching on the tablecloth with her parasol is not to be forgotten as marked by that attitude and occupation Enough then has been said to indicate in what point of view we conceive this novel may be regarded and to prove that on its being read and read again every lover

writers of a disregard of unity in works of art and yet there is no great English work of imagination that does not recognize it in a far higher degree than is involved in acceptance of the classical formula for securing an external unity in respect of time and place and action We rightly hold the imagination capable of passing with ease over intervals of space and time and although we recognize even more thoroughly than our neighbours the demand for unity of action what we mean by that is not outward simplicity and singleness of plot but a wellharmonized relation of all parts to one central thought ideal unity that lies far deeper than any of those considerations on which the old triad of classic unities is based Every great English work of imagination every good work of art all the world over is as it were a crystallization of thought about some one central idea Nowhere perhaps is the sen,
Rewards and Fairies By Rudyard I Kipling Macmillan  Co ME KipLiNG has made a compromise with himself His Puck of Pooks Hill  was obviously undertaken in an alert and vivid mood of patriotism Its sequel has more frankly artistic leanings It might be amusing to consider how differently these themes would have been interpreted by writers of the Celtic school Certainly they would have lacked Mr Kiplings sprightliness and humour but possibly admirers of Celtic glamour would have claimed for the performance a finer and a rarer sense of fantasy It is difficult to say for Mr Kipling is invariably and at all costs real These stories though their mechanism strikes us as cumbrous are always forceful and significant The defect of the glamorous tales is that they mean nothing are nothing but empty vapourings It takes perhaps Celtic minds to believe in Celtic glamour Mr Kiplings is forthright unconvincing AngloSaxon glamour which we could have done without But he has chosen this method of appearing before his public and we must accept it It was the genial Bishop Corbet who wrote  Farewell Rewards and Fairies and the line has a sufficient connexion to form a tag for a title But here are n1o fairies in point of fact here is a blunt sturdy series of historical pictures covering a survey of old England The mystical connexions are cleverly made through Dan and Una our old Young friends but we might as well dispense with them and the machinery The stories supply glimpses of events in English history from Saxon times we get sketches of the Duke of Wellington of Elizabeth of Washington of Talleyrand and others But it is an open question whether the story of Martlake Witches  is not the pick of the bunch as was the  Dymchurch Flit  of the Puck of Pooks Hill  series The characteristic of Mr Kipling which dominates here as always is his extraordinary vitality This combined with an immense modernity has given him his place in the forefront of English fiction today But it is his modernity exactly which renders this medium improper for him Yet with all its faults and defects there comes out of a reading of this book a deep conviction that the author represents and embodies many of our modern forces as no other writer has done At his best he marks them with genius and if you want him at his best it will not be in these prose stories but rather in some of the verses lavishly scattered throughout the pages The Way through the Woods  Brookland Road Song of the Red WarBoat Our Fathers of Old and The Ballad of Minepit Shaw are perhaps the best and among the varieties of form employed his use of the old ballad is the most successful It is not from one of those however that we quote but from a strangely mellifluous set of verses embodying something of the authors poetic missionExcellent herbs had our fathers of oldExcellent herbs to ease our painAlexanders and Marigold Eyebright Orris and Elecampane Basil Rocket Valerian Rue Almost singing themselves they run Vervain Dittany CallmetoyouCowslip Melilot Rose of the Sun Anything green that grew out of the mould Was an excellent herb to our fathers of old If it be certain as Galen says And sage Hippocrates holds as much That those afflicted by doubts and dismays Are mightily helped by a dead mans touch Then be good to us stars above  Then be good to us herbs below We are afflicted by what we can prove We are distracted by what we knowSoah so Down from your heaven or up from your mould Send us the hearts of our fathers of old  We note that following the most illustrious of examples Mr Kipling condescends to utilize the forms of his less renowned predecessors He writes after the precedent of  Philadelphia in the Morning as did R L Stevenson once after  Over the Sea to Skye,juvenile

in public estimation althouKh for our own part we mu ch prefer that which has proved the least popular namely Te Lat ojf the Barons a composition of a loftier class than any the author had previously uttempted and whose comparative failure is a problem we are unable to solve unless it be indeed that it was too good for the circulating libraries Be this as it may Rienzi has continued to grow in esteem and is almost as much in de mand at the libraries now as it was when first published In the present form it may be possessed for little inore than the price at which it is to be borrowel printed very bemutifully on the best paper neatly put into cloth boards and illustrated with an engraving Besides these attractions there is a preface by the author written specially for this edition in which he states that his aim was to adhere to history strictly in hisfact and through this medium of fictitious personages to endleavour to exhibit the causes of those facts The theory is ingenious and lie has not been unsuccessful in working it out IRienzi the Last of the Tribunes MK BULWERS RIENZI By the Author of  Eugene Aram  Last Days of Pompeii c c Whokvkr looks upon any of Mr Bulwers works of fiction as the mere vehicles of amusement does that author great injustice and himself unconsciously a great wrong All bis novels and romances have been produced not to exemplify a single moral but to elucidate a theory work out a principle or establish a science To a superficial observer the last clause of the preceding sentence may seem a strong one and appear to give Mr Bulwer more credit for deepseeing views and ultimate results than even himself will lay claim to But this is not so In his several works he has endeavoured to instruct mankind inwhat ought to be to mankind their primal considerationthe relations of men to each other In bis lighter novels he has given us enduring and searching lessons on the social scheme as circumscribed by a particular circle or a single country In this his latest work 44 Hienzi the Last of the Tribunes he bas deeply and despondingly expatiated and made new discoveries on the most difficult the most debated and the allimportant science of government In imparting wisdom to his countrymen and to the world in the many volumes that he bas written be bas become profoundly wise himself with a wisdom that has brought a melancholy over the high aspirations of his soul and which has given at times a scarcelyperceptible tint of misanthropy to his reflections Whilst his mind is open to every generous sentiment and his admiration and applause the free homage of every virtuous individual he begins to despise and despair of mankind in the mass He begins to understand what we have long knownthat as yet public virtue is like the clove sent forth from the ark on the face of the troubled waters She cannot from the overflowing seas of iniquity that cover the earth find anywhere a restingplace In the progress of knowledge she has certainly found an olivebrancha token of the subsiding of the waters But to the present era we see that the past affords no lesson and the future gives scarcely any hope Even in Mr Bulwers sanguine mind the Utopian dreams of patriotism and his faith in the public good brought about by public virtue are fast fading away and are rapidly giving place to a conviction that sharp realities only will urge man on over bis worldly course regardless of public honour wildlyextended views or the general wed almost every page in the work licforc us furnishes proofs of this feeling growing upon him Verifying his own doctrine the man speaks out eloquently in the author He will soon cease to be a political partisan soon cease to believe in aristocratic Whig honesty on the one hand or to court the most sweet voices of the seldom washed on the other Literature will snatch him away from the disgraceful broils of faction and placing him in the Temple of tbe Muses he will there find his legitimate station his just triumph and his deserved immortality As a literary conqiosition 4fc llienzi the Last of the Tribunes may be classed as a familiar prose epic  whether we regard the unity of its action the eloquence of its diction or the high and the melancholy truth which it so beautifully enforces The story ocns with a loving and quiet scene between the elder llienzi the hero and a gentle being his brother In this interview the character of ola the predestined Tribune is made to display itself very naturally and forcibly His is a mind of great imaginings imbued deeply with classic learning and panting after the regeneration of Home Ile is also proud of his illegitimate lineage derived from an Emperor of Germany at that time the representative of all that was left of the once universal empire At this period the city is distracted and devoured by the two contending factions of the Colonna and the Orsini nearly equal tn strength and rapacity though the former has a little the advantage in being only less Irarbarous than its rival To the Colonna Cola llienzi lias attached himself imitating in a graceful manner thc conduct of the elder Brutus though not to the extent to which that patriot is recorded to have went Ile Cola descended only to a witty buffoonery What he really thought of the men whose festive honours he enlivened by his facetiousness may be gathered from the following indignant burst   The Colonna  said ola with a bitter smile   the Colonnathe pedantsThey affect dull souls the knowledge of the past play the patron and misquote Latin over their cups  They are pleased to welcome me at their hoard because the Roman doctors call me learned and because nature gave nie a wild wit which to them is pleasanter than thc stale jests of a hired buffoon Yes they would advance my fortunes but how  hy some place in the public offices which would fill a dishonoured coffer hy wringing yet more sternly the hardearned coins from our famishing citizens If there he a vile thing in the world it is a plebeian advanced hy patricians not for the purpose of righting his own order hut for playing the pander to the worst interests of theirs Ile who is of the people hut makes himself a traitor to his hirth if he hecomes a puppet for these tyrant hypocrites to lift up their hands and cry See what liberty exists in Rome when we the patricians thus elevate a plebeian I Jid they ever elevate a plebeian if he sympathized with plebeians No brother should I he lifted above our condition I will he raised hy the arms of my countrymen and not upon their necks At that time the deceived patriot had faith in plebeian virtue The reader will also perceive the bitterness and the depth of the remark on that most plebeian of all ambitions the wish to rise by making oneself the tool or the parasite of a patron is here properly characterized  and shows the first dark dawning in the authors mind of the miserable light of one dismal truth of our fallen nature After this sweet interview with his brother over which is spread that wellsustained classicality that no living author knows so well bow to give to his subjects as Mr Bulwer the pair separatethe elder to muse over the miseries of his fallen city and to cherish vague hopes for her resuscitated glory the younger with his heart light with innocence seeks the cheerfulness of his home In his way he is met by a band of the Orsini They unhesitatingly make him their captive guide to direct them to some purpose of rapine and as he is thus brutally urged on with the marauders a stronger force of the Colonna put this band to flight The poor unarmed boy flies vyith he fugitives being distracted with a very natural terror and just is his brother appears and he shrieks out  Save me  save me  to Jola 44 Mercy mercy to his relentless pursuer Martino di Porto the as Ula one of the Colonna thrusts him through with his lance from back to breast Hienzi falls on his knees before Stephen Colonna the head of the house and exclaims with all the pathos of a love made wretched4 It is my brother noble Stephen a boy a mere child  the best the mildest See how his blood dabbles the grass back backyour horses hoofs are in the stream  Justice my lord justice you are a great man  Justice is readily promised by the old chief who supposed that the assassin was an Orsini but when he finds that the assassin was a kinsman the following scene so characteristic of the times occurs   My poor youth said the old man compassionately  you should have had justice against the Orsini hut see you not this has been an error  I do not wonder you are too grieved to listen to reason now Wv must make this up to you   And let this pay for masses for the hoys soul I grieve me much for the accident said the younger Colonna flinging down a purse of gold  Av see us at the palace next week young Colanext week My father we had best return towards the boat its safeguard may require us yet  4 Hight Gianni stay some two of you and see to the poor lads corpse a grievous accident how could it chance   The company passed hack the way they came two of the common soldiers alone remaining except the hoy Adrian who lingered behind a few moments striving to console Hienzi who as one bereft of sense remained motionless gazing on the proud array as it swept along and muttering to himself 4 Justice justice  1 will have it yet 44 The loud voice of the elder Colonna summoned Adrian reluctantly and weeping away 4 Let me he your brother said the gallant boy affectionately pressing the scholars hand to his heart  I want a brother like you  Hienzi made no reply  he did not heed or hear himdark and stern thoughts thoughts in which were the germ of a mighty revolution were at his heart He woke from them with a start as the soldiers were now arramring their bucklers so as to make a kind of bier for the corpse and then burst into tears as he fiercely motioned them away and clasped the clay to his breast till he was lite rally soaked with the oozing blood From that moment Colas patriotism became nerved by revenge his whole soul rose at once in eternal hate against the nobles and rigidly and amply did he pay them back the devastation they had committed on his own race lt is not our purpose to follow the hero through the slow development of his plans his sagacious blinding of the aristocracy to his designs and his veiled and astute cultivation of the good opinion of the working classes Here we may remark a singularity in this romance significantly indicative of a change in Mr Bulwers political opinions The only truly noble great and good character that he brings upon this exciting stage of action is a patrician Adrian a branch of the Colonna family Of the women as they take the colouring of their minds from the men we need say nothing But of all the male characters with the exception of Adrian llienzi among the rest are such as to make us loathe our common nature llienzis character is heroic but it cannot be called good great but incomplete  such an one as might create a faithful adherent but not one whom a pure mind would rejoice to hail as a familiar friend His author attempts to justify him from the imputation of that weakest of all weaknessesan affectation of the puerility of holiday pomp The very entertaining of such gilded hollowness argues pretension  and wherever there is pretension there is innate feebleness in some point of character We do not think that llienzi was justified in this foolish expense of wealth on the score of keeping up his popularity  for though it flattered the citizens upon whose good will his power was solely found in the end it undermined his strength with them as well as brought about the necessity of taxation  and attempted taxation did at last shed his blood in the very midst of his former idolaters One almost uninterrupted colour of black villany and of weakness worse even in its consequences than villany itself is spread over the dramatis pcrsoncc of this intellectual work From the pope to the meanest official in religionfrom the statesman to the lowest Jack in office from the general of armies to the degraded follower of the camp all all are miserable rascals There is no repose for the mind of the reader except in the one character that we have mentioned and in that of his betrothed Irene the gentle and beautiful sister of the Tribune Finely has the author castigated and held up to immortal scorn the Roman working classes and the democrats Ile describes them and describes them truly as being as ambitious as revengeful as cruel as selfish and as weak as the nobles with all their vices made hideous by meanness the most disgusting and sordidness the most revolting For these frequent and not too highly coloured pictures conservatism will be eternally grateful to the author Let us now suppose llienzi to have expelled the nobles from Rome or made them reside there as simple quiet citizens demolished the fortifications of their strongholds hung up some of their number for what were looked upon formerly as mere casual occurrences a few murders or so cleared the roads of banditti brought profitable trade and overflowing plenty within the walls and administering justice with mercy seemed to have chained peace within the city by the rosy bonds of brotherly love between man and in manllienzi has done all this and now let us look at Mr Bulwers picture of democratic gratitude The greasy plebeians have grown fat under the beneficence of his sway Their storehouses are full of merchandize and their purses full of florins All looks well and prosperous within their city But at the far off papal court of Avignon the nobles are again making a demonstration and the popeO these popes  have excommunicated the Tribune because he bathed in the same stone bath as the heathen emperor Constantine Wellone hundred and fifty freebooters in the pay of the patricians steal into the city and for tify themselves in one of the dismantled strongholds of the Colonna Only one hundred and fifty  But we anticipate To repel such an attempt as this the citizens benefactor wanted a little moneyonly a very little taxhear how the demagogues now handle their former idol 44 Meanwhile as the decliiiiiur day closed around the litter and its troop more turbulent actors in the drama demand our audience The traders and artizans of Home at that time and especially during the popular government of Hienzi held weekly meetings in each of the thirteen quarters of the c itv And in the most democratic of these Cecco del Vecchio was an oracle and leader lt was at that assembly over which the smith presided that the murmurs that preceded the earthquake were heard So cried one of the companyLuigi the goodly butcher  they say he wanted to put a new tax on us and that is the reason he broke up the Council today  because good men they were honest aud had bowels for the people it is a shame and a sin that the treasury should he empty 44 4 I told him said the smith 4 to beware how he taxed the people Poor men wont be taxed But as he does not follow my advice he must take the consequencethe horse runs from one hand the halter remains in the other 44  Take your advice Cecco  1 warrant me his stomach is too high for that now Why he is grown as proud as a pope 44  For all that he is a great man said one of the party 4 He gave us lawshe rid the Campagna of robbersfilled the streets with merchants and the shops with waresdefeated the boldest lords and fiercest soldiery of Italy 44 4 And now wants to tax the peoplethats all the thanks we get for helping him said the grumbling Cecco 4 What would he have been without uswe that made can unmake 44 4 lint continued the advocate seeing that he had his supporters 4 Hut then he taxes us tor our own liberties  4 4 Who strikes at them now asked the butcher 44  Why the Barons are daily mustering new strength at Marino  44 4 Marino is not Home said Luigi the butcher 4 Lets wait till they come to our gates againwe know how to receive them Though for the matter of that I think we have had enough fightingmy two poor brothers had each a stab too much for them Why wont the Tribune if th the he be a great man let us have peace All we want now is quiet 44 4 Ah said a seller of horseharness 4 let him make it up wi Barons They were good customers after all  4 For my part said a merrylooking fellow who had been a gravedigger in bad times and had now opened a stall of wares for the living  I could foi give him all but bathing in the holy vase of porphyry 44 4 Ah that was a bail job said several shaking their heads 44 4 And the knighthood was but a silly show an it were not for the wine from the horses nostrilsthat had some sense in it My masters said Cecco the folly was in not beheading the Barons when he had them ail in the net and so Messere Baroncelii savs Ah Baroncelli is an honest man and follows no half measures it was a sort of treason to the people not to do so Why but for that we should never hive Inst so many tall fellows by the gate of San Lorenzo True true it was a shanie  some say the Barons bought him And then said another 4 those poorLords Colonnaboy and man thev were the best of the family save the Castello I vow I pitied them 44 4 But to the point said one of the crowd the richest of the set 4 the tar is the thinj The ingratitude to tax us Let him dare do it   Mi he will not dare for I hear that the popes bristles are up at last so he will only have us to depend upon  Here is satire over which the most bigotted Tory might gloat with rapture It is of no use saying that these men are merely degraded Italians Here they are not acting as Italians but as sons of human nature It is from thc unchanging soul of man that the picture is drawn  the colouring is dismal but it is correct Would the large and fashionable furnishing ironmonger of our metropolis act more heroically than the huge Roman smith Cecco del Vcecilio Mr Bulwer knows he would not Would the west end purveyor of meat the word butcher is obsolete be more ready than Luigi to whet his knife in defence of a newlyacquired liberty  Or is there a rich radical vestryman of Marylebone who would behave more nobly than the richest of thc set of the Roman crowd Noa few hundred or it few thousand of years make but small change in the common impulses of humanity Again we thank Mr Bulwer for this picture But the finishing stroke is still to be put to it The hundred and fifty mercenaries are in the heart of the city the Tribune has just been excommunicated by the popes emissary llienzi harangues the Roman populace in order to inflame them to arms to drive out this handful of robbers In his harangue he tells them that he will go and stand with his few attendants before thc holding of the barbarians that his trumpet shall sound three times and that if at the third blast they do not rise and hasten to his banner and to the attack he will abandon them to the fruits of their ingratitude and cowardice and to the tender mercies of the barons Ile departs and then one of the demagogues in the crowd thus begins    Look you my masters said he leaping up to the place of the Lion  the Tribune talks bravely he always did hut the monkey used the cat for his chesmits  he wants to thrust your paws into the fire  you will not be so silly as to let him The saints bless us  but the Tribune good man gets a palace and his banquets and bathes in a porphyry vase the more shame on himin which San Sylvester christened the Emperor Constantine all this is worth fighting for but you my masters what do you get except hard blows and a stare at a holiday spectacle  Why then if you beat these fellows you will have another tax on the wine that will be your reward    Hark cried Cecco  there sounds the trumpeta pity he wanted to tax us 44  True cried Baroncelli there sounds the trumpet a silver trumpet by the Lord  Next week if you help him out of this serape hell have a golden one But gowhy dont you move my friends  tis but one hundred and fifty mercenaries true they are devils to fight clad in armourfrom top to toe hut what thenif they do cut some four or five hundred throats youll heat them at last and the Tribune will sup tin1 merrier 44  There goes the second blast said the butcher  If my old mother had not lost two of us already tis odds but Id strike a blow for the bold Tribune   You had better put more quicksilver in you continued Baroncelli 4 or youll be too late And what a pity that will be if you believe the Tribune he is the only man that can save Rome What you the finest people in the worldyou not able to save yourselves you bound up with one manyou not able to dictate to the Colonna and Orsini Why who heat the Barons at San Lorenzo Was it not you Ah  you got the buffets and the Tribune the moneta  Tush my friends let the man go  I warrant there are plenty as good as he to he bought a cheaper bargain Andhark  there is the third blast it is too late now  44 As the trumpet from the distance sounded its long and melancholy note it was as the last warning of the parting genius of the place and when silence swallowed up the sound a gloom fell over the whole assembly They began to regret to repent when regret and repentance availed no more  the buffoonery of Baroncelli became suddenly displeasing  and the orator had the mortification of seeing his audience disperse in all directions just as he was about to inform them what great things he himself could do in their behalf 44 Meanwhile the Tribune passing unscathed through the dangerous quarter of the enemy who dismayed at his approach shrunk within their fortress proceeded to the castle of St Angelo whither Nina had already preceded him  and which he entered to find that proud lady with a smile tor his safetywithout a tear for his reverse And this ends the first reign of the Tribune Many arc thc adventures that llienzi in his selfimposed exile undergoes and many and highlywrought and beautiful are the incidents that befall the other characters of this exciting story which even to glance at we have no space The eternal city after its Tribunes departure becomes saturated with the blood of lier children  faction expels factionmassacre avenges massacretill Heaven either in vengeance or in mercy in order to put a stop to the intercommunion of murder pours down the vials of her wrath and enacts the destroyer The plague in its inconceivable destructiveness hushes the voiles of all the contending factions in the nottobebroken silence of death In this part of the work the eloquence of Mr Bulwer often arises into sublimity But we wish not to be mere panegyrists Let us hurry over a mass of events and a long period also when time is chronicled by actions The pope and his advisers find out that if Rome is to be preserved to the church it can only be brought about by thc instrumentality of the banished and now imprisoned Tribune His fetters are knocked offhe is relieved of the bann of his excommunication and clothed in the senatorial robe he goes again to govern Rome Adversity now seems to have perfected his character The same prosperity follows in his stepsthe barons are again humbled and Rome if not again quiet is again happy Ami now wc come to the bitterest commentary on democracy that was ever formed to open the eyes of a deluded world A tax is again necessary A revolt of the free and good citizens of Home is the consequence We shall not adv crt to the byeplay introduced by Mr Bulwer in order to make his finale more dramatic The Tribune advances to address the infuriated mob Thus closes the eventful scene of the man who would te the friend of the mere people Mark it is a liberalalmost a radical that describes it 44 Then from earth to heaven rose the roar4 Down with the tyrantdown with him who taxed the people  44 A shower of stones rattled on the mail of the Senatorstill he stirred mt No changing muscle betokened fear His persuasion of his own Milcrlul powers of eloquence il hr could but he heard inspired him yet with hope he stood collected in his own indignant hut determined thoughtsbut the knowledge of that very eloquence was now his deadliest foe The leaders of the multitude trembled lest he should bc heard  4 and doubtless says the contemporaneous biographer 4 had he but spoken he would have hanged them all and the work been marred 44 The soldiers of the Barons had already mixed themselves with the throngmore deadly weapons than stones aided the wrath of the multitudedarts and arrows darkened the air and now a voice was heard shrieking4 Way for the torches Heil in the sunlight they tossed and waved and danced to and fro above the heads of the crowd as if the fiends were let loose amongst the mob And what place in hell hath fiends like those a mad mob can furnish  Straw and wood and litter were piled hastily round the great doors of the Capitol and the smoke curled suddenly up beating back the rush of the assailants 44 Hienzi was no longer visible au arrow had pierced his handthe right hand that supported the flag of Homethe right hand that had given a constitution to the Republic Ile retired from the storm into the desolate hall Ile sat down  and tears springing from no weak and woman source but tears from the loftiest fountain of emotiontears that befit a warrior when his own troops desert hima patriot when his countrymen rush to their own dooma father when his children rebel against his lovetears such as these forced themselves from his eyes and relieved hut they changed his heart 44 4 Enough enough he said presently rising and dashing the drops scornfully away  4 I have risked dared toiled enough for this dastard and degenerate race I will yet baffle their maliceI renounce the thought of which they are so little worthy  Let Home perish I feel at last that I am nobler than my country she deserves not so high a sacrifice   44 Meanwhile the flames burnt fierce and fast the outer door below was already consumed  from the apartment he had deserted the fire burst out in volleys of smokethe wood crackledthe lead meltedwith a crash fell the severed gatesthe dreadful ingress was opened to all the multitudethe proud Capitol of the Ciesars was already tottering to its fall  Now was the time he passed the flaming doorthe smouldering threshold he passed the outer gate unscathedhe was in the middle of the crowd 4 Plenty of pillage within he said to the hystanders in the Homan patois his face concealed hy his load Suso suso a glin traditore  The mob rushed past himhe went onhe gained the last stair descending into the open streetshe was at thc last gateliberty and life were before him 44 A soldier one of his own seized him 4 Pass notwhere gocst thou 44 4 Beware lest the Senator escape disguised  cried a voice behind it was Villains The concealing load was torn from his headHienzi stood revealed  44 c I am the Senator  he said in a loud voice  Who clare touch the Representative of the People 44 The multitude were round him in an instant Not led but rather hurried and whirled along the Senator was home to the Place of the Lion With the intense glare of the bursting flames the grey image reflected a lurid light and glowedthat grim and solemn monument as if itself of fire  44 There arrived the crowd gave way terrified by the greatness of their victim Silent he stood and turned his face around  nor could the squalor of his garb nor the terror of the hour nor the proud grief of detection abate the majesty of his mien or reassure the courage of the Oisun theavelli tier true tyrants were marciimg miu w   the sound of their approaching horns and trumpets broke upon the burning air the mob seemed to regain their courage llienzi prepared to speak  his first word was as the signal of his own death 44 4 Pie tyrant cried Ceeeo del Vecchio and he plunged his dagger in the Senators breast We said this was written by a liberal almost a radical WTe unsay our words for the epithet now must be impossible The very assassin that struck this cowardly this ungrateful blow was the most upright of all the demoeraticafparty The moral is plain enoughany who run may read lu the hand that struck the blow Mr Bulwer is elucidating a principle not detailing a tact This stroke at democracy is gratuitous The smith is a fiction of story but an everlasting truth of principle Mr Bulwer despairs of the human raceand so do we for generations to come Tliey were not formed for selfgovernment The majority should because as yet tliey are only fit for it influence not control nor cv cn elect their governors Democratic liberty is the illusion of generous minds How then could Mr Bulwer have escaped it Ourselves were cai ried away by it We have been miserably undeceived When reform was at first agitated and the Bill promulgated we hoped great things tor the nationwc thought we saw a new light dawning upon mankind What now has the country gained by it What the world  The reins of government have passed into other hands but I hey are held the more tightly and the lash is applied the more incessantly In mere formin the babble of theory the commonwealth appears to be more free but actual oppression in every present tyranny gives proof to the contrary These are not words of mere declamation One half of the population at least cannot hold themselves secure of not being at some one time within the scope of the poor laws Over the whole of these Whig oppression grins horribly Into how many circles have not the hateful commissioners of this government extended They have already destroyed all local corporations They are not a far distant and almost an abstract grievance that flourishes only near the person of a despot or in the hotbed of a court but it casts its withering shades over our very hearths But wc dare not trust ourselves to descant upon this very galling subject Wc can only congratulate Mr Bulwer upon this highly elaborated and conservative production one that we trust will do as much good to mankind as it does honour to his refined subtle and powerful intellect As a literary composition it would justify any and even contradictory praises It is at times sweet and solemn severe and gay eloquent always poetical often It leads away the heart a willing captive while it appeals to the judgment with the force of logic and leaves upon us the conviction that we have been inspecting the leaves   brok the title of which should be 44 An eternal truthRienzi the Last of thc Tribunes Ey tin Author of  Eugene Aram Second Notice Last week when at the eleventh hour we were unexpectedly called on to oller some though fe xv remarks on this new romance xve felt that it was a service of haste and hardship yet now when we hilve abundant leisure and are only required to state the results of a deliberate judgment we do not find the difliculties much less perplexing To string together highsounding words and gay epithets is iir more easy than to praise xvith discrimination and understanding If xve have been chary of commendation and extreme in

Rip vati Winkle and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow By Washington Irving Edited by S J Adair Fitzgerald Greening  The presentation by Mr Tree of  Rip van Winkle is responsible for the appearance of this work in what is called  Her Majestys Edition a reference it may be supposed to the theatre rather than the monarch With it are given an introduction dealing principally with Washington Irving and the theatrical history of  Rip van Winkle showing the versions of the work to be more numerous than we had supposed Vastly preferable to tho later renderings of the story with which alone we are familiar is the original The further indeed that adapters have departed from Washington Irving the more hopelessly have they gone astray Boucicault got much praise for his adaptation but the matter he introduced was the commonest melodrama The notion meanwhile adopted at Her Majestys of an apotheosis of both Rip and his wife is as little happy as it could well be Except in the matter of popular association The Legend of Sleepy Hollow has nothing to do with Rip van Winkle The German story of  Peter Klaus the Goatherd otherwise  Die Ziegenhirt which is printed in the volume is the undoubted source of Irvings legend We have also received an attractive illustrated edition of Irvings Rip van Winkle from Messrs Putnams Sons Each page is provided with an elaborate border which is occasionally rather heavy but the photogravures and little cuts are decidedly pleasing,juvenile

SABRINA WARHAM THE STORY OF HER YOUTH By Laurence Housman Murray 6s With this novel Mr Housman comes several steps nearer to his own but his own he has not reached so far as novels are concerned that is to say That strange piece of fiction to which he at length put his name  An Englishwomans Love Letters seemed to contain evidence of a dual authorship Influences were traceable but they were not allpervasive in A Modern Antaeus he appeared to be controlling the peh himself throughout but something of his natural freakishness seemed to have dropped off perhaps instinctively aware of incompatibility with the disguise its owner was assuming Here and now there are indications of the development of the novelist in Mr Housman as he is to be The influence has remained supreme for the length of one book only and though it is still easily perceptibleLady Berrers for instance delightful company though one find her is patently a stray out of Meredithiait hats entangled itself inextricably with another influence equally potent and equally lneficent in moderation And all this sounds very unfair and even is very unfair until one remembers that Mr Housman has himself given us the right to claim absolutely individual work from him in fiction by his own achievements in other departments of letters East and West Gill are indubitably hitherto unmarked spots in the map of Wessex Sabrina has a puzzling likeness to Bathsheba fiverdene and David Lorry to Gabriel Oak The scene in which Roddie creeping close to the lighted window to decipher his belated love letter watchss the undressing and bathing of Lotties child his own child Sabrina giving it the attentions that should have come by right from its mother is an idyllic picture that could only be paralleled in the works of Mr Hardy but it would fit into almost any one of the Wessex novels so as to deceive even the very elect  The small events big with the fates of men are wont to move the great artists in fiction to different emotions according to the mood in which they commonly observe With Mr Meredith even in his more sombre momenta we are never far removed from comedy With Mr Hardy a fantastic danse macabre lurks in the background even when his  comic relief his clowns are on the stage Mr Housmans genius is naturally allied rather to that of such a writer as Hawthorne He has shown us in his poems his fairy tales his pendrawings an elvish strain that recalls Donatello in  The Marble Faun and it is probably in this direction that the novels which shall be absolutely unmistakably his own will evolve themselves Nevertheless whilst we still await his savoury meat we have enjoyed and thank him for his lentil pottage,biography
Sense and Sensibility By Jank Ai sten Richard Bentley New Burlington Street This reprint of Miss fane Austens excellent work forms No XXIII of the Standard Novels The best critique of the work itself will be found in thc wellwritten preface but as we wish all to read that anti the novel too that read our notice we shall make a few brief but sincere remarks of high praise upon the publication before us This novel we have always held to be one of the best if not the very best of its class Chaste yet witty it can boast of excessive purity without tininess turns morality into loveliness anti proves religion to be the very highest state of mortal enjoyment This work is the voice of innocencelow vet beautifully distinct from its excessive sweetness anti so persuasive that we feel assured it can come only from the seclusion where vice has never dared to enter and where it fails to make a proselyte it must fall upon a heart unwin thy to enjoy what is beautiful anti unable to appreciate what is virtuousTHE LITERARY EXAMINER Sense and Snsibility By Miss Austen Standard Novels Vol xniii Bentley There we few works of fiction so acceptable in republication as the novels of Miss Austen They never weary their interest is sever lost for as in the prints of Hogarth we find fresh matter for admiration upon every renewal of our acquaintance Her fables ore of the simplest construction her incidents in the common course of things and her characters are only extraordinary in the truth of their delineation The story she tells in all her works is the story of human nature in its most familiar phases There are no exaggerations and no deficiencies and it is by the completeness of the view of character that the fulness of the effect is produced The persons described are such as we meet every day in society but wb have never seen their peculiarities in connexion with their causes of actionthe one illustrating the otherand moreover most people in the world are so much occupied with themselves that they are unable to make very accurate observations on their associates Self is a great disturber of the observing faculties In Miss Austens novels the scene is before us with all the reality of the world and free from the engrossment of acting a part in it we discover points of interest which a divided attention had overlooked The commonplace characters of the town and the village are the characters which Miss Austen makes of interest by making them thoroughly understood In the story before us what an example of the worthless is Mr Johii Dashwoodnot the worMhless in the common acceptation of the word implying positive vice but the worthless negative of worth of which common character Miss Austen has evinced a perfect comprehension and presented various illustrations Mr John Dashwood is incapable of a generous sentiment or a benevolent action but he is a rigid olserver of all the laws of the world and we know full well that so really despicable a man would pass as a very pattern of proprietya model man He has a wife all selfishness and worldliness who draws the pale of humanity round her own house to whom he looks up as he must to some one being of a parasitical genus with veneration consecrating all her foibles and almirilngly magnifying her littleness For one traitThe brother of this paragon marries beneath him as the world calls it though in this as in many other cases so described the match was an equal one for two narrow souls were attracted by the sympathy of meanness and literally contracted to each other the feelings of Mrs John Dashwood upon this trying occasion are described as follows by the adoring husbandwe think we hear the man speakas we read the letter and the very breaks are full of nature and denote the emphasis of his selfish concern Your sister has suffered dreadfullyin short it has been a scene of such complicated distressbut I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome Poor Fanny Mrs John Dashwood she was in hysterics all yesterday But I would not alarm you too much Donovan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended her constitution is a good one and her resolution elual to any thing She has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel She says she never shall think well of any body again anl one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived cSense and Sensibility p 228 How exquisitely true to the sort of nature described is that unconscious satire  She has borne it all unit the fortitude of an angel  She says she never shall think well of any body again Angelic being Mrs Ferrars is another excellently drawn character one of those creatures cankered with wealth the tyrants of the moneybox the capricious despots of the last will and testament who make slaves of expectation and torment with fears of disappointment and cause the interested hopes of their death to be fraught with miseries and abasements during their lives Her merit considered her perfection in one style Miss Austen is the worst appreciated novelist of her time She laboured under the disadvantage of ihaving the inferior stamp of circulatinglibrary popularity put upon her works before the superior judges had become acquainted with them and recognized their high degree of excellence The Quarterly Review to its honour be it remembered was the first critical authority which did justice to her merits and after the grave had closed over her unconscious and modest genius It is remarkable that Scott who noticed with praise many inferior authors never mentioned Miss Austen perhaps because she was not an inferior author perhaps for the same reason that caused Sir Walter to consider Fieldings incomparable satire Jonathan Wild only as a story The present judicious blication is we see to be followed by  Emma  Northanier Abbey  Mansfield Park and Persuasion but suely it cannot be intended to omit  Pride and Prejudice which s at once the best and the most popular of the Austen Novels,biography
Shorter Reviews I Madeleine at Her Mirror A Womans Diarv By MARCELLE TINAYRE John Lane 6s  M ME TINAYRE writes with such a light fantastic M touch that her books are always enjoyable reading The present volume as she herself says  is not a novel but a collection of impressions of dreams and of memories in which fiction mingles with fact It is also we are inclined to think in no small degree autobiographical Some of us delight in building castles in the air others will become lost in thought as they watch the embers on the homely hearth but Madeleine sits before her mirror and gazes into it evoking reminiscences of other days which she records in a dainty style that forcibly reminds one of the late Gustave Droz especially in his delightful work  Monsieur Madame et BebE Madeleine conjures up thoughts and recollection of a multitude of subjects mostly of the piquant gossamer kind which is innate in the Parisienne but occasionally striking a more serious note showing that life is not all frivolity frills and furbelows and that laughter has at times to give way to tears The sketches slight as they are display an intimate knowledge of woman and her ways and the authoress lampoons her foibles with no hesitating pen The chapters Beauty Secrets Friendship among Women Women and their Dressmakers divulge many home truths which a mere man could scarcely hint at Women at Sales depicts the little wild beast   feverishly turning over scarves and laces in a caressing manner which no husband or lover will ever know But it is when Madeleine discusses Mode and Maternity that she is most scathing towards her sex The present fashion if exaggerated becomes the negation of femininity The tight fitting garments of today make prospective maternity immodest   Modem woman is a pretty careless creature who does not think who seldom loves and who never becomes a mother She is a soulless heartless doll Look at our Parisiennes how they flatten any prominence of figure how they diet themselves how they confine their bodies in mummylike sheathes in order to attain to the literary ideal of the perverted angel According to Madame Tinayre who is evidently no believer in as good be out of the world as out of the fashion this regrettable state of things is in the main due to our latterday novelists It is a pity that several of her pages are disfigured by some very careless printers errors Has that gentlemans reader become as extinct as the dodo,biography

Sketch ofthe Life Character and Writings of Baroness de StaelHolstein  3 v   By Madame Necker de Saussure Translated from the French bvo pp 30J London IS 20 Madame de Stael was a lady possessed o such extraor dinary genius and splendid talents and filled so important a part in the literature and politics of the time in which she lived that whatever relates to her as illustrative either of her public or private character cannot fail of being interesting The first of female writers perhaps of this or of auy age she not only possessed a commanding influence in France during the most eventful period of its history but her opinions were inquired after with eagerness and respected if not admired in every state of Europe Some persons have affected to question the moral tendency of the writings of Madame de Stael and passing over the knowledge of human nature the fidelity of observation and the acuteness of remark which she displayed in all her writings haye with a most fastidious delicacy carped at some passages which taken even abstractedly were never doubtful The present work does not contain a regular biographical memoir of this illustrious woman but a critical examination of her writings aud a variety of anecdotes of her domestic and social life and when it is known that these anecdotes are related by the friend and near relation of Madame de Stael who was honoured by her with the appellation of sister and passed many years of her life in the closest intimacy with her it will not be doubted that they are highly interesting We will not follow Madame de Saussure through her critical remarks on the respective works of Madame de Stael and this is the less necessary as their superior excellence is now universally acknowledged  but shall content ourselves with making one extract from this part of the work and then puss on to that part of it which describes her in private life which is the more interesting as it is the least known In u  general examination ofthe talents of Madame de Stael the author remarks   Before she appeared religion and knowledge had their separate defenders These two grand causes have been pleaded as we may say in opposition each finding itself a stranger to a whole system of ideas there has been in this respect a secret division among mankind one party only appearing to tolerate the reign of reason the other that of faith out of pure civility  Madame de Stael alone has embraced with equal zeal the party of knowledge and that of religion she alone has adopted from the bottom of her heart whatever was best in different ages combating on one side ancient prejudices and ignorance and on the other modern selfishness and incredulity   Madame de Stael loved what was about her and extended to human nature her affection for her friends What her style wants of minute finish is more than compensated by the charm of the first impulse by the freshness ofthe inspiration if I may venture to use the term lt is the stream gushing with vivacity from the fountain that sparkles as it flows  But something else may be remarked in her talents than this combination of different faculties there is a marked originality in each yet all bearing a similar stamp which is pe culiar to Madame de Stael T his peculiar stamp originates from her character from the strength as well as the versatile nature of her impressions from those sudden bursts of indignation of compassion of haughtiness and also from her never ceasing to be a woman  This last is perhaps her secret charm She addresses herself as a woman to the reader and presents herself personally to him to tell him what passes in her mind and also in his own But she is aware that he would soon forget her being a woman if she ceased to appear amiable or attractive to him accordingly whether she endeavours to instruct or dazzle she never overpowers him with her superioritv he never arrogates to herself any preeminence It seems as if chance had afforded her a good place at the theatre of moral affairs and she recited what was thus offered to her view  Sometimes too she presents herself as a child guiding a wiseman whose sight is a little indistinct She explains to him all he perceives confusedly and places him in a bright sunshine that he may see a little more clearly himself When she comes to lead him through steep and difficult paths she says to him  do not be afraid you will be glad you have passed we shall soon get safe out of it Constantly endeavouring to render the road agreeable to him she brings herself forward to divert him by rallying herself a little for the strong impressions she receives Persons words faces accents attitudesdresses every thing in fact strikes her everv thing is characteristic in her pictures She knows herself as well as she knows others and that blind instinct which so frequently determines us to like or dislike is in hera feeling founded on motives of which she gives a clear account  The precision of her views is such that we forget their extreme clelicacy She has no vain subtilty does not compel r j her readers to discern what is imperceptible but even thing l  enlarges under her hands lier whole attention is bent for ail instant to each point and it becomes so distinct to her that none of its bearings escape her notice but she takes care to connect threads too slender of themselves with others more strong the importance of which is acknowledged Thus we easily pass with her from the particulars to the whole and we find ourselves at once at the root of ideas when we fancied we were only tracing their remotest ramifications  The copiousness of her thoughts is extraordinary Perhaps no writer has equalled her in this respect Take at a venture any three of her pages and three of the authors most abounding in wit we may venture a wager that the number of striking and original ideas will be greatest in Madame de Stael Not that she affects conciseness every thought is amply furnished with the necessary words but we are not accustomed to see so many thoughts together and perhaps there are two manyperhaps certain phrases which are superfluous to the train of reasoning have on the mind the effect of those bits of cloth in the harpsichord which stop the vibration of one string before another is struck The succession of thoughts is too rapid and continual in Madame de Stael to allow ordinary minds to keep pace with it She is the goddess of plenty she scatters from full hands corn pearls roses ribands and diadems We would Jet nothing escape us because every thing is of value but we may be fatigued in collecting it  On the whole the works of Madame de Stael appear to belong to a new age they announce as they tend to produce another period in society and in literature the age of strong generous animated thoughts sentiments proceeding from the bottom of the heart She has furnished the idea of a literature in some sort rather spoken than written of a kind in which the extempore speaking of national assemblies unrestrained confidence and conversational sallies inform us more strongly and more intimately of politics of the passions and of society than studied rhetoric has ever done The second part of this work is entitled  Social and Domestic Life of Madame de Stael and consists of a series of characteristic anecdotes best calculated to exhibit this estimable woman in the truest light   The distinctions between different kinds of attachment were never less marked than in her The sentiment was one and the same in her and assumed the decided cast of her character much more than that of the different relations of life or the disposition of the persons she loved In her maternal and filial affection friendship gratitude all seemed love lhere was passion or at least emotion in all her attachments They appeared to differ rather in intensity than in kind and they were naturally expansive ardent impetuous and even stormy not that these storms were the effect of any caprice in Madame de Stael but she revolted against the obstacles which the frame of society and often human indolence oppose to the enjoyments of the heart For a long time she comprehended only her own manner of loving for a long time she refused to believe the existence of sincere sentiments that did not express themselves like hers and the clear knowledge that she had of herself led her into error when she judged of others from herself But her most ardent reproaches were also the most affecting her love was conspicuous through her anger She never gave pain to another but because she felt more herself and you could not avoid pitying her even when she wounded you most severely The affection of Madame de Stael for her father evinced itself on every occasion by the most watchful attention on him during his life and after his death she conceived she had lost everr earthly comfort with him  1 It would be necessary to relate how every day passed with Madame de Stael if we would give an idea of the place that her deceased father constantly retained in her heart She never ceased to live with him She always felt herself protected consoled succoured by him She invoked him in her prayers and never did any occurrence that was fortunate for her take place without her saying iC My father obtained that for ne His miniature she always carried about her and it was to her the object of a kind of superstition She never parted with it except on one occasion Very ill herself and finding great consolation in contemplating this portrait she imagined that when her daughter lay in it would produce the same effect on her Accordingly she sent it to her desiring her to look on it when she was in pain Every old man too recalled her father to her mind and made aparticular impression on her To every thing in which old men were concerned she was peculiarly sensible and once when in the time of her persecutions an old man acted towards her with a degree of pusillanimity then common and undoubtedly more excusable at such an age she wras extraordinarily grieved at it  I am very silly said she to me  but what would you have he was kind he was old he sat at my table I altered my hours for him and all these things grieve me to the heart Her bounty to the aged who stood in need of her assistance was immense the idea of their sufferings tore her heart and as true Christians see Jesus Christ in all who are poor she saw her father in every man that was old Her affection for her mother was scarcely less ardent and although she manifested the utmost forbearance towards Madame de Genlis who never ceased to attack her with severe criticisms yet when the same lady spoke in unfavourable terms of Madame Necker it was with the utmost difficulty she could be restrained from resenting it  There is great beauty in the thought of that basrelief which after the death of M Necker Madame de Stael had sculptured on the funeral monuments cf her parents An airy figure as if already beatified is drawing towards the skies another that appears to look with compassion on a young woman veiled and prostrate on a tomb Madame Necker her husband and her daughter are represented under this emblem which likewise indicates the passage from this life to life eternal The motto of Madame de Stael might have been the following verse which she often repeated with emotion    O liberte de Rome 6 manes de mon pere   O Roman freedom manes of my father  Madame de Stael could not avoid forming many friendshins She whispered this sentiment almost at first sight and she was touched with the effect which she produced and yet it was difficult to attain the highest places in her affections  There are ninety dtgrevs fixed saul she in my affections ami only ten moveable She was always free in her remarks on her friends and spared none of tho objects of her attachment   This continual appreciation of her friends not only every one but of each daily this appreciation made incessantly  their presence sometimes hutt them and led them to doubt her affection  With you we must submit to be judged it fresh cost every morning said Ito her  What signifies it answered she  if I love thee more every pveningrNbc added  Were I going to the scaffold V could not help passingjudgment on the friends that accompanied me In her habitual society Madame de Stael was full of charms In bur company there was no restraint thus lu r superiority did not bear heavy on any person  she asked only for amusement not for trials of skill i She could not endure people to talk with indifference How can he expect me to attend to him she would ay  when he does not do himself the honour to attend to himself  She could better endure certain defects of charade r than a mind dried up and disgusted and she said one dav rt an egotist and caviller  That man talks only of himself but he does not tire me hecuase I am certain ul lea t that he feels interested in what he says   She had an occupation in society very different from that of shining and pleasing  she wa the naturalist observing a species as well as the orator that would persuade  But what deranged this study completely what took from her all interest in peoples words was affectation This tault which effaces every prominent feature which substitutes a false and monotonous phantom instead of the inunene variety of moral nature was profoundly tiresome to her ami scarcely less vexatious She expressed herself thus on ihe subject  There is never any such thing as a tele dtCe with affected people the personage assumed makes a third and it is thlsthat answers when you speak to the otherAffected people are the only persons fi om whom nothing is to le learned Exaggeration too displeased her much  lt is no proof of imagination to put a hundred in place of ten she would say For the same reason she was always suspicious of great expressions of sensibility all natural feeling she remarked  have a degree of modesty  From a sketch of her conversation political opitnons and repartees we shall select a few of the most striking passages  When she was told of the follies of some witty man she would say f Give him more wit and all these will van h One of her Swedish friends observing to her  Whatever von may say witty people commit a great many faults die answered  that is very true  but unfortunately stupid persons do the same though nobody thinks it worth while to ur  tice them Another time she said  the follies of men os wit are the profits of ordinary men  Her attachment to France never abated not even ui i she had been banished from it ami incurred the enmity of its rulers I have a corroding grief respecting France she wrote  which 1 love more than ever And again  I have felt clearly that 1 cannot live without that France But it must be confessed her country was more eset lally Paris   Show me the rue de Bac said she once to some persons who wanted her to admire the splendid view of ti e I ac of Geneva and its banks  I would willingly live at fris said she again  with a hundred pounds a j ear itt a lodging up four pair of stairs In 1806 when shepent four dtys ni Paris in concealment her greatest pleasure was to walk out ia night to view the streets by moonlight  I have a constancy of heart she wrote u and an inconstancy of mind for whick a country is formed where the scenes are incessantly renewing and where 1 have my old friends   It is very remarkable that always cutting to the quick in disputation always touching the most sensible points she always conciliated in her presence those whom a vague idea of her had previously made her enemies You might be grazed be wounded in the contest but you always went away healed or at least she had applied balsam to the sore   You desire then my death or my dishonour said an emigrant to her in Switzerland as he was going to the army on the frontiers  No answered she  what I wish is your defeat and yourglcry I would have you except being slain be like Hector the hero of a vanquished army  The following are given as a few of her bon mots on public events  While she was in England in 1814 some person thought fit to congratulate her on the taking of Paris which put an end to her banishment To these expressions of politeness she answered  On what do you compliment me pray On my being in the height of distress  It was from the date of the battle of Leipsic that she began to be alarmed for France 4 In 1815 when Bonaparte had already entered Lyons a lady attached to his party came and said to Madame de Stael  The emperor knows Madame how generously you spoke of him during his misfortunes I hope answered she  he will know how much I detest him  During the hundred days she said  If all the declamatory phrases uttered this winter against the revolution had been enlisted we should have had plenty of soldiers ou the COth of March  In 1810 Mr Canning having thought proper to say to Madame de Stael in the apartment of the first gentleman of the bedchamber in the palace of the Tuillcries  lt is useless to indulge any longer in illusions madam France has submitted to u and we have conquered youYes answered sile  because you had all Europe and the Cossacs on your side but meet us tetedtete and we shall see She  said also to Mr Canning  The English nation is deceived  it is not aware that it is employed to deprive other nations of the liberty enjoyed by itself and to protect intolerance toward its brethren in religion  if it knew this it would renounce those who thus abuse its name   Fiance said she  must remain as dead as long as it is occupied by foreigners First let us have independence and then think of libertv  She said of Mr De Bonald  He is the philosopher of antiphilosophy  but this will not carry a man very far   The ministerial party observed she  looks at the prosaic side of human nature and opposition at the poetical side This is why I have always had an inclination for the opinions ofthe latter  Some person once maintained that it was impossible for ministers of state to confine themselves to the employment of strictly legitimate measures What would youhave me say answered she he who possesses genius can never have occasion for immorality and he who has not should not accept a post of difficulty  In 1816 she said of the ministry  I do not

Sketch ofthe Life Character and Writings of Baroness de StaelHolstein  3 v   By Madame Necker de Saussure Translated from the French bvo pp 30J London IS 20 Madame de Stael was a lady possessed o such extraor dinary genius and splendid talents and filled so important a part in the literature and politics of the time in which she lived that whatever relates to her as illustrative either of her public or private character cannot fail of being interesting The first of female writers perhaps of this or of auy age she not only possessed a commanding influence in France during the most eventful period of its history but her opinions were inquired after with eagerness and respected if not admired in every state of Europe Some persons have affected to question the moral tendency of the writings of Madame de Stael and passing over the knowledge of human nature the fidelity of observation and the acuteness of remark which she displayed in all her writings haye with a most fastidious delicacy carped at some passages which taken even abstractedly were never doubtful The present work does not contain a regular biographical memoir of this illustrious woman but a critical examination of her writings aud a variety of anecdotes of her domestic and social life and when it is known that these anecdotes are related by the friend and near relation of Madame de Stael who was honoured by her with the appellation of sister and passed many years of her life in the closest intimacy with her it will not be doubted that they are highly interesting We will not follow Madame de Saussure through her critical remarks on the respective works of Madame de Stael and this is the less necessary as their superior excellence is now universally acknowledged  but shall content ourselves with making one extract from this part of the work and then puss on to that part of it which describes her in private life which is the more interesting as it is the least known In u  general examination ofthe talents of Madame de Stael the author remarks   Before she appeared religion and knowledge had their separate defenders These two grand causes have been pleaded as we may say in opposition each finding itself a stranger to a whole system of ideas there has been in this respect a secret division among mankind one party only appearing to tolerate the reign of reason the other that of faith out of pure civility  Madame de Stael alone has embraced with equal zeal the party of knowledge and that of religion she alone has adopted from the bottom of her heart whatever was best in different ages combating on one side ancient prejudices and ignorance and on the other modern selfishness and incredulity   Madame de Stael loved what was about her and extended to human nature her affection for her friends What her style wants of minute finish is more than compensated by the charm of the first impulse by the freshness ofthe inspiration if I may venture to use the term lt is the stream gushing with vivacity from the fountain that sparkles as it flows  But something else may be remarked in her talents than this combination of different faculties there is a marked originality in each yet all bearing a similar stamp which is pe culiar to Madame de Stael T his peculiar stamp originates from her character from the strength as well as the versatile nature of her impressions from those sudden bursts of indignation of compassion of haughtiness and also from her never ceasing to be a woman  This last is perhaps her secret charm She addresses herself as a woman to the reader and presents herself personally to him to tell him what passes in her mind and also in his own But she is aware that he would soon forget her being a woman if she ceased to appear amiable or attractive to him accordingly whether she endeavours to instruct or dazzle she never overpowers him with her superioritv he never arrogates to herself any preeminence It seems as if chance had afforded her a good place at the theatre of moral affairs and she recited what was thus offered to her view  Sometimes too she presents herself as a child guiding a wiseman whose sight is a little indistinct She explains to him all he perceives confusedly and places him in a bright sunshine that he may see a little more clearly himself When she comes to lead him through steep and difficult paths she says to him  do not be afraid you will be glad you have passed we shall soon get safe out of it Constantly endeavouring to render the road agreeable to him she brings herself forward to divert him by rallying herself a little for the strong impressions she receives Persons words faces accents attitudesdresses every thing in fact strikes her everv thing is characteristic in her pictures She knows herself as well as she knows others and that blind instinct which so frequently determines us to like or dislike is in hera feeling founded on motives of which she gives a clear account  The precision of her views is such that we forget their extreme clelicacy She has no vain subtilty does not compel r j her readers to discern what is imperceptible but even thing l  enlarges under her hands lier whole attention is bent for ail instant to each point and it becomes so distinct to her that none of its bearings escape her notice but she takes care to connect threads too slender of themselves with others more strong the importance of which is acknowledged Thus we easily pass with her from the particulars to the whole and we find ourselves at once at the root of ideas when we fancied we were only tracing their remotest ramifications  The copiousness of her thoughts is extraordinary Perhaps no writer has equalled her in this respect Take at a venture any three of her pages and three of the authors most abounding in wit we may venture a wager that the number of striking and original ideas will be greatest in Madame de Stael Not that she affects conciseness every thought is amply furnished with the necessary words but we are not accustomed to see so many thoughts together and perhaps there are two manyperhaps certain phrases which are superfluous to the train of reasoning have on the mind the effect of those bits of cloth in the harpsichord which stop the vibration of one string before another is struck The succession of thoughts is too rapid and continual in Madame de Stael to allow ordinary minds to keep pace with it She is the goddess of plenty she scatters from full hands corn pearls roses ribands and diadems We would Jet nothing escape us because every thing is of value but we may be fatigued in collecting it  On the whole the works of Madame de Stael appear to belong to a new age they announce as they tend to produce another period in society and in literature the age of strong generous animated thoughts sentiments proceeding from the bottom of the heart She has furnished the idea of a literature in some sort rather spoken than written of a kind in which the extempore speaking of national assemblies unrestrained confidence and conversational sallies inform us more strongly and more intimately of politics of the passions and of society than studied rhetoric has ever done The second part of this work is entitled  Social and Domestic Life of Madame de Stael and consists of a series of characteristic anecdotes best calculated to exhibit this estimable woman in the truest light   The distinctions between different kinds of attachment were never less marked than in her The sentiment was one and the same in her and assumed the decided cast of her character much more than that of the different relations of life or the disposition of the persons she loved In her maternal and filial affection friendship gratitude all seemed love lhere was passion or at least emotion in all her attachments They appeared to differ rather in intensity than in kind and they were naturally expansive ardent impetuous and even stormy not that these storms were the effect of any caprice in Madame de Stael but she revolted against the obstacles which the frame of society and often human indolence oppose to the enjoyments of the heart For a long time she comprehended only her own manner of loving for a long time she refused to believe the existence of sincere sentiments that did not express themselves like hers and the clear knowledge that she had of herself led her into error when she judged of others from herself But her most ardent reproaches were also the most affecting her love was conspicuous through her anger She never gave pain to another but because she felt more herself and you could not avoid pitying her even when she wounded you most severely The affection of Madame de Stael for her father evinced itself on every occasion by the most watchful attention on him during his life and after his death she conceived she had lost everr earthly comfort with him  1 It would be necessary to relate how every day passed with Madame de Stael if we would give an idea of the place that her deceased father constantly retained in her heart She never ceased to live with him She always felt herself protected consoled succoured by him She invoked him in her prayers and never did any occurrence that was fortunate for her take place without her saying iC My father obtained that for ne His miniature she always carried about her and it was to her the object of a kind of superstition She never parted with it except on one occasion Very ill herself and finding great consolation in contemplating this portrait she imagined that when her daughter lay in it would produce the same effect on her Accordingly she sent it to her desiring her to look on it when she was in pain Every old man too recalled her father to her mind and made aparticular impression on her To every thing in which old men were concerned she was peculiarly sensible and once when in the time of her persecutions an old man acted towards her with a degree of pusillanimity then common and undoubtedly more excusable at such an age she wras extraordinarily grieved at it  I am very silly said she to me  but what would you have he was kind he was old he sat at my table I altered my hours for him and all these things grieve me to the heart Her bounty to the aged who stood in need of her assistance was immense the idea of their sufferings tore her heart and as true Christians see Jesus Christ in all who are poor she saw her father in every man that was old Her affection for her mother was scarcely less ardent and although she manifested the utmost forbearance towards Madame de Genlis who never ceased to attack her with severe criticisms yet when the same lady spoke in unfavourable terms of Madame Necker it was with the utmost difficulty she could be restrained from resenting it  There is great beauty in the thought of that basrelief which after the death of M Necker Madame de Stael had sculptured on the funeral monuments cf her parents An airy figure as if already beatified is drawing towards the skies another that appears to look with compassion on a young woman veiled and prostrate on a tomb Madame Necker her husband and her daughter are represented under this emblem which likewise indicates the passage from this life to life eternal The motto of Madame de Stael might have been the following verse which she often repeated with emotion    O liberte de Rome 6 manes de mon pere   O Roman freedom manes of my father  Madame de Stael could not avoid forming many friendshins She whispered this sentiment almost at first sight and she was touched with the effect which she produced and yet it was difficult to attain the highest places in her affections  There are ninety dtgrevs fixed saul she in my affections ami only ten moveable She was always free in her remarks on her friends and spared none of tho objects of her attachment   This continual appreciation of her friends not only every one but of each daily this appreciation made incessantly  their presence sometimes hutt them and led them to doubt her affection  With you we must submit to be judged it fresh cost every morning said Ito her  What signifies it answered she  if I love thee more every pveningrNbc added  Were I going to the scaffold V could not help passingjudgment on the friends that accompanied me In her habitual society Madame de Stael was full of charms In bur company there was no restraint thus lu r superiority did not bear heavy on any person  she asked only for amusement not for trials of skill i She could not endure people to talk with indifference How can he expect me to attend to him she would ay  when he does not do himself the honour to attend to himself  She could better endure certain defects of charade r than a mind dried up and disgusted and she said one dav rt an egotist and caviller  That man talks only of himself but he does not tire me hecuase I am certain ul lea t that he feels interested in what he says   She had an occupation in society very different from that of shining and pleasing  she wa the naturalist observing a species as well as the orator that would persuade  But what deranged this study completely what took from her all interest in peoples words was affectation This tault which effaces every prominent feature which substitutes a false and monotonous phantom instead of the inunene variety of moral nature was profoundly tiresome to her ami scarcely less vexatious She expressed herself thus on ihe subject  There is never any such thing as a tele dtCe with affected people the personage assumed makes a third and it is thlsthat answers when you speak to the otherAffected people are the only persons fi om whom nothing is to le learned Exaggeration too displeased her much  lt is no proof of imagination to put a hundred in place of ten she would say For the same reason she was always suspicious of great expressions of sensibility all natural feeling she remarked  have a degree of modesty  From a sketch of her conversation political opitnons and repartees we shall select a few of the most striking passages  When she was told of the follies of some witty man she would say f Give him more wit and all these will van h One of her Swedish friends observing to her  Whatever von may say witty people commit a great many faults die answered  that is very true  but unfortunately stupid persons do the same though nobody thinks it worth while to ur  tice them Another time she said  the follies of men os wit are the profits of ordinary men  Her attachment to France never abated not even ui i she had been banished from it ami incurred the enmity of its rulers I have a corroding grief respecting France she wrote  which 1 love more than ever And again  I have felt clearly that 1 cannot live without that France But it must be confessed her country was more eset lally Paris   Show me the rue de Bac said she once to some persons who wanted her to admire the splendid view of ti e I ac of Geneva and its banks  I would willingly live at fris said she again  with a hundred pounds a j ear itt a lodging up four pair of stairs In 1806 when shepent four dtys ni Paris in concealment her greatest pleasure was to walk out ia night to view the streets by moonlight  I have a constancy of heart she wrote u and an inconstancy of mind for whick a country is formed where the scenes are incessantly renewing and where 1 have my old friends   It is very remarkable that always cutting to the quick in disputation always touching the most sensible points she always conciliated in her presence those whom a vague idea of her had previously made her enemies You might be grazed be wounded in the contest but you always went away healed or at least she had applied balsam to the sore   You desire then my death or my dishonour said an emigrant to her in Switzerland as he was going to the army on the frontiers  No answered she  what I wish is your defeat and yourglcry I would have you except being slain be like Hector the hero of a vanquished army  The following are given as a few of her bon mots on public events  While she was in England in 1814 some person thought fit to congratulate her on the taking of Paris which put an end to her banishment To these expressions of politeness she answered  On what do you compliment me pray On my being in the height of distress  It was from the date of the battle of Leipsic that she began to be alarmed for France 4 In 1815 when Bonaparte had already entered Lyons a lady attached to his party came and said to Madame de Stael  The emperor knows Madame how generously you spoke of him during his misfortunes I hope answered she  he will know how much I detest him  During the hundred days she said  If all the declamatory phrases uttered this winter against the revolution had been enlisted we should have had plenty of soldiers ou the COth of March  In 1810 Mr Canning having thought proper to say to Madame de Stael in the apartment of the first gentleman of the bedchamber in the palace of the Tuillcries  lt is useless to indulge any longer in illusions madam France has submitted to u and we have conquered youYes answered sile  because you had all Europe and the Cossacs on your side but meet us tetedtete and we shall see She  said also to Mr Canning  The English nation is deceived  it is not aware that it is employed to deprive other nations of the liberty enjoyed by itself and to protect intolerance toward its brethren in religion  if it knew this it would renounce those who thus abuse its name   Fiance said she  must remain as dead as long as it is occupied by foreigners First let us have independence and then think of libertv  She said of Mr De Bonald  He is the philosopher of antiphilosophy  but this will not carry a man very far   The ministerial party observed she  looks at the prosaic side of human nature and opposition at the poetical side This is why I have always had an inclination for the opinions ofthe latter  Some person once maintained that it was impossible for ministers of state to confine themselves to the employment of strictly legitimate measures What would youhave me say answered she he who possesses genius can never have occasion for immorality and he who has not should not accept a post of difficulty  In 1816 she said of the ministry  I do not like it yet 1 prefer it It is but a barrier of cotton against the return of old abuses yet still it is a barrier  On occasion of the great number of persons enobled she said  It would be best to create France a marquis once for all l  She set no great value on puns yet she occasionally uttered them with her usual quickness in a dispute on the slave trade with a French lady of high rank the

Skirmishing By the Author of Cousin Stella Smith Elder  Co Skirmishing is not a very attractive title but it serves as the portal to avery charming story The incidents are slight indicated rather than detailed The scene is only a secluded village in the depth of the country without even a markettown or a railway in the neighbourhood but the characters are all human beings their sayings and doings are spirited and characteristic and the whole story rouses the readers thorough sympathy There is a rector an excellent sensible kindhearted man well to do in the worldhis wife a handsome bright prosperous woman French by her mothers side but with a thorough English sense of respectability and a horror of doing anything likely to incur blame or ridicule She is not unmerciful nor unwilling to help people in trouble or suffering  but she had always a piivate belief that it was on the whole peoples own doing Her mother Madame Lescrimiere is the perfection of an old lady She is charming she too is halfFrench but her nature is quite different from her daughters she bas a breadth and depth of sympathy a pity and forgiveness which it were heartily to be wished were more common the misery and the anguish always hid from her the fault if fault there were She is witty graceful gracious and wilful to a degree that must captivate the reader though no doubt it occasionally drove her daughter to distraction Then there is her granddaughter Maud a charming English girl engaged to her fathers curate who as he has won her affection must we are willing to believe have had some good qualities  but so far as his appearance in this story is concerned he ia entirely detestable It is wonderful how seldom young curates in stories at least are anything else He cannot understand Madame Lescrimiere at all he feels her atrial and  a trial for which he was not at all thankful there was something about her which he qualified to himself as disorder she hated routine never would receive any notion on authority and  would insist on discussing its reasonableness and credibility A certain Mrs Brown takes an old house long untenanted her whole household consisting only of a son and an old German servant To the horror the scandal and the disappointed curiosity ot the whole village she does not appear at church Madame Lescrimiere boldly stands up for her and insists upon her being received within the pale Here is her mode of  skirmishing   Oh my dear curate she said waving ber hand  I know what you are going to say perfectly well I dont deny your reasonsonly allow that I am reasonable also when I beg you to remember that there were Christiansexcellent the best of Christiansbefore they had any church to go to Ah you dont forget I am sure that the JewB and Pagans persecuted and despised them for not going to thiir temples Now dont all of you look as though I deserved to be packed up between two faggots but listen to a story The dear old ladys motto up to which she always acted was  Never repent of a kind action however it turns out for yourself The Browns ave visited by the rector and his wife We shall not forestall the readers interest in this charming story by unveiling the sad mystery which overclouds Mrs Brown and that has obliged her to try and hide herself from the world Her story is well indicated but the tale turns rather on the complication of village politics than on Mrs Browns antecedents although Madame Lescrimiere seems at one time to have got the respected rectory family into a scrape she is in the end triumphantly vindicated The little cloud of misunderstanding and gentle scandal in which the stiff and reserved young curate finds himself innocently involved teaches him a lesson of charity towards others of which he stood greatly in need Mrs Brown herself and poor Georgy give Bubstance to the interest of the story and form the centre round which all revolves The story is graceful and charming for the skill with which the slight incidents are narrated as well as the sweet broad loving charity of heart that is inculcated,juvenile

STORIES AND FAIRY TALES By HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN Tranislated by H OSKAR SOMMER PhD With loo pictures by A J GsKIN 2 vols each 6s George Allen All the stories are here not the fairy ones alone That is one point to be noted about the book Reading Andersen in a practically complete edition like thisfor one always forgets to remember his novelsone is struck by the excellence of even his average work He wrote a little handful of stories that deserve immortality but as can be seen here out of the slightest of motiveshecould make something at least pretty his talent his art never forsook him even when his genius was not alight Dr Sommers translation is exceedingly good It is so very simple that you may not see at first its real skill but read a few of the stories through and its charm steals over you It is simple not in the sense that it condescends to children but with the simplicity of good literature The translators work should receive recognition We hope it may and that Mr Gaskin for all his merits may not run away with all the praise A good many of Mr Gaskins drawings for the book will have been seen at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition where they had an honoured place and no wonder The school of draughtmanship to which outwardly he belongs has prodiiced a great deal of work beautiful regarded as mere decorati n but which set to illustrate tales of real moving human life is unsatisfactoryit delights the eye but it is not what illustrations should be a commentary on an illumination of the text This cannot be said of the pictures here While altogether removed from commonplace realism they are yet instinct with life with feeling with humour The tenderness in The Loveliest Rose of the World in The Bond of Friendship in  Ib and Christine and in The Wild Swans is quite as remarkable as the beautiful detail the decorative qualities in  The Marsh Kings Daughter  The Daisy  The Goloshes of Fortune and  A Leaf from Heaven to name only a few Many words are not needed to express hearty appreciation The whole hundred of them are pictures not merely to admire but to linger over with keen delight The volumes are good specimens of printing Indeed Mr Gaskin is only the chief collaborator in the production of two volumes of rare artistic excellence which have been issued too not as editions de luxe but which are within the reach of at least a very great many who value good work riE LOVELIEST ROSE IN MHE WORLD From I Stories and Fairy Tales by H C Andercn  Allun THE MARsH KINGs DAUGHTER From Stories and Fairy Tales by H C Andersen G AllenFAIRY TALES FAIRIES may be simple or sophisticated beautiful or hideous friendly or hateful prim and precise or tanglehaired and teasing  but whatever they are their adventures should always be told simply Its hopeless to make a fuss about the fairies the fuss aesthetic the fuss of folklore the fuss moralizing the fuss gruesome all of these are ruin for a fairy tale for children The best authors have been guilty at times There are moments when even Andersen makes the reader sit up with an indignant  That didnt happen and then with a delicate pop away goes the fairy tale and ones happy credulity The best stories are the old stories told quite simply  they may be in language a little conventional as was the language of Mrs Freers  Old Deccan Days  and some of the older versions of the  Arabian Nights but they must have that gravity that respectful manner which show that the author does not regard his work with anything but a serious craftsmans interesthe is neither writing down norworse horror writing up Of our Ghristmas fairy books this year one is written by a man who has a touch a little beyond talent Mr James Stephens in Irish Fairy Tales Macmillan 15s net has not forgotten that he is writing for children  he keeps his humour and his rather rascally gaiety and the wisdom in his stories of Fionn and Oisin Bran and Mongan is quiet and unobtrusive He gives too a definition of fairyland which may serve for the older ones as well as for the children   Everything that is here is there but the things that are there are better than those that are here All things that are bright are there brighter There is more gold in the sun and more silver in the moon of that land There is more scent on the flowers more savour in the fruit There is more comeliness in the men and more tenderness in the women Mr Rackhams pictures are amazing in their grotesque fancy the reptiles the uncanny rocks the ogreish people could not be bettered  but his beautiful people are not of fairyland at all They decorate instead of inspiring Carlo Lorenzini who wrote as Collodi knew how simple a fairy tale might be  he made one out of a piece of wood and many children have already rejoiced over  Pinocchio  Lippincott 10s 6d net This new edition has bad colourillustrations by Miss Maria Kirk and fairly good drawings by someone unnamed These however are distributed in a distracting way round the text which makes it hard to look at them and tiresome to read the text One gladly turns to Miss Pyles pleasantly written and charmingly illustrated  Wonder Tales from Many Lands Harrap 6s net one of the best and least pretentious books of the year Miss Pyle works in penandink with the addition of a slight wash of colour and her illustrations are full of simplicity The best that can be said of  Grimms Fairy Tales Ward  Lock 6s net is that it is always good to meet Grimm again and that as the pictures are printed apart from the text they need not greatly interfere with the enjoyment of the stories But how Rackhams illustrations in Snowdrop and Hansel and Gretel Constable 17s 6d net each add to that enjoyment  The artist is here at his best He has no poetry to reckon with only legend and whim and fun and a little shiver and a horro or two He draws gnomes which a rationalist would ache to nurse  his valiant Tailor has a spirit a gust which would stir an Esquimaux in the winter season His other book this year is  The Sleeping Beauty Heinemann 7s 6d net illustrated in the main with those dashing exciting little black silhouettes familiar to all his admirers Mr G S Evans must be congratulated on his retelling of this story It is done with great charm and humour  and Mr Evans never forgets that all good fairy stories have to read aloud well That alas  is the last praise which could be given to  Bengal Fairy Tales Lane 15s net by Mr Bradley Birt The book has many merits It gives us some new tales and it has illustrations of interest rather than beauty by Abanindranath Tagore Mr Birt writes like this he  evolved a scheme which was to impersonate a ghost by uttering aloud some indistinct nasal noises  or again  Uxoriousness was one of the weaknesses of the king Another king  puts a check to this risibility  and a Brahmin buys not food but  the necessary articles of consumption It is a comfort to turn to Mrs Biggs Polish Fairy Tales Lane 16s net with its fullblooded embroidered illustrations by Cecile Walton These are adapted from the Polish collection of Glin ski and are peasants tales like those in Grimms collection It is only in such versions one gets at once the national differences and the unity which binds all the simple people of the world Mrs Walton has something which Rackham lacksher work is not merely suffused by it is instinct with the character of the tales she is illustrating One experiences not the least change in mood in passing from the text to the picturesa happiness which as a rule comes only when the author has illustrated the book as in The Rose and the Ring In Tristram and Isoude Harrap 21s net Miss Evelyn Paul is her own illustrator to her version of this tale drawn she says out of the Latin into romance by Robert de Borron and Lucas de Gast It is a difficult book to appraise fairly Of Miss Pauls high decorative skill there is no doubt There are initials and borders here which not only derive from the Book of Kells but could bear looking at beside that splendour Some of her crowded swift little pictures have the genuine thrill which the low ceilings and hot atmosphere of Rossetti can give There is too a real touch of individuality about the pictures especially about the figures  Miss Paul is a truer mediaevalist than were the PreRaphaelite Brothers Yet there is a slight affectation in the work and a good deal in the text Miss Paul will not be as simple as she knows how and so misses the reward which she might have Miss Chaundler has rifled the old legends in  Arthur and his Knights  Nisbet 15s net and has given us a book which can be read aloud The style is a little flat a little infected with the drab emphasis of an unintelligent nurse who always bears hardly on the conjunctions and the prepositions but she is free from any attempts at mediaevalism and her knights speak with the pleasant pretending accents of children playing a game Miss Southwarts The Password to Fairyland Simpkin  Marshall 15s net is an effort to follow E Nesbits brave example Miss Soutbwart has failed She has the worst fault that a writer of fairy tales can havefacetiousness The very names of her fairiesWhoooo Skygold Pixie Brighteye Fleecywhitebetray the mixture of sentiment and joke Her fairies would never stand cold water or clear air They are tittering tweaking little fellows dancing selfconsciously like precocious children who desire to get applause from their elders They would use a passport rather than a password R Ellis Roberts,juvenile
STORIES FROM THE BIBLE The first impression is what good value for money is this stout and well printed volume and by such an author  The next feeling is one of uneasy apprehension How  Stories from the Bible  The book is obviously not an anthology of extracts Has Mr de la Mare been bold enough to rewrite the prose which is inwoven with the memories of childish years for so many of us  One opens the volume at random at the story of The Plagues of Egypt and starts reading a paragraph So it continued for seven days And when the seven days were at an end Moses came again into the presence of Pharaoh Is ones fear allayed by that  Or this For now the river not only continued to flow bloodred but the fish in it perished Or this  The river stank and not the river alone   Partly the prejudiced inclination for the already familiar has made us ready to be irritated on any provocation but still there is something not quite right about such things as these It seems somehow neither the Bible nor the Walter de la Mare whose prose we admire So wonderingly we turn to the pleasant  Introduction and find quickly that no man can be more convinced of the dangers that beset his task than the author himself for he savs  ords in their influence are subtle and delicate bevond all things known to man and the least change in them when the are in company or the least addition to that company cannot but entail a change of meaning a change that is in their complete effect on the mind and spirit of the reader Then to illustrate this truth Mr de la Mlare quotes parallel passages in the Book of Ruth from different versions the  Wycliffe  I382 the  Wycliffe  revised by John Purvey 1386 the Miles Coverdale version 1536 the Geneva Bible 1560 the Douai Bible 16o9 the Authorised Version 161 i It is a most instructive lesson and just the kind which would leave a treasure in the mind for ever and there comes the reflection how happy a mortal is that child who discovers the  story  of C Come Hither  for himself and then reads what Mr Nahums grownup disciple has done in these renderings of Old Testament stories made  to put that remembrance of what the Bible meant to him as a child  as completely as I can into words For doubts and fears depart with a straightforward reading It is no compliment to Mr de la Mare to pretend against ones better judgment that there are no flaws at all in the prose anywhere no flaws that is of a kind avoidable by such a writer as Mr de la Mare there are a few uneasy and inept touches when perhaps the wish to enliven the manner was not accompanied by his generally exquisite sense of rhythm and style But as a whole these renderings show that literary style and the simple beauty which should be but is too rarely made the test of suitability for childrens reading are not incompatible but necessary one to the other That alone is a triumph It is to be expected that in recording his imaginative experience of the old stories Mr de la Mare should sometimes abandon the bald directness of the Bible narrative e  Stories From the Bible By Walter de la Mare 7S 6d Faber  Faber and though the change involves often a real sacrifice it is not difficult to be reconciled to the new beauty of detail introduced such detail and such atmosphere must surely give to a young reader visions which the old narrative alone could not Even the sophisticated reader will find himself constantly thanking the author for enriched understanding fresh perceptions This is especially true where the setting allows scope for the characteristic prose of Mr de la Mare To say that the reader of  The Riddle and Other Stories  will not be disappointed with this book is perhaps the aptest praise possible But this is to speak of the mere writing which if it is less free from the  defects and shortcomings  referred to by the author in his introduction is nevertheless the fruit of a task far more difficult accomplished as perhaps no other living English writer could have accomplished it Consider the field covered by this volume divided into nine main sections headed  The Garden of Eden   The Flood Joseph   Moses  The Wilderness  Samson Samuel   Saul David Think of the dreadful pitfalls awaiting anybody who would rewrite the Bible stories under these headings  Is it not then a triumph to have enriched future generations of readers with so little offence to the most unprepared and irritable  There are uninteresting irrelevances and ugly barbarities in the Old Testament A child may come to such a book as this losing hardly anything of worth except an occasional marvel of directness but gaining contact with the ancient word and also with the rare mind of a poet writing in his own language R L MEGROZ,juvenile

notice of Cowper prevented our drawing attention to the special merits of this new edition The great feature in it is the admirable biography which Mr Bruce has given us and the excellent use he has made of the fresh material at his disposal Much light is thrown upon the poets poverty and on his mode of life The neglect of Lord Thurlow to do anything for his old fellow clerk is distinctly proved Air Bruce promises us a volume of correspondence and other papers connected with the subject which cannot fail to be interesting Facsimiles of the original titlepages of Cowpers various productions

Poetical Works of Robert Story MINOR MINSTRELS Longman ft CoA collection of poems by Mr Story has interest just now when so many poems are put forth and such opposite opinions are asserted The followers of Landor Browning and Tennyson would at once denounce Mr Storybut we fancy that Landor Browning and Tennyson themselves would see something in him to admire Poets are not always irritable to poets but their followers affect the hostility of a clanship At the ago of sixtytwo Mr Story collects the labours of his literary lifehis poems covering a period of forty yearsfrom 1816 to 1857commencing when Byron had only begun to assert himself before Keats had published and when Shelley was writing sternly under blighting miscomprehension and calumny when Wordsworth and Coleridge had few readers and when it was perversely held that poetry should be modelled on something that had gone before The varied reputations made iu forty years never seduced Mr Story from the path he originally chose Beginning life as a Northumberland herdboy he was  literally charmed by Dr Watts but springing from so slight a hillock of inspiration he dashed into a style resembling the minor flights of Burns then as now most keenly loved and appreciated amongst an otherwise unread Northern peasantry His poems are dated and usually have some two or three lines of historical gossip which give interest because clearly carrying truth The first poems are all loveMary K To the same To the same by the dozen when other ladies supplant Mary precisely as we find in Burns In 123 Mr Story wrote with a grand simplicity of construction idea and sequenceof which wo furnish a fair specimen In Mays expansive ether Floats many a downy cloudSome white and pure as silver Some edged and streaked wi gowd I care na for the gorgeous sight Though fair aa sight may be My bonnie Craven lassie Is the dearest sight to me In later years Mr Story necessarily changes and devotes his energies to songs of peace and war Thus 1853 We rear no war defying flag Though armed for battle still Th feeble if he like may brag The powerful never win The flag we rear in every breeze Float where it may or when Waves forth a signal oer the seas OfPeace Goodwill to men I In the following year the note changes Bring out the old Warflag Long now it has lain Its foldsrich with gloryall piously furled And the hope of our heart was that never again Should we see it float forth in the wars of the world For stUl we remembered the blood and the tears Both realfor sight not imaginedfor song That dimmed een its triumphs through many dark years When it waved in the battles of Right against Wrong We have shown the elements of Mr Storys volume As a writer of songs following in the wake of Burns Campbell and Allan Cunningham he has been successful his songs have for years been sung in  domestic circles  and at political gatherings But they are of a past age andfor a period at leastcannot hope to contend with  A Soul s Agonies After a time readers may be glad to return to rustic simplicity and clear their souls with verse fresh from the mountain and the moor Mr Story will then take his turnThc Poetical Worts

TE LITERARY EXIER The MiU on Ow Floss By George Eliot Author ofI  Scenes of Clerical Lifle and  Adam Bode In tlree volumes Blackwood and Sons It is worth while to inquire why one of the cleverest books of the day should be nearly the most tedious There is more evidence of the authors natural wit in The Mill on the Floes than there was in Adam Bede and a good natural wit is the first qualification of a storyteller It may be however that the cleverer book is at a disadvantage even in its cleverness Ostendere not ostentare is an ancient warning The wit that shot up naturally in the former works of this writer and that was as pleasant in the  Scenes from Clerical Life as in  Adam Bede having been lately shut up in a hothouse of too fervid praise is forced into excess of blossoming Throughout The Mill on the Floss strain is evident It is an honourable strain to meet the utmost praise with the utmost deserving We know no example of a writer of genius forced into unnatural display of power who is more free than George Eliot from all meanness of affectation Overelaboration then may be one cause of the tediousness of the book Charming sketches of childlife in former writings had received the commendation they deserved and so the first three hundred and sixty pages of The Mill on the Floss are spent on minute painting of a boy and girl The old praise is more than justified but the justification is attended by no small waste of the readers patience Even as girl and boy Maggie and Tom weary us As they grow up they are made to weary us so much that by the time the story ends we are most grateful for the suddenness with whichwhen it is not to be supposed that one person remains who could bear to read about them any longerthey are both sent to the bottom of the Floss The catastrophe though as a matter of art unsatisfactory precisely satisfies if we may generalise our own sense of relief the feeling of the reader Let us say at once that we do not overlook the art with which by stray indications in the course of the book the end is foreshadowed that we duly appreciate the legend of Ogg the son of Beorl that we do know why Maggie in her lovemaking is represented as having become clever at rowing and so forth We do not even complain of the suddenness and rapidity of the close although that may seem a fault by contrast with the long drag of the previous narrative We have no wish to urge the technical objection that the actual manner of the destruction of Maggie and Tom is impossible in nature obvious enough as the fact is that two floating bodies whatever their relative size being borne on a current would be i borne at the same rate so that the one floated in advance  if propelled even by the strength of a child must distance 1 the other The more serious fault of the catastrophe is part of the main fault of the book and we shall have to 1 discuss that presently It is the minor defect of excessive I elaboration that concerns us now I In no part of the work is this overelaboration so unsatis factory in its result as in the endeavour to maintain high credit for perception of the secret springs of character This credit we think was never fairly earned There is in The Mil on the Floes a very great profession of such insight for example when Mr Riley strongly recommends to Mr Tulliver the Rev Walter Stelling as a tutor for his son Tom having no very strong motives for doing so no less than five pages are occupied with a detailed analysis of the small reasons that may have worked together in his mind to affect the manner of that recommendation and all that is said in those five pages could have been better ex I pressed in a paragraph if not in one sentence It is indeed in this feature of the book only that there is room for the charge of a censurable affectation George Eliot here appears as a quickwitted writer whose most laboured effort does not contain one possible character that is more than a sketchwho is clumsily wrong in every main feature of a story that is to be regarded as a copy from real life and who is cleverly wrong in a very great number of those ingenious remarks meant to express knowledge of life and character Take for example the suggestion with regard to Maggie of the  knowledge of the irreversible laws withiu and without her which governing the habits becomes morality and developing the feelings of submis son and dependence becomes religion The saying looks profound yet what could be more inadequate than to define religion the highest energy of life as a mere sbmision to irreversible laws Surely such a writer if clever enough to be selfconscious can hardly claim to be considered an anatomist of human nature Minute study of such artmanufacture as the Dodsons might almost be compared to the deliberate handling of the scalpel over the ragcarcase of a fifth of November subject And tedious as the Dodsons are how much exquisite humour has been pent on the elaboration of them  We only say that it is no anatomy of life at all It is a waste of lace and jewellery in the dressing up of scarecrows But thgeat faul at o r book a VW pet mwe at its td that w v ma have bow the intention of the writer it p en li s a n without a clue As r 1wa of amto iating great and sall ideas is rpoucd i a dilute form through half a dozen charaters

Dihkenss novels whose view of life was that  its aw a muddle has his axiom reproduced as if it were the one truth to be found by penetrating to the core of our humanity If the story of The Mill on the Floss has any central principle at all this passage from one of its clog chapts in which the italics are ours will express it The great problem of Ihe Bayinxg rEdit bdtwepenao axd duff is clear to no man who is capable of apprehedin it the question whether the moment has come in whic a has llen below the possibility of a renunciation that will carry any efficacy and must accept the sway of a passion against which he bad struggled as a trespass is one for which AwveS so matrboy tha4 Willf all cam The casuists hase become a byword of reproach but their perverted spirit of minute discrimination as the shadow of a truth to which eyes and hearts are too often fatally sealed the truth that moral judgments must remain false and hollow unless they are checked and enlightened by a perpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the individual lot To comment upon this passage is to comment on the tone of the whole book There is no  shifting relation between  passion and duty  whoever apprehends such a relation is below and not above the average of human wisdom In the words of One by whom we were taught the unity of truth and the simplicity of the divine law that can be applied as easily to conduct by the peasant as by the philosopher we have  a masterkey that will fit all cases It is not used to unlock the difficulties of life as they are untruly presented in this novel Old Tulliver dies worldly honest cherishing his hatred and his last words are said to be  This worlds  too many  honest man   puzzling    Maggie the heroine for whose passionate life we are prepared from the beginning abandons a sentiment of love slow and long in its growth for a sudden passion of mere lust towards a man who displays only coarse animal love for herself and this under surrounding circumstances that are designed to aggravate the shame The author does not seem to perceive how despicable the heroine at last becomes and how little sympathy is to be won for her tortures and her doubts for her conflict of duty with passion that did once in the course of her life acquire the help of some ascetic teaching from Thomas a Rempis but that never attained to the application of the first principles of Christian life which are the common ground possessed alike bay Christian of every name A knot is tied by lustunless it be his account of the contents of Bucklands  Bridgewater Treatise there is nothing else to account for Maggies sudden love of Stephenand the only solution of the difficulty is such shallow comment as the sentence we have quoted illustrates followed immediately by a letting loose of the floodgates to drown with Maggie and Tom all further consideration of the puzzle As it is with the book as a whole so it is with the characters presented in it The Bible appears once or twice in the story as a thing to lay a hand upon and curse by There is one reverent allusion to the Christian doctrine of tolerance in association with the doctrine of the story that provincial life is utterly intolerant As a social picture the tale may have been meant indeed to display the narrowness of life in country places But here also it is not true The scandal of a little town it needs no penetration to remark upon True depth of penetration would rather have been shown in pointing out how the warm human heart beats even in country towns as in the capital how mere an accident though a too obvious accident is that restriction and localization of talk which is here represented as the core of human life a narrow ugly grovelling existence among the people of St Oggs Truer and cleverer than this novel even as a picture of the outside littlenesses of provincial society infinitely truer in its recognition of the minds to which they are but as a dress was Mrs Giskells  Cranford The merit of the Mill on the Floss as of George Eliots former books lies mainly in shred feminine humour and a quick perception not of the depths and mysteries of life but of what is quaint and noteworthy in its externalS To these qualities value is usually given by a wholesome unaffected style that will express truthfully the lights and shadows of the writers feeling An occasional defect in the style we are tempted to attribute to interpolation In speaking of Adam Bede we hinted a suspicion that it contained touches by a male as well as by a female hand We cannot easily believe that it is the graceful writer of the main part of the MdiU on the Flos who describes young Philip at the piano as an  amorphous bundle who speaks with cumbrous jest of a servantmaid scrubbing a table as  suffering a waste of tissue by evaporation compares  a shiny deposit of dust  on clothes to  tablets prepared for writing upon  speaks of Wakems  parenthetic vindictiveness towards the uncomplimentary 1miller and of Mr Tullivers faculties  renewing their strength from getting a footing on this demonstra tion of the senses  ends a chapter with a similitude about the  nidus of seeds with  an apparatus of  hooks  to get hold of very unreceptive surfaces avoids naming rabbits humorously but unnecessarily by calling them  the more familiar rodents with more of the same sort of dulness If it be not that another hand is answerable for passages aMd phases em ad ee part of capte in the book that are as Cape in dsey Vatican wie mixed with paLernin we must

having done so we can only Part fom the author with a cordial recognition of her gSius and with the confession of a belief that among the emal novelista of our day only Min Bronte and Mrs skell occupy a higher place than she is likely to retain We shall be as quick to praise her next work as we have been slow to censure this if she do not again weary us by presenting to the world artificial men and womenas disjointed pieces of a puzzle to be wrongly put together and then swept off in despairHe Mill on the Floss Novels and Romances by George Elliot BlackwoodsThe authoress of  Adam Bede has been aptly compared to a Dutch painter Her writings belong essentially to the minute and truthful school of art and very often do not escape the accompanying drawback that for the sake of minuteness and truth grace refinement and even dramatic effect are ruthlessly sacrificed The result is that the characters painted with such wonderful accuracy are disgustingly coarse and what is worse in an artistic scene the incidents described with so much painstaking veresimilitude are trivial and uninteresting to a lamentable degree This fault dimly perceptible even in  Adam Bede has become unpleasantly conspicuous in the Mill on the Floss The characters are drawn with the microscopic accuracy of a photograph But when we have got them there is nothing either in themselves or in what they do which can excite any serious sympathy in their peculiar traits and personal fortunes The scene of tbe story is laid in the vicinity of some tenth rate town of semiagricultural semicommercial character through which passes the Flosswhich the reader discovers somewhat to his surprise to be a tidal river rather prone to inundation All the personages of the tale belong to the lower station of the middle or the upper station of the lower class They are millers small farmers or engaged in retail business the constituents in short of that numerous section of the industrious community among whom fifty years since a sort of rugged honesty constituted the chief virtue but whose coarse grain has by the recent spread of education become overlaid with a thin veneer of refinement To this class the Tulliver and Dodson families who supply nearly the whole series of dramatis persona to the novel intrinsically belong The pere Tulliver is the centre figure of the book and his wife whose constant boast it is to  have been a Dodson brings the story into contact with numerous scions of that strongly marked but highly commonplace family The Tullivers at the outset own the  Mill on the Floss and are well to do in the world but during the course of the tale lose their property and sink into sad destitution through the too eager prosecution of a lawsuit by Mr Tulliver The worthy pair have two children Tom and Maggie the former inheriting the practical tastes and also the obstinacy of his father the latter acquiring no one can tell how but certainly from no family source a truthful and somewhat romantic disposition accompanied by that  strong necessity for loving  which is the cause of so much happiness or misery as the case may be in actual life and constitutes one of the chief desiderata in the heroine of a novel Through the first volume we have described the development of these characters in the boyandgirl stages described with wonderful truthfulness and rendered highly entertaining There is also a good deal about various members of the Dodson family and the authoress shows her miraculous talent of eharacterpainting by the perfection in which individuality is stamped and preserved upon each of a rather numerous group although not one of them rise above the level of the most ordinary commonplace or possesses any more distinctive characteristics than those arising from the exhibition of small vanities and petty jealousies and microscopical grievances towards other scions of the Dodson stock At the end of the volume a lawsuit  which has for years been the nightmare of the Tulliver existence ends in an adverse verdict Old Tulliver is now ruined and sold up The Mill on the Floss passes to other owners its new proprietor being Lawyer Wakem his opponent at the trial and whom Mr Tulliver regards professionally and personally as an agent of the Evil One and declared enemy not only of himself specially but of mankind in general The series of motives which induce the obstinate old man to remain as manager in the mill that once was his own is traced with admirable art and a true insight into the depths of the human mind is evinced when he is made to swear in the same breath and write on the flyleaf of his family Bible his determination to serve his old enemy honestly and yet hate him eternally This vicissitude of fortune produces its natural effect upon the character and the career of Tom and Maggie But the story henceforth becomes highly distressing and we will not carry our analysis any further suffice it to say that while Tom achieves some practical successes Maggie gets into various difficulties and entanglements She turns ascetic under the erroneous impression that voluntary suffering is the source of happiness falls in love with the intellectual qualities of Philip Wakem the deformed son of their lawyer enemy and of old Toms schoolfellow and with the personal qualities of Stephen Guest the son of an enriched manufacturer with whom the Dodson family are somehow connected In vacillating between these rivals Maggie contrives to bring misery upon both and involves in the misfortune her own cousin and friend Lucy who has been almost engaged to Stephen In the third volume a new set of characters are introduced the small gentry of the cathedral town of St Oggs But by this time space has become valuable and it is necessary to hurry forward the incidents which led up to the final catastrophe This is brought about by a heavy flood on the Flossthis river from the beginning being described as disagreeably prone to inundationin which Maggie and Tom are swept away together The conclusion is essentially melodramatic and so also is most of the  business to use a stage term by which it is introduced On the whole we are obliged to say that the authoress of  Adam Bede  has in her present novel not made a step in advance Admirable in parts the  Mill on the Floss  is a failure on the whole In comparing the book before us with its predecessor we subject it no doubt to a severe test The sweepings and afterthoughts of a work like  Adam Bede might furnish forth more than one novel which Mudie would patronize the public read and the oritics approve if written by any other author The gleaning of the grapes in Ephraim may be better than the vintage of Abiezer but the superiority furnishes no excuse for laziness or

being no room for eztracta the only thing to be done is to outline the attors creation There is to occasion for ed a eowue in the present instance yet for the sike of diaking the extracts better understood and appreciated3 we may remark that the dramatis per onD of the tale are Mr Tulliver the owner of the miu Mrs Tulliver his wife their son Tom arid a daughter Maggie The latter is the heroine of the story and a most interesting character There ar several other persons but the main interest is concentrated in these Mr Tullivers views with respect to his son are thus graphically giaen What I want is to give Tom a good eddication asll be bread to him That was what I was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave th academy at lAdyday I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer The two years at th academy od ha done well enough if Id meant to make a miller and a farrier of him for hes had a fine tight more schooling nor ever I got all the leanin my father ever paid for was a bit o birch at one end and the alphabet at th other But I should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard so as he might be up to the tricks o these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish It ud be a help to me wi these lawsuits and arbitrations and things I wouldnt make a dowiright lawyer o the lad I should be sorry lor himl to le araskill but a sort o engineer or a surveyor

even wI the law I believe for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i the face as hard as one cat looks another Hes nonie frighted dt him Mrs Tulliver has not the same ambitious view s as hcr husband for the boy She thinks more of the commissariat part of the establishment and has her doubts about  the washing and mending a iis clothes These indistinct doubts lead to tie suggestion on her part of all educational prGceedings being being restricted to the limits of the carriers cart Mrs Tullwer is in excellent sort of person but not uncomfortably troubled with intellect or intellectual aspirations but although her character on the whole is natural perhaps she is at times nade very absurd by having absurdities put into her mouth And here we would illustrating the remark by a specimen of the ladys conversation notice one very great defect in this writers dialogue For the sake of effect ishe makes her characters say things they never would  syutter nonsense in fact which is meant to Pas for fun Ihe following has nothing droll in ir but is simply ridiculous She says after disCussing the interesting matter of airing sheets Well Sir Tulliver Ive put the sheets out for the best bed and Kezias got em hanging at the fire Tbey arent the best sheets I should repent buying em only theyll do to lay us out in An if you wa X die to Wlorrow Mr Tulliver theyre mangled beau tif an aU ready as

solemnity of death with snob pti feelgs It is silly Facetious dialoge s not the forte of the writer She makes Mrs Tulliver a buffoon and puts words into her mouth for the express purpose of being lahed at The pupose is transparent Other authors d e e t do the same The poor people of 8ir Walters novels are true to nature they ar not mad as surd The droll is a very different style only at taimed perhaps by Dickens or Anthony Trollope now adaYs These are supremely droll in their lighter passages When writers of an inferior calibre try to be droll they become either noensical or vulgar But in contradistinction to the above solfioqy on the sheets we subjoin the following good description of the child Maggie  You talk o cuteness Mr Tulliver sbe obervedl as she sat down 1but Im sure the childs half an idiot in some things for if I send her uwtair to fetch anything she forgets what shes gone for a erhaps ull sit down on the foor in the sunshine an praft her hair an sing to herself like a Bedlam catbr all the while Im waiting for her downstairs Maggie is apparently a  good for nought She hates dressing herself and brshing her hair and nenataess or tidiness of any kind but bhc loves tihe country atd the eountry fowen and readiiig too in quecr old books Maggie is very fond of reading And half her time she spends Wranlering along the banks of tbe millstream studying nattare and the othcr half in an old attic studyingr her books to which we sball refer present lv and also in another ocpation also for future consideration Mrs Tulliver is in despair about Maggie She prophesies that she well never come to any good but will meet with some unexpected disaster in the way of drowning or other catastrophe She tried to impress Maggie with a sense of her own unworthiress and advccates patchwork as a fitting means of useful occupation On one occasion when Maggie has as usual been wvaiileiing on the banks of tbe millstream and has returned in a hopeless state of desbabille her mother delivers the foliowing admonitory letum  0 dear 0 dear Maggie says Krs Tulliver  what are you thinking of to throw your botsnet down there Take it upstairs theres a good gal an let your hair be brushed an put your other pinafore on an go on with your patchwork like a lady Maggies answer is philosophical Its foolish work sid Maggie with a to of ht r mane  tearing things to pieces to sw em tgether again Then as to aggies books to whie we have referred Her library appeared to be nther extensive nor well chosen LDefoes Histo of the Devil being one of the collection and a very great fah vorite moreover She had Banyans Pilgrims Progress too but she liked tk pictesbier than the lettepress of this latter work As to the lettI r s its chief recommendation seems to have been that tberes a deal about the devil in it This uuamiable personage and Maggie is a firm believer in his personality is her favourite study Ill shew you a picture of him blie says to Mr Riley one of her fathers friends Ill show you the picture of him in his true shape as he appeared to Christianthe body all black you knowTom bad coloured it in his holidaysand the eyes red like fire because hes all fire inside and it shines out at his eyes The philosophy of this writer has been highly and deservedly eulogisedi but she is not invariably correct The following is untrue She says Plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivatice in order to compass a selfish end are nowhere abundant but in the world of the dramatist That is the first mistake The world teems with selfish and deliberate plotting It may be of a very small and putty Lind but there it is Only wYben the plotting assumes a larger aspect is it recognised The craft of the monarch who by chicanery tries to annex a country to his crown is akin to the cunning of the farmer when lie seeks to hurt his iicighibour and add a few fields to his farm ILoIok through the whole gradations of societj In every degree there is plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance and always of ccurse for a selfish motive Enter into doniestic life either high or low there also in a diFerent form will the selfish policy be found Neitlher is the authoresss context to this assertion correct The reason on which she bases her argument is that  Plotting covetousnef and deliberate contrivance demand too intense a mental action for many of our fellow parishioners to be guilty of them We dont agree to that Cuinihig is the most contemptible of all trades because it is the easiest Then as to the dramatic villain being the only one where this intense mental action is observable we can but say that the dramatic villain has always seemed a most transparent personage to us growing out of Dothilnl and perhaps relapsing into the szune element again In the following passage too she is wroig It is easy enough to Upoil the livesof our neighbours without taking so much trouble we can do it by lazy acquivscence and lazy onission by trivial 1ilsities fur which we hardly know a reason by small frauds neu trahistul by IWall extravagancits by maladroit flatteries and clumisily improvised insinuztios That we dunt believe Our neighbours dont tiouble themselves enough about us to have tbeir lives spoiled  by these trifles Tbere must be ome tangible aiad poilive  rong donc and felt People are not so Sensitive as to be seriously hurt by lazy acquiescence and lazy onmissioll Thie fol lowing account of the rebellious Mvegie is admi rably drawn The writer excells in the delineation of children Maggie has been annoyed by her ziothtis refusal to allow her to acconpanv leer father to the school for the purpose of brinog Tom borne Mrs Tulliver is trying to redue e to subjecion and cleanliness by the judicious P plication of moral advice and map and water Maggie proves refracturv M1aggie suddenly rushed from under her hanes and dipped her head in a basin of water standing near in the vindictive determination that there should be to more chance of curls that day Maggie Maggie exclaimed Mrs Tulliver sitting stout and helpleas with the brushes on her lap  what is to become of you if youre so naughty  Ill tell your Aunt Glegg and your Aunt Pullet when they come next week and theyll never love you any more The eloquence of her mother however makes uo impression on Maggie who takes refuge iii fiiglt Maggie was out of hearing making her way toward the great attic that ran under the old high Pitched roof shaking the water froul under her black locks a she ran like a skyeterrier escaped from his bath This attic was Maggies favourite retreat oil a wet day wilh the weather was not too cold here ishe fretted out all her illhumnours and talked aloud to the wormeatrn floors and the wormeaten shelves and the dark rafters festooned with cobwebs and here sihe kept a Fetish which she punished for all her inisfortuneL This was the trunk of a large wooden doll which once stared with the roundest of eyes above the reldest of cheeks but was now entirely defaced by a long caree of vicarious suffering Three ziils driven into the head comminemorated as many crises in Maggies idne years of earthly struggle that luxury of vengeance having leen suggested to her by the picture of Jatl destroying Sisera in the old Bible The last nail bad been driven in with a fiercer stroke than usual for the Fetish on that occasion represented Autit Glegg But immediately afterwards Maggie had rejfected that if she drove so many nails in she woud not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt when she knocked it against the wall nor to comfort 4t and make believe to poultice it when her fury was abated for even Aunt Glegg would be pitiable when she had been hurt very much and thoroughly humiliated so as to beg her nieces pardon Since thein she had driven no more nails in but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating her wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys that made the square pillars supporting the roof lTe character of MJaggic is beautifully drawn from beginning to end although some of the in cidents which are related of her are too abruptly told and arc scarcely within the range of proba bility  her flight to the gipsies for instance an episode of neither point nor purpose introduced fur no special reason and containing no special I ser ice This author does not excel as a mere stoir teller The construction of her tale is not artistic it is in the graphic pictures that the merit I of tle work consists The following remarks for instance on an acute sorrow are truthful and exchilctit There is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies the first shocks of trouble just as an acute pain is often a timnulus and produces an excitenent which is transient strength It is in the slow keen life that follows in the time when sorrow has become stale and has no longer an emotive intensity that counteracts its pain  in the time when day follows day in dull unexpectant saneness and trial is a dreary routine it is then that despair threatens it is then that the 1esrcmlhtorv himv r of the soul is frit and the eye ad

of a SuperTramp ByW H Davies With a Preface by Bernard Shaw A C Fifield 6s When a few years since a modest volume of poems entitled  The Souls Destroyer appeared the lover of poetry who was fortunate enough to read it was justified in thinking that a new planet had swum within his ken The book was received with a chorus of discriminating praise and speculation became rife as to the strange and fascinating personality that lurked behind the name of William H Davies We learned just enough to whet our curiosity We learned for instance that the new poet was a onelegged man who lived in a common lodginghouse somewhere in Southwark that he enjoyed the munificent pension of 8s a week and that most wonderful of all he had contrived to publish his verses at his own expense This sounded promising  but like Oliver Twist we wanted more At length Mr Davies has taken pity on our ignorance He has told us the plain and unvarnished story of his life And a marvellous record it is  In these days incident having deserted the region of fiction is forced to fly to autobiography as to a welcome sanctuary Certainly  The Autobiography of a SuperTramp we like not the title by the way it is too slavishly Shavian contains enough adventure to fit out a dozen romances by say Mr Rolf Boldrewood Its author has tramped it up hill and down dale  he is equally at home on the highroads of America or in the slums of our English cities He has known the agonies of starvation and by dint of considerable practice has acquired the difficult art of begging His companions have been thieves vagrants and mendicants Not since Borrow it seems safe to say have we had a presentment so vivid forceful and intimate of the inner lives of these delightful people And the strange thing about it all is that Mr Davies himself appears to be a man with essentially domestic instincts a lover of the fireside and the companionship of men and books He has gone through the world weaving his wonderful experiences into song and with an eye always on the end of wanderingthe happy haven that awaits the tired voyager It is difficultindeed it is almost impossibleto quote from this volume so full is every chapter of strange and exciting matter But one incident in this Odyssey of a vagabond must not go unrecorded The scene is America Mr Davies and a companion tramp had been found guilty of the crime of trespassing on a railroad They were each fined five dollars by the Judge Hot with indignation Davies refused to disgorge a cent The remainder must be told in his own words  Judge Stevens looked at us steadily for a time and then asked this astounding question Boys how much are you prepared to pay Brum who had very little sense of justice and being such a good beggar set very little value on money asked the Judge if he would accept three dollars from each of us If I had been alone at this time I would have paid nothing but to save Brum from going to prison who I knew would support me through all I satisfied myself that if the Judge approved of this amount I would pay it without further comment The Judge appeared to weigh the matter seriously and then cried with a magnanimity that was irresistible  Pass over the dollars boys  you shall have a chance this time As a record of a life lived in defiance of all the conventional rules of our modern civilisation this volume is of priceless value Its freshness of outlook and spontaneity of expression together with its entire freedom from cant make it in every sense of the term a truly remarkable production Mr Shaw contributes a characteristic PrefaceTHE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JACK KETCH WITH FOURTEEN ILLUS TRATIONS FROM DESIGNS BY MEADOWS EDWARD CHURTON LONDON IF the selfrecorded lives of public men are of importance to society as exemplification of difficulties surmounted on the high road to eminence then assuredly the subject of these memoirs has a claim up on the gratitude of a highspirited and intellectual people and in thus publishing his interesting experience it is certain he will not be the least in their esteem although with some of them it is just possible that he may be the last The appearance of this volume conveys more than is superficially apparent Its sombre garb is typical of sorrowthe gaudy label on its back cannot cheat us into any other belief it is the funereal glitter of a gilt plate upon a coffinlid No the fact cannot be concealed Jack Ketch is no longer what he wasno longer the bustling active functionaryhis place is not of the value of a ropesendhis occupations gone The schoolmaster has filched his rod and he is now on the list with titled sinecurists and public pensioners How in this most unprosperous period must his recollection carry him back to the good old Tory times when a mighty slender qualification made a man eligible for Tyburntree  when the maladroit conveyance of a twopound note made him intimate with a halter With what an artistlike eye on a Monday morning must he have surveyed the beam whereon some three or four of these fortyshilling freeholders were cooling their heels outside the debtors door for an hour at a stretch Those were days of business Jack Ketch had no time to write books then  the utmost he could do was to favour his friends with a line But sessions are long that have no endings the functionarys friends are again in power and Jack Ketch may hope for the results The book is however a more pleasant speculation than the times and here we find the career of the author faithfully narrated from his earliest infancy down to the period when he takes office by succeeding his uncle to the important post of representative of the Sheriff of London Our hero first saw the light in the  darksome secresy of Rose and Crown Court and with an independence truly original does not claim hereditary respectability but says  Let me not mince the matter for mincing it will not make the matter lessmy father was a thief Ile was however professedly a waiter but his napkin was not large enough to cloak his little peculiarities and he met his fate at the new drop kindly assisted by his respected relative His mother his  sainted mother shortly afterwards laid herself open to a suspicion of not  accurately distinguishing the right of property and was commanded to  expatriate herself for life Here then commences the career of our hero virtually an orphan by the laws of his country the entire code of which he declared open war with in his subsequent career morc we are obliged to confess from his natural tastes than from pious revenge for the wrongs of his parents It would deprive the work of half its interest with the reader were we to proceed with it in the elaborate way we could wish we will therefore merely say that the introluction into life of the thief and the vagabond was through the appropriate medium of an attorlneys officgithere he was introduced to some few of the choicest blackguards in a small way about town  but upon the natural event of his master absconding with the money of his  only respectable clientJack was thrown upon his own resourses and went through the degrees of pickpocket housebreaker and common cheat until he arrived at the dignified position in society which he now holds The work is illustrated by Meadows and we are enabled by the permission of the publisher to give specimens which will speak for themselves of the merits of the artist This woodcut represents the wife of Jack Ketch weeping over her dead birlCatherine is a most masterly delineation of the author of the patient ediurance of a female tinder circumstances of the most heartbreaking wronlg and ildignityshe is the likeness of a being of every lay life the fidelity of which we cannot but recogiiizeomie whose affections no iiijury can abate no cruelty subdue who without a murmur clings to the husband of her choise through good and evil even to death But that part which displays the greatest kinowledge of the human mind is an episodle callel the  Confession of Johin Wilson Jack Ketch in passinL lown the Borough sees his uncle getting off a stagecoach he hadjust returned from some professional affair in the country and had in his pocket a M1S which the unifortunate for whom he had officiated had intrusted to him to deliver to the clergyman of E  Jack goes home with his micle and reads it aloud This is the most striking tale that we have read for many years ini fact we have seen nothinjg like it since Caleb Williamsit is the philosophy of crimethe motives which are supposed to actuate the human heart to the commission of the most frightful atrocities are developed and laid bare anid embodied in a tale of the most powerful interest This woodcut does the artist great credit it represents the children of Wilson finding the knife with which he murdered his friend many years before The little creatures bring it to their father and the sight of it produces a revulsion of feeling which at last occasions the crime for which he suffered Jacks uncle one morning is discovered suspended to a beam by one of his own ropeswhether a victim to professional experiment or occasioned by one of those fits of aberration to which minds peculiarly constructed are subject must be left a matter of conjecture Having an eye to respectability or rather finding his own pursuits not the most lucrative he applies for the vacant situation which by family influence and a nature aptitude for the profession he at length obtains Here he is passing his examination before the Rev Mr Kilderkin the Ordinaryeasily recognized as the more prominent figureand AIr Sheriff Hopkins a dealer in Muscovados His merits are apparent and he is duly invested with the dignities of office Let no one be prejudiced by those quidnunc critics who affect to be disconcerted by the title of a book or fancy that a dark cover must conceal dulness We venture to assert that there is more interest in this little volume than in all the novels brought out this season In the first eight or nine chapters there is wit lurking in every line and we may truly say that every period has its point the continuation abounds with interesting situations forcible delineations of character anl startling eventsthe conclusion is perfectly in keeping with the whole Those who look further into a book than the titlepage will find a fund of entertainment they little dream of and we sincerely recommend it to our readers as a work that in proportion as it is known cannot fail to be estimated,biography

Thc Prince of the Fair Family ILLUSTRATED CHILDRENS BOOKS By Mrs S C Hall Chapman  Hall Bright Thoughts for the Little Ones with Prose and Verse By Grandmamma Cassell Petter  Galpin Lightsome and the Little Golden Lady By C H Bennett Griffith  Farran Washed Ashore or the Tower of Stormont Bay By W H G Kingston Jackson Walford  Hodder Three Hundred sFsops Feibles Translated by the Rev G F Townsend Routledge  Sons The Princess I late a Fairy Talc Saunders Otley Co Mrs S C Halls latest publication is a very pretty and rather whimsical story about little peoplewe can hardly call them fairies according to the popular notion which requires something different in description from minute men and women who live in among and under flowers and leaves using them as men employ houses and having the senses limitations and passions of mere men To say this much in respect to the shortcomings of this charming story is but to declare that the author whose work is now before us has failed exactly where ninetynine out of every hundred fairytale writers have done likewise We know no modern fairy story of this kind and having the pretensions of this one which surpasses it either as regards spirit prettiness or piquancy of treatment richness of incident or carefulness in imparting local colour to the book which tells how a noble Queen Foam of South Wales whose tiny people and lazy royal husband were seated near Tenby a wateringplace to which Mrs Hall seems to have taken an overwhelming fancy bad a son Prince Ivor who being pressed by his imperious mamma to marry a certain beautiful Princess of Pembrokeshire flatly refused to do anything of the sort and preferred banishment and transformation nay even loss of the privileges of  faery and to incur the defeats of mortality rather than wed the Princess Gossamer daughter of King Bulbul The Btory further relates how the Prince was banished and trarsformed what were the pranks he played on earth these are rather trivial in the order of their inventionhow he got rid of some of that freakishness which Mrs Hall in common with all fairytale tellers ascribes to the little peoplehow he fell in love with an earthly damselwhat took place upon the last event the political consequences of which do not appear to have been calculated for by Queen Foamhow he returned home and what then took place We have all this with a moral of the good sound sort which of course we shall not impart neither relate the termination of the story in the fate of the little Prince Let the reader learn it for himself and in so doing appreciate at his best the manner of the writer whose ornate fancy revels in  pretty rather than in potent matters whose conception of faery lacks vigour quite as much as it comes short in inventioniwhose ideas savour of the operatic style and whose book is by no means free from affectation The considerate reader who knows not only the rarity of firstrate fairy tales but the immense difficulty which besets their writers will know how well our author has succeeded notwithstanding the shortcomings we are in no unkindly spirit compelled to point out As to the illustrations before us m this volume they are thoroughly in keeping with the text The immemorial hand of Mr Kenny Meadows has contributed a larger number than that of any other artist These suit the story wonderfully Of sounder work and better Art are several wellexecuted landscapes from drawings by Messrs E M Wimperis and W S Coleman Mr W J Allen is a very happy contributor of vignettes and tailpieces Bright Thoughts for the Little Ones is a book for infants the novelty of which consistsso far as we see the notion is a new onein the fact that little pieces of verse are made to alternate and proceed from little pieces of prose Both classes of the text are pleasantly perhaps a little too pleasantly written all the boys and girls behave themselves as they should obediently lovingly and with a wonderful show of forbearance The illustrations which are by Mr John Proctor are good enough for a commonplace purpose but not good enough to be of the better class Bounder workmanship or at least more of refinement in execution is desirable for them Many are spirited There is nothing to challenge in the book unless indeed it be a recommendation to see General Tom Thumb Lightsome and the Little Golden Lady is a capital childs fairystory with just the slight defect of a rather dull beginning To create such beginning is on the part of the author with Mr Bennetts aim a great mistake and almost fatal to his hopes of obtaining a hearing from children whose standard is not above that of his book once he gets the little ones by the ear we have no doubt that they will be more than thankful to him The event of the scorpion that attacked Skambel whenever he was envious and did bo with a clash as of the tumbling down of ten sets of fireirons and the locking up of fifty streetdoor locks is very much to our minds Grim Hoddidod the hunter has a family resemblance with which we are not unfamiliar as he supports the reputation of his awful race be is not the worse for that in fact one rather likes to meet him here for the sake of the old days when breathless we came upon the great beanstalk with our brave but surely temerarious friend Jack There is some poverty of invention shown in the repetition of the method by which Lightsome cuts off the tails of the bulls moreover it is incredible that the same thing should happen more than once The history of the scales that weighed everything into gold which runs through the book is very well told The illustrations are rather heavily drawn but not without spirit they are the work of the author  Washed A shore is a tale of the coast and the sea of an old captain who lives in an ancient fortress his son who mixing with smugglers comes to grief and suffers a sort of honourable transportation of a lifeboat adventure with a wreck a storm of two saved from its violence One of these is a dashing midshi pman who tells a young laxlya very young ladythat Man Friday was notablackwhatever Defoe might have written There is also a very good blind pedlar a hardhearted magistrate and abundant adventures with smugglers seamen and such like materials for a boys story That it is a little overlaboured may be no deterring matter for juvenile readers especially as a considerable amount of local colouring is applied to descriptions of southern islands and the manners of their inhabitants The discovery of the longlost son of the old seacaptain who lived in the ancient tower and the narrative of that sons adventures make up jjr a sort of Robinson Crusoe stry that is well worthy the attention of the readers for whom the book is written Three Hundred Esops Fables purports to be a newliteral translation from the Greek the work of th Rev George Fyler Townsend who supplied new applications morals c to an edition of CroxaUs old version which we not long since reviewed CroxaUs production is almost universally known in this country and is one of the oldfashioned ornate sort of translations from the classics which obtained favour when the severe simple manner of such originals was little appreciated among us The new translation now before us is decidedly clearer purer in style and infinitely terser than its predecessor it contains also a much greater number of fables than was comprised in the edition to which we have just referred and morewe believe than are to be found in common editions As a literary production the present is creditable to the editor aud traudator it is however rather bald and somewhat deficient in that terse wordpainting which gives life to a literal translation The illustrations which are thu work of Mr Harrison Weir are very unequal in quality some are good as The Fawn and his Mother The Crow and the  Pitcher others are not at all commendable see j those which contain human figures The worst of i the book as a whole is that their author has not  the slightest sense of the Eopian humour here I as in other respects no one of modern times has i approached the happiness of Thomas Bewick in his old age The Princess Ilsee is a fairystory of which the producer of the book before us be she translator or author hus no mean opinion It begius i with an account of the Deluge and dryingup of  the earth and gives a rather fantastical description of the process of the latter by the hands of angels with huge besoms made of the wind and enormous brushes composed of sunbeams Ono of these angels being rather tired with the  cleaning up sits down on the top of a lofty mountainalpine teak  our writer styles it and meditates on the terrestrial and moral prospect before him much in the manner of a serious and highlyrespectable  young lady in a drawingroom This angel is spoken of as male his notions are those of neither one sex nor the other  which is orthodox no doubt although the effect on the reader is rather depressing In short the story is not otherwise describable by us than as nambypamby worse than that is the fact that it is a nambypamby allegory and an example of a style which has our peculiar abhorrence Tried by its own standard there is however ample evidence of care and even of delicacy in writing on the authors part she has carried out her intentions with exactness neatness and precision The illustrations to this work are by M Froment and are thoroughly in keeping with the text that is they are cleverly but too prettily drawnhave a good deal of daintiness and not enough of strength Our collection of minor childrens books comprises many that are brightly and some that are gaudily coloured Merry Conceits and Whimsical Fhymes by Mr C H Ross Routledge  Sons seems to aim at the same success in producing nonsensical fun that attended Mr E Leers capital  Book of Nonsense When we say that no sort of humour appears in this text and that some of its illustrations are vulgar

the 3ookmans Cable A SON OF THIE MIDDLE BORDER By Hamlin Garland 7s 6d John Lane Mr Ilamlin Garland one of the truest and strongest of Western novelists has spent nearly a year in England and revelled in the fresh understanding it has given him of British nature and British problems Those of us who know his books Her Mountain Lover and the restare well aware of his sincerity of touch in writing and the effective humour he can put into the clash of character and type Few uptodate Western writers possess such real affinity with the Old World and this gives him spiritual kinship with men of the past like Longfellow Lowell and Howellsmen who began by absorbing the best that America and her universities could give and then completed their development by acquiring the best they could find in the travel and literature of Europe It is one of the highest ambitions surely for an observer and interpreter to strengthen the bridge of sympathy that has for so long stretched across the Atlantic and has been for ever hallowed by joint service in the war Mr Garland is destined to be one of these and we are glad of this biograph of a family to show what like of men he springs from There is something of heroism in the drift of his father westward and ever westward in search of the unfailing crop and the kindly season but it melts to pathos when the author has to follow westward and woo the old and disillusioned farmer back to the haunts of his boyhood and persuade him that the West has been a cruel lure Social conditions especially after the civil war time were harsh and inclement but the native beauty of character and custom the oldfashioned pieties and traditions blend everything together into a texture of patience and content The closing scenes where the kinsmen come together at a Thanksgiving feast are like a perfect sunset of human life,biography

The Aran Inlands By J M Synge Dublin Maunsel 5s net The Aran Islands it is probably necessary to remind the ignorant Saxon are three small islands lying off the west coast of Ireland about thirty miles from Galway The largest is about nine miles long and the inhabitants who are for the most part still strangely primitive gain their living by burning kelp fishing and tilling their scant fields though the soil is so poor that a field hardly produces more grain than is needed for seed in the following year and the straw is all the profit Of his four visits to these islands Mr Synge the author of The Playboy of the Western World the play that caused so much disturbance at the Abbey Theatre Dublin has written an attractive book which while relating his experiences simply and without literary artifice is rendered charming by tne authors sympathy with the kindly men and women of whom he writes  Mr Synge has a fine eye for colour and he has painted a truthful though sombre picture of the islands with their grey clouds and grey seas and slaty limestone rocks the men dressed in indigo and grey and the women in red petticoats with grey shawls twisted round their heads There is little division of labour on these barren rocks  every man is a good sailor an expert fisherman sufficiently wise in agriculture to till his poor fields clever enough with his hands to make a cradle or a coffin They dwell in thatched cottages whose chief room the kitchen has an earth floor and open rafters and two doors facing each other one open and one shut according to the wind In this room the men sit on the wet foggy days that are so frequent on these desolate islands drinking perhaps the grey poteen in a haze of turf smoke and listening to the wonderful tales of the old men or talking endlessly of tides and fish and the price of kelp in Connemara But in all the speech of this simple folk there sounds a note of despondency a sadness of things passing For their growing sons leave the islands nowadays for America or the mainland unwilling that like their fathers before them they should spend their days in snatching a poor livelihood from the winds and the sea Even here the Gaelic seems to be dying out and the younger men are no longer ready to believe in the fairies whose strange hatred of the human race colours so many of the stories that Mr Synge has collected from the old men of the islands Progress which may not spare either beauty or simplicity is reaching these primitive men and women at last and we therefore owe a double debt to Mr Synge for having written this book before it was too late and for having written it so well Mr J B Yeats contributes some clever illustrations,biography

The Call of the Wild By Jack London I Heinemann Tnis book is published in London by Mr Heinemann It was apparently printed and electrotyped in America and upon its first page is found the legend The M M Co which bookbuyers are wont to associate with Messrs Macmillan Its getup is good and tasteful like that of many of the volumes that come from America its score of illustrations are well reproduced and paper and printing are all that could be desired It is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power Hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of Kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story of an animal we have no hint of the  Jungle Books  or of any sort of derivativeness Consequently it is deserving of more serious consideration than its predecessors The hero is Buck the offspring of a St Bernard sire and a sheepdog dam We meet him first as the wellloved tyrant of a luxurious home in the South Then because the wages of a gardeners helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny Buck changes hands and begins to learn the Law of Club and Fang The Klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals Buck steals a good sum of ready money Bucks first ordeal in the primitive fighting life is his meeting with a man in a red sweater who has released him from the crate in which he has travelled North and who proceeds forthwith to break him inwith a club  For the last time he rushed The man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and Buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  Answers to the name of Buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  Well Buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we ve had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let it go at that Youve learned your place and I know mine Be a good dog and all 11 go well and the goose hang high Be a bad dog an I l whale th stuffinouta you Understand V As he spoke he fearlessly patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though Bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest Presently Buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero It is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books The author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions That is a painful chapter which recounts Bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge From their stupidly cruel hands Buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog North or South might love and honour They make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades Spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog Bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge This is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of Bucks success is heartstirring Failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck Head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth Those who hurried up heard him cursing Buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly Gad sir  Gad sir  spluttered the Skookum Bench king  Ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir Thornton rose to his feet His eyes were wet The tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  Sir he said to the Skookum Bench king no sir You can go to hell sir Its the best I can do for you sir The detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited Buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely avenged the mans murder The book deserves to rank high among animal stories and as has been indicated we think it the best thin its author has so far given usFIOTION The Valley of the Moon By Jack London Mills  Boon 6 A reasonable belief that the first novel received for 1914 was an average specimen of the coming output would enable us to wish our fellowreviewers a  Happy New Year  with some hopefulness of fulfilment The story is that of a workingclass couple ideally mated Before their marriage he is a prizefighter and she is a laundryhand An appalling picture of the life she escapes by wedlock is given as well as more than one vivid description of his competence in the ring She is possessed of that marvellous strength of sacrifice on behalf of her man which can only be properly appreciated perhaps by those who have experienced it He has the gentleness which goes with strength under control though he all but loses it when his temper is upset by a strike of teamsters his mates in a calling which he follows after his marriage Their flight from the sordid struggle of the town to the open solves the struggle of existence for them and further makes the opportunity somewhat too obviously for a display of much agricultural lore in an atmosphere the sweetness of which becomes cloying towards the end of the tale The narrative is written breezily throughout though the authors handling of the bellows has not been sufficiently masked He has perhaps more scorn for than sympathy with the pettiness with which he is obliged to endow many of his puppets in order that they may be true to life The individualism of Socialists and the trickery by which even the wellintentioned are content to earn a living are after all but the natural concomitants of an environment in which the breadth of outlook is lacking to make  Waste not want not a worldmaxim The tale which is essentially American may not appeal to all English readers but though the conditions vary in different lands the author has grasped the essential traits of humanity in its present stage of development and such understanding being a necessary preliminary to further advance any one who helps us to it deserves our thanksThe Son of the Wolf By Jack London Isbister 63 We notice in the advertisements of A God of His Fathers a previous work of the authors appended to the present volume that a critic remarks It is no exaggeration to say that Mr London does for the Klondyke what Mr Rudyard Kipling has done for India A reading of The Son of the Wolf leaves us with the conviction that Mr Rudyard Kipling need be under no uneasiness Mr Jack Londons tales are all  vigorous his men are all muscular heroes his language his style his situations all have the ideal and the downright virtues of muscularity So far so good But we want analysis not deification of the muscular ideal and that is where Mr Jack London fails We do not wish to disparage in any way The Son of the Wolf The nine tales of which the book is made up are healthy breezy narratives of sensational incidents in the  Worthland Scruff Mackenzie goes on the trail seeking a wife braves a whole tribe of Indians kills two men and carries off the beautiful Zarinska the chiefs daughter Xaass an Alentian chief travels thousand of miles from the Behring Sea tracking Axel Gunderson a modern Norse Sea rover who has carried off from him the peerless Unga Of course he lures Gunderson and Unga to a trackless wilderness in search of a gold mine and of course they die in the most melodramatic fashion The best story in the book is To the Man on the Trail because it is the least theatrical  In a Far Country  is a tale with the same motive as  An Outpost of Progress  by Mr Joseph Conrad To compare the manner in which the two authors bring the same situation before us is to see why Mr Jack London cannot be called an artist He is a vigorous story teller for the general publicwhich is not a bad thing but his sphere scarcely touches that of those writers who like Mr Rudyard Kipling have created a manner and a method of presentation which is all their ownlhovel lnotes THE CALL OF THE WILD Bv Jack Londin 6s lIeinernann A reading of  The God of his Fathers inclined us to classify Mr Jack London as the Canadian Kipling and The Call of the Wild further justifies us in doing so For any other study of animal life to compare with this wonderfully intimate storv of the dog  Buck and his companions one must turn to the Jungle Books Not that Mfr London is in any sense an imitator he writes with  STOCKS MRS HUMPHRY WARDS RESIDENCE SOUTH VIEW From Pkotogratk by J T Newman Berkhansted much of the same directness the same vivid simple realism the same insight into the souls of men and beasts but his stories are entirely his own and his types as unlike those of the famous AngloIndian as the snowy remoter regions are unlike India The kidnapping of the petted household Buck the brutal breaking of his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild make a story of unique interest that has more than a touch of genius in the conception and the writing of it The coloured illustrations are extremely effectiveTHE VALLEY OF THE MOON By Jack London 6s Mills  Boon The idyllic title of Mr Londons latest noveland his bestwill neither delude nor deter those who know its predecessors They will know there are grim forces stirring somewhere in the region of this nook of shelter and starlight and that the people who populate it are very fierce realities As a matter of fact the lunar paradise does not arrive until the real action of the book has ceased It is reserved as a kind of reward or escape after many strenuous chapters in which the struggle is not merely one of thew and sinew but a moral war with principalities and powers We get in the opening chapters the hinterland of San Francisco at its worst and Oakland seems to engage itself chiefly with the clatter of steam laundries the strains of the dancing saloon and the faction fights of public holidays This abrupt plunge into a Western world of slang and steam and strife is made palatable to English readers by the pride with which the hero and heroine contemplate their Saxon origin but the author must not be accused merely of making an effort to conciliate his critics over here He brings out certain qualities in those two figures which we are glad to recognise as admirablethe more so that the woman is the deeper and more consistent character and has none of  Billys weaknesses Billy Roberts like the book is mixed in his composition Brought up as a prizefighter he qualifies as a teamster and handles horses with the same mercy and discretion wherewith he handled men He is certainly a  hunky  gladiator this sixfoot giant of the blue eyes and fair complexion but when poverty and hardships arrive he loses selfcontrol and shows once more that the physical training of the ring however thorough is no discipline for the finer issues of life  Saxon his wife on the other hand keeps true to her simple ideals and brings him through Her emotions are always fresh and womanly She succeeds in everything her modesty allows her to undertake but she cannot help the author to interest us in certain chapters which are only agricultural pamphlets in disguise This is the real defect of his book from the literary point of view the moral one is that in Billys excesses the ethical balance is not sufficiently preserved Otherwise we have nothing but admiration for this powerful and human story,juvenile
The Celebrated Madame Camfan Lady in Waiting to Marie Antoinette and Confidante of Napoleon By Violette M Montagu Eveleigh Nash 15s net HORTENSE has a beautiful disposition we understand one another so perfectly were almost the last words of that survivor of hundreds of wrecked fortunes Madame Campan It was because she cottld see the beauty in the disposition of many such people as the Queen of Holland and because her quick and sympathetic nature enabled her to understand perfectly so many of her friends and pupils that she has become one of the most interesting figures in French social history In her wonderful and useful career are interwoven the symbolic bees of Napoleon and the Bourbon lilies of Franceboth stained with the blood of the revolution and ofas it now seemsuseless wars Long before we begin Miss Violette Montagus wellarranged and admirably clear account of Madame Campan we are interested in her but all is newly set forth with skill and leisure from the birth of Henriette Genist and her acquaintance with the roi bienaime until the last line is penned and this remarkable woman lies in 1822 at peace at last in the cemetery at Mantes The intention of the author of this book has been as she says to present a faithful picture of the France of the Eil de Bceuf and of that greater France when no education was considered complete without a sojourn in Paris that Parnassus whither Napoleon the master mind invited the worlds most gifted artists musicians litterateurs scientists and thinkers This is a bold undertaking but one for which Miss Montagu would be perfectly fitted but for an occasional efflorescence of style and a slight inclination to wander from the matter in hand But as her more direct work  Eugene de Beauharnais proved she knows the vast numbers of memoires of the period perfectly and is completely at ease in later eighteenth and early nineteenth century France While dealing with the fortunes of her heroine all the hurrying pushing palpitating world of Louis XV Louis XVI of the Revolution of the Napoleonic era and the confused time that followed are laid before us How low men were and how they rise How high they were and how they tumble O vanity of vanities O laughable pathetic jumble  lhat is the sort of picture one sees once more in Miss Montagus interesting pages It is true that much has been told to us before almost all the characters are historical but the author endows them with new life and adds a thousand little touches gathered from wide reading or personal observation which make her story of Maman Campanfor she was a mother to all the great or wouldbe great ladies of the Empirefresh and delightful The reader of today need not trouble himself about the rather heavy and at the same time elusive volumes of Memoirs which Madame left us for Miss Montagu has adjusted the stilted style to modern taste The first part of the volume dealing with the Court of Marie iVntoinette is to some extent Madame Campans own work wisely edited and assisted by much knowledge gleaned from other and equally useful sources The second part which the author calls The Governess of the Bonapartes is founded on some of the correspondence between Madame Campan and the mother of Napoleon III who was of course under her care as Hortense de Beauharnais and among all her beloved pupils the most beloved The Fates may not have allowed all the girls who were brought up by Madame Campan to prove later very kind or very clever but the governess at least saw that their minds and bodies were perfectly healthy while she could influence them and her carefully thought out methods certainly produced many capable witty women and caused a tradition of wise education to flourish in France even until today Madame herself came of a family famous during generations for their taste for hard work and common sense for caution and in some cases coldness But the fine flower of their race the Henriette of the present volume combined much knowledge of men and things with wide sympathy and much warmth of character with wisdom which was both lively and discreet From the days when a child lectrice she entered the Court of Louis XV as the companion of his daughters to the very end she held in her heart the spirit of a devoted and unselfish mother and although her own marriage made by her parents of coursewas unhappy she never failed to make lighter the burdens which others had to bear At fourteen Miss Montagu says her heroine was in danger of becoming a bluestocking for she was quick and clever and made much of by the various masters of the arts of the day Albanesi the most fashionable of singing masters taught her the melodies of the alluring Lully while Goldoni himself made her familiar with Italian The little picture of her as she comes into prominence shows that the bluestocking period was soon over Miss Montagu pictures her entering the great world wearing a long train her slender figure enclosed in stiff stays and voluminous panniers with her little tearstained face besmirched with rouge and powder Her father had given her many wise warnings Whenever you receive flattering attentions he said you will gain an enemy Of flattery and enemies Madame Campan had her fair share as the years passed but her head was always cool and her heart true and sound and thus she survivedthe friend of humanity through so many and such various periods of Court life Her character and her surroundings make her a particularly interesting subject for such a volume as Miss Montagu gives us It is the life of a wise and sympathetic woman written by anotherand such an alliance will always make a delightful book,biography
The Celtic Twilight Men and Women Dhoula and Faeries By W B Yeats Lawrence  Bullen It was Math the Magicianthe same Math that formed the maiden Blodeuwedd from the blossoms of the oak and the broom and the meadowsweetwho made a boat once out of a little sedge and seaweed and set sail on another sea than we know today Mr Yeats is perhaps the one true follower of Math that we have left and he proves his daring as a magician in nothing so much as in this last book of his In it he dares to show us the materials of his craft the little sedge and seaweed from which he built his magic bark of Oisin and Cuchulain And if we are no nearer the secret at the end of this book than we were at the beginning it is assuredly our fault and not his The Celtic Twilight will still remain to the Saxon intelligence at any rate as much a mystery as ever Its men and women will remainonly men and women the dhouls and faeries will be no more intelligible or conceivable than before But to those who believe in Math that is in the Imagination before all it is different They soon fall under the spell a rhyme or so and the thing is done And Mr Yeats knows his art and begins with rhyme  44 The host is riding from Knockoarea And over the grave of Cloothnabarc  Caolte tosoing his burning hair And Niam calling  Away como away  44 4 And brood uo more where tho fire ia bright filling thy heart with a mortal dream  For breasts are heaviug aud eyes aglara  Away come away to the dim twilight  This invocation is only too effective It makes one expect other ghosts and enchantments more rare and elusive and more mediaeval than can possibly belong to this latter end of the Celtic twilight On the very next page it is true Mr Yeats determines his boundary explicitly in prose But the promise of his verse is not to be gainsaid and its effect is to make one keep hoping for all the ancient mystery of Celtic tradition still lurking as one half ventured to believe in the fields and watersides of Connaught and Leinster That unhappily no longer exists as it did Only the merest fragments remain and this book is a melancholy witness of how little that is For Mr Yeats makes no effort to build up these fragments he takes them as he finds them as they appear to him To give his own account of himself and his book Next to the desire he says which every artist feels to create for himself a little world out of the beautiful pleasant and significant things of this marred and clumsy universe I have desired to show in a vision something of the face of Ireland to any of my own people who care for things of this kind I have therefore written down accurately and candidly much that I have heard and seen and except by way of commentary nothing that I have merely imagined This distinction between the writers impressions and his imaginations is worth noting seeing how much Impressionism as against the purely imaginative use of subjectmatter is now in vogue Mr Yeats is not the only one among our younger contemporaries perhaps who has implied a difference between the two but none other that I know of has elected to make it in actual practice a question betwixt prose and verse However like many other poets his imEressions though expressed in prose will e found often to end in imaginationseven in lyrical imaginations In some passages of the book indeed the reader who has known Mr Yeats hitherto only as poet and rhymer will be very likely to hesitate and wonder whether this thing had not been better adapted to another vehicle as for instance in the striking conclusion of his second apologue   When all is said and done how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than anothers truth  For it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it and make their sweet honey Come into the world again wild bees wild bees But in the main the form is excellently wellfitted to the subjectmatter of the book as in the opening chapter which gives a characteristic account of one Ptddy Flynn A little brighteyed old man he lived in a leaky and oneroomed cabin in the village of Ballisodare which is he was wont to say the most gentlewhereby he meant faery place in the whole of County Sligo    He was a great teller of tale j and unlike our common romancers knew how to empty heaven hell and purgatory faeryland and earth to people his stories He did not live in a shrunken world but knew of no less ample circumstance than did nomer himself Perhaps the Gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination What is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident And are there not moods which need heaven hell purgatory and faeryland for their expression no less than this dilapidated earth F  Au  impressionist in the ordinary sense it is clear of course as any reader of his previous books must know Mr Yeats could never be and though in this book he pretends to give us impressions rather than imaginations of the twilight of the Gael his natural temper of idealism is such that not one of these sketches but is constantly turning its matter of fact into matter of imagination There is no want of humour either in the tales of the  gentry or fairy people or of the ghosts who range so delightfully through Mr Yeatss pages There is an excellent set of them in a chapter on  Village Ghosts in whose doings the villagers with true Irish philosophy have even learnt to take a humorous pleasure Of these ghosts one was a wicked seacaptain who 44 stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall in the shape of a snipe making the most horrible noises He was only dislodged when the wall was broken down  then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling How much more original this is than most of the ghosts in Borderland So too with others who inhabit the same village of H in Leinster which is so well described by Mr Yeats that we cannot resist stealing the passage 44 History has in no manner been burdened by this ancient village with its crooked lanes its old abbey churchyard full of long grass its green background of small firtrees and its Juay where lie a few tarry fishingluggers n the annals of entomology it is well known For a small bay lies westward a little where he who watohes night after night may see a certain rare moth fluttering along the edge of the tide just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn A hundred years ago it was carried here from Italy by smugglers in a cargo of silks and laces There is a curious halfghostly fascination about this elusive moth that makes one at once expect Mr Yeats to turn it to account as a symbol of the tricksy spirit of Celtic lore which he pursues But no  singularly enough he severely discounts both moth and mothhunter in a way that is quite unlike him For every poet is in a sense a mothhunter though indeed it is not given to many to have so rare a moth of a muse as that which haunts Mr Yeatss Celtic twilight Ernest Rhys,biography

THE CUCKOO CLOCK By A J Young 2S 6d Bumpus The tired road climbed the hill To where green rolling clouds hung still Nursing blue thunder in their bosoms With simplicity and a certain ruggedness of expression Mr A J Young obtains vivid effects in the poems he has collected in this small volume He speaks of grasshoppers like small machines mowing the hay of the old tree riddled by worms small shot of the wood  where in wide rents the sky falls through There is a boldness about his work that saves it from the insipidity of much modern lyrical verse though such boldness needs to be handled carefully lest it degenerate into extravagance But Mr Young has imagination and if his similes sometimes pull one up with a little shock they are striking and have a rough dramatic truth about them that stays in the memoryTHE CUCKOO CLOCK By Mrs Molesworth 6s Macmillan There is a new generation always ready for Mrs Molesworths stories and there could be no more attractive edition of the story of Griselda and her cuckoo than this one with its exquisitely dainty illustrations in colour and in blackandwhite It has always we think fallen to Mrs Molesworths lot to be interpreted by sympathetic artists and no one could have done better for her than Mr C E Brock has done here We envy the child who gets this book at Christmas and reads it for the first time It was published first in 1877 but its charm has not faded and Griselda and her great aunts the treasures she saw and her journeys with the cuckoo are here waiting to win and enthral fresh readers,juvenile

The Daisy Chain or Aspirations A Family Chronicle By the Author of the  Heir of Reddy fie c London John W Parker and Son 1856 We heard of an ironical gentlemans addressing a young lady the other day after this fashion 44 So you are for the Heir of Redclyffe I divide young ladies into two species one who swear by the Heir of Redclyffe and the other by Queechy Was it not an exasperating speech ladies  And an insulting comparison many will add Yet Queechy has its beauties too  not the hushed and sweet pervading charm the perfect taste tlie innate elegance the refined beauty no nor even the passion and intense interest of the Heir of Redclyffe but a simple untamed natural beauty of its own It is emphatically Protestant and perhaps what is called a little sectarian  rough too and outspoken at times it has an air of the wild woods and the back settlements about it The 44 Heir of Redclyffe is like a deep blue Italian sky with a rich gorgeous passionate sunset Queechy is more like an autumn heaven iii our cold climate with merry patches of sunlight bursting through the gloom and a cold sharp healthful wind abroad chasing the falling leaves Yet these are but fantastic similes and only play about the truth like bees that hover round the blossoms without settling The 4Heir of Redclyffe  is out of all compare the higher and the deeper work Artistically and morally its foundations are deeper laid and its parts are more thoroughly selfconsistent it yields evidence of a highly cultivated mind a genial spirit a kind and generous heart and a clear and powerful intellect so keen is the discrimination of character evinced and so sweetly and unobtrusively is it displayed We might rather match Miss Yonges creations with those of Miss Sewell also admirable of their kind her 44 Katharine Ashton being an especial favourite  we were sorry to find her fall so far beneath herself in her late 44 Cleve Hall but both these gentle and cheering lights may well shine on in their kindred spheres without having the relative brilliancy of their orbits too curiously investigated The star of the 4 Heir of Redclyffe  casts a wider and more brilliant ray but there is a chaste and holy influence in the beams of the sister planet But no more of this Come we to the matter directly at issue the merits of the 44 DaisyChain This is a certainly lengthy family chronicle of some 600 closely printed pages with little or no plot and perhaps not much romantic interest and yet it has interested and edified us not a little There is little or no direct didactic teaching but a healthful atmosphere breathes through the whole There are a thousand wayside flowers though no gorgeous magnolia or other hothouse blossoms The dear mother so soon removed the enthusiastic gallant generous father the doctor and all the children become familiar to us as real acquaintances We do not think of them as of characters in a book but as of actual people respecting whom we are entitled to hold our own opinions sometimes not coinciding with those of the author Norman is too proud and too fastidious to please us though he is a noble fellow after all Henry is well nigh our favourite of the boys  Richard is very good but a little of a bore  then for the girls Ethel though certainly a good deal like Miss Bremers 44 Petrea is like with a difference more learned and perhaps more earnest more English altogether Margaret verifies the motto si douce est la Margarine Mary Flora all are to the life whether we like or dislike them But how yield our readers an idea of the charm of this book by quotations That were impossible unless the quotations were very ample and our review exceedingly elaborate Within such limits as we shall allot ourselves we can only say that reading the 44 DaisyChain  is something like taking a walk through a plain country which does not appear romantic at first sight in the early summer when every chance step discloses some new object of delight the wild flowers in the hedges the rich blossom of the may the gay and giddy butterflies the blue sky overhead with its white clouds scudding past the sun and the sense of living joy which animates creation This is not a book to read straight through or in a hurry you will not enjoy it then You are not hurried along by wild excitement as in Miss Brontes startling creations But young people will love the 44 Daisy Chain and so will many of their elders and we feel that we are bound to thank Miss Yonge for teaching us unselfishness simplicity and rectitude in such a very pleasant and unpretending way She has strung a wreath of daisies it is true but they are daisies that will not witherThe Daisy Chain  or Aspirations A Family Chronicle By the Author of The Heir of I Redclyffe c Parker  Son The links of The Daisy Chain are eleven young children living in a country town with kind parents and a happy English home Each Daisy is the complete child of nature yet has its own individuality which is preserved throughout and each character speaks so naturally for itself that the reader seems to be one of the  Chain and sitting in family conclave round the hearth The book must be taken up with a determination to enter into home feelings for story there is none The contrast between the children and their various  aspirations form the only incidents that verge on excitement so that the feelings must be interested alone by the truthfulness and simplicity of theFamily Chronicle So many young heroes and heroines with their instructors give the Author of The Heir of Redclyffe and  Heartsease ample opportunities for exercising her peculiar genius for minute sketches of character but we must warn her that when carried into too minute ramifications it will be apt to be pronounced  finicking No better idea can be given of the story than by quoting the Daisies mothers description of them which certainly will interest those the most who have daisies of their own  You say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken daisies and if I do not write in these leisure days you will hardly get it after I am in the midst of business again The new Daisy is like Margaret at the same agemay she continue like her  Pretty creature she eau hardly be more charming than nt present Aubrey the moonfaced is far from reconciled to his deposition from babyhood he is a sober solemn gentleman backward in talking and with such a will of his own as will want much watching very different from Blanche who is Flora over again perhaps prettier and more fairylike unless this is only ones admiration for the buds of the present season None of thtm has ever been so winning as this little maid who even attracts Dr Hoxton himself and obtains sugarplums and kisses Bather she than I says Harrybut notice is notice to the white Mayflower and there is my anxittyI am afraid it is not wholesome to be too engaging ever to gi t a rebuff I hope having a younger sister and outgrowing baby charms may be salutary Flora soon left off thinking about her beauty and the fit of vanity does less harm at five than fifteen My poor Tom has not such a happy life as Blanche he is often in trouble at lessons and bullied by Harry at play in spite of his champion Mary  and yet I cannot interfere for it is good for him to have all this preparatory teazing before he goes into school He hus good abilities but not much perseverance or energy and I must take the teaching of him into my own hands till his schooldays begin in hopes of instilling them The girlishness and timidity will be knocked out of him by the boys I suppose Harry is too kind and generous to do more than teaze him moderately and Norman will see that it does not go too far lt is a common saying that Tom and Mary made a mistake that he is the girl and she the boy for she isa rough merry creaturethe noisiest in the house always skirmishing with Harry in defence of Tom and yet devoted to him and wanting to do everything lie does Those two Harry and Mary are exactly alike except for Harrys curly mane of lioncoloured wig   So much for the younger bairns whom you never beheld dear Flora The three whom you left when people used to waste pity on me for their being all babies together now look as if any pair of them were twins for Norman is the tallest almost outgrowing his strength and Ethels sharp face so like her papas makes her look older than Flora Norman and Ethel do indeed take after their papa more than any of the others and are much alike There is the same brilliant cleverness the same strong feeling not easy of demonstration though impetuous in action but poor Ethels old foibles her harumscarum nature quick temper uncouth manners and heedlessness of all but one absorbing object have kept her back and caused her much discomfort yet I sometimes think these manifest defects have occasioned a discipline that is the best thing for the character in the end They are fuults that show themselves and which one can tell how to deal with and I have full confidence that she has the principle within her that will conquer them   Your sweet goddaughter Flora I almost feel as if I had spoken in disparagement of her but I meant no such thing dear girl It would be hard to find a fault in her since the childish love of admiration was subdued She is so solid and Bteady as to be very valuable with the younger ones and is fast growing so lovely that I wish you could behold her I do not see any vanity but there lies my dread not of beautyvanity but that she will find temptation in the being everywhere liked and sought after Death stops the writers hand and by being left early motherless and unwatched the various characters of the children quickly develope themselves though nipped by Miss Winter the governess who is  sharp and then unrestrained by her successor who is  soft and  has feelings Of the contrasts constantly brought out perhaps the most striking is that between the two elder girls and their  aspirations though it is difficult to separate any part of a chain so linked together Ethel tall awkward and enthusiastic  was obliged to set to work so many principles to induce herself to wipe a pen or to sit straight on her chair that it was like winding up a steamengine to thread a needle  yet the work was done Shewas struggling with her faultshumbled by them watching them overcoming them Flora quiet blueeyed and selfcontrolled meanwhile was sitting calmly down in the contemplation of the unexpected services she had rendered confident that her character for energy and excellence was established believing it herself and looking back on her childish vanity and love of domineering as long past and conquered She thought her grownup character had begun and was too secure to examine it closely Ethels hope and aim in life is to civilize the wild denizens of a neighbouring slate quarry to form a school and perhaps build a church Flora strains hard throughout her life  to serve two masters  and by her marriage with a neighbouring squire Mr Rivers who gets into Parliament and transplants her to Park Lane she has ample opportunities of carrying on the struggle  Mrs Rivers is an admirable woman  So every one felt and her youthful beauty and success in the fashionable world made her qualities as a wife and mistress of a household the more appreciated She never set aside her religious habits or principles and was an active member of various charitable associations Meanwhile Ethels school is built on the moor  and the first teaandbun day is exquisitely and naturally told There was progress Yes there was Only three were as utterly rude and idealess as they used to be at Christmas Glimmerings had dawned on most and one Una MCarthy was fit to come forward to claim Mr Wilmots promise of a prayerbook She could really read and say the Catechism her Irish wit and love of learning had outstripped all the restand she was the pride of Ethels heart though alas neither present nor exhortation had succeeded in making her anything in looks hut a picturesque tatterdemalionher sandy elflocks streaming over a pair of eyes so dancing and gracieuses that it was impossible to scold her    She made up for all the atrocious stupidity of others who after being told every time since they had begunwho gave them their

this was nil that her time and labour had effected  He did not wish to vex her but it was more than he could stand However Ethel was too much engrossed to look for sympathy It was a fine spring day and on the open space of thc common the arrangements were quickly made The children stood in long lines and the baskets were unpacked Mary and Blanche gave the presentsand assuredly the grins courtesies and pulls of the forelock they elicited could not have been more hearty The buns and the kettles of tea followed it was perfect delight to entertainers and entertained except when Marys dignity was cruelly hurt by Normans authoritatively taking a kettle out of her hands telling her she would be the death of herself or somebody else and reducing her to the rank of merely a bun distributor which Blanche and Aubrey could do just as wellFlora in London begins at length to give way in her struggle and the death of her only and neglected child prostrates her both in mind and body and sue sorrows with the sorrow of despair while Ethel at length sees her  aspiration  realizedspire and chancel pinnacle and buttress rise before her on wild Cocksmoor nnd the bells call

The Eskdale HerdBoy a Scottish Talc by Mrs Blackford VJmo pp 210 A good deal of exertion has been turned within these late years to thc instruction of the lower orders in their accidence and spelling books have been let forth Upon them in a torrent of very praiseworthy liberality This was certainly some progress in raising that immense majority of our species who have not drawn hereditary estates or solid prizes in the great lottery of life into a hope of enjoyment rather above the cattle with whom they have hitherto lived in such meek equality And the effort wa9 perhaps as much as could fairly be expected from the lazy and London luxury that knows nothing of the peasant but as a remote feeder of pigs and poultry and nothing of the distresses of rural life but by the increased agio on blanched asparagus and premature peas But there are other observers andcabins have been penetrated by the feet of the fashionable and the fair Some share of this has been due to thc romance that dreams of Arcadia at the sight of a thatched roof and finds a delighted refuge for flutter ing sentimentality in peat smoke iud mud walls  but some share may nM all our scepticism about benevolence attributed to the genuine desire ol making thc comfortless comfortable and giving the ignorant the common means of knowing their duty to society The writer of this book has been one of the latter investigators anti we are gretilled by giving such publicity as may be within our power to a work calculated tc conduct to wisdom through pleasantness The Herd boy of Eskdale is thc history of an orphan who by the common accidents of rustic life and tbe easy exercise of rustic virtues makes his way through the world not indeed to title and estate the absurd lures of viiluge ambition but to competence tocharactcr to thc possession of the woman of his carly fondness and to perhH thc still higher reward the mer of giving his carly benefactors child a shelter under his roof anti repaying Iib debt of gratitude to the sleeper in the grave hy invaluable kindness to the dejected being that he hail left behind to the struggles of the world The writer opens her design in a brief preface The author of this work many vcars ago spent a few weeks in Kskdale The beauly of the country made a deep impression on her perhaps the more so from its being the farthest excursion to the southward that she bael then made from her native home The general character and manners of the inhabitants are she believes correctly represented for there is scarcely an incident exemplifying these of which she had not known the coiuiterpart in real life The respect universally paid by the parishioners to their clergyman mid the great influence which he possesses in forming their minds and morals are circumstances which have fallen under her own observation She hts felt a peculiar satisfaction in describing the simple und useful life of Mr and Mrs Martin from thc remembrance of many worthy cjipls

thc short and unfortunate life ot William Martin she has attempted to shew thc duty of subduing a disobedient and selfwilled temper the character of Helen is meant on thc contrary to illustrate thc inestimable value of which a dutiful daughter may be Her prudence steadiness and even energy on some trying occasions are the result of an education conducted on those principle which ensure the love of the child by a reliance on the justice and affection of the parent In short this is an excellent mothers book We give some extracts The narrative begins in this simple manner In the year 1807 there stood on the beautiful hanks of thc river Esk in Dumfriesshire one of the most southern countries in Scotland a small cottage Thc neat white walls ttcllthatched roof and clean casementwindows ornamented as they were with honeysuckles and roses attracteirthc admiration of the few strangers who from the uncommon beauty and grandeur of thc scenery were tempted to turn off the direct road from Langholm to Edinburgh and follow the windings of the river to its source The cottages in general in that part of the country present a very different appearance  having too frequently a look of neglect the windows broken the walls dirty and instead of a pretty garden a heap of mud before the door The contrast therefore rendered this build  ing thc more remarkable and led people to suppose what indeed was the case that its inhabitants were more industrious and had seen a little more of the customs of other countries than their less neat and cleanly neighbours The names of the couple who resided on this snot were John and Marion Telfer their history I am now going to relate John was the only son of an honest industrious couple who lived in the neighbourhood of Langholm but who unfortunately both died of a fever when he was little more than ten years old leaving him nothing but their blessing and thc virtuous habits of integrity and obedience in which they had trained him from his earliest youth On their deathbed they entreated that the excellent clergyman who in spite of the malignity of the disease continued to comfort and pray by them in their last moments would take compassion on their poor Kttle orphan and find him employment among the neighbouring formers either as a herdhoy to some of the numerous flocks of sheep which arc common in Eskdale or a ploughboy in their fields Mr Martin for such was thc name of the pious pastor assured them that he would do all in his power for their chikl and lie kept his word for as soon as they were dead he took thc boy home to hil own house and there endeavoured by kindness and sympathy to console him forhjs great and irreparable loss For some days ail Ins endeavours were unsuccessful John though sensible of the kind attentions of Mr Murtin still felt miserable and unhappy All his dear mothers care and tenderness all thc pains and trouble that his kind father used to take in teaching him to read his Bible after perhaps a hard days work thc delight with which they both watched his improvementall all rose to poor Johns mind aud made him believe he newer more could be happy Mr Martin at last seeing the boys melancholy continue thought that a little employment might serve to rouse him He therefore one morning called John into hi study and asked him if he would be so good as to assist in dusting anel arranging some books which Mere in a large chest in the  corner ofthe room John from lowness of spirits did not much like to bc employed  but as he had been taught by his father always to be obedient and to do at once whatever he was desired he immediately set about dusting thc books Thc first two or three he merely wiped aud put them down without looking at them but at last rubbing one a leaf fell out which obligee him to open the book to put it back again The work happened to be a handsome edition of Robinson Crusoe with very beautiful prints Mr Martin who was watching him unobserved culled to him to bring the book and then told him he might look at the pictures if he pleased Jolm who had never seen any thing of thc kind before was delighted with this permission and placing himself at a little distance so as not to disturb Mr Martin began turning over the leaves  his eyes sparkling and his little hands trembling with increased delight at every new scene that was represented At last he came to the one where Man Friday is saved from the savages Here his curiosity got the better of the natural awe he felt for Air Martin  and he cried out  Pray Sir lie so good as to tell me what this meansfor though John had been taught to read his Bible as well as his poor father was capable of teaching yet this was in so imperfect a way that he could by no means read easily and was obliged to spell more than half his words Mr Martin smiled goodnaturedly as Johns exclamation made him raise his head from the book he was reading and desiring liim to come near his chair he explained at some length what the print represented after which he asked John if he would not like to be able to read the story himself Jolm immediately answered O dear yes Sir that I should  but looking down and the tears starting into his eyes  that can never be now  for my dear father is dead and gone and nobody else will ever take thc trouble to teach so poor a boy jw I am Anti yet continued he looking in Mr Martins face and brightening a little with a kind of hope  dont you think Sir that if I succeed in getting a place and if I am very very attentive and alway taite pains to please my master I may in time be able to save out of my wage as much as a penny u week  for I know if I could do that I might so to the school at Langholm 1 remember nearing my poor dear father wsh very much that he could afford to pay so much money forme as he said he waa sure that Mr Campbell would teach me to read much beater than he could The history proceeds through the innocent details of life such as it might bc found in a valley in the primitive age The young peasant grows up la understanding and morals and the ministers family is the place of tranquil virtue But there conies a disturbance to all this quiet in the conduct of a son The minister has hot had the power of communicating his own spirit to his turbulent boy and hrother William runs off to sea leaving Helen in sorrow The effects of this disobedience tire however most injurious to hil parents his mother overwhelmed with sorrow takes to her bed The scene that follows is pictured with great artlessness and we think with peculiar feeling Letters arrive from William mentioning his having fixed himself on board a ship going to sea Helen folded up tlie letters and sat for a few minutes considering on their content Her own good sense and feelings of obedience to her parents pointed out to her in how very improper a style her brother wrote  but her love and affection for Winiam made her try to excuse him  Boys are so different from girls thought she  William hat been away so much too from home and besides he must chase a profession and rt would be hard not to leave him at liberty to be what he thinks himself flt for In the evening of this doy Mrs Martin felt herself better and for thc first time since her illness spoke to her husband on the subject of William Mr Martin told her he was with her brother and likewise that he had heard from himself He thea stated what Captain Elliott had said as to Williams being allowed to remain with him but owned he was very averse to this pian Mrs Martin answered very calmly  My dear husband as fur as my judgment goes I perfectly agree with my brother I Would not certainly have chosen that William should be a sailorif I could have prevented it hut as he has acted I think it is thc best thing we can now do He will be under my dear brothers care  and I shall now  controlled she looking at her husband with tendcitwsa  die in peace on hw account convinced fhat Elliott will exert every means to correct and improve my poor boy thc last legacy of dying sister Mr Martin quite alarmed by this address asked lier if she felt herself worse and rose to send for Mr Armstrong She krid her hand gently on his arm  My dearest love said she  I am not woree bm I own I have been watching for an opportunity of preparing your mtnd for what I believe

to you with regard to Helen At present I must have don my strength will not permit nie to continic the conversation Only write my dearest love to my brother and tell hiin I consign my son entirely to his management  and I trust he will endeavour to guard his father from all future anxiety on his account He has cost him epiite enough already The last words were spoken so low that they were evidently not meant for her husbands ear Ile had remained quite motionless all the time she was speaking When she ceased he became almost convulsed with agony for some minutes but a violent shower of tears relieved him and most probably saved either his reason or his life or indeed perhaps both Helen coming into the room showed him thc necessity of composure  and hastily passing her saying he must send answers to his hitters he left the room and shut himself up in his study there to implore compassion and resignation from a Being who is never deaf to thc petitions ofthe humble and sincere believer A few days showed plainly that Mrs Martin knew her own situation but too well She appeared gradually though slowly sinking One evening she asked her husband to raise her up a little  and then desiring Helen to bring her pen and ink she insisted on 1 teing allowed to write a few lines  I shall write very little  said she  but it is a duty thatimtst not be longer delayed She then wrote what appeared to be only a short note which she sealed and addressee to William anel putting it into her husbands hand saul  send this my love when all is over  not before It may comfort him poor fellow he will require comfort then Mr Martin now felt it his duty to inform his dear Helen of the state her mother was really in but it was some time before bc could gain sufficient courage to break it to her One evening however seeing his wife worse than usual he was apprehensive that should her death take place while Helen was unprepared it might have fatal effects upon the poor girls health He therefore followed her into her room when she went to prepare for bcd and there in the gentlest manner informed her of the truth Helen at first wa in such a state of violent grief thtt she could listen to nothing her father said and indeed for some hours was utterly incapable either ef reusoiiug or exertion  but at last lifting up her head and jeeing her poor father pale anel exhausted leaning over her she started up aili throwing herself into his arms cried  Forgive me my dearest father for being so selfish I will indulge in this almost criminal conduct no longer Leave me for a few minutes You may trust me I will then join you anil endeavour to perform my duty both in attending the last moments of my prc eious mother and in being a comfort met a burthen to myeiilally dear father Mr Martin thought it bcif te comply with her rc quest and retired to try and subdue his own feelings that bc might be able to attend to his wife In half an hour Helen and her father were at Mrs Martins bedside She smiled faintly when she perceived them Holding out her hand she thus addressed her husband My dear I wish much to see my mother pray write for her She will I inn sure gratify me Mr Martin immediately left the room to send off a messenger to Melrose Mrs Martin then took hold of Helens hand and said  My clearest girl 1 wish to say a fewwords to you but it must be when you ure composed enough to listen to me The length to which this extract has run compels us to leave out thc last affecting advice of Mrs M to her excellent daughter It thus concludes Helen now in a quiet composed voice went over every circumstance that her mother had enumerated und added a sacred promise never to disobey her lust commands in thought or deed When she had so done her mother clasping her in her arms gave her in a solemn manner that most precious of all gifts to a dutiful child a dying mothers blessing She then aked for a little jelly and on her husbands coming into the room advised Helen to take a turn in the garden and recruit herself by getting a little fresh air She obeyed and after a shower of tears became composed enough to return to her mournful duties within doors Mrs Ms mother Mrs Elliott arrived the next day when Mrs Martin had the satisfaction of gaining her consent to give up her house nt Melrose ind come to live at the manse Mr Martin assured her that she should ever be considered by him os his own mother His wife joined their hands exclaiming My work is finished in this world I have now onlv to look forward to another and a better Her work in this world did indeed seem finished The next day without any apparent change for the worse as her motlier and Helen were sitting by thc bedside and her kind anxious husband was supporting her in his arms she laid her head on his shoulder and seemed to fall asleep It was some minutes before he was aware that she was gone for ever Thus perished one of the best and most exemplary of mothers entirely from anxious solicitude about a son who in spite of all admonition and remonstrance had allowed j the growth and practice of disobedience for  several years to embitter his kind parents  lives und whose headstrong violence and selfwill at last brought the being whom he  most loved n earth to a premature grave  The narrative now rapidly approaches  to its close William perishes his father dies in purity and

his management  and I trust he will endeavour to guard his father from all future anxiety on his account He has cost him epiite enough already The last words were spoken so low that they were evidently not meant for her husbands ear Ile had remained quite motionless all the time she was speaking When she ceased he became almost convulsed with agony for some minutes but a violent shower of tears relieved him and most probably saved either his reason or his life or indeed perhaps both Helen coming into the room showed him thc necessity of composure  and hastily passing her saying he must send answers to his hitters he left the room and shut himself up in his study there to implore compassion and resignation from a Being who is never deaf to thc petitions ofthe humble and sincere believer A few days showed plainly that Mrs Martin knew her own situation but too well She appeared gradually though slowly sinking One evening she asked her husband to raise her up a little  and then desiring Helen to bring her pen and ink she insisted on 1 teing allowed to write a few lines  I shall write very little  said she  but it is a duty thatimtst not be longer delayed She then wrote what appeared to be only a short note which she sealed and addressee to William anel putting it into her husbands hand saul  send this my love when all is over  not before It may comfort him poor fellow he will require comfort then Mr Martin now felt it his duty to inform his dear Helen of the state her mother was really in but it was some time before bc could gain sufficient courage to break it to her One evening however seeing his wife worse than usual he was apprehensive that should her death take place while Helen was unprepared it might have fatal effects upon the poor girls health He therefore followed her into her room when she went to prepare for bcd and there in the gentlest manner informed her of the truth Helen at first wa in such a state of violent grief thtt she could listen to nothing her father said and indeed for some hours was utterly incapable either ef reusoiiug or exertion  but at last lifting up her head and jeeing her poor father pale anel exhausted leaning over her she started up aili throwing herself into his arms cried  Forgive me my dearest father for being so selfish I will indulge in this almost criminal conduct no longer Leave me for a few minutes You may trust me I will then join you anil endeavour to perform my duty both in attending the last moments of my prc eious mother and in being a comfort met a burthen to myeiilally dear father Mr Martin thought it bcif te comply with her rc quest and retired to try and subdue his own feelings that bc might be able to attend to his wife In half an hour Helen and her father were at Mrs Martins bedside She smiled faintly when she perceived them Holding out her hand she thus addressed her husband My dear I wish much to see my mother pray write for her She will I inn sure gratify me Mr Martin immediately left the room to send off a messenger to Melrose Mrs Martin then took hold of Helens hand and said  My clearest girl 1 wish to say a fewwords to you but it must be when you ure composed enough to listen to me The length to which this extract has run compels us to leave out thc last affecting advice of Mrs M to her excellent daughter It thus concludes Helen now in a quiet composed voice went over every circumstance that her mother had enumerated und added a sacred promise never to disobey her lust commands in thought or deed When she had so done her mother clasping her in her arms gave her in a solemn manner that most precious of all gifts to a dutiful child a dying mothers blessing She then aked for a little jelly and on her husbands coming into the room advised Helen to take a turn in the garden and recruit herself by getting a little fresh air She obeyed and after a shower of tears became composed enough to return to her mournful duties within doors Mrs Ms mother Mrs Elliott arrived the next day when Mrs Martin had the satisfaction of gaining her consent to give up her house nt Melrose ind come to live at the manse Mr Martin assured her that she should ever be

THE HAND OF ETHELBERTA Thc Hand of Ethelberta By Thomas Hardy In Two Volumes London  Smith Elder and Co If you asked anybody during the progress of Mr Hardys novel through the Cornhill how they liked the story you generally received an uncertain and qualified answer All admitted tbat it was very clever and original not like any other novel they had ever read but most people added tbat they thought the character of the lady as well as her adventures too improbable They would not believe that such a woman ever existed or could exist and granting the possibility of the character there were many of tho incidents which struck them as extremely unlikely departures from the course of real life Improbability has been the main fault alleged against the  Hand of Ethelberta in current criticisms of the story Now we have always been among the enthusiastic admirers of Mr Hardys work recognising in it the very highest artistic purposes and something not far short of the highest powers of execution and we venture to think that this accusation of improbability as a fault proceeds upon a misapprehension of the writers intentions We do not of course presume to dictate what is to be considered probable and what improbable This is eminently one of the points on which a critic has no right to interfere between the novelist and his reader and would find no profit in interfering The reader may always legitimately decline to take any critics opinion as to what he ought to believe to be possible and if the reader pronounces a story improbable and declines on that ground to approve of it the novelist has failed He has failed that is if he intended to produce an impression of probability Here the critic in the exercise of his chief function of discovering and explaining the intentions of the novelist may lawfully intervene If the novelist did not intend his story to be a reflex of real life he cannot be blamed if it is not unless we are to lay down  close adherence to the probabilities of real life as an indispensable condition of novelwriting Mr Hardy seems to us to have deliberately disclaimed being tried by a rigid standard of probability when he adopted as the subtitle of his work a comedy in chapters True there is a comedy of manners in which to be improbable is to fail because its design is to produce an illusion of real life It has recently been argued in these columns that probability is one of the tests by which the comedy of manners is distinguished from the farce But there is another sort of comedy what may be called ideal comedy in which the fancy is permitted to range beyond the limits of real life Mr Hardys  Ethelberta  a comedy in chapters is a comedy of this sort Characters and incidents are deliberately and consistently deflected from the perpendicular of real life to gratify the humour of the comic muse The incidents in  Ethelberta are improbable as the incidents in Shakespeares comedies are improbable It is a work of art pervaded by a dominant sentiment which colours every incident and every character Whatever maybe thought of the interest of Ethelberta as compared with  Far from the Madding Crowd it certainly shows no falling off in intellectual force There is not a trace of hasty work in  Ethelberta  its dialogues its descriptions its general proportions are as thoughtfully calculated and firmly worked out as a Dutch painting of the old school Not that the novel is dull and laborious on the contrary it is full of life and spirit bright all through with the sunshine of humour and fancy The novelist has been at pains to conceal his painstaking and has succeeded But Mr Hardy undertook a difficult task in trying to work out such a conception as the character of the heroine Ethelberta  he burdened himself with a very subtle and intricate psychological problem The startingpoint of the story he gives in a brief formal prologue in the first chapter Younp Mrs Petherwin stepped from the door of an old though popularlnn in a Wessex town to tike a country walk By her look and carriage she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no worldly sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen  but as a fact not generally known her claim to distinction was rather one of brains than of blood She was a respectable butler s daughter and began life as a baby christened Ethelberta after an infant oftitle who does not come into the story at all having merely furnished to Ethelbertas mother a means of occupying herself as head nurse She became teacher in a school was praised by examiners admired by gentlemen not admired by gentlewomen was touched up with accomplishments by masters who wero coaxed into painstaking by her many graces rather than by her few coins and entering a mansion as governess to the daughter thereof was stealthily married by the son He a minor like herself died from a chill c Night during the wedding tour and a few weeks later was followed into the grave by Sir Ralph Pethcrwin his unforgiving father who had bequeathed his wealth to his wifo absolutely These calamities were a sufficient reason to Lady Petherwin for pardoning all concerned She took by the hand the forlorn Ethelbertawho seemed rather a detached bride than a widowand finished her education by placing her for two or threo years in a boardingschool at Bonn Latterly he had brought the girl to England to live under hvr roof as daughter and companion th1 condition attached being that Ethelberta was never openly to recognise her poor relations This is the lady whose hand is the subject of contention throughout the book If Mr Anthony Trollope had been commissioned to trace Mrs Petherwins adventures in search of a husband he would probably have contented himself with bringing out in a series of clever descriptions of Mrs Petherwin in society that her varnish of gentility was only skindeep that the heart of the butlers daughter beat beneath the elegant garb of the fine lady and he would have found in this plenty of material for an entertaining comedy of manners But Mr Hardy has chosen another line He drops the question of Ethelbertas manners on one side with an understanding that they were as perfect as if her fathers vestibules had been lined with ancestral mail and sets himself to the more intricate task of tracing how Ethelberta threw overboard various lovers and made up her mind to accept the suit of a profligate old lord There is not much difficulty it will be said in that nor indeed would there have been if Mr Hardy had written from the point of view of the cynic A marriage of love renounced for a marriage of convenience is a very commonplace affair But the peculiarity aud originality of Mr Hardys conception lies in the motives which he assigns for Ethelbertas choice and his mastery of the novelists art is shown in the skill with which he traces the working of contending motives If the  Hand of Ethelberta had not appeared before  Daniel Deronda Mr Hardy might have been accused of borrowing his method under great variety of character and circumstances from  George Eliot Ethelberta is a character in which passion is ruled by judgment She was not incapable of passion but reason clearsighted calculation of consequences had the upper hand A talent for demureness under difficulties without tho coldbloodedness which renders such a bearing natural and easy a face and hand reigning unmoved outside a heart by nature turbulent as a Mave is a constitutional arrangement much to bo desired by people in general yet had Ethelberta been framed with less of that gift in her her life might have been more comfortable as an experience and brighter as an example though perhaps duller as a story Such a character is dangerous the most cruel monsters the most shameless adventurers are often made of such materials If Ethelbertas judgment had been occupied solely in controlling her turbulent impulses to her own advantage her biographer might have had to record a very unlovely career But she was not a selfish woman though she did read Bentham and slightly pervert his teaching The sentiment of family was stronger in her than the sentiment of self In the prologue which we have quoted it is said to have been a condition of Lady Petherwins patronage of her daughterinlaw that she should not recognise her poor relations Now it was by no means with goodwill that Ethelberta temporarily yielded to this condition The old butler her father had a large family of whom Ethelberta was the eldest and her ruling motive in life to which every other was subordinated was the advancement of her brothers and sisters She had all a parents interest in them She was eager enough for distinction and social homage but she was resolved to put her whole family in a position of independence This was the source of all her difficulties aud the source we should think of many difficulties to the novelist If Ethelberta had been a solitary adventuress her fortunes would have been much easier to trace The death of Lady Petherwin removed her necessity for living separate from her poor relations and at the same time imposed upon her the necessity of earning a living by her own exertions for Lady Petherwin and she quarrelled before the old ladys death and she was cut off with nothing as a basis of operations except the lease of a house for three years in a fashionable square It was no easy task for a woman to make a living and at the same time keep her position in society but Ethelberta contrived not only to do so but also to keep all her family by her side The shifts by which this was managed the mental struggles ofthe heroine during tbe three years for which her fashionable residence was at her command and the grounds of ber final decision are invented and imagined with the most unfailing humour and a very sure insight into the mysteries of the conscience To lay bare the framework of Mr Hardys story in this analytical way would bo doing him an injustice if we did not say that his framework does not lie on the surface In tbis respect his art is very much higher than George Eliots He traces motives with a skill not less sure and patient but with a much more perfect concealment of the process There is a freshness and sunny clearness about his work a definiteness of outline a bold play of fancy which recals in some indefinable way through all tho difference of incidents and characters the air of the Elizabethan comedy Mr Hardys carefulness in construction and regard for dramatic unity is worthy of Ben Jonson himself There is no straggling in the novel in every chapter it is the disposal of the hand of Ethelberta tbat is in suspense The connecting thread is slight but it binds thc parts very firmly together From whatever point of view we regard the work we find deliberate artistic aims and unflinching fidelity of execution One of the most striking features is the way in which pictorial effects are interpenetrated with the action giving every chapter something like the vividness of a scene in a play We are not only told what the personages say but we seem to see the gesture with which tbey say it and the furniture or the landscape round them Whether this is altogether commendable in a novel whether it does not tend to impede the course of the action and generally dull the impression of what is said and done by imposing too constant a strain on the pictorial faculty of the reader is a subject for consideration but at any rate it is interesting as an experiment We doubt whether Ethelberta possesses tho popular interest of some of Mr Hardys previous novels and so far that is a fault or at least a disadvantage to which the novelist must reconcile himself but it is more masterly as a work of artit reveals a progress in technical excellence which makes us look forward with curiosity to his next publication,biography

The History of Sir Richard Calmady a Romance LITERATURE f NEW NOVELS  By Lucas Malet Methuen Co What sort of novel shall we have next The political the romantic the theological and so many more types come and go and still we are left waiting for the satisfying one All they do just at present is to increase not in grace but in length What we really want for a change is a little human nature pure and simple and not such a weight of environment and side issues The History of Sir Richard Calmady is not the desire of ones eyes but it begins its 618 pages pleasantly enough Mrs Harrison starts with a leisurely account of her heros forbears their fair domain near the Surrey hills the family legend and the family curse Six hooks each with its title are subdivided into chapters headed by something of a Meredithian turn But the atmosphere is alas more clinical than Meredithian The skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages Elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely The History of Sir Richard Calmady cannot have been lightly undertaken nor is it lightly executed The leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable Fallowfield are all the more welcome His son Ludovic has also a whimsical  way with him but we seem to have met his kind before only better realized Lord Fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story As its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated Briefly it is this  The year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race They are the parents of the future Sir Richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions On Richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends His is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for Richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last tho dominant factor and the constant interest Though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning He comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground Richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation The fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident The shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a Velasquez  Dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother Surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer The result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster This is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader We need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness Mrs Harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of Miss Mulocks old story  A Noble Life but more in the  modern spirit and manner In spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness But it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject The mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage If we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own The tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties Of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses One scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained It is when Richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily Nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonize a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own The fifth book called  The Rakes Progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all The evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate The author seems quite out of her depth here The Neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus To use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake But the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides The story actually closes not on the tragic note but in England to the sound of Sir Richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruinFiction The History of Richard Cal mady  a Romance By Lucas Malet Methuen 6s When you see Richard Calmady sitting at table he is an Apollo His splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men But see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the Apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship And the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character The reader never sees him all at once The table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the Apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke Richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two And the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person The artistic justification of Richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex He is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained decomposed and separately set forth Many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment There is Clara the housemaid who nursed the young dwarf in his youth and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet There is Mrs Chifney the trainers wife at the stables who also wept simple soulbecause she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel There is little Lady Constance Quayle She too wept when Richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations But the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are Katherine Calmady Helen de Vallorbes and Honoria St Quentin In these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin It is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable In all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts Moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  Lucas Malet is the pseudonym of Charles Kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman Perhaps of them all Katherine Calmady Richards mother is the finest Pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity of motion which in Richards eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room The second of the three women Helen de Vallorbes Richards evil genius if she is certainly not a pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than Katherine Calmady With the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism She is cruelshe was the child who laughed at Richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion To her the grotesquelydtformed Richard becomes a subtle attraction She begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust The character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green And the chief incident in her amorous relations with Richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration Beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters Richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow It is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous Cyrano de Bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior The minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome The melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman Julius March discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the Velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely Corellian in its obvious luridness The whole idea of this explanation of Richards deformity by legend is unworthy of Lucas Malet it should be left to the How Hells Xnvelette The unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking Nothing matters in fact except that Lucas Malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women And if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters,biography

of a Meredithian turn But the atmosphere is alas more clinical than Meredithian The skilful surgeon rather than the comic muse hovers over the scene of these gloomy yet clever pages Elegant trifling and witty divagation enter rarely The History of Sir Richard Calmady cannot have been lightly undertaken nor is it lightly executed The leading motive is of such a gruesome kind that the few featherheaded remarks of the amiable Fallowfield are all the more welcome His son Ludovic has also a whimsical  way with him but we seem to have met his kind before only better realized Lord Fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story As its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated Briefly it is this  The year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race They are the parents of the future Sir Richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions On Richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends His is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for Richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last tho dominant factor and the constant interest Though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning He comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground Richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation The fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident The shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a Velasquez  Dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother Surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer The result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster This is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader We need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness Mrs Harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of Miss Mulocks old story  A Noble Life but more in the  modern spirit and manner In spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness But it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject The mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage If we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own The tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties Of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses One scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained It is when Richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily Nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonize a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own The fifth book called  The Rakes Progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all The evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate The author seems quite out of her depth here The Neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus To use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake But the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides The story actually closes not on the tragic note but in England to the sound of Sir Richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruinFiction The History of Richard Cal mady  a Romance By Lucas Malet Methuen 6s When you see Richard Calmady sitting at table he is an Apollo His splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men But see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the Apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship And the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character The reader never sees him all at once The table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the Apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke Richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two And the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person The artistic justification of Richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex He is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained decomposed and separately set forth Many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment There is Clara the housemaid who nursed the young dwarf in his youth and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet There is Mrs Chifney the trainers wife at the stables who also wept simple soulbecause she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel There is little Lady Constance Quayle She too wept when Richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations But the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are Katherine Calmady Helen de Vallorbes and Honoria St Quentin In these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin It is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable In all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts Moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  Lucas Malet is the pseudonym of Charles Kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman Perhaps of them all Katherine Calmady Richards mother is the finest Pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity of motion which in Richards eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room The second of the three women Helen de Vallorbes Richards evil genius if she is certainly not a pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than Katherine Calmady With the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism She is cruelshe was the child who laughed at Richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion To her the grotesquelydtformed Richard becomes a subtle attraction She begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust The character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green And the chief incident in her amorous relations with Richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration Beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters Richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow It is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous Cyrano de Bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior The minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome The melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman Julius March discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the Velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely Corellian in its obvious luridness The whole idea of this explanation of Richards deformity by legend is unworthy of Lucas Malet it should be left to the How Hells Xnvelette The unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking Nothing matters in fact except that Lucas Malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women And if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters,biography

The Jungle Book ti By Rudyard Kipling Misc millans Hitherto we have been accustomed to find inequality in Mr Kiplings work He has never yet given us a book entirely good each collection of his stories is a mixture of suooess and failure Naturally this peculiarity has always stirred some annoyance and perplexity in his critics for at his best he is not easily surpassed while at his worst he is almost puerile There is a popular superstition not without an element of truth in it that equality and mediocrity are interchangeable terms But though no author however gifted can always be at his best the inequalities of Mr Kiplings work offer too startling a contrast His frequent falls from the heights to the deeps his dazzling leaps from the mire to tne mountain top cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by any theory however respectable So we are unable to take up a new volume of his without knowing our hopes are dogged by a most uncomfortable fear Faith in his ultimate suooess is founded Tpon the fact that the more di cult his task seems tho greater tho certainty that he will be successful Consequently if he wishes to sustain his reputation he must refuse resolutely to write on subjects commonplace or indifferent The Jungle Book has been cordially welcomed and it is only just to confess at once that it is more carefully designed than anything he has yet given to us There are no serious blemishes in the style and grammar as a pieoe of technique it is quite blameless But a serious doubt arises as to whether the matter of the book is at all worthy of the labour bestowed on it Again it is certain that thoso flashes of genius that used to dazlo us seldom illumine its pages In them Mr Kiplings finest qualities are to seek We prefer to hear his men and women talk as only Mulvaney or Mrs Hawkesby can talk be Bagheora and Baloo never so ingenious It is impossible to rid oneself of the conviction that any author rather more clever than the average could have contrived tho greater part of Th Jungle Book There are indeed a few pages that no one but the creator of Soldiers Three could have written and one new friendship is cemented for whioh we are grateful Rikki Tikki though only a mongoose fights his way StUantly enough into the list of Mr iplings immortals The history of his war with the cobras is entirely delightful and refuses to be forgotten There are times when plain speaking is necessary and then the most ardent admirer of an author must if he be honest say the truth Tho truth is that The Jungle Book had it been written by a person unknown might have stirred a languid interest and a cor ta in reasonable hope of better things to come As the work of a man of recognised genius it compels disappointment It is generally true that to gain a worthy success a writer must toil hard must choose his words with discrimination But there is no rule without an exception and in this case Mr Kipling would seem to be that exception His best work achieves itself apparently spontaneously It is a startling nay dangerous thing to say of a man that he places failure far from him only when he is most careless But Mr Kipling may at any rate be advisedadapting a remark of Mr Henleys not to concern himself again with words and phrases but with the greater truths of destiny and emotion His last bcok prompts this reflection few authors know the human heart so well as he let him forsake thereforo Mowglis and mules and monkeys and remember that his vital phrases have ever been born not made Percy AddleshawTHE JUNGLE BOOK  The Jungle Book is made up of story and song both of them rich in vitality and imagination But every time a verse occurs as the heading of a chapter one is inclined to think that Mr Kipling should write nothing else so instinctive is his power over vigorous rhythm and so vivid are his ballad pictures This  NightSong in the Jungle  is only meant to tune you up to the pitch of the story that follows Now Chil the Kite

Kipling With illustrations by J L Kipling W H Drake and P Frenzemy 6s Macmillan former greatness Bagheera the wise panther says it may not be  Not for nothing are ye called the Free People Ye fought for freedom and it is yours Eat it O Wolves There is something sternly grand about all the Mowgli stories Imaginative children whether or not they follow the narrative with perfect comprehension will be impressed and even awestruck by the solemnity and dignity of jungle life as Mr Kipling paints it Of the habits of the animals of the scenes amidst which they live he has a marvellous knowledge It is this picturesqe knowledge joined to a vigorous interpretation of not their own character but the ideal nature he has constructed for them a nature at once remote and familiar to us that makes the success and the fascination of the stories Man without his intellectual power but with his natural faculties of sight and hearing infinitely intensified and without the enfeeblement the deceit the pettiness that are the fruits of his civilisation would be something like this conception of the beast that obeys the Jungle Law We are grotesquely reminded here and there of the ideals of Rousseau and the natural state idealists Their primitive man they would have desired to be like Mr Kiplings loyal beasts There are stories in the book where he is not at his highest point of vigour  The White Seal  comes near to being a failure and so does  Servants of the Queen The adventures of RikkiTikkiTavi the mongoose that fought with Nag the cobra and Nagaina his wife are too deadly to be amusing and the glamour of imagination does not play round them to turn the terror into fascination The temperature of ones admiration having been reduced by these we find several other things to wonder at not all admiringly Mr Kipling cannot resist opportunities of political allusion indeed invents them And his love for playing the schoolmaster grows on him It is this quality that is at the bottom of the imperfect sympathy which runs parallel in many readers minds with a warm admiration for him The pedagogue in him hides under free and vigorous and unconventional speech but he is mostly there Were he to fall asleep a bit oftener and let some careless lawless fellow take his place if even only for a few minutes Mr Kiplings range of understanding of human nature would be greatly widened But grumbling at Mr Kiplings temperament is not very relevant here It does not greatly offend in  The Jungle Book More to the purpose is it to point to the feats of imagination in these beast stories Next to the three Mowgli tales for great qualities comes  Toomai of the Elephants Toomai is a little boy who saw what few be lieved in and none had seen the great  dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the Garo hills He was on the back of the tame elephant Kala Nag that he tended and when Kala Nag got the signal for the dance the boy was borne away up the wooded hill through the thick underwood through the bed of a river to a space of three or four acres where the grass was trampled and hard The assembling elephants crashed through the trees and entered the danceplace and rolled their eyes and tossed their trunks and clicked their tusks and flicked their great tails  Then an elephant trumpeted and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs and a dull booming noise began not very loud at first and little Toornai could not tell what it was but it grew and grew and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other and brought them down on the ground onetwo onetwo as steadily as tripbammers The elephants weie stamping altogether now and it sounded like a wardrum beaten at the mouth of a cave The dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall and the booming went on and the ground rocked and shivered and Little Toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound But it was all one gigantic jar that ran through hinmthis stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth    The morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills and the booming stopped with the first ray as though the light had been an order It is a magnificent sight that Toomai saw that night when the favour of the elephantfolk and of the gods of the jungle was with him Mr Kipling has some splendid visions For all his love of discipline and order it is when his spirit gets away into the wilder paths of nature and human nature that he touches real greatness

The Later Years of Catherine de Medici REVIEWS CATHERINE DE MEDICI By Edith Sichel Archibald Constable and Co This is an eminently readable if not a very valuable book Miss Sichel frankly admits in her preface that she has made no discovery of an actual fact and has detected no error in accepted dates She has sought to paint the portrait of Catherine de Medici as she sees her with such other persons in the drama as were interwoven with her destiny She says  Here in Paris near the Louvre beneath the window whence Catherine gave her fatal signal on the eve of St Bartholomew     or near that other window which looked out upon the fastcrimsoning Seine  it is easier to feel the full force of the old conceptions which divide us from the past In fact Miss Sichels book is an effort at evocation of a somewhat impressionist kind in which the temperament of the artist and the milieu in which she works play influential parts But surely it has now been decided for some time past by competent historical authorities that the window of the Louvre overlooking the Seine which tradition has associated with the early phases of the St Bartholomew massacre considerably postdates that tragic event For the sake of a picture however the most vivid details are sure to be selected and not those only the authenticity of which is beyond a doubt and this makes the kind of portraiture which Miss Sichel practises of small worth to the student and even misleading in certain cases But the method has a value of its own It supplies the general reader with broad general ideas about important phases and interesting personages of past history It gives him more than does the historical novel and probably informs his mind more effectively than an accurate historical study could do to the appreciation of which qualities of mind which are not exactly common and a certain intellectual training are indispensable There is a danger however that the colouring of the picture may be overdone that the perspective may be false It is rare for a woman who writes around history to write without prejudice Men historians often enough fall into the same fault under the influence of political and religious bias But with women it seems impossible to avoid it Women are born into the world to love and love always entails hate Miss Sichel is not far from hating Catherine de Medici and the age of the Renaissance in which she lived She writes  The Ligue was the counterpart of Catherine We have compared it to the great French Revolution but there is this vital difference between the two The Revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an Idea it was the beginning of an eraThe death of Catherine closed an epoch with her died the age of the Renaissance And with the reign of Henry IV there came the dawn of modern timesIt was the destiny of Catherine de Medici to imbibe the poison of either influence that of the Reformation and that of the Renaissance From the Reformation she derived its abusesits degradation of religion into politics its gross polemic materialism the more pernicious for priestly vestments From the Renaissance she inhaled its stagnant Paganism its cold curiosity its stupid blindness to aught but the senses its foolish worship of a golden calf set up in a boundless wilderness Such were the miasmic fumes that she absorbed and breathed forth again to blight the world she lived in There are deadlier poisons than those that lurk in perfumed gloves there is a deadlier death than that which these deal to men It is the death of the ideal of faith in man of faith in anything outside him These were the real murders of the women accused of scores of others History provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists but sometimes unconsciously it reveals to us certain moral laws It is a medium for them not a pulpit If any person any age is doomed for its sins to forfeit the meed of immortality that age is the reign of the last Valoisthat person is Catherine de Medici Most if not all of this is fustianlittle better indeed than sheer nonsense In the first place it is highly dangerous for any writer of history to talk so glibly of eras epochs ages and modern times Strictly speaking there is no such thing as an era an epoch an age or modern times With every minute that goes by the Middle Ages for instance are getting further and further away from the middle assumingwhich is of course not the case that there can possibly be a middle to that which has no known beginning or knowable end To tell us that the Revolution was the conflagration at the birth of an Idea is to tell us nothing that has any precise meaning and if Miss Sichel imagines that any new ideas were given birth to by the fact of the French Revolution she is assuredly mistaken If anything deserves to be called stagnant it was the pseudoclassical conception of freedom which predominated in the minds of the leaders of that inhuman movementa pseudoclassicism which by the way achieved among other things the complete destruction of the art of painting in Franceat any rate for the presenta curious result which is worthy of more attention from historians than it has received especially as it is highly typical The gross polemic materialism of the Reformation the more pernicious for priestly vestments is unfair to a highly complex movement one of the strongest motives of which lay in the fact that the invention of printing had weakened the raison detre of the older ecclesiastical symbolism To accuse the Renaissance of stupid blindness to aught but the senses is far too sweeping a charge and indeed a stupid one Whatever its faults and deficiencies may have been the Christian world owes to the Renaissance an immense debt To say that Catherine de Medici murdered the ideal and the faith in man which he has never been without as far as what we know of his history enables us to judge is to give that good lady who had her commendable points an importance which she never possessed and surely neither she nor her age will be bereft  of the meed of immortality with Miss Edith Sichel on the spot precisely to ward off this tragic and quite undeserved contingency History she says provides no theological text for the sermons of conscious moralists But she contradicts this when she writes a few lines higher up on the same page which is her last Yet although for long men did not know it they were aremaking towards a common goal and using a common watchword That watchword that goal is freedom Making f or  moving  is a slang expression but is not this just the theological text which history does supply to the conscious moralist  Of what use is the historian any way if he is not to be a conscious moralist with history or as much as he can find out about it as his text which is a theological text into the bargain  For the moral to which it constantly points is the divine triumph in the long run of Good over Evil and in that conclusion we are entirely we think in accord with Miss Edith Sichel,biography

The Legend of Jubal and other Poems SATURDAY MAY 16 7874 LITERATURE GEORGE ELIOT S POEMS By George Eliot Blackwood  Sons There are certain developments of the genius of George Eliot for which verse is the only satisfactory medium Artistic longings and fancies such as abound in Romola and  Middlemarch can scarcely find adequate expression in prose In the march of verse and in the effect of recurrent sounds there is something which aids as much the writer in the development of his thought as the reader in its appreciation or retention Not seldom the continued labour of the author imparts to his work a grace and a significance beyond his expectation that come upon him almost as a surprise and a revelation Where no such result is obtained there is a pleasure in the task of polishing to the utmost poetic utterances which combines the glad service of the worshipper with the mothers delight in attendance upon her offspring Since the success of the Spanish Gypsy bas shown that verse in the hands of George Eliot is a serviceable and manageable instrument there is little cause to wonder it is again adopted The poems in the volume now published deal with that aspiration which takes in different natures the form of music devotion love For such themes poetry is the fittest medium In welcoming George Eliot once more as a poet however and in expressing sympathy and admiration for her present production we are far from implying that we should like to see a large portion of her effort directed to verse Her case is analogous to that of Scott No one will now contest the value of Scotts ballad romances While however in his own days Scott had in poetry rivals and superiors in prose fiction his supremacy was unchallenged In like manner the appearance of a poem from George Eliot is a matter of interest while that of a novel is an affair of highest literary importance The four principal poems in the volume have already appeared in print in various magazines English and American All have a measure of resemblance in the lesson they enforce In The Legend of Jubal and in Armgart aspiration developes itself through music in Agatha it finds its utterance in a life of devotion and in  How Lisa loved the King it blossoms into love After his departure from the presence of his offended God Cain built a city in which his offspring dwelt unaware of the curse of death that was upon them Idly they laboured as a maid who weaves Her hair ia mimic mats and pauses oft Aud strokes across her hand her tresses soft Then peeps to watch the poised butterfly Or little burthened ants that homeward hie Time was but leisure to their lingering thought There was no need for haste to finish aught Accident first revealed the presence in their midst of the grim spectre of death and a change came over the scene Each man feeling the insecurity of his tenure now that Death was Lord of Life strove to snatch te passing hour And Work grew eager and Device was born Chief workers among those stung into activity were the sons of Lamech in whose family death had made first inroad Jabal the eldest son learned to tame the lowing kine to nurse the starbrowed calves and soothe the silly sheep Tubal yoked the fire And made it roar in prisoned servitude Within the furnace till with force subdued It changed all forms he willed to work upon Meanwhile listening to the clanging symphonies of the beaten and resonant metal Jubal heard some melody Wherein dumb longings inward speech bad found Long he brooded over the sweet and mingled sounds The fluctuant changes of the spoken word  The mothers call the childrens answering cry The laughs light cataract tumbling from on high The suasive repetitions Jabal taught That timid browsing cattle homeward brought The clearwinged fugue of echoes vanishing And through them all the hammers rhythmic ring The result of his meditations was the birth of the lyre Alone among the hills he practised until his hand obtained a mastery over the chords At length one holidaytide he ventured to prove before his companions his new gift Absorbed at first in this unexpected response to the  strange thirst within them  the fateful growth the unnamed discontent the listeners sat in silence until the twin sister of music sprang into being The youths and maidens both alike longtressed By graceinspiring melody possessed Rose in slow dance with beauteous floating swerve Of limbs and hair and many a melting curve Of ringed feet swayed by each closelinked palm  Then Jubal poured more rapture in his psalm The dance fired music music fired the dance The glow diffusive lit each countenance Till all the circling tribe arose and stood With glad yet awful Bhock of that mysterious good Subsequently Jubal having taught to others his newfound art travelled to where Eastward the hills touch heaven and remained away until most of those who had known him were dead He returned to find cities where he had left pastoral valleys Memory of the benefits he had bestowed survived however and the people on the day even of his return were holding a feast in his honour When the weary greyhaired wanderer claimed to be the Jubal whom they worshipped the minstrels rose and beat him with their flutes for irreverence and he who had given mankind its most priceless boon sought the  screen of thorny thickets where alone and untended he died cheered only by visions of Song The close of this striking amplification of the suggestion thrown out in Genesis resembles closely the notion German in origin we believe upon which Mr Wills founded his  Man of Airlie Agatha depicts the grave placid and beneficent existence of a woman halfgrandame and half saint repaying by prayers the assistance she obtains from the villagers among whom she dwells Prayer to her is a  way of singing Just as the nightingales pour forth sad songs Not too sure is Agatha that her intercessions are of much avail Nay I cannot sing  My voice is hoarse and oft I think my prayers Are foolish feeble things  for Christ is good Whether I pray or notthe Virgins heart Is kinder far than mine  and then I stop And feel I can do nought towards helping men Her simple life sanctified wholly to the service of her faith and her warm and gentle creed that  would have young things merry are touchingly depicted Armgart is a dramatic sketch showing the dominion of the artistic passion over the breast of the singer who can hold thousands spellbound by her song aud the defeat and collapse which follow when after a brief period of triumph the voice gives way and the priceless instrument is worthless Just as devotion in Agatha and the sound of the lyre in  Jubal suffice for all expression of emotion the voice of Armgart is adequate to all utterance  Poor wretch she says of any murderess  The world was cruel and she could not sing I carry my revenges in my throat I love in singing and am loved again The fretfulnesses vanities and anxieties of the artistic temperament have seldom been depicted more forcibly than in this poem They are subjugated however by the absolute  possession which Armgarts art exercises over her nature Her reasons for rejecting the suit of Graf Dornberg are well given and the study of artistic fervour and feminine wilfulness is fine as it can be Armgarts address to the doctor whose drugs while curing her illness of throat have ruined her voice is thoroughly impassioned Yes thick thick thick  and you have murdered it t Murdered my voicepoisond the soul in me And kept me living You never told me that your cruel cures Were clogging filmsa mouldy deadning blight A lavamud to crust and bury rae Yet hold me living in a deep deep tomb Crying unheard for ever O your cures Are devils triumphs  you can rob maim slay And keep a hell on the other side your cure Where you can see your victim quivering Between the teeth of torture c The lesson of patience Armgart learns at length from the resignation of her musicmaster an old composer whose philosophical calm stands in effective contrast with the tumultuous effervescence of youth  How Lisa loved the King catches happily the spirit and something of the note of Provencal song It transports the reader to a court like that of King Rene and to a world to which the Golden Age is restored where Arcadian dreams are realized and where all pleasures are permissible since all desire is virtuous What song is to Armgart music to Jubal and devotion to Agatha love is to Lisa and the manner in which utterance is given to her aspiration is very fanciful and delicate Of the new poems in the book  A Minor Prophet is our favourite Here George Eliot is on her own territory of humour Nothing can be cleverer than the opening description nothing deeper more subtle more sympathetic and more significant than the application The poem commences I have a friend a vegetarian Beer By name Elias Baptist Butterworth A harmless bland disinterested man Whose ancestors in Cromwells day believed The Second Advent certain in five years But when King Charles the Second came instead Revised their date and sought another world I meannot heaven butAmerica A fervid stock whose generous hope embraced Tbe fortunes of mankind not stopping short At rise of leather or the fall of gold Nor listening to the voices of the time As housewives listen to a cackling hen With wonder whether she has laid her egg On their own nestegg Still they did insist Somewhat too wearisomely on tho joys Of their Millennium when coats and hats Would all be of one pattern books and songs AH flt for Sundays and the casual talk As good as sermons preached extempore Equally admirable is the description of Elias in whom ancestral zeal is modified by  Transatlantic air and modern thought with hair Brushed back to show his great capacity A full grains length at the anglo of the brow Proving him witty while the shallower men Only seem witty in their repartees Not that hes vain but that his doctrine needs The testimony of his frontal lobe The Millennium of Elias will be reached when men are all vegetarian and practical Science and civilization will bring about the day when  dogs will all be moral and all  the uglier breeds will fade from memory when Wartpigs with tender and parental grunts Wombats much flattened as to their contour Perhaps from too much crushing in the ark But taking meekly that fatality  The serious cranes unstung by ridicule  Longheaded shortlegged solemnlooking curs Wise silent critics of a flippant age The silly straddling foals the weakbrained geese Hissing fallaciously at sound of wheels All these rude products will have disappeared Along with every faulty human type By dint of diet vegetarian All will be harmony of hue and line Bodies and minds all perfect limbs wellturned And talk quite free from aught erroneous Sadly our author thinks of the consequences of such a state of affairs Endowed with that sympathy and pity for error and that respect for failure which are the rarest most unmistakable and least regarded attributes of the highest genius she falls into a strain of regret for those who living in those perfect times Will not know half the dear imperfect things That move my smiles and tearswill never know The fine old incongruities that raise My friendly laugh the innocent conceits That like a needless eyeglass or black patch Give those who wear them harmless happiness The twists and cracks in our poor earthenware That touch me to more couscious fellowship I am not myself the finest Parian With my coevals A noble moral indicated iu the line Our finest hope is finest memory comes as the close of a poem which by its gentle teaching its fine sympathy and its sad irony moves one highest admiration  Brother and Sister is a tender poem with some delightful descriptions of rustic scenery forming an appropriate frame for poetical thought  Stradivarius shows the nobility of art in its mechanical portions even Tis God gives skill But not without mens hands He could not make Antonio Stradivaris violins Without Antonio So speaks Stradivarius himself Two Lovers is in motive a little like the Laureates poem of Circumstance Ariongives finely the legend told by Herodotus The volume in all poetic respects is an advance upon the  Spanish Gypsy In those qualities which without being indispensable to poetry supplement and elevate it in largeheartednesSjtenderness and humour it is worthy of the author of  The Mill on the Floss It cannot fail to advance its authors reputation bringing her nearer our sympathies as well as placing her higher in our admirationLITERATURE The legend of Jbal and other Poemis By I GeorgeEliot London Blackwood Sons IT is always instructive when a great painter turns sculptor or a great musician turns dramatist or a great poet turns novelist or as in the present case a great novelist turns poet there is always something fresh to be learnt about the powers and the im pulses of the artist which have to find a fresh channel for themselves there is always something to be learnt also about the limits of the old channels which no longer seem enough This is so especially in the case of such a personal spontaneous genius as George Eliot all whose writings are necessary to the complete expression of herself with whom we are entirely safe from mere echoes of other writers which express nothing except an overambitious sympathy Even shortcomings have their meaning and their interest when they are visibly due not to any defect of training or elaboration but to the habitual predominance of other faculties than those which are most helpful to the work in hand A great thinker cannot wait while fancy and emotion grow up into thought the thought must always be there and sometimes the fancy and emotion grow over the thought luxuriantly and sometimes though the overgrowth is always healthy the thought shows through In the Spanish Gypsy there was a constant incongruity the whole conception was poetical and verse was obviously the only appropriate vehicle for the most dramatic movements of the story but there were long intervals where the action flagged or was positively pushed aside by commentaries and dikcassions or was overlaid by ornament and it was hardly a compensation that the commentaries were an overflow of intellec tual sympathy with the situation and that the ornaments showed how much diligent and refined observation had fed the writers imagination of the scenery The present volume is on a smaller scale than the Spanish Gypsy or most of the authors works in prose and it contains at least one poem the eleven sonnets entitled  Brother and Sister which is all but perfectmore delightful if possible more classical than the parallel passages in the Mill o0 tVw Floss In the novel there is no doubt more human more concrete individual reality but in the poem we gain what is even more precious an unbroken ideal medium in which what is harsh and grotesqcue is wholly suppressed in order that what is permanent and beautiful and memorable may appear unalloyed Nearly every sonnet contains gems like theseI held him wise and when lie talked to me Of snakes and birds and which God loved the best I thought his knowldgo marked the boundary Where men grew iixad though angels knew the rest  all at home were told the wondrous feat And how the little sister had fished well In secret though my fortune tasted sweet I wondered why this happiness befell  The little lass had luck the gardener said And so I learned luck was with glory wed His years with others must the sweeter be For those brief days he spent in loving me If the  Brother and Sister  show the superiority of verse over prose for presenting a subject sub specie aeternitatis  Armgart  shows the superiority of the same instrument for expressing the fulness of passion which the growing reticence of modern civilisation tends to repress till it is probable that it will ultimately be extinguished like a fire deprived of air Bear witness I am ealm I road my lot As soberly as if it were a tale Writ by a creeping feuilletonist and called  The Womans Lot a Tale of Everyday A middling womans to impress the world With high superfluousness her thoughts a crop Of chickweed errors or of potherb facts Smiled at like some childs drawing on a slate  Genteel 0 yes gives lessons not so good As any mans would be but cheaper far  Pretty  No yet she makes a flgure fit For good society Poor thing she sews Both late and early turns and alters all To suit the changing mode Some wilower Mlight do well marrying her but in these days  Well she can somewhat eke her narrow gains By writing just to furnish her with gloves And droschlkies in the rain They print her things Often for charityO a dogs life A harnessed dogs that draws a little cart Voted a nuisance  It is impossible to write with more severity and compression of style and yet the effusion of feeling would have been excessive in prose Again the verse certainly adds lightness and elevation to the bitter gaiety of Leos answer when asked whether he expects his music to live when he is deadPfui the time was I drank that homebrewed wine And found it heady while my blood was young Now it scarce warms me Tipple it as I may I am sober still and say  My old friend Leo Much grain is wasted in the world and rots Why not thy handful  On the other hand the description of Armgarts reception by the house rather convinces us of the insufficiency of prose than of the sufficiency of verse and there are passages like the invention of butter in  Jubal where what would have been easy and familiar in prose becomes strange without becoming beautiful inverse and in A Minor Prophet  there is a puzzling allusion to  astral cocoanuts which exemplifies a rather common fault of subtle and reflective poetry The writer sees that many things must always be left to the reader to comprehend at half a word and it is only in popular poetry that a traditional understanding exists to determine which Of course the only reason for speaking of such things is that they intrude themselves on the attention less when they have been noticed and explained It is a pleasanter and more profitable study to compare How Lisa loved the Kino with its original in Boccaccio and see how the modern writer has enlarged and deepened the meaning of the story without impairing its essential simplicity Boccaccio keeps throughout to the tone of mere kindly courtesy with which wellbred people tell a graceful interesting story He does not dwell for a moment on the historical position of King Pedro though the story is a Ghibelline reply to a story of the temperance of King Charles whom Pedro dispossessed nor on the growth of Lisas passion nor upon the spirit in which she accepted her happiness What might have been seen and heard is enough for him and out of this he makes one of the best of his prose idylls and in all that he says with one exception George Eliot follows him closely The justification of and the originality of her poem is the wealth of brooding feeling which is poured into the space which Boc caccio has left blank Tue central point both of the story and of the poem may bo said to lie in the song which tells Pedro the talc of Lisas hopeless love Boccaccio is deliciously sweet and musical and genuine but he does not get beyond the shy broken sob of animal feeling and innocent helpless pain the singer feels the pathos of this side of the situation too much to care to in tellectualise it the approaching death of the lovelorn maiden simply measures the ardour of her hopeless passion whereas in George Eliot the worship of Death be comes the keynote of four lovely stan zas of which the last is the clirqaxTell him 0 Love I am a lowly maid mo nore than any little knot of thyme That lho with careless foot may ofteu tread Yet lowliest fragrance oft will mount sublime And cleave to things most high and hallowZ1 As doth the fragrance of my lifes springtime My lowly love that soaring seeks to climb Within his thought and makei a gentle bliss More blissful than if mine in being his So shlall I live in him and rest in Death The glorification of Death is of course tho burden of  Jubal  it reads throughout almost like an answer to the early numbers of the E arthly Paradise and the impression is all the stronger because the music of tho answer is so often like an echo of the music of the challenge In both the dis cussion is carried on as it ought to be rather in accordance with the logic of feeling than the logic of signs Mr Morriss contention is that it is precisely when life is at its best that the thought of death poison it George Eliot maintains with Feuerbachs that it is death at a distance which gives life all its value and death at hand which puts the seal upon life When Jubal returns in old age and finds his memory worshippedAll was forgotten but the burning need To claim his fuller self to clhihn the deed That lived away from him and grew apart While he as from a tomb with lonely heart Warmed by no meeting gla nee no hand that presse Lay chill amid the life his life had blessed What though his song should spread from mans small race Out through the myriad worlds that people space And make the heavens one joydiffusing quire  Still mid that vast would throb the keen desire Of this poor aged flesh this eventide This twilight soon in darkness to subside This little pulse of self that having glowed Through thrice three centuries and divinely Strowed The light of music through the vague of sound Ached smallness still in good that had no bound After his rejection the solution isYea art thou come again to me Oreat Song The face bent over him like silver night In longremembered summers that calm light Of days which shine in firmament of thouhit That past unchangeablo from change Ftill wrought And there were tones that with tho vision blent He know not if that gaze the music sent Or music that calm gaze to hear to see Was but one undivided ecstasy The raptured senses melted into one And parting life a moments freedom won From in and outer as a little child Sits on a bank and sees blue heavens mild Down in the water and forgets its limibs And knoweth nought savo the blue heaven that swims Jubal the face mid  I am thy loved Past The soul that makes thee one from first to last I am the Angel of thy life and death Thy outbreathod being drawing its last breath Am I not thine alone a dear dead bride Who blest thy lot above all mens beside  Thy bride whom thou wouldst never chang nor take Any bride living for that dead oes sakeo Of course if any one were foolish enough to attempt to translate this into the logic of signs he would expose himself to the obvious observation that it is no more in our power to possess ourselves of our whole past than o the whole future of our work and that therefore it is idle to teach that we ought to be content to have our past for ourselves and give up our work to the world seriously if we are to expect either for ourselves we have an equal right to expect both from the liberality of a Power able to do aIundantly above all that we can ask or think The fact is that there are problems presented by the permanent facts of the world which can only receive an objective solution if at all from paramount facts which show that the best which we can apprehend in the little that we know is supreme in the much which we do not know in this life but whatever objective solution we adopt or whether we despair of any we need a subjective solution for the subjective pro blem presented by the alternations of our own moods Such a solution has never been given more worthily than in Jubal and in the glorious lines beginning 0 may I join the choir invisible which form the Epilogue of the volume and make the posi tivist heaven for the first time intelligible and desirable because for the first time the conception has been lifted above the level of controversy from which it suffers even more than the majority of religious conceptions since there are few which are so open to be taunted with unanswerable questions Indeed the whole volume is a splendid homage to the great principle of the inherent supremacy of feeling over thought which it is one of Comtes chief merits to have formulated though be shrank from its legitimate consequences which is not surprising when we remember whence he took it And this gives an artistic value and completeness to the poetry of George Eliot which is missing in some measure in her prose works Though the latter are richer and more varied and more masterly the writer seems constantly trying to escape into the atmosphere of high impulse and momentary feeling in which the poems move habitually The love of Lisa is an exquisite satisfaction to the perilous and invincible desire With dream fruit dream wishes to fulfil Throughout  Armgart her singleminded impetuosity is contrasted with the essential unexceptionable baseness of the Count so as to show how ruinous it is simply to be consistently reasonable in matters of conduct  And by what is what will be to define Aringarts impulsiveness is il fact the key to the whole poem she aggravates her loss by her eagerness to measure it and the particular form of her resignation is very much a matter of accident it would have been easy to find practical and ideal reasons if they were the thing required to show that her talent as an actress was too good to be wasted and that it would be foolish to destroy the chance of her voice recovering itself by teaching It would have been equally easy to prove that her tardy sym pathy for Walpurga and Leo it is an ad mirable trait that Walpurga accuses her while she accuses herself to Leo wvas a motive for generalisinc her revolt not for subsiding into submission but the poet resists the temltation to a systematic intel lectual pessimism as she resists the temptation to a systematic intellectual opti mism which would have made the moral change in Armgart a compensation for the loss of her voice The only approach to a glorification of right reason is the very interesting poem on Stradivarius who defends his simple straightforward perfect work triumphantly against a painter Naldo Knowing all tricks of style at thirtyone And weary of them  who tells Stradivariuss Thou nrt little more Than a deft potters wheel Antonio Turning out work by more necessity And lack of varied function Higher arts Subsist on freedomeccentricityUncounted inspirations influenco That conies with drinking gambling talk turned wild Then moody misery and lack of foodWith every dithyrumbic fine excess Only when we remember that Southey worked and prepared himself for work on the principle of Stradivarius and that Hoff mann and Byron prepared themselves for work on the principles of Naldo and compare the value of their work we see how hard it is to draw universal inferences from the best selected facts No one would be less disconcerted by this difficulty than the author who combines the most resolute and exalted hope with a keen perception of the ridiculous nature of all Utopias which are a premature attempt to anticipate in detail the realisation of aspirations which it is well to cherish Not even the conclave at the Rainbow shows a sharper sense of humour than the Minor Prophet an American vegetarian and spiritualist who holdsThat Thought was rapping in the hoary past And might have edified the Greeks by raps At the greater Dionysia if their ears Had not been filled with Sophoclean verse And when all Earth is VegetarianWhen lacking butchers quadrupeds die out And less Thoughtatmosphere is reabsorbed By nerves of insects parasitical Those higher truths seized now by higher minds But not expressed the insects hindering Will either flash out into eloquence Or better still be comprehensible By rappings simply  Two Lovers  is a very touching picture of the stages of a lifelong affection only the ejaculatory lines at the end of each stanza hardly communicate the depth of feeling out of which they come  Arion  is an almost successful attempt to show that half of a legend which a scientific age can accept may be made more than the whole Here are the two last stanzasThe last long vowels trembled then As awe within those wolfish men They said with mutual stare Some god was present there But lo Arion leaped on high Ready his descant done to die Not asking

The Life and Works of Charlotte Bronte and I her Sitters With Introductions to the  Works by Mrs Humphry Ward 6 vols Smith Elder  Co Fint Notice The true criticism of the work of the sisters Bronte ought to present to our imaginations on a general view an aspect at once large and simple It ought to be no more complex than the sight from any vantage point of the famous moors above Haworth parsonage or we might add the picture which memory would bear away even after many hours wanderings in those almost classic haunts The journeyings would reveal of course many grim or appealing details unapparent in the general prospect but imagination after we had come south or gone north would but see a great picture synthetic and simple and would have wrought its own sense of the colour and  spirit of the heathlands The deeper essence of the place would still be a secret of nature that knows the meaning of matter and spirit and all their manifestations in the universe So the general features in thoroughgoing Bronte criticism will be sheer simple outstanding the details deftly set in subsidiary proportion For Charlotte and Emily Bronte were strange and intense souls and in their books it is the soul  fact that matters True there are a hundred less inspired things let them be quietly touched and passed The great poetic passionate creative stages are elemental and bold easily seen by those that can see and having duly marked them and told their quality criticism has done its broad work It cannot sound their mystery wring out the secret of their inspiration any more than the traveller on the heath can penetrate to the secret below the colour and the lonely beauty of nature Mrs Humphry Ward is sometimes thoughtful in her Bronte studies but she also dwells unduly on none too relevant details We could wish on the other hand that she had boldly considered a vital matter that must be settled before the absolute worth of the sisters work in literature or the evolution of literature is satisfactorily determined In her introduction to Jane Eyre she writes with pardonable gratification of the unquestioned spell exercised today by Charlotte Brontes novels on the imagination of England But this suggests the important and here unconsidered question whether the reading world on the whole realizes what great fiction ought to be whether its general ideal is such that its enthusiasm in the case of Miss Bronte can be said to be a really critical tribute It is to be feared as a matter of fact that England and the Continent have paid more attention to the body than to the spirit in fiction and despite Mrs Wards high opinion of latterday developments of the novel it is by no means yet certain that it can become a supreme medium of literature A worthy instrument it has been in some instances a noble one We have even seen achievements that have suggested the supreme the novelist in such rare cases showing great soul in action giving embodiment to as we might say spiritual romance indicating in characters and destinies something of the Soul above souls vision of the Power that  ever accompanies the march of man The general desire however is that he should walk  rationally  upon earth and paint the body and circumstance of his age or another Much too muchis expected of him as a delineator of daily manners till often he becomes but the photographer of individuals the Autolycus of data that have no more than a transient importance It might almost seem that the great novelist must be a master of two artsthat of revealing spiritual forces permanent passions like a great poet or dramatist and that of imparting imaginative significance to more ordinary actualities The two powersthe interaction of the two worldsmake the true novel To be thus a seer and a convincing delineator of actuality so far as actuality is essential  a keen problem  necessitates vision intuition opportunity aud experience on such a scale that we must needs be modest in our expectations on the score of permanent fiction The vision and the intuition are of the greater importance on their possession and cultivation depends the fact whether fiction can be absolute literature rather than excellent description or analysis or the work as it were of a syndicate of reporters in the service of a 4 time spirit which may not be by any means a true daughter of the eternal If the vision of the sisters Bronte sometimes failed them it was uncommon at its best And even as regards their experience or their knowledge of life Mrs Ward like many critics seems to entertain a too narrow idea The sources of knowledge are subtle as well as obvious Knowing the Celtic inheritance of the sisters of which more anon their contact with a world of great Northern tradition the keen ordeals to which their sensitive spirits were subjected at home and abroad which stirred unimagined forces in their natures and made them critics of life in a higher sense than perhaps is commonly realizedunderstanding all this and more and remembering the subtle ways in which nature and life speak to the chosen mind we may well be chary of complaint as to lack of knowledge in their case It is the soul that matters not the number of miles travelled the number of cities seen in the actual world Charlotte Bronte has told as she was eminently fitted to tell the ordeals of souls that live alone in more senses than onethe never finished tragedies of deep natures in plain frames Her unhappy governesses and teachers are more than governesses and teachers they are types old and new as the passion for sympathy the lack of consideration in any womans sphere And crises and partings journeys and reunions in her pages sometimes seem to tell of people in more mysterious lands and on more mysterious seas than ours They speak of souls rather than bodies Faults and crudities of construction in Jane Eyre and its successorsmatters with which Mrs Ward deals at length  are sufficiently obvious Had Charlotte Bronte been careful enough or courageous enough to free herself boldly from old theories of plotmaking and other prepossessions her story of the struggle of duty against affinity would have led to truer ordering perhaps almost to real fusion of material But some of her critics strictures on details are scarcely tenable We may not always regard Mr Rochester so gravely as his creatorhe does not justify himself to the imagination in the way of Paul Emmanuel but his early talk with Jane Eyre is scarcely the delectable food for comedy which Mrs Ward imagines The judgment on the countryhouse party also is much too sweeping Without taking sides on the interesting question of governess versus provincial society one may gently urge that a governess of genius in her merciless way would be likely to detect and record an ugly side of thing possessing more or less glamour for the polite It is not really a case of an ignorant governess passing judgment on  high life  it is injured and incisive genius casting critical eyes on humanity socially more favoured but spiritually inferior Convention may seek to put her out of court with scorn but the spirit of critical judgment especially after some of Miss Brontes own stories recorded by Mrs Gaskell will not be convinced that there may not be a great deal to be urged on the other side It were better no doubt to invoke the comic spirit in the treatment of puch issues but Haworth was not meet alas for her airy presence Certainly Charlotte Bronte had not always the happiness of overcoming ordinary prejudices in the gleam of larger vision nor had she the unfailing power of shaping ordinary material to artistic ends as we see in the often delightful and sometimes poetical  Shirley The novelist as we have suggested is on occasions hard set to be an artistic interpreter of permanent passion and minute and mobile actuality But it is possible to slip on points of detail to fail now and then in kindling imaginative life in ordinary material and yet to be true again and again in the high hours to what the imagination recognizes as aoulfact Because Charlotte Bronte so vividly interpreted soulfact not occasionally but often we know that however fallible at other times she was an eminent novelist Mrs Ward maintains the interesting but of course by no means novel theory that the genius of Charlotte Bronte was fundamentally Celtic The racial spirit or rather the deep human one as affected in the light and shadow the momentum the environment of a race of changeful fortunes no doubt lives long and works subtly in unconsidered regions and is an attractive if rather tentative study though put to strange uses by extremists too bent on dividing humanity into compartments But leaving temperaments and workaday selves and looking into the souls that live deeply the souls that create permanent literature we feel that they are of no race they know not geographical boundaries As to Charlotte Bronte and Ireland she seemed unable to create aa Irish character  the curate Malone ia  Shirley and the drunken Mrs Sweeny ia  Villette are beneath notice in this regari but it is obviously true that certain qualities well marked in Celtic nature and personality are apparent in her work It is te be feared however that Mrs Ward has tee conventional an idea of Celtic characteristics Her remarks are a little too suggestive of Matthew Arnolds lectures on the 4 Study ot Celtic Literaturelectures fruitful in their day and still useful but not founded on a comprehensive acquaintance with even translated Gaelic literature and Irish or general Celtic personality  Celtic melancholy is but a halftruth Joyousness is the dominant quality of much Gaelic literaturejoyousness and n fierce zest of life The theory of tho Celts love of loneliness seems strange when we know that the idea of contention being  better than loneliness passed iuto a proverb with one order of Celts For the theory of  Celtic shrinking from all active competitive existence it would be difficult to find any generai justification ancient or modern Nor ds Mrs Ward convincing when she tries te explain Bronte Celticism as a growth of the Ireland of the North on which commerce and Protestantism have set their grasp This although perhaps a popular notion is but another halftruth the Catholic and Celtic traditions and elements of Ulster are in their way outstanding In any case did not the Rev Patrick Bronte come of a south of Ireland family Mrs Wards consideration of the Celtic basis of the Bronte genius might have been much more interesting had she understood the manysidedness of the real Celticism and that the Bronte sisters practicality and order were no more alien to it on the whole than their share of the vision that remakes the world Were Gaelic literature accessible as a whole it would clear away many misconceptions caused by taking it in snatches that concern widely severed years and varying circumstances and give a disconnected and somewhat shadowy idea of the race or races Its modern successor AngloIrish literature does not really display a true grip of later Irish realities and political controversy has unfortunately obscured certain verities The Celt has dreamed dreams idealized his moors and hills seen visions of hells and heavens that show a Dantesque feeling without of course a Dantesque art he has realized the tears of things and known at stages the melancholy that for sensitive souls accompanies the fateful trends of life But he framed the elaborate Brehon laws and a still more elaborate bardic system pursued philosophic and scholastic ideals with a strange passion and in modern days in more lands than one he has proved his genius as an empirebuilder Far from being an elusive creature half within half without existence he has shown at his highest a remarkable grip of both worlds Mrs Ward did be really know the various aspects of Celticism might have profitably considered that phase of it which would appear to have lived a tenacious if halfinscrutable life in Emily Bronte rather than Charlotte Yet the critic conscious of the highest reaches of English genius would claim much of hers as peculiar to his own race There is truth on both sides How much of the spiritual the poetic the divine even lies below either racial consciousness seldom coming into being or concrete embodiment  This deeper human subconsciousness so to say carno 10 consciousness in the Bronte sisters on their great moors in their Yorkshire world of distinctive tradition in the crises of their struggling years It mixed with moods and found outlet in forms in which Celt and Touton and all men find much of their more passionate selves So when all is said the origins are of natures underlying store the result speaks for and to humanityThe Life and Works of Charlotte Bronte and her Sisters With Introductions to the Works by Mrs Humphry Ward 6 vols Smith Elder  Co Second Notice Mus Ward inlier introduction to Wuthering Heights propounds a theory of an appreciable German influence a somewhat liberal infusion of Hoffmann and even Tieck in Emily Brontes work It mu6t be said at once that Mrs Ward unfortunately does not seem to realize the spirit and the stages of the  German romantic movement Some of her views suggest the wild and peculiar conceptions of this German literature against which Carlyle protested in a critical essay comparatively early in the century  Tieck and Hoffmann says Mrs Ward  are full of raving and lunatic beings who sob shout tear out their hair by the roots and live in a perpetual state of personal violence both towards themselves and their neighbours This to speak mildly is not fair criticism even of Hoffmann but how must it be regarded by the student who has a comprehensive knowledge of Tieck The whole trend of Mrs Wards critique is unjust to the German  Romantics  at their best to their beauty there is only a casual allusion there is no suggestion of those qualities both grave and humorous in which they are seen to differ decisivelyeven to the merely casual eye from the author of Wuthering Heights It would appear that Mrs Wards imagination has dwelt overmuch upon the earlier Tieck and on the other hand it is more than doubtful that a mind like Emily Brontes could ever have been so much impressed as she thinks by the horrors of Hoffmann or indeed of his English contemporaries of the school that would  make Parnassus a churchyard In fact critics are too apt to exaggerate the  haunting effect of the bowl and dagger bookmen on the early century we may be sure there was an esoteric English self unimpressed by their terrors Monk Lewis it is suggestive to remember had no appreciable effect upon the House of Commons And the Haworth sisters let it never be forgotten had a critical as well as a creative faculty Mrs Wards theory however will be interesting to the curious who seek for the source and development of genius as distinguished from casual shades and external dyessome of which in Emily Brontes case were no doubt Germanic as some in Charlottes were French anywhere but in the mysterious store and order of nature We know from Charlotte Brontes words and without them should realize the truth that Emily Bronte the creator the Emily Bronte who means much to the imagination owed little if anything to literature It lit or shadowed her mind of course as sun or darkness lit or shadowed her moors and heath it did not permeate her spirit or become a second nature with her Her distinctive work and that widespread literature which may be regarded as an outcome so to say of the British Museum Readingroom seem ages asunder in point of date and method All that places her apart owes no more to booklore than the stories woven and rewoven by vigorous brooding minds in the lonely Icelandic life to which we are indebted for the procession of the sagas work to which remoteness from common actuality and profound aloof winters gave so often a novel sense and depth of mood By the way there was of course a Norse element in Yorkshire tradition and one finds it interesting to trace in Emily Bronte a certain kinship with the sagamen though fancy might easily carry the kinship too far A critic in the Athenaum once suggested a decisive relation in Emily Brontes genius to something far greater than that of German romancowhich of course at its best had some sense of greatness or at least was deeper than a cult more than a mere fashion in fiction  to no less than the genius of Dante himself This is a highly interesting question which unfortunatelyat least so far as the present writer knowsthe acute critic has not considered in detail In this connexion and in view of Emily Brontes Celtic ancestry it were profitable to study that Celtic visionary spirit which made many Infernos before and during Dantes day even though they found no comprehensive and powerful artist to shape them into concreteness and permanency There was a potential Dante in the racial soul and in truth some sense of it lingera to this day with the Celts As to other aspects of the kinship it is not merely fanciful to apprehend a certain Dantesque significance in the chief lovers in Wuthering Heights abandoned to passion in such a degree that it becomes as a great doom Catherine in the passionate scene where her cry is that she is Heathcliff is no faint reminder of Francesca but a Dante would not allow a Heathcliff or a Catherine in hate or love to protest so much The tears and cries doubtless set Mrs Ward thinking of the minor features of German romance The passion as the forementioned critic recognized runs too much to rhetoric But the concentration not only of speech but of passion which mightnay would surely have come is indicated in a few of Emily Brontes best poems Unfortunately enough in treating of her virtues or defect Mrs Wardwho holds the theory that  we passionately accept her or we are untouched by herdoes not always employ felicitous figures of speech Charlotte Bronte touches the shield of the readershe attacks him and complete as his ultimate surrender may be he yields fightingit is still more so with Emily This martial stress and circumstance is rather overwhelmingand artificial And  Wuthering Heights whatever its naivete of construction its signs of inexperience does not suggest the artificial It is like a grim and elemental outcome of nature not meant either for human enjoyment or human opposition It makes us as it were spectators in strange lands where our word counts for nothing we stand by pits of the passions Had it been Germanmade to the degree Mrs Ward imagines instead of being virtually a creation of impersonal and independent genius it would not have its on the whole decisive imaginative justification Were it possible for Emily Bronte to have been dominated by book impressions and such casual experiences as her critic supposesin short were she an artist of the receptive ordershe would surely have reproduced more of her overyday life in the manner of Anne the frail little one in  Agnes Grey and more gloomily in  The Tenant of Wildfell Hall or in that of even Charlotte in her more porsonal and argumentative moments when the compelling new self was not active Emily was too original for that She obeyed that inscrutable and overmastering spirit of imagination which as Charlotte said in a well known preface strangely wills and works for itself Mr Swinburne rightly finds in her  a dark unconscious instinct as of primitive nature  worship  Unconscious instinct  contains more essential truth than the Germanic dissertation of Mrs Ward And strangely enough if we may touch again the question of Emily Brontes ancestry in the oldest known fragment of Celtic poetry handed down for hundreds of years in Irish tradition there is the unconscious instinct not only of worship of but absolute identification with nature There is a gleam as well as darkness and tho suggestion of a fierceness of spirit that the strenuous and conquering Emily would have understood and sympathized with readily The singer is  the wind which breathes upon the sea the vulture upon the rocks  the ox of the seven combats  the fairest of plants a wild boar in valour a salmon in the water  a lake in the plaineverything in his sheer primeval world as Emily Brontes spirit was everything in the great moorlands The singer before the dawn of Celtic history expressed the dark unconscious instinct in the novelist and poet after sophisticated ages nature again stirred and spokethe nature below books and beyond race Eventually of course as we see by the later poems the unconscious instinct gave place in some measure to a conscious and considered philosophy This Haworth Edition contains besides the novels and poems of the sisters and the  Cottage Poems of their father their portraits and the original titlepages and prefaces in their due places Mrs Gaskells Life with an introduction and notes by Mr Clement Shorter will conclude the series The style of the six volumes already issued is worthy of the house so honourably associated with Haworth though occasionally the printer has neglected quota tion marks We have left to the last a reference to a feature which some will regard as specialillustrations from photographs of places indicated in the works They are of course interesting in their way though the way is too literal They would bind the genius that speaks for many scenes to too local and particular ones For instance tho description of Lucy Snowe in London is accompanied by a picture of Ludgate Hill and St Pauls Cathedral in 1848 The pages have as much to do with Ludgate Hill of 1828 or 2048 They are concerned with a state of soul much more than with a local habitation,biography

THE LITERARY EXAMINER A Tale of Two Cities By Charles Dickens With II lustrations by H K Browne Chapman and Hall This novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story In this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any English work of fiction The subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of tbe great French Revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect If the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury But in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household The story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it It is as truly the Tale of Two Cities as it is tbe touching history of Doctor Manette and Lucie his daughter The pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for tbe distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction Except Mr Stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of Sydney Carton and the slightly sketched family of Jerry Cruncher by the help of which Jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in tbe book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book Mr Dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through tbe outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth Even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt In this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view There are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the Tale of Two Cities In most of Mr Dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won Here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made The skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of Doctor j Manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn tbe Bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate The detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth We may recal as one example of the manner of tbe book the art with which tbe echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in Doctor Manettes j quiet street corner near Soho square A little group sits unI der tbe plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  Darnay the future husband of Lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of tbe curse upon those by whom the Doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story The I Doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling The slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes the I bursting of the tempest blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest tbe greater storm of wbich tbe first drops  had then fallen This is artifice but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book We are inevitably strengthened by a work Hke this in the conviction that Mr Dickenss place hereafter in our literature will be in the first rank of the poets who have not expressed themselves in verse What intensity of life and truth is in tbe picture of the dawn of revolution contained in the story of the Marquiss journey to his country seat before his assassination Saint Antoine and its wretchedness have been described Red wiue bas been spilt at a wineshop door and gathered from tbe mud by a gaunt wolfish people with their human sympathies among themselves but grim and ominous with the red stains upon their hands and mouths when they are first shown to us We have seen the silken courtiers to whom these people are as dogs bound by no ties of love among themselves The Marquis bas left tbe reception room of Monseigneur devoting him to the devil He has run over a wretched mans child and offers gold for its loss as if it had been but a whelp Swinging by tbe chain under his travelling carriage goes one as a passerby afterwards said  whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  It will die out said Monsieur the Marquis glancing at his hands directly In effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the Marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off But there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of tbe hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison Round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the Marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home The village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments It had its poor people too All its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at tbe fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten Expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed Few children were to be seen and no dogs As to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectLife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag Heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the Furies Monsieur the Marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate It was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him He looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years This is bis last converse with the outer world The halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill Gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night The postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the Furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling She turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  It is you Monseigneur  Monseigneur a petition With an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face Monseigneur looked out  How then What is it  Always petitions  Monseigneur For the love of the great God My husband the forester  What of your husband the forester  Always the same with you people He cannot pay something   He has paid all Monseigneur He is dead  Well He is quiet Can I restore him to you   Alas no Monseigneur  But he lies yonder under a little heap of poor grass Well  Monseigneur there arc so many little heaps of poor grass Again well She looked an old woman but was young Her manner was one of passionate grief by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy and laid one of them on the carriagedoor tenderly caressingly as if it had been a human breast and could be expected to feel the appealing touch  Monseigneur hear me Monseigneur hear my petition My husband died of want so many die of want so many more will die of want Again wen Can I feed themT u Monseigneur the good God knows but I dont ask it My petition is that a morsel of stone or wood with my husband name may  be placed over him to show where he lies Otherwise the place will  be quickly forgotten it will never be found when I am dead of tbe  same malady I shall be laid undw some other heap of poor grass I Monseigneur they are so many they increase so fast there is so much  want Monseigneur Monseigneur j The valet had put ber away from the door the carriage had broken n into a brUk trot the postilions had quickened the pace she was left fg far behind and Monseigneur again escorted by the Furies was rapidly  diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and his chateau i  Distinctly present to the taney of the writer must have 11 g ly  been that scene of the taking of the Bastille which is here is j made present to the dullest wit by a few powerful touches of which every one belongs aa closely to tbe story of Doctor Manette as to tbe history of France Here again is a little picture of Saint Antoine after it had been out all day and among other work had wreaked its vengeance upon  Foulon who told the starving people 44 they might eat grass Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and broadleas Then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip Gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors Scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sance to wretched bread  Yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them Fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and hoped It was almost morning when Defarges wineshop parted with its  last knot of customers and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door  At last it is come my dear f Eh well returned madame  Almost How admirable is the picture of the rise of power io the Doctor when the day comes that makes the great horror of his life a means of blessing to his child by giving him influence as a Bastille prisoner over the storm that threatens shipwreck of her dearest hopes He relapses when a second wave against which all bis skill is powerless breaks over her head aud the knot is at last solved by Sydney Cartou The exquisite poetry of the touches which detail to us j the manner of his sacrifice with the honour and trust  of an innocent girl to strengthen him in his last moment is worthy to be the close of a tale nobly sustained to the latest word A few touches here and there may be in excess  we are hardly content for example that it should occur to Miss Pros at a critical moment to compare Madame Defarge s eyes to bed winches  but these faults natural to au active fancy are very few and very slight in the work now before us lt is written throughout with an energy that never wanders from its aim a strength that uses with the subtlety of genius the resources of a studied art,biography
THE LITERARY EXAMINER Bleak House Ry Charles Dickens Rradbury and Evans The addition of another to the list of elaborate works upon which Mr Dickens rests his claim to be remembered in future times forms always an event in contemporary literature  and lileah House being finished opinious upon it are now freely exchanged on all sides Some find in it occasion to feel sorely aggrieved because Mr Dickens is not so inhuman as to be absolutely faultless Some suggest modifications and point out how they would have planned it if it had been theirs to write Some are in raptures over one part some over another and some very particular fellows are carping at every part The judgments on lileah House are in short as various as judgments are apt to be upon a man whoso failings it is thought a subtle test of criticism to discover for the very reason that all the world admires and likes him and his books are bought and read by everybody That this latest of his hooks has filled the fancies of its readers with new groups of people as familiar and real as any that in life they may have known  that it overflows with inimitable grace and tenderness that it is stored with the most subtle wit and with a humour hearty and true that sets always instinctively at work our pleasantest and kindliest emotions  that mirth and pathos abound in it that its satire is always just and manly and that it is full of generous indignation against social usages that create wrong and perpetuate suffering among usis simply in other words to say that it is a book written by Mr Dickens That it has also faults is to say that it is not quite a miracle even though written by bim MtmWyttteHM truly may be found with it and such aa prope ap company great qualities In the whole line of uuMtji throughout the history of literature there will be discovered few writers indeed who have produced unexceptioothe books Books become everlasting by tbe fetuoe tiwi it ia them and by their unquestionable ululation abet tte products of men having only ordinaiy power   panying defects are but tokens ola twa kui haps scarcely detract fran tba them Very hard JEneid and the most omit to note bow have to do with  dramatists MiMik Veg ta JtWn  lSwmmmmm Biotin mmem Scbr  tba boc ft  comparisons are not impertinent Novels as Mr Dickens writes them rise to the dignity of poems In the same spirit Fielding wrote treating his Tom Jones as an epic Upon this high ground we must stand if we would properly discuss lileah House It touches and amuses us but it is destined to draw teare and smiles also from our childrens children Mr Dickens has a large public in the present and wo do not hesitate to declare our belief that he will have one hardly less large in the future The world will grow wiser than it is the abuses attacked by this greatest of humorists and kindliest of satirists will disappearbut the spirit in which he writes and to which he appeals is indestructible  and the emotions he awakens are not more fresh and true to us than they will be to future generations Thc first remark we are disposed to make on lileah House has relation to its plot The conduct of the story appears to us singularly skilful Not without justice has it been objected that the habit of writing a story in monthly parts is apt to lead to a grouter concern for the part than for the whole und to interfere with tho steady and continuous working of every event up to the final issue But let us in the present instance with no less justice remark that the habit of reading a story in parts is equally apt to prevent many readers from noticing how thoroughly a work so presented to them is calculated for perusal as a whole The studied and elaborate care bestowed upon the construction of lileah House is very manifest Event leads to event and chance words or tho deeds of chance people that seem perfectly irrelevant are seen everywhere precisely as in real life exerting a direct and powerful bearing on the course taken by a train of incidents whereof the issue is one of life or death of happiness or misery to men and women perfectly unknown to them Taking the mere surface view of such treat ment it would of course be easy to exhibit its apparent want of connection and design and to display in the J attempt only our own very real want of sagacity This subtle linking together of thc deeds and interests of many people so far as they bear on the progress of one given set of incidents is in fact truer to nature infinitely truer than the common plan of representing half a dozen men and women acting and re acting on each other exclusively as if they were fenced out from the surrounding world Its drawback is that it compels the uso tf a huge number of characters which come and go during tho progress of the story  und j as their purpose in the narrative is not always evident until the reader can look back from the journeys end over tlie  ground he has traversed they may now and then cause some j confusion in the readers mind mid produce an etlect like J that of an overcrowded picture 13ut the art rather than the artist is there in fault  He this as it may never in any former work has Mr j Dickens made use of a plot so evidently planned before hand with minute consideration or throughout so elaborately studied Even the lits of the little lawstationers servant aid directly in the chain of little things that lead indirectly to tho catastrophe of Lady Dedlocks death So dexterously indeed an the many little incidents of this kind leading to i great results managed throughout lileah House that wu can hardly feel surprise if the results should by not very careful readers be received as substantive and independent facts and the small precedent details held altogether separable from them as a mere cloud of isolated incidents A novel j may havo its too superficial readers as life has its too hasty obsorvers At tho closo of his preface Mr Dickens marks incidcii tally the general character of the tale by the intimation thatj in it ho has purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of i familiar things Marvellous is the skill with which towards j this intention tho great Chancery suit on which the plot hinges and on incidents connected with which important or trivial all tho passion and suflering turns is worked into j every part of the book Whenever tho occasion arises or j the art of the storyteller requires tho thick atmosphere of j law that rises out of Jumdyee t darndyce is made to cling  like a fog about thc peoplo in tho story It may be more or less but there it is Either as a thick cloud or a light mist it is to be seen everywhere Lawyers of many grades law clerks of all kinds the copyist the lawstationer thu usurer suitors of every description haunters of tho law courts and their victims live and move round ubout tho life of the chief persons iu the tale and exercise almost insensibly but very certainly a continual influence upon them Comparo this with what a commonplace writer would have preferred and a congenial critic recommended and you will understand what tho power of a man of genius really is To have made the plot itself a connected story of a Chancery suit would havo beeu except for tho merest commonplace ono of tho clumsiest and most impracticable designs conceivable Mr Dickens knew hotter what he was alout and tho use made of Jarndyco v Jamdyco in lileah House is always complete and masterly fJThe other grand feature of the tale connected also closely yet quito naturally with this is the Dedlock household lt is brought out with equal power with the same thoughtful elaboration aud with as perfect a result Not only have we Sir Leicester a truo gentleman with all his weaknesses and Lady Dedlock the supercilious woman of fashion with a busy heart painfully throbbing beneath that hard and quiet outside but Yolumnia and tho cousins the town house and the footmen thc country house and ita good oldfashioned housekeeper all aro worked out with the finish of a master From the first glimpse of the assembled Dedlock household discussing the Doodles and Foodies and Cuffys and Buffya in which they believe politics to consist down to the last chapters that concern themchapters in eluding the flight and pursuit of the unhappy Lady Dedlock which are in conception aud construction absolutely wonderfulthe power aud care spent upon tho group are unceasingly exerted yet so successfully as to bear no trace of effort to keep it throughout iu that central position towards which the other sections of tho tale may be seen gradually and surely to converge Taking the story piecemeal as a mero gallery of pictures and persons we are disposed to think that there are particular groups in lileah House finer than anything that even Mr Dickens has yet produced in the same way Exquisitely true and tender as are his descriptions of the suffering classes in former writings wo can remember none by which we have been touched so deeply or that has been graced by so much of the very finest writing as tho entire tale of the streetwandering Joe as it may be gathered from the pages of the book before us In tho trooper George tho Ragnets and their humble household we have another of those fine broad hearty exemplifications of humour in which Mr Dickens delights in which all tho ludicrous features of every object or incident are intensely enjoyed and made prominent yet with a most genuine and charming sentiment at the same time underlying it all Nothing is repulsive  everything is large laughable and true and the most homely and ungainly figures become radiant with the spirit of goodness Tlie character of Esiher Summerson has been much elaborated and the early portions of her narrative aro as charming as anything Mr Dickens has ever writtenindeed some of the best things in the book may be found throughout it full as it is of noble fancies and delicate and graceful thoughts but wo suspect that Mr Dickens undertook more than man could accomplish when he resolved to make her the naive revealer of her own good qualities We cannot help detecting in some passages an artificial tone which if not selfconsciousness is at any rate not such a tone as would be used in her narrative by a person of tho character depicted Yet the graces and virtues of Esther have won so many hearts that we do not care to dwell on our objection to his method of displaying them  and as to the one or two other characters of the book which wo might have wished away these are quite lost in that crowd of fresh and ever real creations that will live while the language continues Mrs Jelly by and her despondent husband her daughter Caddy and tho Turveydrops the trooper George and his man Phil the brickmakers wives and the dead infant the lawstationer and his little woman Roy thorn and Ski Dipole Mr Chadband and the Coavinses the mother of Mr  uppy the inscrutable and impassable Tulkinghorn to say nothing of 1 poor Miss Flite or tlie immortal Bucket and a dozen others j have been added here to the long list of ideal people with j whom Mr Dickens has made his countrymen intimately and permanently acquainted Mr Dickenss characters as all the world knows pass their names into our language and become types lt is  an evidence of his possession of the highest power that the best of them are thus made each to embody some characi toristic feature to personify some main idea which are ever after found universally applicable Such has been the aim of the highest class of dramatists and novelists since tho beginning of all literature They know little how much there is in any ono mans head or heart who expect to have every I character in a tale laid bare before them as on a psychological  dissecting table and demonstrated minutely We see nobody minutely in real life The rough estimates we form of character aro on tho whole if we possess any tact correct  but men touch and interfere with ono another by the coni tact of their extremes and it is the prominences the sharp I angles that aro most likely to appear in a tale really worth the telling Hence it is therefore as well as for i other reasons that the dramatist or novelist is concerned chiefly with the display of salient points in leach one of his characters Tho rest ofthe sketch is filled iup by the reader or spectator instinctively and sufficiently I out of his own experience Squire Allworihy Rlifil Philosopher Square Parson Adams Trulliber and all the rest of Fieldings characters were formed upon this plan  nor was it thought unjust or unnatural by the great novelist to give distinctness to thc picturo in each case by just so much of genial strength and breadth of colouring as should prevent his idea from being impressed too faintly on the public mind It is for the most part much more easy than correct to cry outexaggeration Wo may be only betray ing our ignorance after all Thero is an eastern saying to the effect that there is in the world precisely what the eye can find in it and let us not suppose that what limits our viewin any particular direction should of necessity be an equal restriction to thc view of a man of genius Of Mr Dickens it is to bo said if of any oue that his main strength has lain in the ability to concentrate his thoughts on objects external to himself If his mero personality were at every turn set up as the limit aud bound to his perceptions if it were still his recurring habit to tako his own character as the infallible test of all other characters ho would in each fresh essay be always retracing only the old weary ground Rut ready and cager at all times with genial warmth and fulness to enter in all the peculiarities of others we have him continually throughout his books apprehending and interpreting iew forms of character and truth and carrying with each new achievement of his genius new pleasure nnd delight into thousands of homesbecause his genius is his fellowfeel in with his race To illustrate these remarks a few passages may bo taken almost at random From the tragical and touching episode of Joe we borrow a brief extract which relates a history The poor desolate outcasts evidence has beenT inquest because he  could not exactly say uhectedt to done to him after death  but what he hid to tu 0uli  wards ascertainedextra judicially te

THE LITERARY EXAMINER Danish Fairy Legends and Tales By Hans Chris tian Andersen Pickering This is a charming little book of fairy tales and excellently well translated But why the tales should he called Danish we do not perceive  except inasmuch as a Dane is the author There is an occasional Northern colouring but only so far as it could not be helped All the rest is so free from everything national or exclusive that we do not remember to have met with any production so given up to a sense of the variety of being that exists in the universe At times it is even painfully so We have so strong a sense given us of the feelings of ducks and ducklings  of swans and storks  of mermen and mermaidens  of nightingales flowers and daisies  even of slugs and cuttlefish  aud of what all sorts of animated creatures round about us think do and might say if they could speak that ones consciousness as a human being almost becomes lost in the crowd We begin to feel as Mrs Gulliver did when her husband returned from Houynhnm land  and think we might as well take to being of a different species We need not say that it implies a rare and surprising art to convey such impressions as these When Johnson laughed at Goldsmith for thinking of writing a story in which u little fish should be the actors the author of Animateil Xetture very properly told him that it was not so easy a matter as he thought it  and that if he Johnson were to write such a story he would make his little fish talk like  great whales There is no such confusion of ideas in Mr Hans Christian Andersen His whales and his little fish all talk in character We are not sure that we ourselves after reading his book could not have talked at pleasure like sharks minnows mermaids bulls ducks or green teas For his vegetables have as much conversational character as his ducks and geese Nay his very pegtops and balls are full of individuality There is a pathetic Daisy in his story of that name who is quite a  sweet creature for the pastoral beauty of her tongue  and in another story there is a Leatter Ball of so aristocratical a character that when proposals are made to her by a PegTop because they happen to have been companions in the same drawer she indignantly asks him whether he is aware that her father and mother were morocco slipjiers and that she has  cork in her body We are here however it may be said confusing the specific and the superinduced character Mr Andersen keeps all clear He has so just a sense of the necessity of adhering to verisimilitude and of the forgetfulness of it on the part of writers in general that he introduces one of his stories with a remark that ought to become proverbial  In China the Emperor is Chinese eSome of his descriptive touches recall the wonderful observation and exquisitely graphic felicity of Mr Dickens There is a wretched little hut in the tale of the Ugly Duclding  so wretched that it knew not on which side to fall and therefore remained standing Admirable is the picture of the stork parading about on his long red legs discoursingin Egyptian which language he had learned from his mother Who does not feel that Egyptian Ls the very language that by way of accomplishment a stork would know  The touches of tnis kind are innumerable The fault of the book if we must find one is that all the stories have too much meaning  that they overflow with intention and moral not always obviously sometimes obscurely but still with incessant intelligence You desire occasionally something more childish and less clever And some of tbe stories nre too long But the genius and refinement are undeniable We must give an extract and are somewhat at a loss so many of the teles nave such strone chums But with all tbe fairy fancy of tbe volume in general perhaps tbe beet story nevertheless if that whkh k least mirylike It rn celled tbe Bmpem NemCbmm voAUmvmbtkhm Westra of tbe spirit of Humbug ead of tbe way in wbicb the T and email vuJpr aw to

unfit for their office and fatso be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish I This stuff must be woven for me immediately And he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly  So the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected to work very busily though iu reality thev did nothing ait all They asked for the most delicate ails and the purest gold thread  put both into their own knapsacks  and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until lau aat aaight   I should like to know how the weavers are

Mhool ef Mr Hans Christian AudersenWZCTZON IDanish Fairy Legends and Tales By HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN London 1846 Pickering SONIE time since these Tales were noticed amid the foreign literature of THE CRITIC That notice attracted to them considerable attention and translations were immediately commenced in various quarters The first that has made its appearance is now before us exquisitely printed at the Aldine Press and tastefully bound so as to form a birthday gift or school prize as attractive in external appearance as it will prove in its contents which are precisely such as youth most loves to read appealing at once to the imagination aud the heart conveying the morality of poetry and the poetry of morality AN DERSEN has succeeded beyond all modern writers in catching the spirit as wvell as the manner of the legendary lore of his country It may be that he has only remodelled fables already current among the peasantry of Denmark but even if he be not the inventor he is entitled to much applause for the skill with which he has put them into presentable shape without divesting them of the simplicity of language and the air of childlike faith in their literal truth which are essential to the storyteller and in which in fact lies the differ i encebetween the real and the false legend making the latter however cleverly constructed dull and uninteresting when compared with the former ANDERSEN writes as if he thoroughly believed that there was a time when beasts and birds talked like Christian men  when i fairies danced anl mermaids sung In this lies the  charm of his Legends and Tales anrd for this and be 1 cause they invariably carry a wholesome moral without thrusting it offinsively forward teaching it rather by the example than by precept do we heartily recommend this volume to young persons and to the regards of all who are looking for an acceptable present for their young friends The translator who wve understand is a lady has performed her task with a hearty appreciation of the characteristics of the Author which she has carefully preserved by rendering the simple language of the original into a pure and simple English so well fitted to convey legends and tales such as these and always so charming because so intelligible to children As specimens both of author and translator anl as in themselves worthy of perusal we extract some of these legends What poetry there is in THE DAISY Listen to my story  In the country close by the road 4 side there stands a summerhouseyou must certainly have I seen it In front is a little garden full of flowers enclosed by I white palings with green knobs and on a bank outside the I palings there grew amidst the freshest of grass a little daisy I The sun shone as brightly and warmly upon the daisy as upon I the splendid large flowers within the garden and therefore it grew hourly so that one morning it stood fully open with its delicate white gleaming leaves which like rays surrounded the t little yellow sun in their centre It never occurred to the 1 little flower that no one saw her hidden as she was among I the grass she was quite contented  she turned towards the i warm sun looked at it and listened to the lark who wasF singing in the air The daisy was as happy as if it were thei day of some high festival and yet it was only Monday The c children were at school  and whilst they sat upon their forms hi and learned their lessons the little flower upon her green stalk n learned from the warm sun and every thing around her how 1 good God is Meanwhile the little lark expressed clearly and 0 beautifully all she felt in silence and the flower looked up a with a sort of reverence to the happy bird who could fly and d sing it did not distress her that she could not do the same a  I can see and listen thought she  the sun shines on mne h and the wind kisses me Oh how richly am I blessed 94 There stood within the palings several grand stifflooking t flowers the less fragrance they had the more airs they gave fl themselves The peonies puffed themselves out in order to Ai make themselves larger than the roses The tulips had the b gayest colours of all they were perfectly aware of it and held ti themselves as straight as a candle that they might be the better 01 seen They took no notice at all of the little flower outside c the palings but she looked all the more upon them thinking y4 how rich and beautiful they are Yes that noble bird will st surely fly down and visit them How happy am 1 who live al so near them and see their beauty  Just at that moment vi ji quirrevit the lark did fly down but he came not to the peonies nor the tulips no he flew down to the poor little ac daisay in the grass who was almost frightened from pure joy In and knew not what to think she was so surprised The little to bird hopped about and sang  Oh how soft is this grasm rtand what a sweet little flower blooms here with its golden of heart and silver garment  for the yellow centre of the daisy rn looked just like gold and the little petals around gleamed silver n white IHow happy the little daisy was  no one can imagine of how happy The bird kissed her with his beak sang to her le and then flew up again into the blue sky It was a full quarhe ter of an hour ere the flower recovered herself Half ashamed n and yet completely happy she looked at the flowers in the th garden they must certainly be aware of the honour and haput piness that had been conferred upon herthey must know tir j how delighted she was But the tulips held themselves twice al as stiff as before and their faces grew quite red with anger As I to the peonies they were so thickheadedit was indeed well he that they could not speak or the little daisy would have heard something not very pleasant The poor little flower could see  well that they were in an illhumour and she was much vexed at it Soon after a girl came into the garden with a knife i sharp and bright she went up to the tulips and cut off one after another  Oh  that is horrible sighed the daisy  it  is now all overwith them The girl then went away with the I tulips How glad was the daisy that she grew in the grass Lit outside the palings and was a despised little flower  She felt e really thankful and when the sun set she folded her leaves IS went to sleep and dreamed all night of the sun and the beaul tiful bird The next morning when our little flower fresh ir and cheerful again spread out all her white leaves in the sunshine and clear blue air she heard the voice of the bird but he is sung so mournfully Alas  the poor lark had good reason for e sorrow he had been caught and put into a cage close by the ly open window lie sang of the joys of a free and unrestrained i flightlie sang of the young green corn in the tields and of the pleasure of being borne up by his wings in the open air The poor bird was certainly very unhappyhe sat a prisoner in his narrow cage  The little daisy would so of illingiv have  helped him but how could she  Ah that she knew not she squite forgot how beautiful all around her was how warmly the sun shone how pretty and white her leaves were Alas  she could only think of the imprisoned bird for whom it was not in her power to do anything All at once two little boys 1 came out of the garden one of them had a knife in his hand e as large and as sharp as that with which the girl had cut the y tulips They went straight up to the little daisy who could e not imagine what they wanted  Here we can cut a nice r piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys and he began n to cut deep all round the daisy leaving her in the centre it I Tear out the flower said the other boy and the little s 1 daisy trembled all over for fear for she knew that if she were e torn out she would die and she wished so much to live as she e was to be put into the cage with the imprisoned lark  No g leave it alone  said the first  it looks so pretty  and so e it was left alone and was put into the larks cage But the s poor bird loudly lamented the loss of its freedom and beat e its wings against the iron bars of its cage and the little flower e could not speak could not say a single word of comfort to Ihim much as she wished to do so Thus passed the whole imorning  There is no water here said the imprisoned vlark they have all gone out and forgotten me not a drop 1 of water to drink  my throat is dry and burning there is fire and ice within me and the air is so heavy  Alas  I must I die I must leave the warm sunshine the fresh green trees and all the beautiful things which God has created  And then he pierced his beak into the cool grass in order to refresh him self a little and his eye fell upon the daisy and the bird bowed to her and said  Thou too wilt wither here thou poor little flower  They have given me thee and the piece of green iaround thee instead of the whole world which I possessed before  Every little blade of grass is to be to me a green i treethy every white petal a fragrant flower Alas  thou only remindest me of what I have lost  Oh that I could comfort him  thought the daisy but she could not move yet the fragrance which came from her delicate blossom was stronger than is usual with this flower The bird noticed it and although panting with thirst he tore the green blades in very anguish he did not touch the flower It was evening and yet no one came to bring the poor bird a drop of water he stretched out his slender wings and shook them convulsivelyhis song was a mournful  pipi his little head bent towards the flower and the birds heart broke from thirst and desire The flower could not now as on the preceding evening fold together her leaves and sleep she bent down sad and sick to the ground The boys did not come till the next morning and when they saw the bird was dead they wept bitterly They dug a pretty grave which they adorned with flower petals the birds corpse was put into a pretty red box royally was the poor bird buried Whilst he yet lived and song they forgot himleft him suffering in his cage and now he was highly honoured and bitterly bewailed But the piece of turf with the daisy in it was thrown out into the street no one thought of her who had felt pnost for the little bird and who had so much wished to comfort him What a moral in THE BUCKWHEAT If after a tempest you chance to walk through a field where buckwheat is growing you may observe that it is burnt as black as though a flame of fire had passed over it and should I you ask the reason the peasant will tell you That the lightning has done it But how is it that the lightning has I done it  I will tell you what the sparrow told me and the sparrow heard the story from an old willowtree which grew and still grows close to a field of buckwheat This willowtree is tall and highly respectable but at the same time old and wrinkled its trunk had been riven asunder from top to bottom grass and brambles grow out of the gap the tree bends forward and the branches hang down almost to the ground looking like long green hair There were different kinds of corn growing in the fields around the willowrye wheat and oatsthe beautiful oats whose ears when they are ripe look like a number of little yellow canarybirds sitting upon one branch The cornears were richly blessed and the fuller they were the lower they bowed their heads in pious humility But there was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willowtree the buckwheat bowed not like the rest of the cornhe stood stiff and proud  I am quite as rich as the wheat said he i and besides I am so i much more handsome my flowers are as beautiful as the I blossoms of the appletree it is delightful to look at me and l my companions Do you know anything more beautiful than l we are you old willowtree  And the willowtree bent his l head as much as to say  Yes indeed I do  But the f buckwheat was puffed up with pride and said  The stupid  tree he is so old that grass is growing out of his bodv  c Now ctnne a dreadful storm all the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads whilst it passed over them 1 the buckwheat Lowever in his pride still stood erect t  Bow thv head as we do  said the flowers  I have no c need said the buckwheat  Bow thy head as we do said  I the corn  The angel of storms comes flying hitherward heI h has win s which reach from the clouds to the earth he will It strike thee down before thou hast time to entreat for mercy n  No I will not bow said the buckwheat Close thy I p flowers and fold thy leaves said the old willowtree look a not into the flash when the cloud breaks Even men dare not n do that for in the flash one looks into Gods heaven and that t sight can dazzle even human eves  what then would it prove tl to mere vegetables like us if we should dare to do so we al who are so inferior to men  So inferior indeed  said the ir buckwheat Now then I vid look right into Gods nr heaven And in his pride and haughtiness he did gaze upon c the lightning without shrinking Such was the flash that it sE seemed as if the whole world was in flames When the tem se pest was over flowers and corn greatly refreshed by the rain re once more breathed pure air but the buckwheat had been ta burnit as black as a coal by the lightning it stood on the field E a dead useless plant And the old willowtree waved its branrelse to and fro in the wind  and large drops of water th fell from the green leaves as though the tree wept And the of svarrows asksd  Winv weepest thou  it is so beautiful here  to See

NEW CLOTHES iad Many years ago there was an Emperor who was so exces Mst sively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress pt He did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor ith did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase except for Iv the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new ud clothes He had a different suit for each hour of the day and nd as of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he  He is sitting in council it was always said of him  The he Emperor is sitting in his wardrobe Time passed away tie merrily in the large town which was his capital strangers arrived every day at the court One day two rogues calling themselves weavers made their appearance They gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colours and elaborate patterns the clothes manufactured from re which should have the wonderful property of remaining in as visible to every one who was unfit for the office he held or Id who was extraordinarily simple in character  These must he indeed be splendid clothes  thought the Emperor  Had I as I such a suit I might at once find out what men in my realms he are unfit for their

before he e troubled himself in the affair All the people throughout d the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to n possess and all were anxious to learn how wise or how ignos rant their neighbours might prove to be  I will send my e faithful old minister to the weavers said the Emperor at last i after some deliberation  he will be best able to see how the cloth looks for he is a man of sense and no one can be more I Fuitable for his office than he is So the faithful old minister went into the hall where the knaves were working with all their might at their empty looms V What can be the meaning of this  thought the old man opening his eyes very wide d I cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms however he did not express his thoughts aloud The impos1 tors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms and then asked him whether the design pleased him and whether the colours were not very beautiful at the same time pointing

I am a simpleton  I have never thought so myself and no one must know it now if I am so Can it be that I am unfit for my office No that must not be said either I will never confess that I could not

his spec tacles  This pattern and the coloursyes I will tell the Emperor without delay how very beautiful I think them W e shall be much obliged to you said the impostors and then they named the

THE LITERARY EXAMINER Great Expectations By Charles Dickens In Three Volumes Chapman and Hall All who have read this story from week to week as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of Mr Dickenss popular journal should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work It is a finished work in the best sense There are we believe some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of Pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it Such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past Let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in Pickwick and Nicholas Nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer Such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of Pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined Mr Dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of Europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art In place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole We dwelt upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc Tale of Two Cities In the story of Great Expectations the same thing is equally remarkable And tbe new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in England and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power There is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch Every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told Thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known Chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple Everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation In Great Expectations the thought is one often enforced by Mr Dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour Joe Gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying About him revolves Pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman His great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning There is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in Australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need He escapes from Australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human Frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him The monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour That he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow Pip sees and feels But the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows and from tbe deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law Pip turns to his neglected fosterfather Joe Gargery the blacksmith Joe who had in these late years found the fallen Pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done Pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour One with this story is that of Miss Havisham and her foster child Estella who becomes the object of Pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter Wealthy Miss Havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane Yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them Upon Miss Havisham who is rich a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful Estella to win and wring the hearts of men She lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes But let us turn to the book for a few extracts In the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which Great Expectations grew and the beginning of the childs action which begot the convicts gratitude The first chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with Joe Gargery at the Forge The delicacies of Joes character are often suggested rather than told We make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant Pip as his child But we are told by himself why he leaves Mrs Gargery to develope into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her My sister Mrs Joe Gargery was more than twenty years older than I and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up  by hand Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand She wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and I had s general impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by band Joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth see sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they  to have somehow got mixed with their own whites Hs wat a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dee fellowa sort of Hercules in strength sad also in weakness My sister Mrs Joe with black hair sud eyes had sacha prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap She wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles She made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against Joe that she wore this apron so much Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life Joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time When I ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and Joe was sitting alone in the kitchen Joe and I being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such Joe imparted a confidence to me the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  Mrs Joe has been out a dozen times looking for you Pip And shes out now making it a bakers dozen Is she  Yes Pip said Joe  and whats worse shes got Tickler with her At this dismal intelligence I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire Tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  She sot down said Joe  and she got up and she made a grab at Tickler and she Rampaged out Thats what she did said Joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she Rampaged out Pip  Has she been gone long Joe  I always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  Well said Joe glancing up at the Dutch clock  shes been on the Hampage this last spell above five minutes Pip Shes a coming  Get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you I took the advice My sister Mrs Joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied Tickler to its further investigation She concluded by throwing meI often served her as a connubial missileat Joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg But the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  And last of all Pipand this I want to say very serous to you old chapI see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that Im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and Id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself I wish it was only me that got put out Pip I wish there warnt no Tickler for you old chap  I wish I could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraigbt on it Pip and I hope youll overlook shortcomings There is a subtle indication we may observe of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as Mrs Joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with Dolge Orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple Again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious T and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T from tar to toast and tub At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent Thereupon J had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail Then I bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and I borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence But she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it tbat we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate Biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at Joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by Joe and me  Why of course cried Biddy with an exultant face Dont you see  Its Aim Orlick without a doubt She had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer We told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him and that I was disappointed by the different result She manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink She watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and tbere was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master After that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without Orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more tban I did what to make of it Biddy again who is mentioned in tbat extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined Poor Biddy had kept shop at the village Dame School and had taught Pip the first mysteries of letters When Mrs Joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan Biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge Imperceptibly I became conscious of s change in Biddy however Her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean She wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like Estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered She bad not been with us more than a year I remember her being newly out of mourning at tbe time it struck me when I observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty snd very good  j It cease ci my Urang onay own eyes fan  writing some psssages fros a book lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing Biddy observant of what I was about I laid down my pen aad Biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down MBiddy said I how do you manage it Either I sm very stupid or you are very clever What is it that I manage I dont knowreturned Biddy smiling She managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but I did not mean that though that made what I did mean mort surprising How do you manage Biddy said I  to learn everything that I learn and always to keep up with me  I was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for I spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though I hsve no doubt now that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price  I might as well ass you said Biddy  how you mansge    Ko because when I come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it But you never turn to at it Biddy  I suppose I must catch itlike a cough said Biddy quietly and went on with her sewing Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side I began to think her rather an extraordinary girl For I called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools In short whatever I knew Biddy knew Theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as I or better Tou are one of those Biddy said I  who make the most of every chance Tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are Biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  I was your first teacher though wasnt I   said she as she sewed  Biddy   I exclaimed in amazement  Why you are crying   No I am not said Biddy looking up and laughing  What put that in your head  What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r I sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until Mr Wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people I recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help as a matter of course Biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while I looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy I might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though I did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  Tes Biddy I observed when I had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  Ah poor thing  replied Biddy It was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  Well said I u We must talk together a little more as we used to do And I must consult you a little more as I used to do Let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday Biddy and a long chat Still more exquisite in the same way is tbe sketch of that long chat between Pip and Biddy The connexion of Pips great expectations with the great old Bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of Newgate associations with Pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between Newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of tbe skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout We may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to London as an actor Pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe When Pip becomes a pupil of Mr Matthew Pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the Peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils Startop and Bentley Drummle They are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story Even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks Pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot But Mr Pumblechook docs nothing It is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash We are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand Rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness No other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of Great Expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,biography

THE PETTICOAT COMMANDO oDer Women in Secret aeryice try jonanna Uranut os tmilS z noon This narrative of certain events in Pretoria during that exciting period between the British occupation in June i9oo and the proclamation of Peace two years later must be approached from an impartial standpoint It is written by one uncompromisingly convinced of the plenary righteousness of the Republican cause and of the absolute injustice of British policy and methods Nevertheles when we have allowed for the viewpoint the book is of considerable interest It is largely from records such as this that the authentic history of the Great Doer W ar will one day ec written The author hates healthily ii the term may be permitted That is to say her rancour is seldom against the individual even an enemy is apt to have justice done at her hands and she does not spare the lamb when those on the Republican side are under criticism The scene is laid at Harmony an old romantic farmstead on the outskirts of Pretoria Harmony was surrounded by the British lines nevertheless it became the intelligence exchange between the Republican inhabitants of Pretoria and the commandos of General Botha which hovered in the vicinity Hansie van Warmelo the heroint is a young woman of compelling individuality and considerable charm The circumstance that she captured a kitten from the British lines and appropriately named it  Mauser perhaps expresses her character better than her more sensational achievements Captain Naude the Baden Powell of the Boers is the hero of the tale His exploits are thrilling enough for instance his visits to Hamnmony in the uniform of a British colonel after strolling through the lines past the house of the Military Governor and being saluted by the sentries Then there is  Gentleman Jim the Zulu who although he could speak Dutch fluently absolutely refused to make use of the  Taal after the British occupation Nevertheless Jim remained faithful to his salt We may close with this expression of the authors healthy optimism  the time will surely come when in the intermarriage of our children and our childrens children will be formed a nation great and strong and purified,biography

The Poetical Work8 of Edgar Allans Poe Illus trated Edinburgh Alexander Hislop and Co It is one of the misfortunes attendant upon the absence of an international copyrightlaw between this country and America that our publishers seldom give us the chance of reading an American author in decent type and paper The reason is obvious The market is filledwith all manner of spurious cheap editions that render such an effort much too risky Hence it is that American literature whichwith all deference be it spokenshould not scorn adventitious aids is generally associated with dirty grey paper bad type small size and insecure binding Let any one who ignorantly fancies that such things have no effect upon his enjoyment of an author read Romeo Juliet published in the form of a dirty tract which may be had in Holywell Street for twopence let him turn to his own large clear wellprinted edition and then say whether the poem does not seem to have acquired a new grace and light and sweetness that it did not possess before We are glad to perceive therefore that Edgar Allan Poe unquestionably the greatest genius that America has yet producedis at length offered to English readers in a handy and presentable form with the accompaniments of clear type and good paper But it was a bold notion to think of illustrating these wonderful poems Failure might have been anticipated at the beginning It was a priori as impossible to translate the dreamlike beauty of Annabel Lee into a picture as it was impossible to set the poem to fitting music and we dare say a good many of our readers have had their fee outraged by hearing the mystically beautiful lines sung to the strumming of a piano The illustrations to this volume are tolerable only where they are independent of the poetry e g one or two chaming little landscapes by Mr MacWhirter But to begin at the beginning did ever anybody more wickedly burlesque a fine poem than Mr C J Staniland has done with the  Raven Did Mr Staniland fancy that this was a comic poem  We find a hideously ugly boy seated in an annchair before a fire the room being filled with ghouls and spirits that remind us of the mnagic weene in Der Pieibchutz done iu a cuwtlty theatre What these tawdry devils have to do with the weird simplicity of the poem we are at a loss to make out But this is nothing to the final scneu in which the boy is found lying on the floor with a merry imp presumably representing hearthurn or nightame sitting on his chest We forgive Mr S hlaad for not being aIe to hmw us the umap proshatb Annabel e but the Raven was more sb as a

best edition of Poes poems we know ofTHE COMPLETE WORKS OF BRET HARTE Collected and Revised by the Author Vol X Tales of Trail and Town 6s Chatto and Windus The Library Edition of the works of Bret Harte is now complete in ten volumes The publishers have done their part well so far as binding and type are concerned though some readers may regret that none of the excellent illustrations which have adorned the earlier editions appear in the new one Many reputations have been made and have passed since Bret Harte gave us The Luck of Roaring Camp and hardly one has stood the test of constant production like his He is now what he was in his early days a writer of excellent stories with a sense of fine workmanship which he has never outraged The present volume contains tales that have

Notice of his Life and Genius By James Hannay 1 Esq With Twenty IllustrationsSome of these twenty illustrations are gracefully fantastic The biographical notice is perversely sentimental The story of Poes life was told by himself so largely and loudly to the public by the daily papers of America that to attempt to colour over its shames with sympathy and apology is idle The poems with their strange unwholesome unequal vigour nightmare verses if such things can be speak for themselves Their writer apart from his works had best be forgottenLITERATURE The Works of Edgar Allan Poe Edited by John H Ingram Vols I and II containing the Collected Tales London and Edinburgh Adam  Charles Black 1874 With jnst so much of the authors works before us it would be too soon to speak definitively of his character either as a man or a writer and hence although Mr Ingrams memoir is prefixed duly enough to the first volume I do not think it falls to be considered here in any detail Mr Ingram has done his best to clear Poes name from the calumnies of Rufus Griswold a gentleman grim by name who makes so repulsive a figure in literary history that he might well have been coined in the morbid fancy of his victim  but when all is said it is not in tho power of man to make Poe altogether sympathetic I cannot find it in my heart to like either his portrait or his character and though it is possible that we see him more or less refracted through the strange medium of his works yet I do fancy that we can detect alike in these in his portrait and in the facts of his life as now most favourably told a certain jarring note a taint of something that we do not care to dwell upon or find a name for The tales themselves are all before us in these two volumes and though Mr Ingram does not tell us whether they are there printed in chronological order I fancy we shall not be mistaken in regarding some of the last stories in the second volume as being also among the last he wrote There is no trace in these of the brilliant and often solid workmanship of his better moments The stories are illconceived and written carelessly There is much laughter bat it is a very ghastly sort of laughter at bestthe laughter of those in his own words  who laugh but smile no more He seems to have lost respect for himself for his art and for his audience When he dealt before with horrible images he dealt with them for some definite enough creative purpose and with a certain measure and gravity suitable to the occasion but he scatters them abroad in these last tales with an indescribable and sickening levity with something of the ghoul or the furious lunatic that surpasses what one had imagined to oneself of Hell There is a duty to the living more important than any charity to the dead and it would be criminal in the reviewer to spare one harsh word in the rpression of his own loathing and horror lest by its absence another victim should be permitted to soil himself with the perusal of the infamous  King Pest He who could write  King Pest had ceased to be a human being For his own sake and out of an infinite compassion for so lost a spirit one is glad to think of him as dead But if it is pity that we feel towards Poe it is certainly not pity that inspires us as we think of Baudelaire who could sit down in cold blood and dress out in suitable French this pointless farrago of horrors There is a phase of contempt that if indulged transcends itself and becomes a phase of passionate selfsatisfaction  so for the weal of our own spirits it is better to think no more of Baudelaire or King Pest It is not the fashion of Poes earlier tales to be pointless however it may be with these sorry ones of the end Pointlessness is indeed the very last charge that could be brought reasonably against them He has the true storytellers instinct He knows the little nothings that make stories or mar them He knows how to enhance the significance of any situation and give colour and life with seemingly irrelevant particulars Thus the whole spirit of VThe Cask of Amontillado depends on Fortunatos carnival costume of cap and bells and motley When Poe had once hit upon this device ol dressing the victim grotesquely he had found the key of the story and so he sends him with uneven steps along the catacombs of the Montresors and the last sound we hear ont of the walledup recess is the jingling of the bells upon his cap Admirable also is  the use he makes of tho striking clock at Prince Prosperos feast in  The Mask of the Red Death Each time the clock struck the reader will remember it struck so loudly that the musn and the dancing must cease perforce until it had made an end as the hours ran on towards midnight these pauses grew naturally longer the maskers had the more time to think and look at one another and their thoughts were none the more pleasant Thus as each hour struck there went a jar about the assemblage until as the reader will remember the end comes suddenly Now this is quite legitimate no one need be ashamed of being frightened or excited by such means the rules of the game have been respected  only by the true instinct of the storyteller he has told his story to the best advantage and got full value for his imaginations This is not so always however  for sometimes he will take a high note falsetto sometimes by a sort of conjuring trick get more out of his story than he has been able to put into it and while the whole garrison is really parading past us on the esplanade continue to terrify us from the battlements with sham cannon and many fiercelooking shakos upon broomsticks For example in  The Pit and the Pendulum after having exhausted his bedevilled imagination in the conception of the pendulum and the redhot collapsing walls he finds he can figure forth nothing more horrible for the pit and yet the pit was to be the crowning horror This is how he effects his purpose vol i p 214   Amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well emu over my soul like balm 1 rushed to its deadly brink  I threw my straining vision below The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses Yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw At length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit burned itself in upon my shuddering reason O for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but this And that is all He knows no more about the pit than you or I do It is a pure imposture a piece of audacious impudent thimblerigging and yet even with such bugs as these he does manage to frighten us You will find the same artifice repeated in  Hans Pfaal about the mysteries of the moon  and again though with a difference in thc abrupt conclusion of  Arthur Gordon Pym His imagination is a willing horse  but three times as you see ho has killed it under him by overriding and come limping to the post on foot With what a good grace does he not turn those failures to advantage and make capital out oleach imaginative bankruptcy  Even on a critical retrospect it is hard to condemn him as ho deserves  for he cheats with gusto After this knowledge of the stage this cleverness at turning a story out perhaps the most striking of Poes peculiarities is an almost incredible insight into thc debateable region between sanity and madness Tho  Imp of the Perverse for example is an important contribution to morbid psychology  so perhaps is  The Man of the Crowd   Berenice toofor ashorrible as it is touches a chord in ones own breast though perhaps it is a chord that had better be left alone  and the same idea recurs in  Thc TellTalo Heart Sometimes we can go with him tho whole way with a good  conscience sometimesinstead of saying yes this is how 1 should bo if I were just a little more mad than ever I waswe can say frankly this is what I am There is ono passage ol analysis in this moro normal vein in the story of  Ligeiaas tothe expression of Ligcias eyes He tells us how he felt ever on the point of understanding their strange quality and ever baffled at the last moment just as  in our endeavours to recall to memory something long forgotten wo often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being able in the end to reincmbrr  and how in streams of running water in the ocean in the falling of a meteor jj tho glances of unusually aged people in crrlaia sounds from stringed instruments in certain passages from books in the commonest sights and sensations of thc universe he found ever and anon some vagne inexplicable analogy to the expression and the power of these loved eyes This at least or the like of it we all know But in the general his subtlety was more of a snare to him than anything else Nil sapicntiac odiosius he quotes himself from Seneca  nil sapicntiae odiosius acumine nimio And though it is delightful enough in the C Augusto Dupin trilogyit was Baudelaire who called it a trilogyyet one wearies in tho long run of this strain of ingenuity one begins to marvel at tbe absence of thc good homespun motives and sentiments that do the business of the everyday world although the demonstrator is clever and the cases in structive and probably unique one begins to weary of going round this madhouse and long for thc society of some plain harmless person with business habits and a frock coat and nerves not much more shattered than the majority of his plain and harmless contemporaries Nor did this exaggerated insight make him wearisome only it did worse than thatit sometimes led him astray Thus in  The Pit and the Pendulum when the hero has been condemned  the sound of the inquisitorial voices he says seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel Now it wants but a moments reflection to prove how much too clever Poe has been here how far from true reason he has been carried by this niminm acumen Forthe man being giddythe  idea of involution  must have preceded the merging of the inquisitorial voices into an indeterminate hum and most certainly could not have followed it as any fanciful deduction Again as before in the matter of effect one cannot help fearing that some of the subtlety is fustian To take an example of both sorts of imaginationthe fustian and the sincerefrom the same story  Arthur Gordon Pym   the four survivors on board the brig Grampus have lashed themselves to the windlass lest they should be swept away one of them having drawn his lashings too tight is ready to yield up his spirit for a long while is nearly cut in two indeed by the cord about his loins No sooner had we removed it however Poe goes on  than he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to move with much greater ease than either Parker or myself two who had not tied themselves so closely  This teas no doubt owing to the loss of blood Now whether medically correct or not this is on tho face of it sincerely imagined Whether correct or not in fact it is correct in art Poe evidently believed it true  evidently it appeared to him that thus and not otherwise the thing would fall out Now turn a page back and we shall find ii 78 in tho description of the visions that went beforo Pym while thus bound something to be received very much more deliberately  I now remember he writes that in all which passed before my minds eye motion was a predominant idea Thus I never fancied any stationary object such as a house a mountain or anything of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people on honeback carnages driving furiously and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession This may be true  it may be the result of great erudition in thc thoughts of people in such sore straits  but the imagination does not adopt these details they do not commend themselves to our acceptance it is nowise apparent why stationary objects should not present themselves to the fancy of a man tied to the windlass of a dismasted brig and this being so the whole passage as art stand condemned If it be mere causeless fancy as it seems it is fustian of the most unpardonable sort if it be eruditionwell then it may be erudition bnt never art Things are tit for art so far only ns they are both truo and apparent To make what I mean clear Mr Buskin in some one or other of his delightful books quotes and approves a poet I think it was Homer who said of a brave man that he was as brave as a fly and proceeds in his usual happy manner to justify the epithet The fly he tells us is in very deed the most madly courageous of all created beings And therefore the simile is goodexcellent good And yet the readers instinct would tell him I am sure that the simile is a vile simile Let him prefer his instinct before Mr Ruskins natural history For though it be based on what is true this comparison is not based upon a truth that is apparent it does not commend itself to our acceptance it is not art I have spoken at so great a length of these matters of method and detail that no room remains to me to speak of the larger questiona question avoided also by Baudelaire on the same plea of want of spacewhy it is that these subjects interested Poes imaginationa question difficult of solution indeed but not insoluble with time Nor have I left myself room to speak of what is j perhaps still more important the relation  between Poe and his far greater and better compatriot Hawthorne That there is a consanguinity that the two saw the world in a fashion not altogether dissimilar that some of the short stories of Hawthorne seem inspired by Poe and some of Poes short stories seem to be an echo of Hawthorneall this is beyond question  but all this I can do no more than indicate Nor should the reader be surprised if a criticism upon Poe is mostly negative and rather suggests new doubts than resolves those already existing for it is Poes merit to carry people away and it is his besetting sin that he wants altogether such scrupulous honesty as guides and restrains the finished artist He was let us say it with all sorrow not conscientious Hunger was ever at his door and he had too imperious a desire for what we call nowadays the sensational in literature And thus the critic if he be more conscientious than the man he is criticising dare not greatly praise lest he should be thought to condone all that is unscrupulous and tinsel in these wonderful stories They are to be praised by him in one way onlyby recommending those that are least objectionable If anyone wishes to be excited let him read under favourable circumstances  The Gold Bug  The Descent into the Maelstrom  The Cask of Amontillado  The Oval Portrait and the three stories about C Auguste Dnpin the philosophical detective If he should then desire to read more he may go on but warily there are trapdoors and springguns in these two volumes there are gins and pitfalls and the precipitate reader may stumble unawares upon some nightmare not easily to be forgotten One word on the services of Mr Ingram This edition has evidently been a labour of love with him Let us hope in the next two volumes which are to complete the series he may extend some of his love and labour to the scraps of French which Poe was so fond of scattering about his pages There are some deplorable errors abroad in the two under present considerationerrors I should like to make clear to

He is aloof sinister unbending while theyC are frank friendly companionable he belongs nowhere while t he v are local orat the broadestof their Ownl Country and continent T h e finding is a little indiscriminate though it has a side of truth so far as Poe is concerned We note further that in Ir Greenoughs opinion  The 4Gold Bug  Pur1 o in ed Letter  Murders in the Rue MT orgue etc are to be preferred before the  Fall of the House of Usher  and  1omain of Arnheim that is to say the tales of ratiocination before those of high imagining the inventions before things of creative genius The first group has begotten a great host of imitators but no one dares to borrow from that other store which sent out things like The Masque of the Red Death  Beren i c e and  Ligeri This edition includes the preface to that of 1849 the remarks of N P Willis published in theHonze Journal on the Saturday a f t e r the death of Poe and the memoir by Rufus Griswold These things belong to history

Corrcspomling Mimbus A   Kditcd by Hoz With Illustrations by If V Hoz The third number of this amusing work is well sustained with the same humour and drollery that have made the preceding parts so popular The lat boy improves upon us ami we lind that he turns out to be not tpiite so tfrcat a fool ns the world had generally supposed His betrayal of the loves of the elderly Mr Tupnian and the not

Hoz has dune his part well and much lessens our reirnt at the want of Mr Seymours spirited handThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club Edited toy Boz London Chapman and Hall 186 Strand Wa have before us seven numbers of a work which has attracted no little notice in the world of wit and which certainly deserves the serious attention of all laughterloving mortals These memoirs contain some account of the adventures of Mr Pickwick the founder and Messrs Tupman Winkle and Snodgrass three of the members of the club in search not of the picturesque like Dr Syntax but of information concerning men and manners for the instruction and edification of the members of the society Of course the story is merely a framework in which to exhibit pictorial representations of the incidents which befel these gentlemen in the course of their travels The comedy is interspersed with some occasional touches of tragedy which we do not think by any means so felicitous in their execution as the lighter and more humorous parts and for poetry at least poetry of a serious character we recommend the author of these papers to eschew it for ever To borrow the words which he has put into the mouth of the supposititious creator of the lines on the  Joy Green when called upon to recite his offerings to the muse Its a very slight affair and the onlv excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it is that I was a young man at the time The style of ideas brought into fashion bv Monk Lewis and sustained for a time by the vigorous pen and wild imagination of Barry Cornwall has long since been forsaken under the influence of returning good taste and consigned to the  tomb of all the Capulets  and young poets should recollect that the uneven lines of Thomas Moore are excused only by their exquisite matter or by the kWill which h rendered a deformity of metre pleasing to the ear as a skilful composer will enhance the value of his harmonies by the occasional interposition of the harshest discords But such liberties with the rhythm of verse may only be taken by the lofty spirit of genius or the practised band of longtried ingenuity Having thus blamed what we consider blameable it is but just that we should offer our meed of praise The scenes from life are sketched with considerable graphic power and rich humour showing an insight into the mechanism of human actions and a knowledge of the workings of that incomprehensible cause the mind which give a more interesting character to the fun and frolic of these racy pages than if they were mere farce unseasoned with the sharp relish of a strong satirical vein A scene in mimicry of the tranquil and digtified proceedings of a certain great house not a hundred miles from Westminsterbridge is well worthy of perusal and in short if we were to particularize all that is good we should give the numbers of all the comic chapters and if we were to select a specimen of every variety of merry jest we should reprint half of the contents We give one extract which will serve to initiate our readers into the mysteries of the Pickwick Club and refer them to certain little monthly numbers which are displayed in green coats in the majority of the booksellers shops we have passed for some time since It should not be forgotten that the illustrations of the earlier numbers proceeded from the pencil of the waggish Seymour but since his lamented and premature death they have been of course transferred to another operator The portion we have chosen is a description of the chain of untoward circumstances by which Mister Weller boots of the White Hart in the Borough lost his chance of inheriting his fathers wealth  My father Sir vos a coachman A vidower he vos and fat enough for anythinguncommon fat to be sure His

With Illustrations The world has already been delighted with ten of these singular and humorous papers  and all the characters that they so originally display are still in high feather not one of them yet having been found in the least to droop We are rejoiced to find that Mr Dickens promises us ten moremay his health and spirits carry him merrily through them This last number contains some severe hits at matrimonial disarrangements and the inimitable Sam Weller moralizes upon them in a strain truly philosophical The merrymaking at Christmas is what it ought to bea making of us merry The story with which it concludes that of  The Goblin who stole a Sexton contains a verv excellent moral and is well toldTHE WORLD OF DICKENS TH POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICEWCK CLUB By Charles Dickens WIT 10lluations in colour by C E BROCK Harrap 15s WE are glad to see this new edition of  Pickwick  with Mr Brucks bright and effective illustrations Mr Pickwick with Mrs Bardell in his arms and Mr Winkle extruded into the cold of the Crescent at Bath are good examples of the artists skill in detail Mr Pickwicks figure and face were fixed by Seymour and no one has departed far from his conception but in the other characters there is a chance to improve on  Phiz  which has been taken He made figures either notoriously fat or notoriously thin His Sam Weller looks at least forty and the same may be said of Alfred Crowquills which appeared in a pirated American edition Here Winkde and Snodgrass look more like real persons of some character The List of Characters is useful but by no means complete As Dickenss Preface is printed why is his Dedication to Talfourd not included also It was a tribute to a friend both from the public and the private point of view and reprints should give itTke

into favour by the old gentleman were shortly afterwards installed in a newlyt uilt house not half a mile from Mr Pickwicks Mr Winkle being engaged ia the city as agent or town corespondent of his father exchanged his old costume for the ordinary dress of Englishman aad presented all the external appearance of a civilised Christina everaJlerwarda Mr aad Mrs Saodgraas settled at Dingley Dell where they purchased and cultivated a small farm more for occupation than profit Mr Snodgrass being occasionally abstracted and melancholy is to this day reputed a great poet laong his friends and acquaintance although we do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief We know many celebrated characters literary philosophical and otherwise who hold a high reputation on a similar tenure Mr Tupmaa when his friends married and Mr Pickwick settled took lodgings at Richmond where he has ever since resided He walks constantly on the Terrace during the summer months with a youthful and janty air which has rendered him the admiration ofthe numerous elderly ladies of single condition who reside in the vicinity He has never proposed again Mr Bob Sawyer having previously passed through the Gazette passed over to Bengal accompanied by Mr Benjamin Allen both gentlemen having received surgical appointments from the East India Company They each had the yellow fever fourteen times and then resolved to try a little abstinence since which period they have been doing well Mrs Bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentlemen with great Boat hut never brought any more actions for a breach of promise of marriage er attorneys Messrs Dodson and Fogg continue in business from which thev realise a large income and in which they are universally considered among the sharpest of the sharp Sam Weller kept his word and remained unmarried for two years The old housekeeper dying at the end of that time Mr Pickwick promoted Mary to tbt situation oa condition of her marrying Mr Weller at once which she did without a murmur From the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been repeatedly seen at tha gate of the back garden we have reason to suppose that Sam has some family The elder Mr Weller drove a coach for twelve months but being afflicted with the gout was compelled to retire The contents of the pocketbook had been so well invested for him however by Mr Pickwick that he had a handsome independence to retire on upon which he still lives at an excellent publichouse near Shooters hill where he is quite reverenced as an oracle boasting very much of his intimacy with Mr Pickwick and retaining a most unconauerable aversion to widows Mr Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house employing his leisure hoars in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club or in hearing Sam Weller read aloud with such remarks as suggested themselves to his original mind which never failed to afford Mr Pickwick great amusement He was much troubled at first by the numerous applications which were made to him hy Mr Snodgrass Mr Winkle and Mr Trundle to act as godfather to their offspring but he has become used to it now and officiates as a matter of course lie never had occasion to regret his bounty to Mr Jingle for both that person and Job Trotter became in time worthy members of society although they have always steadily objected taratara to tha scenes of their old haunts and temptations He is somewhat infirm now but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit aad may still be frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the Dalwieh Gallery or enjoying n walk about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine day Ha is known by nil the poor people about who never fail to take their hats off as he passes with great respect tbe children idolise him nnd so indeed deas the whole neighbourhood Every year he repairs to a large family merrymaking at Mr Wardlea on this as on all other occasions he is invariably attended by the faithful Sam between whom and his master there exists a steady aad reciprocal attachment which nothing but death will saver A preface which touches on some of the difficulties the author has had to contend with in his undertaking and a dedication are given in tbe last number Tbe dedication is to Mr Serjeant Talfourd  mm a slight and roost inadequate acknowledgment of the inestimable services he is rendering to the literature of his country and of the lasting benefits he will confer upon the authors of this and succeeding generations by securing to them and their descendants a permanent interest in the copywright of their worksThe Posthumous Papers ofthe Pickwick Club Edited by Boz JNo VIII Chapman and Hall We continue to read these papers with great admiration of the easy original and unaffected powers displayed in them We should be ungrateful if we passed by the appearance of a new number without a word of notice and welcome There is no flagging in this number before us Every stroke of the writers humour the most common or the most careless tells to a desired effect and that rarely mastered distinction between thc power of embodying the serious and the ludicrous is thoroughly mastered here We should say that the grave passages of the number even excel the Comic tn the heartrending calamities of common life as in its sidesplitting oddities and humours the writer bids fair to show himself unrivalled The number opens with an impassioned rhapsody by a mysterious old lawclerk on the many miseries that have darkened the dingy old Inns of Court Mr Pickwick stares at him in silence The old gentleman resumes with a leer   Look at them in another light their most commonplace and least romantic  What fine places of slow torture they are Think of the needy man who has spent his all beggared himself and pinched his friends to enter the profession which is destined never te yield a morsel of bread to him The waitingthe hopethe disappointmentthe fearthe miserythe poverty the blight on his hopes and end to his careerthe suicide perhaps or better still the shabby slipshod drunkard Am I not righi about them eh  And the old man rubbed his hands and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject Mr Pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity and the remainder of the company smiled and looked on in silence  Talk of your German universities said the little old man Pooh pooh theres romance enough at home Without going half a mile for it  only people never tb ink of it  I never thought of the romance of this particular subject before certainly said Mr Pickwick laughing  To be sure you didnt  said the little old man a of course not As a friend bit of it said he He died one morningw  his outer door Fell with his head in his own letterbox and there he lay for eighteen months Everybody thought he had gone out of town  And how was he found at last  hundred Mr Pickwick  The benchers determined to break his door open as he hadnt paid any rent for two years So they did Forced the lock and n very dusty skeleton in a blue coat black kneeshorts and silks fell forward in tne arms of the porter who opened the door Queer that Rather perhaps rather eh r And the little old man put his head more on one side and rubbed his hands with unspeakable glee  I know another case said the little old man when bia chuckles had io some degree subsided It occurred in Cliffords Inn Tenaat of a top ut bad charactershut himself up in his bedroom closet and took a

hat ehich always preceded his entering into conversation with his master u It is not indeed Som replied Mr Pickwick surveying the crowded j jhy street through which they were passing  Its a wery remarkable circumstance Sir said Sam  that poverty and oysters always aeems to go together u l dont underataad you Sam said Mr Pickwick a What I mean Sir said Sam  is that the poorer a place is the greater call there seems to be for oysters Look here Sir heres a oyster stall to efery halfdozen housesthe streets lined vith ern Blessed if I dont think that ven a mans wery poor he rushes out of his lodgings and eats oysters in reglar desperation  To be sure he does said Mr Weller senior  and its just the same vith pickled salmon  Those are two very remarkable facts which never occurred to me before aid Mr Pickwick  The very first place we stop at Ill make a note of By this time they had reached the turnpike at Mile End a profound silence prevailed until thev had got two or three miles further on when Mr Weller senior turning suddenly to Mr Pickwick said  Wery queer life is a pikekeepers Sir  A what  said Mr Pickwick  A pikekeeper  What do you mean by a pikekeeper  inquired Mr Peter Magnus  The old un means a turnpikekeeper genlmn observed Mr Weller in explanation  Oh said Mr Pickwick  I see Yes very curious life Very uncomfortable  Theyre all on em men as has met vith some disappointment in life said Mr Weller senior  Ay ay   said Mr Pickwick  Yes Consequence of vich they retires from the world and shuts themselves up in pikes partly vith the view of being solitary and partly to rawenge themselves on mankind by takin tolls N Deat me said Mr Pickwick  I never knew that before  Fact Sir said Mr Weller  if they was genlmn youd cali era misanthropes but as it is they only takes to pikekeepin All this is excellent but the wit of Boz excellent as it is has not exhausted this subject of Turnpikes He may return to it with some effect We look upon it as only another strong proof of tbeir misanthropical turn for annoying and disappointing mankind that they are specially called Trusts because they all declare  No Trust It is malice and false pretence The elder Mr Weller acquits himself through the number in a manner infinitely worthy of his esteemed aad ingenious son We will close our extracts by quoting his touching farewell to Sam when he is obliged to resume the reins for London   pm a goin to leave you Samivel my boy and theres no telling ven I shall see you again Your motherinlaw may ha been too much for me or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o the celebrated Mr Yeller o the Bell Savage The family name dependa wery much upon you Samivel and I hope youll do wots right by it Upon all little piata o breedin I know I may trust you as veil as if it was my own self So ive only this here one little bit of adwice to give you If ever you no matter and pison to say to that Pison yourself Samivel my boy pison yourself and youll be glad on it afterwards With these affecting words Mr Weller looked steadfastly on his son nnd turning slowly upon his heel disappeared from his sight We see in this the foreshadowing of some deep and pathetic interest or other and wait impatiently for the ninth number of the Papers of the PickwickThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwickian Club Indited by Bo And The Library of Fiction  or lui utily Story Teller Boz marches on triumphantly and has completely taken possession of the ear and of the hearts too of his countrymen His fifth number is joyous in the scenes of a contested election and the honest wonder and indignation ol the great Mr Pickwick at the venality he witnesses are charming The contents of the  Story Teller  this month are all good and two of the pieces are original the one Jesse Chile by Miss Mitford and  the Alchymist by Mr Harvey This is really a great advance upon the last Hoing thus this periodical cannot fail to do wellThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club  containing a Faithful Record of thc Perambulations Perils Travels Adventures and Sporting Transactions of the Correspotiding Members Edited by Boz With Illustrations The public have now had a full dozen of these papers and they are cager for a dozen more They seem to increase in interest and ability as they proceed Instead of flagging they grow more uproarious in their fun and more rich in their drollery We like this number the best of any that have yet appeared still it has a striking fault and we shall take this opportunity of reading Master Boz a friendly lecture in public that we are quite secure he would not submit to in private When he brings his scenes home to us in their familiarity of everyday life he should always be not only strictly possible but even probable Thus if an artist choose to paint a dragon or a chimera we give him a little latitude as to his proportions and the free use of his colours  but should he choose to paint a pig it must be a pig and nothing else but a pig that he paints or we shall pronounce his attempt a failure The trial scene that makes the interest of this volume is as familiar to his readers as is the appearance of a denizen of the sty  and everybody who reads it knows badly as much of our judicature is conducted that the verdict was not possible from the evidence produced This is a pity inasmuch as it has no thing to do with the humour of the proceedings If it were necessary for the following out of the story that the venerable and muchtobeidolized Pickwick should be wrongfully cast in damages the evidence against him should have been made strongerthe misconception could easily afterwards have been explained away However ull this may not have struck the million But we will still maintain that however wild may be the fiction or rampant the humour of a literary production all the groundwork upon which it is erected such as the face of the country the manners of the time and the operations of public institutions should be strictly in accordance with truthThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club containing a faithful Record of the Perambulations Ptriis Travels Adventures and Sporting Transactions of the Corresponding Members Edited bv Box With Illustrations Boz iroes on triumphing and has again proved to the world that the comic muse is not yet quite defunct The seventh number of this Pickwickian risibility has more than rivalled the preceding six The sporting excursion on the 1st of September which was undertaken with all the strength of the club still more strong in its adjutant Sam Weller is one of the best things of the sort that we have ever read The impounding of the dignified leader in a barrow among the pigs and the asses in the Tillage receptacle for the wandering is a happy hit and though a most powerful still a most probable one For quiet humour and keen satirical acumen the interview with the lawyers is really not to be stirpassed The next number promises us a rich treat Wo are just admitted into the vestibule with the foldingdoors partially opened that are to disclose some rich scenesupon which we are impatient to enterPosthumous

illustrations Very good this number the eleventh indeed Sam Weller improves upon acquaintance The world never saw drollery and wit offered to them before in a form so singular The renowned Mr Pickwick is himself the legitimate successor to Don Quixote  indeed he is the cockney Quixote of the nineteenth century and instead of armour of iron he is encased in a good coating of aldermanie fat and instead of spear and sword has his own powers of declamation with which to go forth to do fearful hattie upon the swindler the wrongdoer and the oppressor of the innocent Wc wish that the humorous Boz would call to mind that the knight of La Mancha was really the victim of a veritable flame We should like to see Mr Pickwick confess to the soft impeachment This gentlemans attendant has the process of mollification already going forward in his heartwe trust that it will not ascend to his head but that he will make love with the same effect that hitherto he does everything else Wc know of no publication that is productive ot more genuine amusement than these Pickwickian papersThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club Edited by Boz No IX Chapman and Hall This is the best Pickwick we have

popular The lat boy improves upon us ami we lind that he turns out to be not tpiite so tfrcat a fool ns the world had generally supposed His betrayal of the loves of the elderly Mr Tupnian and the not less elderly Miss  anile to his mistress is a very rich seciic The cricketmatch also is well elev scribed Wv arc rdad ntrahi to meet Mr Jingle on the scene though bc is but a sad rollie at best and

Hoz has dune his part well and much lessens our reirnt at the want of Mr Seymours spirited handThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club Edited toy Boz London Chapman and Hall 186 Strand Wa have before us seven numbers of a work which has attracted no little notice in the world of wit and which certainly deserves the serious attention of all laughterloving mortals These memoirs contain some account of the adventures of Mr Pickwick the founder and Messrs Tupman Winkle and Snodgrass three of the members of the club in search not of the picturesque like Dr Syntax but of information concerning men and manners for the instruction and edification of the members of the society Of course the story is merely a framework in which to exhibit pictorial representations of the incidents which befel these gentlemen in the course of their travels The comedy is interspersed with some occasional touches of tragedy which we do not think by any means so felicitous in their execution as the lighter and more humorous parts and for poetry at least poetry of a serious character we recommend the author of these papers to eschew it for ever To borrow the words which he has put into the mouth of the supposititious creator of the lines on the  Joy Green when called upon to recite his offerings to the muse Its a very slight affair and the onlv excuse I have for having ever perpetrated it is that I was a young man at the time The style of ideas brought into fashion bv Monk Lewis and sustained for a time by the vigorous pen and wild imagination of Barry Cornwall has long since been forsaken under the influence of returning good taste and consigned to the  tomb of all the Capulets  and young poets should recollect that the uneven lines of Thomas Moore are excused only by their exquisite matter or by the kWill which h rendered a deformity of metre pleasing to the ear as a skilful composer will enhance the value of his harmonies by the occasional interposition of the harshest discords But such liberties with the rhythm of verse may only be taken by the lofty spirit of genius or the practised band of longtried ingenuity Having thus blamed what we consider blameable it is but just that we should offer our meed of praise The scenes from life are sketched with considerable graphic power and rich humour showing an insight into the mechanism of human actions and a knowledge of the workings of that incomprehensible cause the mind which give a more interesting character to the fun and frolic of these racy pages than if they were mere farce unseasoned with the sharp relish of a strong satirical vein A scene in mimicry of the tranquil and digtified proceedings of a certain great house not a hundred miles from Westminsterbridge is well worthy of perusal and in short if we were to particularize all that is good we should give the numbers of all the comic chapters and if we were to select a specimen of every variety of merry jest we should reprint half of the contents We give one extract which will serve to initiate our readers into the mysteries of the Pickwick Club and refer them to certain little monthly numbers which are displayed in green coats in the majority of the booksellers shops we have passed for some time since It should not be forgotten that the illustrations of the earlier numbers proceeded from the pencil of the waggish Seymour but since his lamented and premature death they have been of course transferred to another operator The portion we have chosen is a description of the chain of untoward circumstances by which Mister Weller boots of the White Hart in the Borough lost his chance of inheriting his fathers wealth  My father Sir vos a coachman A vidower he vos and fat enough for anythinguncommon fat to be sure His

With Illustrations The world has already been delighted with ten of these singular and humorous papers  and all the characters that they so originally display are still in high feather not one of them yet having been found in the least to droop We are rejoiced to find that Mr Dickens promises us ten moremay his health and spirits carry him merrily through them This last number contains some severe hits at matrimonial disarrangements and the inimitable Sam Weller moralizes upon them in a strain truly philosophical The merrymaking at Christmas is what it ought to bea making of us merry The story with which it concludes that of  The Goblin who stole a Sexton contains a verv excellent moral and is well toldTHE WORLD OF DICKENS TH POSTHUMOUS PAPERS OF THE PICEWCK CLUB By Charles Dickens WIT 10lluations in colour by C E BROCK Harrap 15s WE are glad to see this new edition of  Pickwick  with Mr Brucks bright and effective illustrations Mr Pickwick with Mrs Bardell in his arms and Mr Winkle extruded into the cold of the Crescent at Bath are good examples of the artists skill in detail Mr Pickwicks figure and face were fixed by Seymour and no one has departed far from his conception but in the other characters there is a chance to improve on  Phiz  which has been taken He made figures either notoriously fat or notoriously thin His Sam Weller looks at least forty and the same may be said of Alfred Crowquills which appeared in a pirated American edition Here Winkde and Snodgrass look more like real persons of some character The List of Characters is useful but by no means complete As Dickenss Preface is printed why is his Dedication to Talfourd not included also It was a tribute to a friend both from the public and the private point of view and reprints should give itTke

into favour by the old gentleman were shortly afterwards installed in a newlyt uilt house not half a mile from Mr Pickwicks Mr Winkle being engaged ia the city as agent or town corespondent of his father exchanged his old costume for the ordinary dress of Englishman aad presented all the external appearance of a civilised Christina everaJlerwarda Mr aad Mrs Saodgraas settled at Dingley Dell where they purchased and cultivated a small farm more for occupation than profit Mr Snodgrass being occasionally abstracted and melancholy is to this day reputed a great poet laong his friends and acquaintance although we do not find that he has ever written anything to encourage the belief We know many celebrated characters literary philosophical and otherwise who hold a high reputation on a similar tenure Mr Tupmaa when his friends married and Mr Pickwick settled took lodgings at Richmond where he has ever since resided He walks constantly on the Terrace during the summer months with a youthful and janty air which has rendered him the admiration ofthe numerous elderly ladies of single condition who reside in the vicinity He has never proposed again Mr Bob Sawyer having previously passed through the Gazette passed over to Bengal accompanied by Mr Benjamin Allen both gentlemen having received surgical appointments from the East India Company They each had the yellow fever fourteen times and then resolved to try a little abstinence since which period they have been doing well Mrs Bardell let lodgings to many conversable single gentlemen with great Boat hut never brought any more actions for a breach of promise of marriage er attorneys Messrs Dodson and Fogg continue in business from which thev realise a large income and in which they are universally considered among the sharpest of the sharp Sam Weller kept his word and remained unmarried for two years The old housekeeper dying at the end of that time Mr Pickwick promoted Mary to tbt situation oa condition of her marrying Mr Weller at once which she did without a murmur From the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been repeatedly seen at tha gate of the back garden we have reason to suppose that Sam has some family The elder Mr Weller drove a coach for twelve months but being afflicted with the gout was compelled to retire The contents of the pocketbook had been so well invested for him however by Mr Pickwick that he had a handsome independence to retire on upon which he still lives at an excellent publichouse near Shooters hill where he is quite reverenced as an oracle boasting very much of his intimacy with Mr Pickwick and retaining a most unconauerable aversion to widows Mr Pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house employing his leisure hoars in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club or in hearing Sam Weller read aloud with such remarks as suggested themselves to his original mind which never failed to afford Mr Pickwick great amusement He was much troubled at first by the numerous applications which were made to him hy Mr Snodgrass Mr Winkle and Mr Trundle to act as godfather to their offspring but he has become used to it now and officiates as a matter of course lie never had occasion to regret his bounty to Mr Jingle for both that person and Job Trotter became in time worthy members of society although they have always steadily objected taratara to tha scenes of their old haunts and temptations He is somewhat infirm now but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit aad may still be frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the Dalwieh Gallery or enjoying n walk about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine day Ha is known by nil the poor people about who never fail to take their hats off as he passes with great respect tbe children idolise him nnd so indeed deas the whole neighbourhood Every year he repairs to a large family merrymaking at Mr Wardlea on this as on all other occasions he is invariably attended by the faithful Sam between whom and his master there exists a steady aad reciprocal attachment which nothing but death will saver A preface which touches on some of the difficulties the author has had to contend with in his undertaking and a dedication are given in tbe last number Tbe dedication is to Mr Serjeant Talfourd  mm a slight and roost inadequate acknowledgment of the inestimable services he is rendering to the literature of his country and of the lasting benefits he will confer upon the authors of this and succeeding generations by securing to them and their descendants a permanent interest in the copywright of their worksThe Posthumous Papers ofthe Pickwick Club Edited by Boz JNo VIII Chapman and Hall We continue to read these papers with great admiration of the easy original and unaffected powers displayed in them We should be ungrateful if we passed by the appearance of a new number without a word of notice and welcome There is no flagging in this number before us Every stroke of the writers humour the most common or the most careless tells to a desired effect and that rarely mastered distinction between thc power of embodying the serious and the ludicrous is thoroughly mastered here We should say that the grave passages of the number even excel the Comic tn the heartrending calamities of common life as in its sidesplitting oddities and humours the writer bids fair to show himself unrivalled The number opens with an impassioned rhapsody by a mysterious old lawclerk on the many miseries that have darkened the dingy old Inns of Court Mr Pickwick stares at him in silence The old gentleman resumes with a leer   Look at them in another light their most commonplace and least romantic  What fine places of slow torture they are Think of the needy man who has spent his all beggared himself and pinched his friends to enter the profession which is destined never te yield a morsel of bread to him The waitingthe hopethe disappointmentthe fearthe miserythe poverty the blight on his hopes and end to his careerthe suicide perhaps or better still the shabby slipshod drunkard Am I not righi about them eh  And the old man rubbed his hands and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject Mr Pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity and the remainder of the company smiled and looked on in silence  Talk of your German universities said the little old man Pooh pooh theres romance enough at home Without going half a mile for it  only people never tb ink of it  I never thought of the romance of this particular subject before certainly said Mr Pickwick laughing  To be sure you didnt  said the little old man a of course not As a friend bit of it said he He died one morningw  his outer door Fell with his head in his own letterbox and there he lay for eighteen months Everybody thought he had gone out of town  And how was he found at last  hundred Mr Pickwick  The benchers determined to break his door open as he hadnt paid any rent for two years So they did Forced the lock and n very dusty skeleton in a blue coat black kneeshorts and silks fell forward in tne arms of the porter who opened the door Queer that Rather perhaps rather eh r And the little old man put his head more on one side and rubbed his hands with unspeakable glee  I know another case said the little old man when bia chuckles had io some degree subsided It occurred in Cliffords Inn Tenaat of a top ut bad charactershut himself up in his bedroom closet and took a

hat ehich always preceded his entering into conversation with his master u It is not indeed Som replied Mr Pickwick surveying the crowded j jhy street through which they were passing  Its a wery remarkable circumstance Sir said Sam  that poverty and oysters always aeems to go together u l dont underataad you Sam said Mr Pickwick a What I mean Sir said Sam  is that the poorer a place is the greater call there seems to be for oysters Look here Sir heres a oyster stall to efery halfdozen housesthe streets lined vith ern Blessed if I dont think that ven a mans wery poor he rushes out of his lodgings and eats oysters in reglar desperation  To be sure he does said Mr Weller senior  and its just the same vith pickled salmon  Those are two very remarkable facts which never occurred to me before aid Mr Pickwick  The very first place we stop at Ill make a note of By this time they had reached the turnpike at Mile End a profound silence prevailed until thev had got two or three miles further on when Mr Weller senior turning suddenly to Mr Pickwick said  Wery queer life is a pikekeepers Sir  A what  said Mr Pickwick  A pikekeeper  What do you mean by a pikekeeper  inquired Mr Peter Magnus  The old un means a turnpikekeeper genlmn observed Mr Weller in explanation  Oh said Mr Pickwick  I see Yes very curious life Very uncomfortable  Theyre all on em men as has met vith some disappointment in life said Mr Weller senior  Ay ay   said Mr Pickwick  Yes Consequence of vich they retires from the world and shuts themselves up in pikes partly vith the view of being solitary and partly to rawenge themselves on mankind by takin tolls N Deat me said Mr Pickwick  I never knew that before  Fact Sir said Mr Weller  if they was genlmn youd cali era misanthropes but as it is they only takes to pikekeepin All this is excellent but the wit of Boz excellent as it is has not exhausted this subject of Turnpikes He may return to it with some effect We look upon it as only another strong proof of tbeir misanthropical turn for annoying and disappointing mankind that they are specially called Trusts because they all declare  No Trust It is malice and false pretence The elder Mr Weller acquits himself through the number in a manner infinitely worthy of his esteemed aad ingenious son We will close our extracts by quoting his touching farewell to Sam when he is obliged to resume the reins for London   pm a goin to leave you Samivel my boy and theres no telling ven I shall see you again Your motherinlaw may ha been too much for me or a thousand things may have happened by the time you next hears any news o the celebrated Mr Yeller o the Bell Savage The family name dependa wery much upon you Samivel and I hope youll do wots right by it Upon all little piata o breedin I know I may trust you as veil as if it was my own self So ive only this here one little bit of adwice to give you If ever you no matter and pison to say to that Pison yourself Samivel my boy pison yourself and youll be glad on it afterwards With these affecting words Mr Weller looked steadfastly on his son nnd turning slowly upon his heel disappeared from his sight We see in this the foreshadowing of some deep and pathetic interest or other and wait impatiently for the ninth number of the Papers of the PickwickThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwickian Club Indited by Bo And The Library of Fiction  or lui utily Story Teller Boz marches on triumphantly and has completely taken possession of the ear and of the hearts too of his countrymen His fifth number is joyous in the scenes of a contested election and the honest wonder and indignation ol the great Mr Pickwick at the venality he witnesses are charming The contents of the  Story Teller  this month are all good and two of the pieces are original the one Jesse Chile by Miss Mitford and  the Alchymist by Mr Harvey This is really a great advance upon the last Hoing thus this periodical cannot fail to do wellThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club  containing a Faithful Record of thc Perambulations Perils Travels Adventures and Sporting Transactions of the Correspotiding Members Edited by Boz With Illustrations The public have now had a full dozen of these papers and they are cager for a dozen more They seem to increase in interest and ability as they proceed Instead of flagging they grow more uproarious in their fun and more rich in their drollery We like this number the best of any that have yet appeared still it has a striking fault and we shall take this opportunity of reading Master Boz a friendly lecture in public that we are quite secure he would not submit to in private When he brings his scenes home to us in their familiarity of everyday life he should always be not only strictly possible but even probable Thus if an artist choose to paint a dragon or a chimera we give him a little latitude as to his proportions and the free use of his colours  but should he choose to paint a pig it must be a pig and nothing else but a pig that he paints or we shall pronounce his attempt a failure The trial scene that makes the interest of this volume is as familiar to his readers as is the appearance of a denizen of the sty  and everybody who reads it knows badly as much of our judicature is conducted that the verdict was not possible from the evidence produced This is a pity inasmuch as it has no thing to do with the humour of the proceedings If it were necessary for the following out of the story that the venerable and muchtobeidolized Pickwick should be wrongfully cast in damages the evidence against him should have been made strongerthe misconception could easily afterwards have been explained away However ull this may not have struck the million But we will still maintain that however wild may be the fiction or rampant the humour of a literary production all the groundwork upon which it is erected such as the face of the country the manners of the time and the operations of public institutions should be strictly in accordance with truthThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club containing a faithful Record of the Perambulations Ptriis Travels Adventures and Sporting Transactions of the Corresponding Members Edited bv Box With Illustrations Boz iroes on triumphing and has again proved to the world that the comic muse is not yet quite defunct The seventh number of this Pickwickian risibility has more than rivalled the preceding six The sporting excursion on the 1st of September which was undertaken with all the strength of the club still more strong in its adjutant Sam Weller is one of the best things of the sort that we have ever read The impounding of the dignified leader in a barrow among the pigs and the asses in the Tillage receptacle for the wandering is a happy hit and though a most powerful still a most probable one For quiet humour and keen satirical acumen the interview with the lawyers is really not to be stirpassed The next number promises us a rich treat Wo are just admitted into the vestibule with the foldingdoors partially opened that are to disclose some rich scenesupon which we are impatient to enterPosthumous

illustrations Very good this number the eleventh indeed Sam Weller improves upon acquaintance The world never saw drollery and wit offered to them before in a form so singular The renowned Mr Pickwick is himself the legitimate successor to Don Quixote  indeed he is the cockney Quixote of the nineteenth century and instead of armour of iron he is encased in a good coating of aldermanie fat and instead of spear and sword has his own powers of declamation with which to go forth to do fearful hattie upon the swindler the wrongdoer and the oppressor of the innocent Wc wish that the humorous Boz would call to mind that the knight of La Mancha was really the victim of a veritable flame We should like to see Mr Pickwick confess to the soft impeachment This gentlemans attendant has the process of mollification already going forward in his heartwe trust that it will not ascend to his head but that he will make love with the same effect that hitherto he does everything else Wc know of no publication that is productive ot more genuine amusement than these Pickwickian papersThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club Edited by Boz No IX Chapman and Hall This is the best Pickwick we have

the hand of an enemy should efface my name from the picture I would not complain if the work of my hand and of my fliit lived only for mankind To the eldeily ladyshe said with a low voice and a look of humility  I do not know whether I should be happy I only know one thing that I must obey tho voice which requires from me that I should strive after the immortal in art Cod must dispose my fate as He sees best And have you weighed asked Count Alarik advancing towards her all the dillicultics of your path eiieral opinion poverty your sex which prevents the acquisition of a grounded knowledgeall nil vvill retard your steps Listen to wiser counsel Angelica Direct yourself according to the taste and the circumstances of the times Do not strive to attain to the ideal paint portraits little scenes out ofeveryday life and you will become rich will live tranquil loved and esteemed  I can endure hunger said Angelica calmly and fixedly and the censure of the world I do not hear it would be overpowered by a mightier voice within my own breast Striving after the highest only vvill I live  And if you should fail i if you should be deceived in your own powers Y  Then may Cod be merciful to me and let me die   And wherefore this ambition  A less degree of perfection also gives joy and the good and the beautiful live also in the humbler spheres of life and there are they moro accessible The highest the highest exclaimed Angelica I will live iind die striving after tbe highest You have the true artistsoul said Count Alarik Angelica afterwards becomes the pet of ii patronizing Countess and dies young at Home leaving behind her one immortal work  Angelica lived not in vain And who that has striven ardently and laboured honestly has lived in vain if it be only for a brief morning hour  The following sketch of various classes f women is drawn to the life  Some amongst us there aro to whom life has been a rough soil they go through it without being loved and what is worse without being able sincerely to love any one The frostiness of thc air around them chills thc warmth in their breasts they become bitter and hard  and as they can produce no flowers they turn themselves into rods They cannot leave virtue and beauty at peace and they quarrel with beauty and weakness Let us hope that by the light of a moro friendly sun the tree of their life shall put foi th new buds and thal they shall receive and give forth gladness Others there are iind they are many whom nature has Modally provided foi  tiny are good and amiable they love virtue  but the world and temptation unwise counsellors and their own hearts weakness make them fall The best heall becomes soiled by unworthy desires and low pleasures Fallen angels many are there anion them who weep bitter tears over the grave of their own innocence and these may one day arise in renewed virtue Others there aro who overlay its hs with flowers and mirth over these weep the angels of heaven Many chers are there also whom lianne iud fortune made for temptation but friendly stars have kept watch over them Their hearts were early attached by a jure love and a protecting home closed around them liken Midsummer bower Theil joys and their sorrows are alike innocent and all their intercourse with their fellow creatures is peaceful No one hates thom and what is more tranquillizing no one loves them more or differently to what the Cospel permits They live loved and honoured and general opinion calls them patterns iind examples lint these quietly happy one these untried ones how often do they pass heavy judgments on those who in an atmosphere ditferent to their own have fioen their hearts or scorched their wings They fancy that they have a light to despise them and yet it is possible after all that they aro in no way superior to then except in being happier Others also are there thank ind  and my heart warms in thinking that 1 know and love suchwho neither stepchildren nor favourites of nature and fortune tempted or not templed bylife resemble each other nevertheless in this that they never let anything dim the celestial mirror in their souls Pure themselves and hating all evil yet they pity and purdon those who sin A heaven of pure compassion lies in their glance and through it only does the guilty one read his judgment Sood true wise patient alfcctiouate they do not permit themselves to be disturbed by human weakness or severity they go tranquilly on their way  iliey have a light within them that guides them and that warmly beneficently beams around them They understand how to compassionate those sorrows they have themselves never felt and when they stiller they can yet smile joyfully on others Like the hird of paradise they hover onwards over the earth without disfiguring their wings with its dust and by their loveliness they entice others to follow on their heaven ward dight And now hack againwell  but I had nearly forgotten thc fifth and most populous class of women and thus with them nearly shut myself out of the creation I do not know how j better to designate them than as  the hannie We its members aro as numerous iis the potatoe and come like it all over the vvoild We are the worlds household fare and the world would go on badly without us We fill the room and yet deprive nobody of a place we neutralize the warring elements of life which without us would destroy one another We are produced by the jute milint and this our element we seek to diffuse over the world We call exultation folly and Sappho a madwoman We go to church and to the opera and dont wish to he much noticed We take from life exactly what life will give us iind are contented we put our houses in order salt our meat according to established rule speak moderately good or ill of our neighbour think only its much as is necessary and beat down the price of every thing that is much praised or greatly in demand in one word we are what arc called cipud people and keep the world in equipoise We sing best this J good song Tralliiln tfiillnlii trallii trail Tiiilliila triillitla trallom  The following scene between Adelaide and lier betrothed vvill give the reader an insight into the character of both   When these amiable women were gone Count Alarik said The impression made hy personal beauty is generally acknowledged  I am the hist who would wish to deny the beneficent inlluence of beauty on the mind its bewitching power on the heart hut what works equally with this and deeper and more beneficially aro the qualities we hiive just had an opportunity of admiring in Mrs L and her daughters That fine proportion in thc development of the powers of the soul that clear uiiderstaniiin that precision and order in tho expression and di livery of opinions

to think that in one appearance one possess s a tie isiire rich enough to give happiness lo a whole hie The world moves so joy fully so pleasantly for tho young beauty so that it is diilicult for her to seize the seriousness of lifo And why this seriousness why must it bc so important to st he it  asked Adelaide  lecaue a human being is called to something more than being merely a flower or ii butterfly  as such it is possible to please to charm to call forth approbation  but never esteem nor true love Adelid looked oppressed and furs rose to lier eyes  Jif  so pleasant said she  Cod has given us joy and Iile  why shall we rn i enjoy his gifts Ah let us let us be joyful   Life has higher ind weightier interests said Count Alarik with deeper earnctness iind which but ill agree with a thoughtless enjoyment of its pasing pleasures There are said Countess Augustaweighty and important duties to be performed  man must nut live for himself alone  What do you mean thenasked Adelaide earnestly half anxious half laughing  with your importance and your duties  Is it something out of the llomau history that one must resemble to be ii human being   Count Alarik looked at lier with an extraordinary emotion She stretched her hand to him with the niot engaging charm and said  Let me be glad in life and in death Cod is good he intends good to us all in joy as in sorrow   why should we not ho glad  Let me not see this gloomy seriousness Count Alarik did not answer  he pressed the snow white hand to his lips followed Adelitide with his eyes during the whole evening but remained silent and thoughtful Adelaide was grave for a moment but soon returned to her usual liveliness and laughed sung and played with the little ones The description of ii Swedish spring and its awakening

Presidents Daughters A Narrative of a Governess By Frederika Bremer Smith This is a reprint of another of the American translations on which we remarked some weeks since The style is easy and spirited with none ofthe laboured periods or harsh entanglements of j a common place translator When we noticed Mrs Ho witts version also excellent we dwelt upon the story at too great a length to recur to it now but we cannot avoid remarking it as a great advantage that tbe Presidents Daughters may here be purchased apart from its sequelNina It is complete in itself and one of the best of Miss Bremers tales how beautiful is Adelaide throughout and what a charming scene the closing reconciliation of the lovers with its incident of the cherries so prettily stolen from La Fontaine Nina we confess is greatly less to our taste and seems to us more filled with Miss Bremers peculiar faults than any other in her delightful series of fictionsTHE LITERARY EXAMINER The Presidents Daughters including Niuo Br JFredenka Bremer Translated by Mary Howitt Three vols Longman and Co The author of this work is a great domestic teacher in Sweden and the social condition of her audience invests her labours withfeectiliar interest With the most perfect institutional ninnis trtrn and a people enjoying aU the iulteUetagos of a complete system of national hutractton Swedep exhibits in its criminal

ofatttww back iBlOaltiaiar afa gJad tSOaatteatSL tamar tat Btw tat fih ki vi         ft f   j TWmsfw more extensively read Little is known however of her personal history and it is to be regretted that her English translator has not taken the trouble to collect a few particulars concerning the life of an author who occupies so remarkable a position We believe Miss Bremer was born to affluence but troubles have fol leu heavily on her family and reduced her in the spring of life to a state of dependence upon her friends who move in the best circles of the capital Her genius has thus been prompted to exertion by adversity and many touching allusions to her own circumstances may be found scattered through her productions She resides chiefly at Stockholm Tlie secret ot her success lies in that truthfulness f delineation which whatever form it takes or in v hat ever manner it makes itself manifest is always siru to strike home to the heart of a people She mes nothing to art and everything to the depth aud seriousness of a resolute purpose She is the least skilful ol all living novelists She has no notion of consiructiiii a narrative on anv inlelligie principle of arrangement she never dreams of  mhveiing a series tlincidents in natural sequence Willi her the end arul aim of thc design is to work out thoronuhly and sincerely the whole passion of the subject h fore her without embarrassing her progress willi any reference to what has gone before or what is likely to follow How she succeeds in raising tho edifice and finally roofing it must be a grave puzzle to the aesthetic critics of Germany  for she may be fairly compared to an architect uho builds a house without scaffolding Vet her looks arc nevertheless solid and symmetrical in relation to their ultimate object and like all truths lound in strong feelings and fixed conviction have an innate energy in them that overrules criticism Her novels are not novels of plot or costume hut of character and observation lier knowledge of human nature is profoundol human nature as it is dewhmed in the world and acted upon by worldly influences She paints society with a wisdom rarely brought to bear upon domestic scenes and she unveils with such clearness and courage the mixed emotions that throb beneath the surface that the reader derives from the reality of hr pictures a sort of artificial experience of life The volumes before us contain two talcs or more properly a family chronicle divided into two parts The faults which were so prominent in Miss Brewers former publications are even more conspicuous in this The interest is broken up and distributed amongst a greit variety of persons the narrative is a progress through a succession of events rather than a compact story the individuals who move in it are strongly contrasted and some of them are drawn in sheer wilful excess  in the matter of plot there is a tendency to extravagance and romance which is strangely irreconcilable with the good sense and cultivated taste of the author  and if we add that there is too much German mysticism and too much of that socalled artenthusiasm which deals so largely in loose abstractions as to bc nearly unintelligible we shall have discharged our conscience of every grain of objection that has settled upon it during a careful perusal of these volumes But how large a balance of praise remains to oe counted up The minute fidelity of the details the vivid distinctness with which every mental struggle and secret emotion is traced the moral beauty and womanly purity which steadily illuminate thc narrative and thc calm Christian philosophy out of which all its earnest lessons of truth anil justice and resignation and serene wisdom arc drawn must receive implicit admiration on all hands The style occasionally perhaps a little too florid is generally eloquent and appropriate and much as she crowds thc scene with figures Miss Bremer possesses beyond any other living writer of her cUss the power of realizing to the imagination every individual she introduces There is scarcely a single person in her tumultuous groups that does not stand out palpably in his lning lineaments The Presidents Daughters occupies only the first volume Nina the youngest of the family engrosses the remaining two The President is a widower with four daughters and we are introduced on the very threshold of the narrative to this fair household on whose fortunes the whole story revolves The narrator is tbe governess to whose charge the orphan are consigned  The first wat a tall thin figure with a remarkably plain countenance and stiff and unpleasing demeanour She curtseyed coldly and reservedly and was presented by her lather as  Edi  Adelaide mas then named and a yoong lovely creature approached me and beaming with smiles blushingly embraced me I thought I had never seen anything more bewitching  Chickens chickens my little chickens Nina and Mina now exclaimed the President and lifted in his anas two of tbe sweetest little beings in the world Lighthaired Maeeyed rosylipped omlcatelyformed were they and so like each other that in the bsginoina I could not possibly distinguish them I was enchanted wah these  lovely ttttlc chSldreo aad desired nothing more tata to make scqitaiaftance with them The President did all thal 4esaMslssj skis afc ts tivy  gravely and bairne ts sstsasksra sjsylrtsflssfessiftji feat legged stiffarmed figures which I cut out of cards mediators between us At sight of these the little ones began as it were to thaw and presently I wag covered with their carts their dolls and their castles as well as being informed in confidence that they thought mv nose very large  In the meantime I paid attention to the President who was conversing with his two elder daughters Adelaide related to her father the events of the daythe dinner company and the dishes Edla added a remark or two and even sometimes upon her sisters words The President marvelled much at the mixture of  chicken and cauliflower For my part I could not take my eyes from Adelaide she struck me as indescribably beautiful and pleasing Her countenance was more round than oval the forehead high and finely arched the nose small and exquisitely formed whilst a pair of large dark blue eyes beamed with joy and goodheartedness and the roses of health tinged both her lips and her cheeks Her smile nay her whole manner was such as we ascribe to a cherub She was ot middle height her figure finely moulded and her carnage noble  her neck her arms and hands dazzlingly white and of the most perfect form Her head whichwas adorned with rich chesnutbrown hair she carried a little thrown back which gave her an appearance of haughtiness nay almost of arrogance  nor was this contradicted by her manner however softened that might be by an expression of sincere sweetness and goodwill Beside this brilliant figure her sister showed like a shadow and I suspected that it was her own sense of this which made her so gloomy The foundations of the subsequent interest are visibly laid in these portraits Kdla plain reserved and melancholy has no share in her fathers affections The worthy President is a man of conventions and without being conscious of an injustice is devotedly fond of the beautiful Adelaide A morose spirit is gradually engendered in the heart of the neglected Edla and from ont step to another the distance between her and lier father widens into distrust and aversion Passing over a long interval let us come to the sequel It is evening the company juc assembled in the drawingroom and Adelaide has just sung a song about  Home The subject is a dangerous one 44  A home  said Count W softly as he crossed his arms on his breast and bowed his head 4 a home with a beloved wifeit is in truth a heaven 444 Yes said the President  and with an amiable daughter who in everything seeks to please her father and provides so tenderly for his comfort and enjoyment 44 The tone in which this was said and the sharp glance he cast upon Edla caused ali eyes to turn upon her She coloured violently I am certain that the President immediately repented his hasty and unfriendly words  but what was said was said and Edlas embittered feelings roe hastily to a decree which I should have thought with her to be impossible She turned to Count Alarik and said  44 4 You have compared home to a heaven do you know what else it may resemble  44 lie looked questioningly upon her and she continued 4 A house of correction 44 I shuddered at these bitter words The President started so that the tea was shaken out of his cup Count Alarik regarded Kdla seriously and reproachfully 44 Kdla continued with violent excitement  There is an overseer and there are prisoners The fonner assigns work to the latter and when they neglect it he punishes them He exacts the fulfilment of duties but gives neither the tenderness nor the joy which makes duty light But why complain of it V she added casting up a glance full of anger and despair  the lesser life is but a counterpart of the higher and home is an image of the worlds order 44 i Miss Kdla said Count Alarik warningly 44 The President was violently affected but restrained himself and turning to Count Alarik said with a specious calmness4 Is it not wonderful my dear Count that man so often embitters his own days and then complains impatiently at the suffering he has himself causer  My late  wife the President became moved as he almost always did when he named her  poor Frederica made me  s the happiest of husbands  if she had lived she would like i  wise have made me a happy father for she would have  taught her daughters that mildness and concession which j alone can gain love she would have taught them to deserve   a fathers tenderness who desired nothing better than to see all his children happy around him and to clasp them a to his bosom I  The President was moved and evidently ready for reconciliation Not so Edla the long pentup poison of bitterness was boiling up in her 444 Love alone she said  wins return of love That father who gave his child life and did not give it tenderness and does not give it joy has no right to make any claims No right said the President with warmth and too excited to be able to weigh his words  No right But vou you can never be wron you must always he right but it I have no right to claim from you some compliance and obedience I have at least a right to free myself and my house from discomfort and disquiet For the last three years you have not given me one single joyful day  you have yourself evidently shown that you despise your fathers counsel and dislike his house if in future this does not become other than it has been heretofore then it is best thatthat we part  It will then be my affair said Edla coldly and growing pale to give place I shall soon no longer give discomfort or disquiet to any one  She arose laid aside her work and was about to go Count Alarik seised her arm  Child  said he softly no precipitance Miss Edla you are wrong bethink yourself 44 She stopped and looked wildly at him  What shall I do she asked M Yon have been wrong Confess it Beg your fathers forgive neaii M  No I saki abe violently as she sought to disengage her arm bat Count Alarik held it fast and eondncting her aside

pity and purdon those who sin A heaven of pure compassion lies in their glance and through it only does the guilty one read his judgment Sood true wise patient alfcctiouate they do not permit themselves to be disturbed by human weakness or severity they go tranquilly on their way  iliey have a light within them that guides them and that warmly beneficently beams around them They understand how to compassionate those sorrows they have themselves never felt and when they stiller they can yet smile joyfully on others Like the hird of paradise they hover onwards over the earth without disfiguring their wings with its dust and by their loveliness they entice others to follow on their heaven ward dight And now hack againwell  but I had nearly forgotten thc fifth and most populous

to think that in one appearance one possess s a tie isiire rich enough to give happiness lo a whole hie The world moves so joy fully so pleasantly for tho young beauty so that it is diilicult for her to seize the seriousness of lifo And why this seriousness why must it bc so important to st he it  asked Adelaide  lecaue a human being is called to something more than being merely a flower or ii butterfly  as such it is possible to please to charm to call forth approbation  but never esteem nor true love Adelid looked oppressed and furs rose to lier eyes  Jif  so pleasant said she  Cod has

thoughtless enjoyment of its pasing pleasures There are said Countess Augustaweighty and important duties to be performed  man must nut live for himself alone  What do you mean thenasked Adelaide earnestly half anxious half laughing  with your importance and your duties  Is it something out of the llomau history that one must resemble to be ii human being   Count Alarik looked at lier with an extraordinary emotion She stretched her hand to him with the niot engaging charm and said  Let me be glad in life and in death Cod is good he intends good to us all in joy as in sorrow   why should we not ho glad  Let me not see this gloomy seriousness Count Alarik did not answer  he pressed the snow white hand to his lips followed Adelitide with his eyes during the whole evening but remained

Presidents Daughters A Narrative of a Governess By Frederika Bremer Smith This is a reprint of another of the American translations on which we remarked some weeks since The style is easy and spirited with none ofthe laboured periods or harsh entanglements of j a common place translator When we noticed Mrs Ho witts version also excellent we dwelt upon the story at too great a length to recur to it now but we cannot avoid remarking it as a great advantage that tbe Presidents Daughters may here be purchased apart from its sequelNina It is complete in itself and one of the best of Miss Bremers tales how beautiful is Adelaide throughout and what a charming scene the closing reconciliation of the lovers with its incident of the cherries so prettily stolen from La Fontaine Nina we confess is greatly less to our taste and seems to us more filled with Miss Bremers peculiar faults than any other in her delightful series of fictionsTHE LITERARY EXAMINER The Presidents Daughters including Niuo Br JFredenka Bremer Translated by Mary Howitt Three vols Longman and Co The author of this work is a great domestic teacher in Sweden and the social condition of her audience invests her labours withfeectiliar interest With the most perfect institutional ninnis trtrn and a people enjoying aU the iulteUetagos of a complete system of national hutractton Swedep exhibits in its criminal

that her English translator has not taken the trouble to collect a few particulars concerning the life of an author who occupies so remarkable a position We believe Miss Bremer was born to affluence but troubles have fol leu heavily on her family and reduced her in the spring of life to a state of dependence upon her friends who move in the best circles of the capital Her genius has thus been prompted to exertion by adversity and many touching allusions to her own circumstances may be found scattered through her productions She resides chiefly at Stockholm Tlie secret ot her success lies in that truthfulness f delineation which whatever form it takes or in v hat ever manner it makes itself manifest is always siru to strike home to the heart of a people She mes nothing to art and everything to the depth aud seriousness of a resolute purpose She is the least skilful ol all living novelists She has no notion of consiructiiii a narrative on anv inlelligie principle of arrangement she never dreams of  mhveiing a series tlincidents in natural sequence Willi her the end arul aim of thc design is to work out thoronuhly and sincerely the whole passion of the subject h fore her without embarrassing her progress willi any reference to what has gone before or what is likely to follow How she succeeds in raising tho edifice and finally roofing it must be a grave puzzle to the aesthetic critics of Germany  for she may be fairly compared to an architect uho builds a house without scaffolding Vet her looks arc nevertheless solid and symmetrical in relation to their ultimate object and like all truths lound in strong feelings and fixed conviction have an innate energy in them that overrules criticism Her novels are not novels of plot or costume hut of character and observation lier knowledge of human nature is profoundol human nature as it is dewhmed in the world and acted upon by worldly influences She paints society with a wisdom rarely brought to bear upon domestic scenes and she unveils with such clearness and courage the mixed emotions that throb beneath the surface that the reader derives from the reality of hr pictures a sort of artificial experience of life The volumes before us contain two talcs or more properly a family chronicle divided into two parts The faults which were so prominent in Miss Brewers former publications are even more conspicuous in this The interest is broken up and distributed amongst a greit variety of persons the narrative is a progress through a succession of events rather than a compact story the individuals who move in it are strongly contrasted and some of them are drawn in sheer wilful excess  in the matter of plot there is a tendency to extravagance and romance which is strangely irreconcilable with the good sense and cultivated taste of the author  and if we add that there is too much German mysticism and too much of that socalled artenthusiasm which deals so largely in loose abstractions as to bc nearly unintelligible we shall have discharged our conscience of every grain of objection that has settled upon it during a careful perusal of these volumes But how large a balance of praise remains to oe counted up The minute fidelity of the details the vivid distinctness with which every mental struggle and secret emotion is traced the moral beauty and womanly purity which steadily illuminate thc narrative and thc calm Christian philosophy out of which all its earnest lessons of truth anil justice and resignation and serene wisdom arc drawn must receive implicit admiration on all hands The style occasionally perhaps a little too florid is generally eloquent and appropriate and much as she crowds thc scene with figures Miss Bremer possesses beyond any other living writer of her cUss the power of realizing to the imagination every individual she introduces There is scarcely a single person in her tumultuous groups that does not stand out palpably in his lning lineaments The Presidents Daughters occupies only the first volume Nina the youngest of the family engrosses the remaining two The President is a widower with four daughters and we are introduced on the very threshold of the narrative to this fair household on whose fortunes the whole story revolves The narrator is tbe governess to whose charge the orphan are consigned  The first wat a tall thin figure with a remarkably plain countenance and stiff and unpleasing demeanour She curtseyed coldly and reservedly and was presented by her lather as  Edi  Adelaide mas then named and a yoong lovely creature approached me and beaming with smiles blushingly embraced me I thought I had never seen anything more bewitching  Chickens chickens my little chickens Nina and Mina now exclaimed the President and lifted in his anas two of tbe sweetest little beings in the world Lighthaired Maeeyed rosylipped omlcatelyformed were they and so like each other that in the bsginoina I could not possibly distinguish them I was enchanted wah these  lovely ttttlc chSldreo aad desired nothing more tata to make scqitaiaftance with them The President did all thal 4esaMslssj skis afc ts tivy  gravely and bairne ts sstsasksra sjsylrtsflssfessiftji feat legged stiffarmed figures which I cut out of cards mediators between us At sight of these the little ones began as it were to thaw and presently I wag covered with their carts their dolls and their castles as well as being informed in confidence that they thought mv nose very large  In the meantime I paid attention to the President who was conversing with his two elder daughters Adelaide related to her father the events of the daythe dinner company and the dishes Edla added a remark or two and even sometimes upon her sisters words The President marvelled much at the mixture of  chicken and cauliflower For my part I could not take my eyes from Adelaide she struck me as indescribably beautiful and pleasing Her countenance was more round than oval the forehead high and finely arched the nose small and exquisitely formed whilst a pair of large dark blue eyes beamed with joy and goodheartedness and the roses of health tinged both her lips and her cheeks Her smile nay her whole manner was such as we ascribe to a cherub She was ot middle height her figure finely moulded and her carnage noble  her neck her arms and hands dazzlingly white and of the most perfect form Her head whichwas adorned with rich chesnutbrown hair she carried a little thrown back which gave her an appearance of haughtiness nay almost of arrogance  nor was this contradicted by her manner however softened that might be by an expression of sincere sweetness and goodwill Beside this brilliant figure her sister showed like a shadow and I suspected that it was her own sense of this which made her so gloomy The foundations of the subsequent interest are visibly laid in these portraits Kdla plain reserved and melancholy has no share in her fathers affections The worthy President is a man of conventions and without being conscious of an injustice is devotedly fond of the beautiful Adelaide A morose spirit is gradually engendered in the heart of the neglected Edla and from ont step to another the distance between her and lier father widens into distrust and aversion Passing over a long interval let us come to the sequel It is evening the company juc assembled in the drawingroom and Adelaide has just sung a song about  Home The subject is a dangerous one 44  A home  said Count W softly as he crossed his arms on his breast and bowed his head 4 a home with a beloved wifeit is in truth a heaven 444 Yes said the President  and with an amiable daughter who in everything seeks to please her father and provides so tenderly for his comfort and enjoyment 44 The tone in which this was said and the sharp glance he cast upon Edla caused ali eyes to turn upon her She coloured violently I am certain that the President immediately repented his hasty and unfriendly words  but what was said was said and Edlas embittered feelings roe hastily to a decree which I should have thought with her to be impossible She turned to Count Alarik and said  44 4 You have compared home to a heaven do you know what else it may resemble  44 lie looked questioningly upon her and she continued 4 A house of correction 44 I shuddered at these bitter words The President started so that the tea was shaken out of his cup Count Alarik regarded Kdla seriously and reproachfully 44 Kdla continued with violent excitement  There is an overseer and there are prisoners The fonner assigns work to the latter and when they neglect it he punishes them He exacts the fulfilment of duties but gives neither the tenderness nor the joy which makes duty light But why complain of it V she added casting up a glance full of anger and despair  the lesser life is but a counterpart of the higher and home is an image of the worlds order 44 i Miss Kdla said Count Alarik warningly 44 The President was violently affected but restrained himself and turning to Count Alarik said with a specious calmness4 Is it not wonderful my dear Count that man so often embitters his own days and then complains impatiently at the suffering he has himself causer  My late  wife the President became moved as he almost always did when he named her  poor Frederica made me  s the happiest of husbands  if she had lived she would like i  wise have made me a happy father for she would have  taught her daughters that mildness and concession which j alone can gain love she would have taught them to deserve   a fathers tenderness who desired nothing better than to see all his children happy around him and to clasp them a to his bosom I  The President was moved and evidently ready for reconciliation Not so Edla the long pentup poison of bitterness was boiling up in her 444 Love alone she said  wins return of love That father who gave his child life and did not give it tenderness and does not give it joy has no right to make any claims No right said the President with warmth and too excited to be able to weigh his words  No right But vou you can never be wron you must always he right but it I have no right to claim from you some compliance and obedience I have at least a right to free myself and my house from discomfort and disquiet For the last three years you have not given me one single joyful day  you have yourself evidently shown that you despise your fathers counsel and dislike his house if in future this does not become other than it has been heretofore then it is best thatthat we part  It will then be my affair said Edla coldly and growing pale to give place I shall soon no longer give discomfort or disquiet to any one  She arose laid aside her work and was about to go Count Alarik seised her arm  Child  said he softly no precipitance Miss Edla you are wrong bethink yourself 44 She stopped and looked wildly at him  What shall I do she asked M Yon have been wrong Confess it Beg your fathers forgive neaii M  No I saki abe violently as she sought to disengage her arm bat Count Alarik held it fast and eondncting her aside spoke earnestly to ber in a low voice  The bitterness of dlas life is now converted into a shape of real suffering She tails il and illness brings reflection and new resolves The beaaty of her nature

comfort I did so beforeperhaps  but I have seen I was wrong Remain you wuk your books Edla 44 This moment was decisive I trembled for fear thr Edlas wounded feelings might prevent her from making a new trial on the Presidents heart I feared that this moment would for ever divide father and daughter from each other But Edla drew herself a little farther off and said mildly 4 And if my books

The Professor at the BreakfastTable  with the Story of Iris By Oliver Wendell Holmes Ticknor  Fields London Low  Co Prenticeana or Wit and Humor in Paro graphs By the Editor of the Louisville Journal New York Derby  Jackson London Low  Co Miss Martineau characterized American con versation as prosy rich and droll We I int have been reminded of her epithets by the I to Professors welcome book Dr Holmes I holds a high place in the light literature of  America He is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists There is a raciness in his writing a truth in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what Mrs j da Pringle in Gaits  Ayrshire Legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent With all this The Story of Iris approves Dr Holmes to be an American writerThe number of mysterious girls who figure in Transatlantic fiction is appalling Such a tribe of finehearted poetical only half   understood damsels exists in no old country not even in Germany where young gentlewomen  sad as nightwe hope not  for very wantonnesstoy with fancies of suicide while they are knitting their antimacassarswhere Lotte sitteth with her hand clasped in Jennys during a whole coffeevisit or gardenparty in rapt indifference to the males who stream past in a cloud of smoke  Iris is j ei the Una of the boardinghouse iu which the scene I  of this volume is laidDr Holmes in an jl imaginary character describing himself as also j  a dweller in one of those household societies j  which so far as we can read the riddle imply  companionship without affinityintimacywith i 8 no real confidence Besides the mystery of 18  Iris  who keeps a book tight locked j b which contains some very pleasant verse as  g we shall show his boardinghouse contains t a more dismal curiositya deformed man  b to whom this girl clings with the love of pity  and whose bodily trials end in gradually  engaging for him the sympathy of all his com j 5 Eanions in the house Yet some of these are of  c omespun quality enough for instance the I  young man here to be introduced to the polite reader under the name of  John The young man John asked me to come up one day and try some Old Burbon which lc he said was Al On asking him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that I shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way I followed him to his habitat being very willing  to see in what kind of warren he burrowed and j thinking I might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity Mighty close quarters they were where the young man John bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons or trousers hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them Several prints were pinned up unframedamong them that grand national portraitpiece  Barnum presenting Ossian E Dodge to Jenny Lind and a picture of a famous trot in which 1 admired anew the cabalistic air of that imposing array of expressions and especially the italicized word Dan Mace names b h Major Slocum and  Hiram

statement Do I look as if Id lost much flesh  Bid heanswering my question by another No aid Ifor that matter I think you do credit to the bountifully furnished table of the excellent lady who provides so liberally for the company that meets around her hospitable board The sentence in quotationmarks was from one of those dis interested editorials in small type which I suspect to have been furnished by a friend of the landladys and paid for as an advertisement   It ant the feedsaid the young man Johnits the old womans looks when a fellah lays it in too strong The feeds well enough After geese

you fired em out of a revolver we get hold of all them delicacies of the season But its too much like feedin on live folks and devourin widdahs substance to lay yourself out in the eatin way when a

sharp eye on the chap that carves But when theres anything in the poultry line it Reems to hurt her feelins so to see the knife goin into the breast and joints comin to pieces that theres no comfort in eatin When I cut up an old fowl and help the boarders I always feel as if I ought to say Wont you have a slice of Widdahinstead of chicken The young man John fell into a train of reflections which ended in his producing a Bologna sausage a plate ofcrackers as we Boston folks call certain biscuits and the j bottle of whisky described as being A 1 Under j the influence of the crackers and sausage he grew  cordial and communicative It was time I thought j to sound him as to those of our boarders who had I excited my curiosity What do you think of our young IrisI began Fustrate little fillyho  I

I suppose she s I wouldnt have looked at a fellah like mehe said t I but I come pretty near tryin If she had said  Yes though I shouldnt have known what to do  with her Cant marry a woman nowadays

and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little Johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything It makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt And its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money We return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until Death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the Professors speculations on the same These if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of Dr Holmes when he is bent on philosophizing   I have never yet crossed the threshold of the Little Gentlemans chamber How he lives when he once gets within it I can only guess His horns are late as I have said  often on waking late in the night I see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite If the times of witchcraft were not over I should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises Sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then Occasionally I hear very sweet BtTains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem I have often tried to find out but through the partition I could not be quite sure If I have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing I have heard sounds so like them thatI am a fool to confess itI have covered my head with the bedclothes for I have had a fancy in my dreams that I could hardly shake off when I woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the Little Gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain Of course you dont suppose that I have any foolish superstitions about the matterI the Professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead It is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies A man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much On the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever Bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary November evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it He doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images It is not what we believe as I said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive A principle that reaches a good way if I am not mistaken Here are some verses out of the book of  Iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic UNDER THE VIOLETS Her hands are cold her face is white No more her pulses come and go Her eyes arc shut to life and light Fold the white vesture snow on snow And lay her where the violets blow But not beneath a graven stone To plead for tears with alien eyes A slender cross of wood alone Bhall say that here a maiden lies In peace beneath the peaceful skies And gray old trees of hugest limb Shall wheel their circling shadows round To make the scorching sunlight dim That drinks the greenness from the ground And drop their dead leaves on her mound When oer their boughs the squirrels run And through their leaves the robins call And ripening in the autumn sun The acorns and the chestnuts fall Doubt not that she will heed them all For her the morning choir shall sing Its matins from the branches high And every minstrelvoice of spring That trills beneath the April sky Shall greet her with its earliest cry When turning round their dialtrack Eastward the lengthening shadows pass Her little mourners clad in black The crickets sliding through the grass Shall pipe for her an evening mau At last the rootlets of the trees Shall And the prison where she lies And bear the buried dust they seize In leaves and blossoms to the skies So may the soul that warmed it rise If any born of kindlier blood Should ask What maiden lies below Say only this A tender bud That tried to blossom in the snow Lie3 withered where the violets blow A fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round tho breakfast  table of the Transatlantic Mrs Todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse The book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain Mr Prentice is a humorist of a different kind from Dr Holmes He is a painfully diffident American editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty For something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals He has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men Some of them he says made the Louisville Journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature One merit of the collection in Mr Prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself Thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity American museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the Yankee Yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of George Frederick Cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of Prentices head and its contents when he was young Of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings PrenticeYorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing The world had its Menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other Anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed Nowadays the initiation has been made in the States for a man to read his own Ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic Figaro  Que les gens desprit sont betes I In all the Anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine The flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest Not of these are the Prentice sayings They were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former Thus Mr Prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning He maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of Dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august Louisville Olympus  To express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes I have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest Mr Prentices own description will thus best characterize the manner of his wit Give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  This process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the Guepes of M Alphonso Karr Bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master The following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith Here are halfadozen of the smart things whichthe author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  The editor of theasks if he shall write our life Exactly as he pleases Perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  The Louisville Democrat announces the melancholy fact that Gen Cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass Does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  A lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  The earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  An editor in the West boasts that his enemies will find him  a young David Very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaimGoliar Several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of Mt Vernon Ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon Washingtons  We know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort Her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds The playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   Yesterday the junior editor of the Democrat called upon the senior editor of the Journal to welcome him back to Kentucky The senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  To sit in To tumble out of which he did without an effort No bones broken andmatters compromisedLouisville Democrat Well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon If you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down These folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  The editor of the New Hampshire Patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives Ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire The editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less We believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges He prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  The editor of the SouUiern Democrat wants to know what makes us so smart If we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it A democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down No doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well The subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit An English paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the Princess Royal of England on her late weddingday We are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not The richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either There are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the Republican wit for the unchivalrous Irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour Here are some of them John Mitchel says in his Southern CiiizenthsX this country  needs a rattling war She certainly does not need any more rattling Irishmen John Mitchel the Irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the Hon John Bell in the US Senate He is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with Macbeth stop that dreadful Bell We thought the quotation was from Othello but they have probably a new Shakspeare in Louisville The sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words Again  John Mitchel who made his escape from Botany Bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  John Mitchel is by this time in Europe We are rid of him If he could have had his way we should Ijave been rid by him The ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   The more our ladies practise walking the more graceful they become in their movements Those ladies acquire the best carriage who dont ride ia one A graceful correctionThe proper study of mankind is womanPunch Woman is certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart Our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive A Kentucky editor says that among other presents the ladies have sometimes given us scissors Oh yes some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors accompanying the gift with the old motto we part to meet again Let those beware who like our ugly neighbour would come between  A Miss Way advertises that she will debate womans rights with a Kentucky lawyer in that city after which she will make a grand balloon ascension from Congo SquareExchange Does she propose to take the Kentucky lawyer up with her Or does she mean to throw him sky high in the argument and then go up after him in her balloon Brigham Young says in one of his late manifestoes that the great resources of Utah are her women It is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi resources The last of the halfdozen and the concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  Oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption With these specimens of the Prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it We will only add that he has annexed a very great number of  Joes committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general ready to take all that is worth having and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employersThe Poet of the Breakfast Table SATURDAY NOVEMBER 2 1872 LITERATURE By Oliver Wendell Holmes Routledge  Sons We have had the Autocrat and the Professor and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the Poet and again instructs the world and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour We cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded It would have been as well perhaps to have ended by a grand display of fireworks but the Poet like the Autocrat and Professor has his own way with his own means and ends tranquilly The BreakfastTable Series is now complete Its fault is its extreme length The Poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closelyprinted pages of prose and verse If he leaves pleasant memories they are also somewhat confused Ne quid nimis is as useful a maxim as Pas trop de zele The Poet gives us too much of one thing and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely that such excess is good for nothing he leaves with his memories of pleasure sensations of fatigue There are fourteen persons at the Breakfast Table The opposite ends are occupied by the Landlady and the Capitalist On one side are the Poet the Scarabee a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined a Man of Letters a Master of Arts a Young Girl who writes stories for periodicals and who is called Scheherazade and the Lady On the other side are Dr B Franklin no connexion with the older owner of the name the Astronomer the Member of the Haouse as the Legislator calls himself the Registrarof Deeds the Salesman and That Boy The lastnamed is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community He turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted though perhaps not so often as he is wanted and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden popgun when people are getting prosy which whether it gives forth only a report or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull is entertaining and neverintrusive quite the contrary In this company the Poet speaks as he likes and makes his companions speak after the same fashionthat is to say after his own humour and not according to their own natures They are however not out of character  but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself he is of course not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries The Poet nevertheless is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings and with doings to match The following are among very numerous examples  It aint just the thing to grease your ex with the ile of vitriol the wheel of progress will soon stick fast if you do Again   It is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle Cotton Mather was miserable all his days I am afraid after that entry in his diary  This day Dr Sewele was chosen President for his piety1 We may observe by the way that there are two prejudices which seem immortal Americans believe that there are no hs in England and Frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs  However we could match the goodlooking Landlady of the Poets boardinghouse from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out with an unmistakable expression conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood to the effect that while there is life there is hope The daughter of this lady is quaintly said to have married well to a member of th3 postmedical profession that namely which deals with the mortal frame after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave Among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the Order of Things and who remarks  I hope to do some sound thinking in Heavenif I ever get there  Fanciful too is the division of onestory twostory and threestory intellects The first is described as a factcollector and nothing more the twostory men are those who compare generalize and reason but the threestory individuals are men of imagination and are farsighted They have skylights over their miuds through which illumination reaches them from Heaven The groundfloor men have only stores of books and cannot be said to know how to use further than lendingthem We approve of the Old Masters criticism on returning from a concert although it seems to have been borrowed I dont like your chopped music any way That woman she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societiesFlorence Nightingale says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks and the music you jpowieZ out isnt Not that exactly but something like it I have been to hear some music pounding After describing the concert with much humour he adds I like to hear a woman sing and I like to hear a fiddle sing but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvilsdont talk to me I know the difference between a bullfrog and a woodthrush and Pop went a small piece of artillery    That Boy was in his seat looking demure enough The Master refers to a line of anxious and conscientious effort which I saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our Great Organthat Himalayan home of Harmony which you are to see and then die if you dont live where you can see and hear it often There is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests namely  I thank God that a great many people believe a great deal more than I do I think when it comes to serious matters I like those who believe more than I do better than those who believe less There is no doubt that this is a general feeling We endorse the sentiment as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words   It is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs if he does it so that others may make anything out of it If he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists he may as well let it alone In quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the Breakfast Table we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water Nevertheless the smoothness polish and cleanliness of the pebble after all indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly and that it may be good to taste now and then but not altogether to drink by pailfuls or to live upon to the exclusion of other liquids The character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the Young Girl who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper the Weekly Bucket which has no bottom and it is her business to fill it The poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions passions mysteries plots and graces of style in stories always ending and always beginning for the wages of a maidofallwork and no recognition or thanks from the public   Poor little body poor little mind  poor little soul She ia one of that great company of delicate intelligent emotional young creatures who are waiting like that sail I spoke of for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms love the right of every woman and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench a chain to fasten them to it and a heavy oar to pull day and night The Poet thinks the toiling Scheherazade of the Weekly Bucket never had a lover  or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion  as she does in a fantasia from a story of hers The SunWorshippers Daughter which she wrote for the Bucket Here is a sample  Kiss mine eyelids beauteous Morn Blushing into life newborn  Lend me violets for my hair And thy russet robe to wear And thy ring of rosiest hue Set in drops of diamond dew  Kiss my lips thou Lord of Light Kips my lips a soft Good Night Westward sinks thy golden car  Leave me but the evening star And my solace that shall be Borrowing all its light from thee  We may now rise from the Breakfast Table leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at that wellfurnished board,biography
The Professor at the BreakfastTable  with the Story of Iris By Oliver Wendell Holmes Ticknor  Fields London Low  Co Prenticeana or Wit and Humor in Paro graphs By the Editor of the Louisville Journal New York Derby  Jackson London Low  Co Miss Martineau characterized American con versation as prosy rich and droll We I int have been reminded of her epithets by the I to Professors welcome book Dr Holmes I holds a high place in the light literature of  America He is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists There is a raciness in his writing a truth in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what Mrs j da Pringle in Gaits  Ayrshire Legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent With all this The Story of Iris approves Dr Holmes to be an American writerThe number of mysterious girls who figure in Transatlantic fiction is appalling Such a tribe of finehearted poetical only half   understood damsels exists in no old country not even in Germany where young gentlewomen  sad as nightwe hope not  for very wantonnesstoy with fancies of suicide while they are knitting their antimacassarswhere Lotte sitteth with her hand clasped in Jennys during a whole coffeevisit or gardenparty in rapt indifference to the males who stream past in a cloud of smoke  Iris is j ei the Una of the boardinghouse iu which the scene I  of this volume is laidDr Holmes in an jl imaginary character describing himself as also j  a dweller in one of those household societies j  which so far as we can read the riddle imply  companionship without affinityintimacywith i 8 no real confidence Besides the mystery of 18  Iris  who keeps a book tight locked j b which contains some very pleasant verse as  g we shall show his boardinghouse contains t a more dismal curiositya deformed man  b to whom this girl clings with the love of pity  and whose bodily trials end in gradually  engaging for him the sympathy of all his com j 5 Eanions in the house Yet some of these are of  c omespun quality enough for instance the I  young man here to be introduced to the polite reader under the name of  John The young man John asked me to come up one day and try some Old Burbon which lc he said was Al On asking him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that I shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way I followed him to his habitat being very willing  to see in what kind of warren he burrowed and j thinking I might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity Mighty close quarters they were where the young man John bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons or trousers hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them Several prints were pinned up unframedamong them that grand national portraitpiece  Barnum presenting Ossian E Dodge to Jenny Lind and a picture of a famous trot in which 1 admired anew the cabalistic air of that imposing array of expressions and especially the italicized word Dan Mace names b h Major Slocum and  Hiram Woodruff nam es g m Lady SmithBest three in five Time 240 246 250   I say Governor broke in the young man Johnthem hossesll stay jest as well if youll only sat down Ive had em this year and they havent stirredHe spoke and handed the chair towards meseating himself at the same time on the end of the bed You have lived in this house some timeI said with a note of interrogation at the end of the statement Do I look as if Id lost much flesh  Bid heanswering my question by another No aid Ifor that matter I think you do credit to the bountifully furnished table of the excellent lady who provides so liberally for the company that meets around her hospitable board The sentence in quotationmarks was from one of those dis interested editorials in small type which I suspect to have been furnished by a friend of the landladys and paid for as an advertisement   It ant the feedsaid the young man Johnits the old womans looks when a fellah lays it in too strong The feeds well enough After geese have got tough  turkeys have got strong V lambs got old n veals pretty nigh beef n sparragrasss growin tall n shm n scattery about the head n green peas are gettin so big n hard theyd be dangerous if you fired em out of a revolver we get hold of all them delicacies of the season But its too much like feedin on live folks and devourin widdahs substance to lay yourself out in the eatin way when a fellahs as hungry as the chap that said a turkey was too much tor one n not enough for two I cant help lookin at the old woman Cornedbeefdays shes tolerable calm Roastindays she worries some n keeps a sharp eye on the chap that carves But when theres anything in the poultry line it Reems to hurt her feelins so to see the knife goin into the breast and joints comin to pieces that theres no comfort in eatin When I cut up an old fowl and help the boarders I always feel as if I ought to say Wont you have a slice of Widdahinstead of chicken The young man John fell into a train of reflections which ended in his producing a Bologna sausage a plate ofcrackers as we Boston folks call certain biscuits and the j bottle of whisky described as being A 1 Under j the influence of the crackers and sausage he grew  cordial and communicative It was time I thought j to sound him as to those of our boarders who had I excited my curiosity What do you think of our young IrisI began Fustrate little fillyho  I saidPootiest and nicest little chap Ive seen I since the schoolmarm left Schoolmaam was a   brownhaired oneeyes coffeecolour This one has i J got winecoloured eyesn thats the reason they i  turn a

Like em bothit ant the  j colour of em makes the goodness Ive been kind j of lonely since schoolmaam went away Used to like to look at her I never said anything particular to her that I remember but1 dont know whether it was the cracker and sausage or that the young fellows feet were treading on tbe hot ashes 1 I of some longing that had not had time to cool b j but his eye glistened aa he stopped I suppose she s I wouldnt have looked at a fellah like mehe said t I but I come pretty near tryin If she had said  Yes though I shouldnt have known what to do  with her Cant marry a woman nowadays till il  youre so deaf you have to cock your head like a e I parrot to hear what she says and so longsighted y j you cant see what she looks like nearer than arnTsn j length Here ia another chance for

marryin ant for them Sometimes a fellah feels lonely and would like to have a nice young woman to tell her how lonely he feels And sometimes a fellah here the young man John looked very confidential and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little Johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything It makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt And its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money We return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until Death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the Professors speculations on the same These if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of Dr Holmes when he is bent on philosophizing   I have never yet crossed the threshold of the Little Gentlemans chamber How he lives when he once gets within it I can only guess His horns are late as I have said  often on waking late in the night I see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite If the times of witchcraft were not over I should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises Sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then Occasionally I hear very sweet BtTains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem I have often tried to find out but through the partition I could not be quite sure If I have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing I have heard sounds so like them thatI am a fool to confess itI have covered my head with the bedclothes for I have had a fancy in my dreams that I could hardly shake off when I woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the Little Gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain Of course you dont suppose that I have any foolish superstitions about the matterI the Professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead It is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies A man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much On the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever Bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary November evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it He doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images It is not what we believe as I said before that frightens us commonly but what we

such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  The Louisville Democrat announces the melancholy fact that Gen Cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass Does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  A lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  The earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  An editor in the West boasts that his enemies will find him  a young David Very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaimGoliar Several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of Mt Vernon Ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon Washingtons  We know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort Her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds The playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   Yesterday the junior editor of the Democrat called upon the senior editor of the Journal to welcome him back to Kentucky The senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  To sit in To tumble out of which he did without an effort No bones broken andmatters compromisedLouisville Democrat Well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon If you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down These folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  The editor of the New Hampshire Patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives Ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire The editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less We believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges He prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  The editor of the SouUiern Democrat wants to know what makes us so smart If we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it A democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down No doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well The subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit An English paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the Princess Royal of England on her late weddingday We are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not The richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either There are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the Republican wit for the unchivalrous Irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour Here are some of them John Mitchel says in his Southern CiiizenthsX this country  needs a rattling war She certainly does not need any more rattling Irishmen John Mitchel the Irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the Hon John Bell in the US Senate He is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with Macbeth stop that dreadful Bell We thought the quotation was from Othello but they have probably a new Shakspeare in Louisville The sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words Again  John Mitchel who made his escape from Botany Bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  John Mitchel is by this time in Europe We are rid of him If he could have had his way we should Ijave been rid by him The ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   The more our ladies practise walking the more graceful they become in their movements Those ladies acquire the best carriage who dont ride ia one A graceful correctionThe proper study of mankind is womanPunch Woman is certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart Our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive A Kentucky editor says that among other presents the ladies have sometimes given us scissors Oh yes some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors accompanying the gift with the old motto we part to meet again Let those beware who like our ugly neighbour would come between  A Miss Way advertises that she will debate womans rights with a Kentucky lawyer in that city after which she will make a grand balloon

concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  Oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption With these specimens of the Prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it We will only add that he has annexed a very great number of  Joes committing

The Professor at the BreakfastTable  with the Story of Iris By Oliver Wendell Holmes Ticknor  Fields London Low  Co Prenticeana or Wit and Humor in Paro graphs By the Editor of the Louisville Journal New York Derby  Jackson London Low  Co Miss Martineau characterized American con versation as prosy rich and droll We I int have been reminded of her epithets by the I to Professors welcome book Dr Holmes I holds a high place in the light literature of  America He is a real humorist in the midst of a bewildering crowd of pretenders and sentimentalists There is a raciness in his writing a truth in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what Mrs j da Pringle in Gaits  Ayrshire Legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent With all this The Story of Iris approves Dr Holmes to be an American writerThe number of mysterious girls who figure in Transatlantic fiction is appalling Such a tribe of finehearted poetical only half   understood damsels exists in no old country not even in Germany where young gentlewomen  sad as nightwe hope not  for very wantonnesstoy with fancies of suicide while they are knitting their antimacassarswhere Lotte sitteth with her hand clasped in Jennys during a whole coffeevisit or gardenparty in rapt indifference to the males who stream past in a cloud of smoke  Iris is j ei the Una of the boardinghouse iu which the scene I  of this volume is laidDr Holmes in an jl imaginary character describing himself as also j  a dweller in one of those household societies j  which so far as we can read the riddle imply  companionship without affinityintimacywith i 8 no real confidence Besides the mystery of 18  Iris  who keeps a book tight locked j b which contains some very pleasant verse as  g we shall show his boardinghouse contains t a more dismal curiositya deformed man  b to whom this girl clings with the love of pity  and whose bodily trials end in gradually  engaging for him the sympathy of all his com j 5 Eanions in the house Yet some of these are of  c omespun quality enough for instance the I  young man here to be introduced to the polite reader under the name of  John The young man John asked me to come up one day and try some Old Burbon which lc he said was Al On asking him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that I shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way I followed him to his habitat being very willing  to see in what kind of warren he burrowed and j thinking I might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity Mighty close quarters they were where the young man John bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons or trousers hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them Several prints were pinned up unframedamong them that grand national portraitpiece  Barnum presenting Ossian E Dodge to Jenny Lind and a picture of a famous trot in which 1 admired anew the cabalistic air of that imposing array of expressions and especially the italicized word Dan Mace names b h Major Slocum and  Hiram Woodruff nam es g m Lady SmithBest three in five Time 240 246 250   I say Governor broke in the young man Johnthem hossesll stay jest as well if youll only sat down Ive had em this year and they havent stirredHe spoke and handed the chair towards meseating himself at the same time on the end of the bed You have lived in this house some timeI said with a note of interrogation at the end of the statement Do I look as if Id lost much flesh  Bid heanswering my question by another No aid Ifor that matter I think you do credit to the bountifully furnished table of the excellent lady who provides so liberally for the company that meets around her hospitable board The sentence in quotationmarks was from one of those dis interested editorials in small type which I suspect to have been furnished by a friend of the landladys and paid for as an advertisement   It ant the feedsaid the young man Johnits the old womans looks when a fellah lays it in too strong The feeds well enough After geese have got tough  turkeys have got strong V lambs got old n veals pretty nigh beef n sparragrasss growin tall n shm n scattery about the head n green peas are gettin so big n hard theyd be dangerous if you fired em out of a revolver we get hold of all them delicacies of the season But its too much like feedin on live folks and devourin widdahs substance to lay yourself out in the eatin way when a fellahs as hungry as the chap that said a turkey was too much tor one n not enough for two I cant help lookin at the old woman Cornedbeefdays shes tolerable calm Roastindays she worries some n keeps a sharp eye on the chap that carves But when theres anything in the poultry line it Reems to hurt her feelins so to see the knife goin into the breast and joints comin to pieces that theres no comfort in eatin When I cut up an old fowl and help the boarders I always feel as if I ought to say Wont you have a slice of Widdahinstead of chicken The young man John fell into a train of reflections which ended in his producing a Bologna sausage a plate ofcrackers as we Boston folks call certain biscuits and the j bottle of whisky described as being A 1 Under j the influence of the crackers and sausage he grew  cordial and communicative It was time I thought j to sound him as to those of our boarders who had I excited my curiosity What do you think of our young IrisI began Fustrate little fillyho  I

Like em bothit ant the  j colour of em makes the goodness Ive been kind j of lonely since schoolmaam went away Used to like to look at her I never said anything particular to her that I remember but1

I suppose she s I wouldnt have looked at a fellah like mehe said t I but I come pretty near tryin If she had said  Yes though I shouldnt have known what to do  with her Cant marry a woman nowadays

marryin ant for them Sometimes a fellah feels lonely and would like to have a nice young woman to tell her how lonely he feels And sometimes a fellah here the young man John looked very confidential and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little Johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything It makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt And its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money We return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until Death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the Professors speculations on the same These if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of Dr Holmes when he is bent on philosophizing   I have never yet crossed the threshold of the Little Gentlemans chamber How he lives when he once gets within it I can only guess His horns are late as I have said  often on waking late in the night I see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite If the times of witchcraft were not over I should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises Sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then Occasionally I hear very sweet BtTains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem I have often tried to find out but through the partition I could not be quite sure If I have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing I have heard sounds so like them thatI am a fool to confess itI have covered my head with the bedclothes for I have had a fancy in my dreams that I could hardly shake off when I woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the Little Gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain Of course you dont suppose that I have any foolish superstitions about the matterI the Professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead It is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies A man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much On the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever Bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary November evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it He doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images It is not what we believe as I said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive A principle that reaches a good way if I am not mistaken Here are some verses out of the book of  Iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic UNDER THE VIOLETS Her hands are cold her face is white No more her pulses come and go Her eyes arc shut to life and light Fold the white vesture snow on snow And lay her where the violets blow But not beneath a graven stone To plead for tears with alien eyes A slender cross of wood alone Bhall say that here a maiden lies In peace beneath the peaceful skies And gray old trees of hugest limb Shall wheel their circling shadows round To make the scorching sunlight dim That drinks the greenness from the ground And drop their dead leaves on her mound When oer their boughs the squirrels run And through their leaves the robins call And ripening in the autumn sun The acorns and the chestnuts fall Doubt not that she will heed them all For her the morning choir shall sing Its matins from the branches high And every minstrelvoice of spring That trills beneath the April sky Shall greet her with its earliest cry When turning round their dialtrack Eastward the lengthening shadows pass Her little mourners clad in black The crickets sliding through the grass Shall pipe for her an evening mau At last the rootlets of the trees Shall And the prison where she lies And bear the buried dust they seize In leaves and blossoms to the skies So may the soul that warmed it rise If any born of kindlier blood Should ask What maiden lies below Say only this A tender bud That tried to blossom in the snow Lie3 withered where the violets blow A fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round tho breakfast  table of the Transatlantic Mrs Todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse The book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain Mr Prentice is a humorist of a different kind from Dr Holmes He is a painfully diffident American editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty For something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals He has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men Some of them he says made the Louisville Journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature One merit of the collection in Mr Prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself Thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity American museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the Yankee Yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of George Frederick Cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of Prentices head and its contents when he was young Of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings PrenticeYorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing The world had its Menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other Anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed Nowadays the initiation has been made in the States for a man to read his own Ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic Figaro  Que les gens desprit sont betes I In all the Anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine The flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest Not of these are the Prentice sayings They were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former Thus Mr Prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning He maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of Dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august Louisville Olympus  To express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes I have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest Mr Prentices own description will thus best characterize the manner of his wit Give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  This process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the Guepes of M Alphonso Karr Bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master The following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith Here are halfadozen of

appropriator or his employersThe Poet of the Breakfast Table SATURDAY NOVEMBER 2 1872 LITERATURE By Oliver Wendell Holmes Routledge  Sons We have had the Autocrat and the Professor and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the Poet and again instructs the world and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour We cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded It would have been as well perhaps to have ended by a grand display of fireworks but the Poet like the Autocrat and Professor has his own way with his own means and ends tranquilly The BreakfastTable Series is now complete Its fault is its extreme length The Poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closelyprinted pages of prose and verse If he leaves pleasant memories they are also somewhat confused Ne quid nimis is as useful a maxim as Pas trop de zele The Poet gives us too much of one thing and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely that such excess is good for nothing he leaves with his memories of pleasure sensations of fatigue There are fourteen persons at the Breakfast Table The opposite ends are occupied by the Landlady and the Capitalist On one side are the Poet the Scarabee a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined a Man of Letters a Master of Arts a Young Girl who writes stories for periodicals and who is called Scheherazade and the Lady On the other side are Dr B Franklin no connexion with the older owner of the name the Astronomer the Member of the Haouse as the Legislator calls himself the Registrarof Deeds the Salesman and That Boy The lastnamed is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community He turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted though perhaps not so often as he is wanted and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden popgun when people are getting prosy which whether it gives forth only a report or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull is entertaining and neverintrusive quite the contrary In this company the Poet speaks as he likes and makes his companions speak after the same fashionthat is to say after his own humour and not according to their own natures They are however not out of character  but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself he is of course not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries The Poet nevertheless is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings and with doings to match The following are among very numerous examples  It aint just the thing to grease your ex with the ile of vitriol the wheel of progress will soon stick fast if you do Again   It is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle Cotton Mather was miserable all his days I am afraid after that entry in his diary  This day Dr Sewele was chosen President for his piety1 We may observe by the way that there are two prejudices which seem immortal Americans believe that there are no hs in England and Frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs  However we could match the goodlooking Landlady of the Poets boardinghouse from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out with an unmistakable expression conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood to the effect that while there is life there is hope The daughter of this lady is quaintly said to have married well to a member of th3 postmedical profession that namely which deals with the mortal frame after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave Among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the Order of Things and who remarks  I hope to do some sound thinking in Heavenif I ever get there  Fanciful too is the division of onestory twostory and threestory intellects The first is described as a factcollector and nothing more the twostory men are those who compare generalize and reason but the threestory individuals are men of imagination and are farsighted They have skylights over their miuds through which illumination reaches them from Heaven The groundfloor men have only stores of books and cannot be said to know how to use further than lendingthem We approve of the Old Masters criticism on returning from a concert although it seems to have been borrowed I dont like your chopped music any way That woman she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societiesFlorence Nightingale says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks and the music you jpowieZ out isnt Not that exactly but something like it I have been to hear some music pounding After describing the concert with much humour he adds I like to hear a woman sing and I like to hear a fiddle sing but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvilsdont talk to me I know the difference between a bullfrog and a woodthrush and Pop went a small piece of artillery    That Boy was in his seat looking demure enough The Master refers to a line of anxious and conscientious effort which I saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our Great Organthat Himalayan home of Harmony which you are to see and then die if you dont live where you can see and hear it often There is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests namely  I thank God that a great many people believe a great deal more than I do I think when it comes to serious matters I like those who believe more than I do better than those who believe less There is no doubt that this is a general feeling We endorse the sentiment as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words   It is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs if he does it so that others may make anything out of it If he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists he may as well let it alone In quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the Breakfast Table we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water Nevertheless the smoothness polish and cleanliness of the pebble after all indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly and that it may be good to taste now and then but not altogether to drink by pailfuls or to live upon to the exclusion of other liquids The character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the Young Girl who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper the Weekly Bucket which has no bottom and it is her business to fill it The poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions passions mysteries plots and graces of style in stories always ending and always beginning for the wages of a maidofallwork and no recognition or thanks from the public   Poor little body poor little mind  poor little soul She ia one of that great company of delicate intelligent emotional young creatures who are waiting like that sail I spoke of for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms love the right of every woman and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench a chain to fasten them to it and a heavy oar to pull day and night The Poet thinks the toiling Scheherazade of the Weekly Bucket never had a lover  or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion  as she does in a fantasia from a story of hers The SunWorshippers Daughter which she wrote for the Bucket Here is a sample  Kiss mine eyelids beauteous Morn Blushing into life newborn  Lend me violets for my hair And thy russet robe to wear And thy ring of rosiest hue Set in drops of diamond dew  Kiss my lips thou Lord of Light Kips my lips a soft Good Night Westward sinks thy golden car  Leave me but the evening star And my solace that shall be Borrowing all its light from thee  We may now rise from the Breakfast Table leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at that wellfurnished board,biography

in his feeling which set him apart 1 from that herd of faded and flippant writers n who dress up their periods with what Mrs j da Pringle in Gaits  Ayrshire Legatees called i he gumflowers and who when they most to pretend to spirits are only the most feebly impertinent With all this The Story of Iris approves Dr Holmes to be an American writerThe number of mysterious girls who figure in Transatlantic fiction is appalling Such a tribe of finehearted poetical only half   understood damsels exists in no old country not even in Germany where young gentlewomen  sad as nightwe hope not  for very wantonnesstoy with fancies of suicide while they are knitting their antimacassarswhere Lotte sitteth with her hand clasped in Jennys during a whole coffeevisit or gardenparty in rapt indifference to the males who stream past in a cloud of smoke  Iris is j ei the Una of the boardinghouse iu which the scene I  of this volume is laidDr Holmes in an jl imaginary character describing himself as also j  a dweller in one of those household societies j  which so far as we can read the riddle imply  companionship without affinityintimacywith i 8 no real confidence Besides the mystery of 18  Iris  who keeps a book tight locked j b which contains some very pleasant verse as  g we shall show his boardinghouse contains t a more dismal curiositya deformed man  b to whom this girl clings with the love of pity  and whose bodily trials end in gradually  engaging for him the sympathy of all his com j 5 Eanions in the house Yet some of these are of  c omespun quality enough for instance the I  young man here to be introduced to the polite reader under the name of  John The young man John asked me to come up one day and try some Old Burbon which lc he said was Al On asking him what was  t the nmnber of his room he answered that it was 1i fortyleven sky parlour floor but that I shouldnt   find it if he didnt go ahead to show me the way I followed him to his habitat being very willing  to see in what kind of warren he burrowed and j thinking I might pick up something about the boarders who had excited my curiosity Mighty close quarters they were where the young man John bestowed himself and his furniture  this last consisting of a bed a chair a bureau a trunk and numerous pegs with coats and pants and  vestsas he was in the habit of calling waistcoats and pantaloons or trousers hanging up as if the owner had melted out of them Several prints were pinned up unframedamong them that grand national portraitpiece  Barnum presenting Ossian E Dodge to Jenny Lind and a picture of a famous trot in which 1 admired anew the cabalistic air of that imposing array of expressions and especially the italicized word Dan Mace names b h Major Slocum and  Hiram

statement Do I look as if Id lost much flesh  Bid heanswering my question by another No aid Ifor that matter I think you do credit to the bountifully furnished table of the excellent lady who provides so liberally for the company that meets around her hospitable board The sentence in quotationmarks was from one of those dis interested editorials in small type which I suspect to have been furnished by a friend of the landladys and paid for as an advertisement   It ant the feedsaid the young man Johnits the old womans looks when a fellah lays it in too strong The feeds well enough After geese

you fired em out of a revolver we get hold of all them delicacies of the season But its too much like feedin on live folks and devourin widdahs substance to lay yourself out in the eatin way when a

in eatin When I cut up an old fowl and help the boarders I always feel as if I ought to say Wont you have a slice of Widdahinstead of chicken The young man John fell into a train of reflections which ended in his producing a Bologna sausage a plate ofcrackers as we Boston folks call certain biscuits and the j bottle of whisky described as being A 1 Under j the influence of the crackers and sausage he grew  cordial and communicative It was time I thought j to sound him as to those of our boarders who had I excited my curiosity What do you think of our young IrisI began Fustrate little fillyho  I

and perhaps as if a little ashamed of his weakness sometimes a fellah would like to have one of them small young ones to trot on his knee and push about in a little wagona kind of a little Johnny you knowits odd enough but it seema to me nobody can afford them little articles except the folks that are so rich they can buy everything and the folka that are so poor they dont want anything It makes nice boya of us young fellahs no doubt And its pleasant to see fine young girls sittin like shopkeepers behind their goods waitin waitin and waitin n no customersand the men lingerin round and lookin at the goods like folks that want to be customers but havnt got the money We return to the deformed gentleman into whose chamber it was impossible for prying strangers to penetrate until Death opened the doorthat we may mention some unaccountable noises in his room and the Professors speculations on the same These if not wholly new are neatly put and give a fair idea of Dr Holmes when he is bent on philosophizing   I have never yet crossed the threshold of the Little Gentlemans chamber How he lives when he once gets within it I can only guess His horns are late as I have said  often on waking late in the night I see the light through cracks in his windowshutters on the wall of the house opposite If the times of witchcraft were not over I should be afraid to be so close a neighbour to a place from which there come such strange noises Sometimes it is the dragging of something heavy over the floor that makes me shiver to hear itit sounds so like what people that kill other people have to do now and then Occasionally I hear very sweet BtTains of musicwhether of a wind or stringed instrument or a human voice strange as it may seem I have often tried to find out but through the partition I could not be quite sure If I have not heard a woman cry and moan and then again laugh as though she would die laughing I have heard sounds so like them thatI am a fool to confess itI have covered my head with the bedclothes for I have had a fancy in my dreams that I could hardly shake off when I woke up about that socalled witch that was bia greatgrandmother or whatever it wasa sort of fancy that she visited the Little Gentleman  a young woman in oldfashioned dress with a red ring round her white necknot a necklace but a dull stain Of course you dont suppose that I have any foolish superstitions about the matterI the Professor who have seen enough to take all that nonsense out of any mans bead It is not our beliefs that frighten us half to much as our fancies A man not only believes but knows he runs a risk whenever he steps into a railroad car but it doesnt worry him much On the other hand carry that man across a pasture a little way from some dreary countryvillage and show him an old house where there were strange deaths a good many years ago and there are rumours of ugly spots on the wallsthe old man hung himself in the garret that is certain and ever Bincethe countrypeople have called it the haunted house the owners havent been able to let it since the last tenants left on account of the noisesso it has fallen into sad decay and the moss grows on the rotten shingles of the roof and the clapboards have turned black and the windows rattle like teeth that chatter with fear and the walls of the house begin to lean as if its knees were shakingtake the man who didnt mind the real risk of the cars to that old house on some dreary November evening and ask him to sleep there alonehow do you think he will like it He doesnt believe one word of ghostsbut then he knows that whether waking or sleeping his imagination will people the haunted chambers with ghostly images It is not what we believe as I said before that frightens us commonly but what we conceive A principle that reaches a good way if I am not mistaken Here are some verses out of the book of  Iris which are more than ordinarily graceful and pathetic UNDER THE VIOLETS Her hands are cold her face is white No more her pulses come and go Her eyes arc shut to life and light Fold the white vesture snow on snow And lay her where the violets blow But not beneath a graven stone To plead for tears with alien eyes A slender cross of wood alone Bhall say that here a maiden lies In peace beneath the peaceful skies And gray old trees of hugest limb Shall wheel their circling shadows round To make the scorching sunlight dim That drinks the greenness from the ground And drop their dead leaves on her mound When oer their boughs the squirrels run And through their leaves the robins call And ripening in the autumn sun The acorns and the chestnuts fall Doubt not that she will heed them all For her the morning choir shall sing Its matins from the branches high And every minstrelvoice of spring That trills beneath the April sky Shall greet her with its earliest cry When turning round their dialtrack Eastward the lengthening shadows pass Her little mourners clad in black The crickets sliding through the grass Shall pipe for her an evening mau At last the rootlets of the trees Shall And the prison where she lies And bear the buried dust they seize In leaves and blossoms to the skies So may the soul that warmed it rise If any born of kindlier blood Should ask What maiden lies below Say only this A tender bud That tried to blossom in the snow Lie3 withered where the violets blow A fairer impression will be derived from the above scattered extracts than from any continuous attempt to sketch the persons gathered round tho breakfast  table of the Transatlantic Mrs Todgers or to reveal what untied the knot and cleared up the mysteries of the boardinghouse The book will not be read for its narrative but it may be taken up again and again and its pages paused over for the enjoyment of the pleasant touches and suggestive passages which they contain Mr Prentice is a humorist of a different kind from Dr Holmes He is a painfully diffident American editor one of a class distinguished for their modesty For something like thirty years ho has been writing paragraphs for transatlantic newspapers living thus before the public in the columns of those journals He has collected them allto forestall others in doing sonot because he thinks such collections praiseworthy at least by other men Some of them he says made the Louisville Journal famous or at any rate notorious and were exceedingly offensive to individuals whose feelings are now spared by change of nomenclature One merit of the collection in Mr Prentices eyes seems to consist in the alleged circumstance that the items are all his own original  representing the editor himself Thus he embalms as it were some years of his life for the enjoyment of contemporaries and posterity American museums may exhibit in after years the skull of the Yankee Yorick or lend it out to evening parties as was done with that of George Frederick Cooke but the holders of this volume may always boast of being in possession of Prentices head and its contents when he was young Of the more youthful head with its quips and sharp sayings PrenticeYorick is manifestly proud albeit he claps his hands over his face and tells you he is blushing The world had its Menagiana after the wit was dead and half a hundred other Anas when the humorists were shrouded and entombed Nowadays the initiation has been made in the States for a man to read his own Ana set up his own statue chiselled by himself burn incense to and under his own nose and to cause to be applied to himself the celebrated apophthegm of the philosophic Figaro  Que les gens desprit sont betes I In all the Anas hitherto published the enjoyment yielded by them consists in the circumstance that the wit is at least genuine The flashes are those of a thundercloud the coruscations are of the playful summer lightning  spontaneous bright effects of natural causeswords that burn titterings among contending wits where there was a hearty cudgelling of brains and the hardest hits were returned with compound interest Not of these are the Prentice sayings They were composed or invented by elaborate process the joke not being the consequent ot a pre cedent but this latter being made for the sake of the former Thus Mr Prentice gives us frequently only bottled lightning He maintains nevertheless with all the pertinacity of Dennis that his thunder is still a genuine production from the august Louisville Olympus  To express a thought or a fancy or a conceit moro conveniently says the transoceanic joker of jokes I have put the words into the form of a dialogue purporting sometimes to be between two politicians sometimes a man and his wife but such paragraphs are not less my own nor less original than the rest Mr Prentices own description will thus best characterize the manner of his wit Give him his timeonly let him thinkand at a retort you shall find him the readiest fellow possible if you will only have patience  This process can indeed be pursued without the elabora tion being apparent and if the author of this volume be inclined to improve  his prentice han in this respect we cannot do better than refer him to the Guepes of M Alphonso Karr Bad however as some of these jokes are that same prentice han is not altogether unskilfulthough thirty years of use has failed to make the owner of it a master The following specimens will show the merits rather than the demerits of the work and at the same time will yet serve to prove that our strictures are made in good faith Here are halfadozen of the smart things whichthe author deems worthy of handing down to posterity  The editor of theasks if he shall write our life Exactly as he pleases Perhaps he would be quite as well employed in writing such a life as oura as iu living such a one as his own  The Louisville Democrat announces the melancholy fact that Gen Cass has been slain  by the jawbone of an ass Does our sly neighbour mean to insinuate that the general has talked himself to death  A lady may give her husband a piece of her mind if she chooses but she shouldnt break the peace  The earth is a tender and kind mother to the husbandman and yet at one season he always harrows her bosom and at another plucks her ears  An editor in the West boasts that his enemies will find him  a young David Very few read his paper without feeling disposed to exclaimGoliar Several graceless fellows have written their names upon the tomb of Mt Vernon Ah ye miscreants the world would rather see your names upon your own tombs than upon Washingtons  We know a beautiful girl who would prove a capital speculation for a fortunehunter of the right sort Her voice is of silver her hair of gold her teeth of pearl her cheeks of rubies and her eyes of diamonds The playfulness of local editors seems to be of an elephantine quality  for instance   Yesterday the junior editor of the Democrat called upon the senior editor of the Journal to welcome him back to Kentucky The senior aforesaid gave the junior aforementioned a chairfull grown minus two legsto sit in  To sit in To tumble out of which he did without an effort No bones broken andmatters compromisedLouisville Democrat Well you and the chair had four legs between you which certainly should have been enough to stand upon If you insist that we gave you the fall you must at least admit in justice to our magnanimity that we didnt hit you after you were down These folks are more amusing when they are downright quarrelling  The editor of the New Hampshire Patriot says that he expects to grow fat as long as he lives Ah yes but when he dies will not the fat be all in the fire The editor of thesays he almost scorns to deny our charges they are so utterly ground less We believe he generally scorns to deny  groundless charges He prefers confining himaf to the denial of true ones  The editor of the SouUiern Democrat wants to know what makes us so smart If we are smart it must be for the same reason that he is so stupid cant help it A democratic paper asks us to tell why its party is generally up and ours down No doubt for the same reason that the empty bucket is generally at the top of the well The subjoined is a sample of the deliberatelyinvented jokewhere there is a lack of truth as well as of wit An English paper says that a superbly oma mented whip was one of the presents made to the Princess Royal of England on her late weddingday We are not told whether the bridegroom upon the making of that suspicious present to his royal bride looked scared or not The richest part of the whip was the buttso we presume she will give her spouse the other end if either There are numerous paragraphs which exhibit the dislike of the Republican wit for the unchivalrous Irish leader who to escape from captivity broke his plighted word of honour Here are some of them John Mitchel says in his Southern CiiizenthsX this country  needs a rattling war She certainly does not need any more rattling Irishmen John Mitchel the Irishman is anxious that something should be done immediately to stop the free speech of the Hon John Bell in the US Senate He is not the only political miscreant disposed to cry out with Macbeth stop that dreadful Bell We thought the quotation was from Othello but they have probably a new Shakspeare in Louisville The sarcasm would have lost nothing by a more accurate quotation of the words Again  John Mitchel who made his escape from Botany Bay should remember that wheu he abuse fugitive slaves he abuses himself  John Mitchel is by this time in Europe We are rid of him If he could have had his way we should Ijave been rid by him The ladies of course come in for a large share of our wits notice   The more our ladies practise walking the more graceful they become in their movements Those ladies acquire the best carriage who dont ride ia one A graceful correctionThe proper study of mankind is womanPunch Woman is certainly wonderfully constructed we have always loved to study her and get her by heart Our first lessons were delightful but the maturer philosophy is sublimely grand and expansive A Kentucky editor says that among other presents the ladies have sometimes given us scissors Oh yes some of them have given us pretty pairs of scissors accompanying the gift with the old motto we part to meet again Let those beware who like our ugly neighbour would come between  A Miss Way advertises that she will debate womans rights with a Kentucky lawyer in that city after which she will make a grand balloon ascension from Congo SquareExchange Does she propose to take the Kentucky lawyer up with her Or does she mean to throw him sky high in the argument and then go up after him in her balloon Brigham Young says in one of his late manifestoes that the great resources of Utah are her women It is very evident that the prophet is disposed to husband hi resources The last of the halfdozen and the concluding maxim in the book may be profitably read on both sides of the water  Oftentimes the  fastest young women an th most easily overtaken by the galloping consumption With these specimens of the Prenticeana our readers may gather some idea of the wit alive beyond the ocean and how it is appreciated by the maker of it We will only add that he has annexed a very great number of  Joes committing this nefarious offence with all the unscrupulousness of a buccaneer general ready to take all that is worth having and vociferous in his assertions that all was the original property of the appropriator or his employersThe Poet of the Breakfast Table SATURDAY NOVEMBER 2 1872 LITERATURE By Oliver Wendell Holmes Routledge  Sons We have had the Autocrat and the Professor and now the author adopts the dress and properties of the Poet and again instructs the world and amuses himself by manifestations of his humour We cannot say that the third venture is better than those by which it was preceded It would have been as well perhaps to have ended by a grand display of fireworks but the Poet like the Autocrat and Professor has his own way with his own means and ends tranquilly The BreakfastTable Series is now complete Its fault is its extreme length The Poet alone furnishes nearly four hundred closelyprinted pages of prose and verse If he leaves pleasant memories they are also somewhat confused Ne quid nimis is as useful a maxim as Pas trop de zele The Poet gives us too much of one thing and though he does not illustrate the wise proverb completely that such excess is good for nothing he leaves with his memories of pleasure sensations of fatigue There are fourteen persons at the Breakfast Table The opposite ends are occupied by the Landlady and the Capitalist On one side are the Poet the Scarabee a naturalist whose researches into animal nature are rather confined a Man of Letters a Master of Arts a Young Girl who writes stories for periodicals and who is called Scheherazade and the Lady On the other side are Dr B Franklin no connexion with the older owner of the name the Astronomer the Member of the Haouse as the Legislator calls himself the Registrarof Deeds the Salesman and That Boy The lastnamed is by no means the least important or the least amusing member of the community He turns up in conversation or mischief just when he is wanted though perhaps not so often as he is wanted and he has a way of firing a pellet from a hidden popgun when people are getting prosy which whether it gives forth only a report or the pellet reaches the nose of the person who is growing dull is entertaining and neverintrusive quite the contrary In this company the Poet speaks as he likes and makes his companions speak after the same fashionthat is to say after his own humour and not according to their own natures They are however not out of character  but where a man has the argument on both sides to himself he is of course not likely to be beaten by the logic provided by himself for his adversaries The Poet nevertheless is not illiberal in furnishing them with characteristic sayings and with doings to match The following are among very numerous examples  It aint just the thing to grease your ex with the ile of vitriol the wheel of progress will soon stick fast if you do Again   It is a common weakness enough to wish to find ourselves in an empty saddle Cotton Mather was miserable all his days I am afraid after that entry in his diary  This day Dr Sewele was chosen President for his piety1 We may observe by the way that there are two prejudices which seem immortal Americans believe that there are no hs in England and Frenchmen will assert that there is nothing but fogs  However we could match the goodlooking Landlady of the Poets boardinghouse from under whose smart cap the grey curls come out with an unmistakable expression conveyed in the hieratic language of the feminine priesthood to the effect that while there is life there is hope The daughter of this lady is quaintly said to have married well to a member of th3 postmedical profession that namely which deals with the mortal frame after the practitioners of the healing art have done with it and taken their leave Among the speculative persons is one who applies himself to the wide consideration of the Order of Things and who remarks  I hope to do some sound thinking in Heavenif I ever get there  Fanciful too is the division of onestory twostory and threestory intellects The first is described as a factcollector and nothing more the twostory men are those who compare generalize and reason but the threestory individuals are men of imagination and are farsighted They have skylights over their miuds through which illumination reaches them from Heaven The groundfloor men have only stores of books and cannot be said to know how to use further than lendingthem We approve of the Old Masters criticism on returning from a concert although it seems to have been borrowed I dont like your chopped music any way That woman she had more sense in her little finger than forty medical societiesFlorence Nightingale says that the music you pour out is good for sick folks and the music you jpowieZ out isnt Not that exactly but something like it I have been to hear some music pounding After describing the concert with much humour he adds I like to hear a woman sing and I like to hear a fiddle sing but these noises they hammer out of their wood and ivory anvilsdont talk to me I know the difference between a bullfrog and a woodthrush and Pop went a small piece of artillery    That Boy was in his seat looking demure enough The Master refers to a line of anxious and conscientious effort which I saw not long since on the forehead of one of the sweetest and truest singers who has visited us the same which is so striking on the masks of singing women carved upon the facade of our Great Organthat Himalayan home of Harmony which you are to see and then die if you dont live where you can see and hear it often There is deeper philosophy and undeniable truth in the remark of another of the guests namely  I thank God that a great many people believe a great deal more than I do I think when it comes to serious matters I like those who believe more than I do better than those who believe less There is no doubt that this is a general feeling We endorse the sentiment as we do another conveyed in the following pithy words   It is a great thing for a man to put the whole meaning of his life into a few paragraphs if he does it so that others may make anything out of it If he conveys his wisdom after the fashion of the old alchemists he may as well let it alone In quoting these samples of sententious wisdom on the part of the guests at the Breakfast Table we are like a person who should show pebbles from a running brook as samples of the quality of the water Nevertheless the smoothness polish and cleanliness of the pebble after all indicate that the brook runs clearly and swiftly and that it may be good to taste now and then but not altogether to drink by pailfuls or to live upon to the exclusion of other liquids The character that is likely to prove the most attractive is the Young Girl who lives by supplying a story every week to a newspaper the Weekly Bucket which has no bottom and it is her business to fill it The poor thing has to deal in weekly emotions passions mysteries plots and graces of style in stories always ending and always beginning for the wages of a maidofallwork and no recognition or thanks from the public   Poor little body poor little mind  poor little soul She ia one of that great company of delicate intelligent emotional young creatures who are waiting like that sail I spoke of for some breath of heaven to fill their white bosoms love the right of every woman and find that life offers them instead a seat on a wooden bench a chain to fasten them to it and a heavy oar to pull day and night The Poet thinks the toiling Scheherazade of the Weekly Bucket never had a lover  or she would not play so lightly with the firebrands of the great passion  as she does in a fantasia from a story of hers The SunWorshippers Daughter which she wrote for the Bucket Here is a sample  Kiss mine eyelids beauteous Morn Blushing into life newborn  Lend me violets for my hair And thy russet robe to wear And thy ring of rosiest hue Set in drops of diamond dew  Kiss my lips thou Lord of Light Kips my lips a soft Good Night Westward sinks thy golden car  Leave me but the evening star And my solace that shall be Borrowing all its light from thee  We may now rise from the Breakfast Table leaving all to linger there who may have appetite at that wellfurnished board,biography
THE RETURN OF THE NATIVE The Return of tlie Native By Thomas Hardy Smith Elder and Co There are many indolent readers who when they open a novel like to plunge into a lively conversation or an exciting scene at once and lav down the book impatiently if their interest is not aroused on thc very first page To these Mr Hardys book will appear dull because they will not read far enough to be interested But persons of a more patient disposition will be well rewarded for thc task which we are compelled to admit is not quite an easy one of mastering the long descriptions of the groud bonthy furzy briary obsolete country in which the scenes of this story are laid Wc J warn intending readers not to be alarmed at the verbose eccentricity which distinguishes its opening chapters nor to be repelled by the uncouth language often closely verging on coarseness in which the conversation of the natives of Egdon Heath is carried on The obvious imitations of Victor Hugo are confined to the opening chapters or at any rate reappear only at rare intervals throughout the work while the intimate acquaintance with and real affection for the suiToundings of his tale displayed by the author almost reconcile one to the repeated and prolonged emphasis with which he dwells on them The book is not crowded with characters as is too often the case in modern novels Only three women Mrs Yeobright her niece Thomasin and Eustacia Wye and three men Wildeve young Yeobright and the Reddleman have anything to do with the development of the drama Of course there are other characters but although some like Christians are fresh well drawn and very amusing they play no part whatever and only serve to fill up the background The result of the skilful handling of these few persons is a concentration of interest steadily increasing tc wards the middle of the third volume after which unfortunately the sudden and unexpected removal of the two most interesting because most inexplicable actors leaves the stage blank and bare It is not usual for authors to kill off half their dramatis personce long before the book ends But from Mr Hardy we cannot expect anything usual on the contrary the originality and freshness of the work is such that these very qualities at first prevent our perceiving its full strength When after eleven months in London we first reach a remote Alpine valley surrounded by weird rocks and cold glaciers the strangeness of our surroundings will for a few hours not allow us to enjoy their full beauty So it is with the  Return of the Native There is no heroine in it and nobody at all like anybody of whom we have read before Nor is there as far as we can make out any hero One wedding takes place in the first volume another in the second and a third at the end of the book but the first two are not at all satisfactory and we suspect that no one will care much about the third The Reddleman who acts throughout as the deus ex machind is apart from his redness which is inseparable from his business of selling dye the only character whom we think we have met before under the garb of a supernaturally intelligent amateur detective We do not propose spoiling the pleasure which attaches to the unknown and unexpected by betraying the plot but it may fairly be objected to the slender framework of the tale that if its conclusion had been pleasanter it would have lost none of its interest and would have been a great deal more satisfactory It appears to us that Mr Hardy had gradually become tired of working out the singular characters of Eustacia and Wildeve and not seeing how to get them out of the inevitable mess into which no unnatural events but their own innate weakness brought them had killed them off to get rid of the difficulty Such an expedient if expedient it be is unworthy of the author and we are convinced that a little more patieuce would have been well bestowed on the third volume Again Clyni hardly betrays his tendencies with sufficient explicitness to permit us to feel that the course of life he at last adopts is quite natural notwithstanding our sympathy both with him and with his lofty aim we feel that he was made for something greater if not better And the interest the author arouses for Thomasin is we believe much milder than he expected for it is evidently his wish that we should be satisfied with the quiet happiness she obtains while in reality we are perfectly indifferent to it Eustacia is so obviously Mr Hardys favourite that she becomes ours also We are therefore disgusted with her misery in the second half of the novel and disappointed with her sad end Notwithstanding these imperfections which are perhaps not faults but only idiosyncrasies of the author the book is one which deserves a better fate than merely to be skimmed and then thrown aside Not only is it far very far above the ordinary three volume novel but and this is much higher praise many parts of it will bear reading a second time and will then be better appreciated than at the first hasty perusal The Return of the Native makes us expect very great things from Mr Hardy if he will only work slowly and patiently,biography

The Romance of Sandro Botticelli woven from his Paint mgs By A J Anderson Illustrated Stanley Paul and Co ios 6d net Judging from its title the majority of readers will doubtless suppose this book to be a biographical work of the accepted order in which case however they will be mistaken Mr Anderson has set out on a more daring expedition than a quest of plain or doubtful fact As he explains in a note  The word romance is used in the sense of a fictitious narrative in prose with imaginary conversations and fictitious incidents and not in the modern sense of a lovestory Thus the title might be read  The story of Sandro Botticelli reconstructed from his paintings As it is the author has given us some very pretty romance and has told the story as his imagination pictured it of the events loves disappointments and triumphs of which the canvases stood as the centre as they became imbued little by little with life and colour But surely this practicehowever successful may be its results in the way of drama and popular interestis a dangerous one In this case the work is interspersed with some really invaluable criticisms and sidelights on those pictures from which the author has drawn his creative inspirations But the peril remains Were this method to become common how many modern artists would go in fear and trembling lest some selfelected benefactor of the dim future should endeavour to reconstruct their lives from some specimen of their art once hung on the walls of the Royal Academy They would probably have reason for their dread But even this speaking generally does not justify this new departure in the way of romantic biography,biography

The Schemers By E F Harkins Chatto  Windus This storyone of the increasing number of novels imported from Americahas for its background a fashionable store in Boston It is not a pleasant picture that Mr Harkins draws Most of the shopgirls scheme to entrap the Harvard students into matrimonial folly and nearly all the young men whom he sketches are guilty of indiscretions that assist the shopgirls plans If the picture be truea question on which only a Bostonian can offer an opinionthe authorities of Harvard have something to learn from older universities in the way of discipline Not wholly dark however is this realistic sketch of Boston shop life Lilian Fox who enters the  grand store  at an early age succeeds in resisting the evil influences that surround her and is rewarded by the honest devotion of a clever student to whom her lowly parentage counts as naught The growth of her character under the stress of temptation is by far the most skilful and pleasing feature of the book She is essentially a lifelike creation full of girlish vivacity and not uninclined to frivolity but saved by native grace from the vulgar intrigues of her companions Mr Harkins has a gift of humour and uses it very effectively in the portrayal of a local politician with a distorted notion of civic morality,biography

The Secret of an Empress By Countess Zanardi Landi Cassell  Co 16s net The last of the children of the Emperor and Empress of Austria who figure in the  Almanach de Gotha  was born in 1868  but the writer of the book before us claims to be the daughter of the Empress Elizabeth and states that she was born in 1882 She informs the public that her birth took place at a chateau in Normandy where her mother was staying under an assumed name but she does not know her birthday A few weeks later she was smuggled into the house of some people in Vienna and it was announced to the Viennese that the lady of this house had given birth to a daughter the author of this curious memoir It is stated in the first chapter that the Emperor  came secretly to see the Empress while she was at the chateau of Sassetot in the Seine Inferieure but that  what passed between her and the Emperor now will never be revealed It is suggested that the reason why the Empress wished her child brought up without knowledge of her parentage was that the Empress did not want this last of her children to be educated at the Court and preferred her childhood to be as different as possible from that of her other children The book is full of mysterious references to Ludwig II of Bavaria and to the affection of the Empress for his memory which cannot fail to make the reader ask what it is that the author means She is however studiously vague and declines to take the public into her confidence on the most important of all points though she indulges in hundreds of pages of trivial details about her childhood On one occasion after the Empress had told her that she was her real mother she ventured to ask  Why were you so fond of Ludwig of Bavaria mother   She notes that the Empress  started violently at my words and I felt that I should have liked to bite off my foolish tongue But the Empress recovered her selfpossession and remarked that the question had been unexpected that  she would like to talk to me about him She knew I must be bewildered and it was time that I should be enlightened a little The enlightenment was  little as all that it comes to as reported by the author is that in the opinion of the Empress Ludwig II was not mad But the Empress brought the conversation to a close with the significant words   We two remain to mourn for him In the account given of the death of this Bavarian king wide variations will be noticed from all the official statements The authors account derived she says from the Empress Elizabeth is a convenient one  but to the public it may be incredible That the Empress was an odd woman that she spent a large part of her life in wandering about the world and in living quietly where she was unrecognized is already known to the public  but there is much in this volume which will interest those who care for gossip and will tell them for the first time why the Empress hid herself and how she contrived to spend long holidays often in the same hotel with the child whom the Austrian Court refuses to recognize as being a member of the royal family The author lays stress on her account of the Mayerling tragedy and what she calls the true solution of that mystery is that the Crown Prince Rudolph was murdered and did not commit suicide She believes that a party hostile to him was formed at the Court The Crown Prince took no interest in military affairs and he found the soldiers and the Emperor were against him His unhappy marriage is described at length and the way in which he became acquainted with Marie Vetsera When she was staying with him at Mayerling the Emperor is said to have sent Baron Bolfrass to search the house and arrest the Crown Prince Rudolph threatened to shoot the first man who entered the room In a struggle the Crown Prince shot a gamekeeper and was himself shot as was Marie Vetsera This is the story ofthe Countess Zanardi Landi and it is given as coming direct from the Empress Elizabeth The author reports that shortly before the death of the Empress her mother promised to introduce her to the world   Should I know my father and ssers   I asked  Yes of course she answered 41 wonder how I shall get on with them    Very well I hope dear Anyhow they will not trouble us much  The author asked the Empress how she was going to  bring her out and the answer was   Very simply Th Emperor will have to announce officially   tht th Empress and he have a third daughtr living who has been educated away from th Court and who will be introduced on the occasion of his Jubilee It will not make any trouble whatever All is in order the papers and everything That is al that will be neeessarv After the assassination of the Empress the author wished to get into touch with her relatives but the lady with whom she was boarding warned her in the folowing words to avoid trouble   Your mother and the Emperor never ne reed Is it any wonder then that they went separate ways and as far a possible sought consolation elsewhere     Von must keep quiet for your mother sake if you dont want the story in everybodys mouth According to the tale here told the Empress left her child a fortune of 160000 She married a man for whom she did not care The money was placed in his hands and he at once lost it by seculation In 1906 she went with him to Canada but parted from him in 1908 and after a series of struggles was married again to Count Zanardi Landi The Countess describes the legal action which she began in Vienna and says that she refused 1 million crowns to settle it She gives the reasons why her lawyers dropped itreasons which are not very convincing and says that when they had thrown her over she was advised that her only course was to publish this workBooks BIOGRAPHICAL THE SECRET OF AN EMPRESS BY COUNTESS ZANARDI LANDI Cassell i6s net WE took up this volume not without misgiving But that flavour of courtly rottenness which generally hangs about this class of literature is not at all pronounced here On the contrary the book is a protest against everything of the kindthe author is animated with all the Empress Elizabeths hatred of restraint and conventionality Its title to be sure is a popular one and may well have been chosen with a view to appealing to snobs of every class with a view to  selling It deserves to sell We hope it will bring all the material profit possible to those concerned for Countess Landi is unquestionably entitled to every kind of compensation she can extract out of this world She tells her tale with such straightforward simplicity that these pages we think will not fail to procure her a number of new friends Vivid sidelights are thrown upon the manifold tragedies and absurdities of the House of Hapsburg and the fantastic ritual there is no other word for it which orders the life of the Austrian Court that perverse institution overhung by the mephitic vapours of jesuitry where the Empress may not even see her own children unless her visit is announced twentyfour hours beforehand where everybody up to the very head of the State moves about like puppets in some sinister pantomime There is a good little bit too about the Empresss ideas of what constitutes a small villa Mother had intended to have a small villa at Corfu with beautiful gardens attacked to it The cost was not meant to exceed a million pounds in English money The merest

The Spendthrift By Francis Dodsworth Grant Richards The binding of The Spendthrift is the reverse of engaging but it is not an unfitting keynote to the contents It is a novel of the turf and racecourse and the air of knowledge and truth is the most satisfactory thing about it One feels that the author knows his ground that the rise and fall of the youthful gambler are written by an experienced and shrewd observer of certain phases of life It is a pitiful story and the nard unrelenting realism but adds to the pity of it The spendthrift has no charm of personality or manner  even his callow youth shows none of the early enthusiasms or generous romance that even modern training does not always entirely obliterateTHE SPENDTHRIFT By Francis Dodsworth 6s Richards  The Spendthrift  is a vigorous bit of work The material is ably put together and the characterisation is within its limits shrewd and terse The writers firsthand knowledge or close study of the Turf will also be counted to his merits at an hour when storytellers are encouraged to be specialists Yet we seriously doubt if the book was worth writing Even as an awful warning as a soiemn moral lesson it can hardly reconcile us to its sordidness It is a much cherished belief that every mans life if it be honestly told is worth telling but it is not the truth Such a story as this is profitless and without interest There is no relief to the dreary commonplace of an existence like Devans He is without heart without intelligence without any stirrings in his being save the obstinate desire of gain the obstinate resignation to loss inspired by the billiardroom the cardtable and the turf There is no tragedy in his life which in its miserable end was a paltry fulfilment of its possibilities Fatigue rather than regret killed him at the last Some flitting generous impulses in a woman some kindly ministrations of a servant there are But the woman and the servant are only shadows and rouse but faint instincts of sympathy in us Even the least Pharisaical may turn away with a weary expression of gratitude for their unlikeness to this mere betting and gambling machine,biography

The Story of Herewvard By DOUGLAS C STEDMAN Harrap 7s 6d THE Story of Hereward  is a very readable narrative of the adventures and mighty deeds of the last of the English as Charles Kingsley calls him Round Hereward as round Robin Hood centres all the romance of outlawry Among much that is uncertain much that is fictitious however there remains the certainty of Herewards splendid defence of his camp of refuge at Ely in 107071 when the spirit of resistance survived only in the fens of Cambridgeshire Hereward appears to have been afterwards reconciled to William and even to have served him in his foreign wars The manner of his death is uncertain Mr Stedman to make a readable narrative has not contented himself with the bare certainties and gives a dramatic account of the death of Hereward the single combat with Harold Hardrada and some scenes of HIerewards boyhood are also innovations There are some very effective illustrations,juvenile

The Two Families an Episode in the History of Chapelton NEW NOVELS By the Author of Rose Douglas 2 vols Smith Elder  Co So favourableas may be recollectedwas our opinion of  Rose Douglas that another novel by the same writer could not fail to be welcomed by us with more than ordinary heartiness and curiosity  The Two Families will neither injure nor increase its authors reputation Again and again have we been treated to the contrast betwixt Riches without Religion and Poverty with Piety displayed in one and the same family  but the one has rarely been set in array against the other in a manner more entirely void of offence or of those exaggerations which point out wealth as a crime and lowly estate as a virtue in themselves The spoiled child Eliza Wilson by whose hapless fate the moral of the tale is pointed is well drawn until the moment of her marriage The events connected with and succeeding to this egregious case of sale and barter are forced for the sake of effect We hardly believe that people represented to be so proud as the Chamberlyns would stoop to court the Parvenus heiress with so little veil upon their cupidity  nor do we imagine that any well bred persons would so nakedly and suddenly commence the course of contemptuous insult which this aristocratic mother and son are described as adopting towards the bride from the very moment when the Church had tied fast the impoverished mans meanness to the ambitious girls money But there is a dismal reality in the account of poor Elizas return home and the solace to which she subsequently has recourse namely the bottlecomes only too naturally by way of sequel to such an illomened and un equal marriage That to the bottle the coffin shortly succeeds is also in the natural duotder of such a wretched history We are less satisfied with the final distribution of the great fortune and apprehend that the authoress of  Rose Douglas has small experience of settlements deeds of conveyance c c though her conception of sacrifice and generosity is right royally munificent The country beaux and belles of Chapelton and the noisy smartness of the Glasgow ladies are not badlydone  but the invention of The Two Families might have been fully and sufficiently wrought out in a quarter of the compass of the present novel,juvenile

The White Peacock By D H Lawrence Heinemann This novel is a characteristic specimen of the modern fiction which is being written by the feminine hand The older ideas and ideals are sacrificed ruthlessly to an attempt to breathe vitality into a succession of cinematographic pictures illustrative of the lives of the dramatis personal Tbere is however no selection as this method would suggest impressions are merely scattered at random It is as it were paulopostimpressionism in fiction That there is cleverness in thismodern study of nerves is obvious from the first chapter but it is equally impossible to avoid the conclusion that the characters were spun in the authors brain There is no verisimilitude Farmers daughters talk high culture and an ordinary readers head whirls in trying to determine the social relations of the sundry people involved Scenes seem introduced merely because the author has observed them or thought of them not because they add anything to the plot or even to the atmosphere Such is the modern method which a growing school of writers in this country encourages but which as we have pointed out before owes its conception rather to Zola than to English sources The author of The White Peacock is never realistic with the crudity of the master but she is needlessly frank to a fastidious mind As the trend of the novel in general seems to be in this direction she should be successful particularly when she has learnt her craft better There are suggestions and even more than suggestions of the making of a fine style in her writingTHE WHITE PEACOCK By D H LAWRENCE Heinemann InjD H Lawrence we have a new writer one most certainly to be reckoned with It is his first book we understand and he is quite young quite unknown The White Peacock should be read The book stands out among the ruck of contemporary fiction unmistakably as a work of artistic and literary excellence as the writing of a man who knows he will achieve both fame and distinction It is not perhaps a very good novel Mr Lawrence is somewhat prolix in his conversations his lifes orbit would seem a little limited there are loquacious oases of rather heavy and almost suburban dulness But there are flashes of real genius touches of physical interpretation a skill of observation a zeal of life a glow of intellect and above all a wonderful sensitiveness of art and nature which mark the writer as a real force He still needs craft the unerring craft of a Wells he needs experience There is nothing much in the story which is the study of a little country circle without much incident or movement Yet the book has a great fascination The scent of the countryside is all about it These people of his are realthere are some extraordinarily good descriptive scenesand the end is real No mawkish sentimentality No boyandgirl book this A true piece of writing revealing in places the sense of beauty and passion of a quite remarkable talentFICTION The White Peacock By D H LAWRENCE Heinemanil 6s I HITHIDro we have only known Mr D H Lawrence as being one of the many interesting poets discovered by the English Review Henceforth we shall certainly know him as the author of The White Peacock for it is beyond all argument an admirable and astonishing piece of work We use the word  astonishing  advisedly for like most new books of uncommon merit  The White Peacock  surprises even while it charms There are pages in it that made the present reviewer a sophisticated and disillusioned reader of novels lay down the book and rub his eyes in wonder at the authors individuality and courage It is no very new story that he has to tell That a young woman should encourage two young men at once and should end by marrying the wrong one is possibly even more frequent in fiction than in life Again that the slighted lover should thereon marry beneath him and take to drink is only ill accordance with the best traditions of the ingenuous school of novelists But in the hands of Mr Lawrence this old theme is quickened with new life The action takes place in the rural districts of Nottinghamshire and it would hardly be fanciful to say that Nature is the protagonist of the drama and that the author has drawn her character with uncommon care We realise her in all her moods and she is as interesting as she is convincing Nor has the author taken less pains with the drawing of those special manifestations of Nature that are called men and women The heroine is a delightful picture of a lively clever girl who likes excitement of all kinds and especially the rather dangerous excitement of leading passionate men on to making passionate love Mr Lawrences unravelling of this heedlessness is almost uncanny in its shrewdness But his greatest success is the character of George the farmerlover whose defeat and degradation supply the book with its motive This is a really masterly study of passion now wordless and pitiful now strung to its utmost intensity of selfexpression when the man realises his weakness and his own words hurt him like blows Lettie loves his physical strength and the completeness of his submission and wisely enough according to her lights marries the other man because his money and social position make him a more suitable match It is clever of Mr Lawrence to compel us to sympathise both with George and Lettie We are made to feel that they are both hard driven by their natures and are not to be blamed for the inevitable catastrophe But in truth of all the many characters in the book there is not one who does not move within the bounds of our sympathy the men are men the women women and the children who appear all too rarely are such children that we hope the author will be more generous of them in his next work Apart from the characterisation the book would stand by its vivid pictures of a country life that is new to us where side by side with the primitive roughness that lingers wherever men and women till the soil the new ideas have taken root and are apparently about to flourish The author treats of the primitive with praiseworthy frankness and there is no denying the interest of the spectacle of a young farmer looking at Aubrey Beardsleys illustrations for the first time It is apparent to us that Mr D H Lawrence is one of those rare writers who intends only to tell the truth as he sees it and nothing but the truth As a consequence he has given us a book of considerable achievement and infinite promise,biography

Byrons  prose Homer of human nature No expense has been spared to make the edition worthy of ts matter and its subject The type is clear nd comely the paper is thick and brilliant he covers of brown buckram relieved by a archmont label are workmanlike and neat dr Small has illustrated the novels with ome forty designs elaborately cut and reproluced as India proofs Mr Leslie Stepnen tas contributed an admirable introductory sssay and the English edition is limited o a thousand copies The change from Roscoes penurious issue and from the culgar poverty of a cheap reprint is strikng Fielding took rank among immortals ven while he lived and wrought and ime in spite of Richardsons illiberal sharity and Johnsons honest disregard las but strengthened his claims and improved his position The issue of the present editionan edition de luxe in every jen se of the termis a kind of official recognition of the admiration which has been his portion all along Thanks to its publishers he has become one of the saints Df the library as well as one of the worlds novelists His canonization is complete  the last honours have been bestowed and his reception into the hierarchy is an accomplished fact He need no longer be read in the blunt type and blurred pages of Murphy and Chalmers nor in the pale ink and yellow paper of original editions nor in the dogsears and meagre margins and dreadful double columns of popular reissues The greatness now thrust upon him is at once impressive and engaging In his new guise he appears as one of the handsomest and noblest classics in the language With so much to praiseand justly praise it seems ungraceful to condemn The edition has been projected on so opulent a scale and is in certain ways so complete and honourable a success that to find fault with it at all is to run the risk of appearing hypercritical and even unjust On reflection however it is impossible to reject the conclusion that the enterprise is remarkable rather for liberality and enthusiasm than for taste and judgment To begin with the size of the volumes raises objections and objections that are neither to be gainsaid nor despised Fielding is before all things else a writer to be studied He wrote for the world at large and he wrote to the end that he might be read and read continually His matter his manner the terms of his philosophy the quality of his ideals the nature of his achievement proclaim him popular Like Scott like Cervantes like Shakspeare he claims not merely our acquaintance but an intimate and abiding familiarity He has no special public and to be only on nodding terms with him is to be practically dead to his attraction and unworthy of his society He worked not for the boys and girls of an age but for men and women of all time  and both as an artist and as a thinker he commands unending attention and lifelong friendship He is a great inventor an unrivalled craftsman a perfect master of his material His work is the record of a lifetime of varied experience of keen observation of unwearying intellectual endeavour The types he created are vigorous and sound with an intellectual flavour peculiarly their own His novels teem with ripe wisdom and generous conclusions and improving examples He has as Mr Stephen remarks the undeniable merit of representing certain aspects of contemporary society with a force and accuracy not oven rivalled by any other writer Not to have studied him is to be without a knowledge of the most important documents of contemporary history It is evident that such a writer is not one to be skimmed and laid aside and that it is doing his admirers doubtful service to present him in any but the handiest of forms Now this is exactly what has come to pass in the present edition It is sumptuous but it is unwieldy It is inaccessible without a readingdesk and a library chair To peruse it is to engage in the performance of a literary solemnity We consider it with a respectful admiration and we think with a mixture of envy and regret of the editions of Alphonso Lemerre and the delightful bouquim produced by Jouaust at the Librairie des Bibliophiles What was wanted was a Fielding that could be comfortably held and easily perused and that while an ornament to the shelf would not on occasion have proved impossible to the pocketa Fielding with whom the reader might converse at odd hours of the day or night with the affectionate freedom that is his due What has been achieved is a Fielding to be superbly bound and gilded honoured with a prominent place in the library and venerated for his appearance a Fielding to be revered at a respectful distance like a colossal Pharaoh or Mr Addisons celebrated tragedy of  Cato Another point on which we regret to find ourselves at variance with the publishers of the new Fielding is the illustrations It is at all times difficult to understand why the library edition of a great writer should be held incomplete without pictures and the difficulty is increased tenfold when the great writer enjoys such a position as is Henry Fieldings In the first place it is not doubtful that if Fielding wrote for any class of readers in particular it was for readers who were interested in his work not as a vehicle for illustrations but primarily and essentially as literature and that could we suppose him to have been consulted in the matter he would be mortified to find that after over a hundred years of popularity his novels are held to stand in need of adventitious assistance Again Tom Jones and  Jonathan Wild and Amelia have been classics for many years we know them intimately and we have formed as definite a conception of the appearance of their heroes and heroines as we have of the men and women of Shakspeare and Cervantes themselves and it is certain that the artist who essays to improve upon our imaginings for us or to thrust them out to make room for imaginings of his own is doomed in advance to failure Moreover and this is perhaps the strongest argument of allthere is a gap between the present and that part of the past which it was Fieldings lot to represent for us between the convention of today and the convention of a century and a half ago between the age of Gladstone and the age of Walpole that is for all practical purposes as impassable as Styx itself The present is an epoch of sentiment its ideals and ambitions are mainly emotional what it chiefly loves is romance or the affectation of romance passion selfconscious solemnity and a ertain striving after the picturesque In fieldings time there was doubtless a food deal of sentimentality for his geneation delighted not only in Western md Trunnion and Mrs Slipslop but in Pamela and Clarissa and the pathetic Lie Fevre But for all that it wasat all wents in so far as it was interesting to Fielding and in so far as Fielding has pictured ita generation that knew nothing f romance and was keenly interested in lommon sense and took a vast deal of honest pleasure in wit and humour and a rather ruculent type of satire It is evident that such possibilities of sympathy and understanding as exist between a past of this sort and such a present as our own must f necessity bo few and small Their importance too is greatly diminished when we reflect on the nature and tendency 3f certain among tho essential elements of Fieldings art and mind The most vigorous and the most individual of these is perhaps his irony the next is that abundant vein of pure intellectual comedy by the presence of which his work is exalted to a place not much inferior to that of such work as the  Tartuffe  and the  Ecole des Femmes These rare and splendid qualities are distinguishing features in the best and soundest part of Fieldings work Of irony he is probably the greatest English master of pure comedy the intellectual manipulation and transmutation of what is spiritually ridiculous in manners and societyhe is both in narrative and in dialogue the greatest between Shakspeare and Mr George Meredith And with both our sympathy is to say the least of it imperfect in no small degree AVe have learned to be sentimental and selfsufficient with Rousseau to be romantic and chivalrous with Scott to be emotional with Dickens to take ourselves seriously with Balzac and George Eliot there are touches of feeling in our laughter even though the feeling be but spite we have acquired a habit of politenessa tradition of universal consideration and respect and our theory of satire is rounded by the harmless generalities of Mr Du Maurier on the one hand and the malevolent respectability of Mr W S Gilbert on the other A consequence of all this is that in attempting the illustration of  Tom Jones and  Jonathan Wild the modern artist enters on a task for which he is indifferently prepared and in which he can at best achieve but an imperfect success This is what has happened to Mr Small He is probably as good a draughtsman for wood as the publishers could have selected in picturing the aspects and emotions of his contemporaries he is usually successful he has the true sentiment of black and white his invention is varied his design expressive and sound Yet of the forty pictures he has contributed to the new Fielding there is hardly one that does not seem inappropriate to his matter and that does not act as a barrier between his author and his authors readers It is not that the illustrations are bad in themselves On the contrary many of them are excellent But they have little or none of Fieldings spirit and they are in no sense in harmony with Fieldings work In Thackeray or in Messrs Besant and Rice in  Denis Duval or  The Chaplain of the Fleet they would be well enough in  Amelia and  Joseph Andrews  they appear misplaced and their affect is discomforting They have faults f their own as for instance a certain inlecision in invention which has resulted in the production of two or three Westerns balf a dozen Joneses several Jonathan Wilds and a strange variety of Amelias ind Sophias But their chief fault is that they do not illustrate Fielding Mr Small has left his comedy to shift for itself and has endowed him with picturesque and romantic qualities altogether foreign to his art and to the epoch in which it was produced He ignores Lady Bellaston and Miss Matthews and Mrs Ellison  he only shows us Col Bath as a defeated duellist and Sergeant Atkinson in tho act of saving his masters life to him Capt Blifil is but a body to be carried upstairs and Jones a slim young gentleman to be presented under the influence of violent emotion  he has made nothing of Partridge nothing of the Ordinary and next to nothing of Mr Abraham Adams and for one picture of Lady Booby conceived in something of the right spirit he has given us half a dozen of Sophia which are merely pretty and clever and accomplished And just as he has suppressed the element of comedy so has he exaggerated the element of incident His picture of Joseph Andrews stripped and abandoned has the gloom and the terror of a design for  Eugeno Aram he has drawn us three or four duels as many bouts at fisticuffs and a couple of highway robberies his sketch of Jonathan Wild picking the counts pocket might illustrate a melodrama in a Strand theatre his presentment of Booth in prison is like a page from a modern novel in the manner of  Oliver Twist His designs in one word are suggestive now of a Fielding who wrote for the Adelphi and now of a Fielding who lived at Bedford Park The impression as may be imagined is peculiar To this may be added that though fairly well engraved they are on the whole ill printed For the reproduction of such trenchant contrasts as those in which Mr Small indulges such a medium as India paper seems improper It is soft and spongy and it absorbs and spreads the ink so that an impression is often produced of vagueness and indecision It is probable that a better effect might be obtained with ordinary platepaper which is hard and glossy and permits of a great deal of clearness of outline and transparency of darks and shadows For the selection of wood engraving in preference to etching as a means of illustration the projectors of the edition deserve a great deal of praise and we cannot but regret that their venture should be unfortunateas in certain ways it undoubtedly is In addition to all this it must be admitted that the editing of the new Fielding is by no means so scholarly as was to be desired The arrangement is entirely arbitrary  the text save that in  Amelia a few suppressed passages have been reprinted appears to be mainly that of Arthur Murphy of annotations and explanations which are absolutely indispensable to a correct and complete understanding of Fielding and which judiciously supplied would have gone far to make the edition final there is not one in all the ten volumes That these are defects and grave ones will readily be granted They are blemishes too that were hardly to be looked for in such an elaborate publication as the present To the absence of critical and historical annotations we have just referred  and we shall add no more than that in our opinion it does away with any pretensions to finality the edition might have been supposed to possess Scarce less noticeable are the vices of arrangement Tom Jones 1749 the authors second novel is printed first it is followed immediately by Amelia 1751 which was his last and this in its turn is succeeded by Joseph Andrews 1742 which was his first In tho same volume with Joseph Andrews appears tho  Journey from this World to the Next which first appeared in the second volume of the  Miscellanies published in 1743 while the fifth volume is composed of  Jonathan Wild originally printed as the third volume of the  Miscellanies and of Fieldings contributions to the Champion which appeared in 17391740 two or three years before The sixth volumo contains in the order specified thirtyseven articles from the Covent Garden Journal 1752 against the twentysix reprinted by Murphy  the ten numbers of the True Patriot 1745 included in Murphys edition  the two numbers of the Jacobites Journal 1748 republished by Murphy the Philosophical Transactions 1743 the essay Of the Remedy of Afflictions the  Dialogue between Alexander the Great and Diogenes the Cynic the Interlude and the essays on  Conversation Character and Nothing 1743 and the  Clear State of the Case of Elizabeth Canning and the  Case of Bosavern Penlez which appeared full ten years later The seventh volume opens with the  Voyage to Lisbon which is a posthumous publication  passes on to the  Charge to the Middlesex Grand Jury  and the  Inquiry into the Causes of the late Increase of Robbery which date from 1751 and 1753 respectively and after presenting us with the early prefaces to  David Simple and the  Familiar Letters continues withthe  Translation of the Second Olynthiac and the  Poems included in the  Miscellanies in 1743 and concludes with the translation of Juvenals Sixth Satire which is one of Fieldings first performances The last three volumes are devoted to the plays and include  very properly  the two pieces first printed among the  Miscellanies It is to be noted that the dates of production are not always given and that the editor has very wisely prefaced each play with a statement of the cast Where much is wanting one is apt in the nature of things to feel grateful for little Of Mr Stephens introductory essay we can speak in terms of almost unqualified approval It is not so hearty and cheerful as the excellent note on Fielding contributed to one of the series of Hours in a Library it repeats unquestioningly the old old story of the Fielding portrait it comments upon Lady Marys estimate of Fielding and Horace Walpoles malevolent historiette as though the ladys literary weaknesses and Walpoles fondness for decorating his gossip had no existence and were not to be taken into the writers calculation and it errs a little in electing to consider its hero according o the canons of modern morality in showing i trifle more interest in the religious inluences that made him what he was than erhaps they deserve and in declining to give i detailed opinion about Fieldings relations vith his contemporaries and particularly vith his innumerable posterity But ivhen all is said it remains a piece of singularly good and able work and one of svhich even its author may well be proud lt bears in every sentence the stamp of acute intelligence and great literary tact it is full of wit and humour of excellent criticism and of kindly and generous feeling it abounds in happy phrases and in just and pointed remarks on lifo and literature and morals It may without exaggeration be described as the best and soundest estimate of Fielding that has yet appeared in English or in any language whatsoever,biography
The Works pf George Peele TJ11 t A   Edited by A H xuuen ua 2 vols Nimmo After the labour involved in his edition of Middleton Mr Bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of Feele almost a holiday task Not that the text of Peele offers little difficulty to an editor It is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves In one case indeed that of Peeles Scriptural drama  David and Bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out Not even in the case of a Bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot Wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied Practically most that could be done for Peele was done by Dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction Mr Bullen pays full homage Sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of Dyces edition of Peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories New facts concerning Peeles history have been dragged to light and of these Mr Bullen has naturally made use In the Athenceum of July 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning Peele which appears in this latest edition first saw the light It is there shown that George Peele whom Pavne Collier confidently stated to be the son of Stephen Peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of James Peele clerk of Christs Hospital where the dramatist was educated Successive advances towards George Peeles education are chronicled in the Court Book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his sonne George Peele   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure The passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new Peele though Mr Bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries In the editorial part of his task Mr Bullen has been aided by Mr P A Daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed Mr Daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays Not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that Mr Bullen adopts In the cases in which Mr Bullen departs most widely from Dyce we are generally in accord with him The authority for assigning to Peele  Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes is a MS note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to Peele Dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed Though slow to differ from his predecessor Mr Bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school Mr Bullens sound instinct has not deceived him It is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  David and Bethsabe and The Old Wives Tale It is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of Peele have little in common If we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard That standard is obtained in The Old Wives Tale The Arraignment of Paris and in  David and Bethsabe though concerning the play last named Mr Sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it Cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to Peele The golden curls Of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of Eastern extravagance of language which Peele rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended A beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  The Arraignment of Paris where our author speaks of Yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold Two other lines a little Spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of Lord Tennyson The lines are And round about the valley as ye pass Ye may ne see for peeping flowers the grass The resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  The Two Voices You scarce could see the grass for flowers gave Milton some hints for Comus It is more than probable  it is all but certain that Milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of Comus TocompareMiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile From whatever source Milton took son bien he made it his own The resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions The very phraseology of  Comus is to a certain extent taken from  The Old Wives Tale Traces of imitation moreover on the part of Milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play Vigorous passages are less common in Peele than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and Peele is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the Elizabethan drama In his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree The rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance Some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency Similar instances abound To force however as is done at the opening of Sir Clyomon and Sir Clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke As the play is of dubious authority Peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this In the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  Cupids Curse in theArraignment of Paris is an exquisite ditty It is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  His golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the Earl of Essex belongs to Peele With the plays Mr Bullen gives the poems and other works of Peele including The Jests of George Peele To some portions of these Mr Bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour In this he is probably right The jests themselves however are the common property of Renaissance storytellers Some of them doubtless are as Mr Saintsbury states assignable to the  Eepues Franches of Villon Jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity In getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature Facsimiles of MSS of interest are given and the miniature title of the unique  Tale of Troy is copied It is pleasant to find Mr Bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacityThe Works of George Meredith Memorial Edition Vols IVL Constable  Co This Memorial Edition of Merediths works is a pleasant compromise between the rival claims of stateliness and use For the greater part of its life a book is an article of furniture and stands upon the shelf to decorate the library with its patch of colour and glow of kindly associations  but from time to time there occur those crises of its existence when it is taken down and read Books are as a rule designed primarily to meet these crises and Meredith is in a peculiar degree an author whose significance is only to be discerned by reading him Dickens Thackeray George Eliot delightful as they are can all be if we choose to make them so delightful memories and so clear are they in their place as to be intelligible almost at secondhand But Meredith is still side by side with us as a name on the shelf he is an enigma and there is no choice between living familiarity with him and vexed confusion On this account he does not readily lend himself to the statuesque habiliments of a  Library  edition which too often destines the author to be ranked in monumental impressiveness remaining mute Yet a Memorial Edition would not fulfil its object if it were not monumental in appearance  and the twenty and more volumes which the edition before us is to comprise though a little large for comfort have an appropriate dignity which is pleasantly emphasized by their sober green attire They are novels and a novel is a book to be read in relaxation  one hand ought to be enough for it these really require two On the other side it may be said that this edition is illustrated and illustrations are mostly not worth looking at unless they are of a certain size while the clear type is relieved by a margin neither too narrow nor too broad We have in fact a page printed on sound paper free from eccentricities and asking not to be stared at but to be read The illustrations are certainly an interesting feature It is a pity that the open ing portrait has such a misty look  a new view of Meredith is presented in it his piercing and soaring activity of mind  which is more familiar  yielding under the touch of age to a quality of clear introspection mixed with meditative sadness The photographs of various houses in which he lived or worked or scenes familiar to him and to the characters in his novels are tastefully done and though placed somewhat at random in the text suggestive in their degree Charles Keenes dxawings for  Evan Harrington of which five are reproduced will as time goes on become increasingly valuable as illustrations apart from their native character and charm The picture of Evan wearing his tall hat in the greenhouse while his ladylove her hair neatly netted upon her neck honours him with the present of a rose it is a critical moment in their romance recalls to us better than a volume of history the public and the mind of the public which Meredith originally addressed and which as was very natural only accorded him a qualified appreciationTHE WORKS OF GEORGE MEREDITH 17 vols 6s each Constable To fall back on a wellworn phrase there is nothing cheap about this  Standard Edition  of

THIE OtUARDIAiN ANGEL 4 It is not easy to discover the drift of this poemn and we incline to think that the author has stopped short of his original intention and presented his readers only with a fragtment But however this may be  The Guardian Angel  is a work of merit It is iin the form of a drama  and the purpose seems to be to show the infiLlence of a good woman over a nature of fierce impulse Agnes the heroine while abroad has saved Oliver from commmitting murder On his retura t Wales he sees her again and appears anxious to marry her so as to have his guardiani angel always at his side But lhe falls over a cliff and dies  and whether Adrian who is also in love with Agnes marries her we are not told Nor does it appear that her influence over Oliver has been very effectual for he plainly intends to murder Adrian a few minutes before he meets with his fatal accident Thus the cliff over which he fell is better entitled to the name of the dramia than Agnes herself and it seems rather due to his fall than to her that he dies in a Christian state of mind The other poems are passableThc Guardian Angel NEW NOVELS By Oliver Wendell Holmes 2 vols Low  Co To the more thoughtful and critical of those who are likely to peruse his new novel Mr Wendell Holmes is at pains to set forth in a lengthy preface the purpose of the tale which relates to the character and doings of Myrtle Hazard in whose blood an element of rebellious wildness derived from an aboriginal Indian ancestor is at war with the physical and moral forces which she inherits from her AngloSaxon progenitors  I have attempted says the author  to show the successive evolutions of some inherited qualities in Ihe character  of Myrtle Hazard not so obtrusively as to disturb the narrative but plainly enough to bc  kept in sight by the small class of preface  readers The novel that requires to be thus  explained in a preface is manifestly deficient in one of the most important qualities of a i good tale  and the worst that we have to urge  against The Guardian Angel is said when j we admit that without the authors considerate  preface we should certainly have failed to  apprehend his special design and that even i with the aid of his prefatory intimation we j are unable to see how his book is calculated  to effect his object Like its precursor  Elsie Vernier the tale is termed by the author  a j study of Reflex Function in its highest sphere j by which term he fears that he may  frighten  away all but the professors and learned ladies j and though without laying claim to rank with j either of these two classes of severely philo j sophie readers we were in no way disposed to  tremble at his hard words we must confess j that when we found the story dull and inco herent they did not tend to influence our  judgment in its favour Throughout the earlier chapters we were inclined to think well of the book and to hope that on working into the middle of the first volume we should take a strong interest in the passionate child whose peculiaritiesamply accounted for by the cheerlessness of her life and the severity of her training in a gloomy home and therefore by no means referable to the physical cause to which the author assigns themare sketched with force and delicacy But as the novel progresses to the end of its first half growing more devoid of  story  with every turn of a leaf the heroine loses all power over the readers imagination and by the time she has tunied out a commonplace schoolgirl in a fashionable college for young ladies she has altogether ceased to be in the slightest degree interesting as a psychological curiosity Some of the subordinate personages of the drama are presented with cleverness For instance Mr Byles Gridley MA the mild benevolent bookworm is so well managed that for the pleasure of watching his humorous nature and amiable disposition under circumstances more favourable to their display we could wish that Mr Holmes had put him on a better stage and given him a worthier part as well as worthier companions Some skill and originality are also shown in the coarse delineation of the Rev Mr Stoker who is for a time Myrtle Hazards religious adviser and ghostly enemy and of whom it is recorded  The Rev Mr Stoker was a man of emotions He loved to feel his heart beat he loved all the forms of nonalcoholic drunkenness which are so much better than the vinous because they taste themselves so keenly whereas the other according to the statement of experts who are familia with its curious phenomena has a certain sense of unreality connected with it He delighted in the reflex stimulus of the excitement be produced in others by working on their feelings A powerful preacher is open to thc same sense of enjoymentan awful tremulous gooseflesh sort of state but still enjoyment that a great tragedian feels when he curdles the blood of his audience Some of Myrtles feminine companionsespecially her austere aunt Miss Silence Withers and her loyal defender Nurse Byloeexhibit artistic merits that might almost be extolled for excellence But other characters of the story are just as poor and ludicrously insufficient for the purposes of romantic art as the better characters are commendable Gifted Hopkins the village poet is perhaps the weakest andmost puerile piece oibad  work in the book  but in the portions of the tale  that do not specially relate to this butt for i  Mr Holmess satire there are characters and  I devices and pieces of descriptive writing that i  will occasion more surprise than gratification to  readers who have derived amusement from the 11 authors former works But of all its many   shortcomings the chief fault of The Guardian i  Angel is its almost total want of what is i j technically termed  story So singularly de fective is it in this respect that if Mr 1 i Holmes should ever be required to reissue the J  work in a second edition he would d well to I  prepare readers for its most conspicuous failing  by christening it The Novel Without a Story,biography
THREE MONTHS UNDER THE SNOW I Tnis is one of those delightful books which young readers will peruse with all the interest of Robinson Crusoe and which many old folks too will etoy with equal pleasure We heartily recommend the little volume as a work very suitable for a present to young people al d that our readers may see the grounds on which we cordially praise it we proceed to furnish them with a short resume of its contents During seven months of the year the lofty mountain chain of Switzerland known as the Jura is covered with a mantle of snow and ice which prevents all access to it by travellers But durmg the other five months from May until October the scene changes Then the snow disappears the forests are clad in all their verdant livery and excellent pastures are furnished by the rich grass Allured by the latter attraction the Swiss drive forth their herds to browse upon the mountain peaks of Jura On these occasions the shepherds remain with their flocks until the hard winter again sets in residing during their absence from home in rude chalets formed of stone and occupying their intervals of leisure with the manufacture of the Grweere cheeses so well known in the list of epicura delicacies The scene of the narrative of  Three Months under the Snow which by the way is founded to 1 a very great extent upon facts is laid among the spots just described and commences at a time when the shepherds had driven back their flocks from the mountains of the Jura One of these I shepherds Frangoisthe father of Pierre Lopraz the little hero of the bookdoes not as was expected return with the others alarm is in consequence excited and Pierre accompanied by Louis his t fadther determines to proceed in eat of his mssing parent In the course of ascent up the mountain Pierre has the  Thee ontihe under the Snow The Journal of a yon inhabitant of the Jun tranuated fro the French of oldPomowha Rigiu Tact society curosity to go near the edge of a dangerous ravine when his grandfather in his anxiety to warn him against the danger stumbles and sprains his foot No particular notice of the aeci dent is taken at the moment but it turns out to I be the pivot on which the whole plot turns On arriving at the pasture ground Pierre finds his father well and intending to return the following day the illness of some of his cows having prevented him from leaving the mountain at the time when the other shepherds took their departure The whole party goes to sleep that evening in a rude chalet in which the father has resided during the summer but next day a new difficulty arises the old mans foot has so much swollen that he cannot walk and as there is not assistance enough to carry him back to the village it is arranged that Pierre shall remain with him at the cottage while his father drives down the flock and brings back directly the needful aid from home The father departs accordingly although all parties have ominous misgivings The father trembles lest the snow should set in and bury them alive before his return while Pierie and his grandfather are apprehensive that if the snowstorm actually comes on it will not only be fatal to them but will overwhelm Franjois before he reaches the village Meanwhile the mountains have begun to be tinged with snow and a loud wind is whistling past the cabin when suddenly it is recollected that there is another tenant of the cottagone indeed who turns out in the issue to be a most important one Our wooden clock says the young hero in a diar which records the incidents of each dayhad scarcely struck threeat this moment I called my grandfathers attention to the bleating of the goat   Poor Blanchette said he  her milk is troublesome and she is calling us Light the lamp we will go and milk her and then have our supper  The wind roared violently It rushed among the shingles which shook with its force so that we had some fear that the roof of the chAlet would have been carried away I lifted my head several times Fear nothing said my grandfather this house has sustained many similar assaults The shingles are loaded with large stones and the roof being nearly flat gives very little hold to the wind He then made me a sign to go before him and we entered the stable When the goat saw us she redoubled her bleatings She seemed ready to break her halter by the efforts she made to get to us How greedily she ate the handful of salt that I gave her Her tongue licked my hand over and over again that she might not lose a grain She gave us a good pailful of milk Such is our introduction to

THREE MONTHS UNDER THE SNOW I Tnis is one of those delightful books which young readers will peruse with all the interest of Robinson Crusoe and which many old folks too will etoy with equal pleasure We heartily recommend the little volume as a work very suitable for a present to young people al d that our readers may see the grounds on which we cordially praise it we proceed to furnish them with a short resume of its contents During seven months of the year the lofty mountain chain of Switzerland known as the Jura is covered with a mantle of snow and ice which prevents all access to it by travellers But durmg the other five months from May until October the scene changes Then the snow disappears the forests are clad in all their verdant livery and excellent pastures are furnished by the rich grass Allured by the latter attraction the Swiss drive forth their herds to browse upon the mountain peaks of Jura On these occasions the shepherds remain with their flocks until the hard winter again sets in residing during their absence from home in rude chalets formed of stone and occupying their intervals of leisure with the manufacture of the Grweere cheeses so well known in the list of epicura delicacies The scene of the narrative of  Three Months under the Snow which by the way is founded to 1 a very great extent upon facts is laid among the spots just described and commences at a time when the shepherds had driven back their flocks from the mountains of the Jura One of these I shepherds Frangoisthe father of Pierre Lopraz the little hero of the bookdoes not as was expected return with the others alarm is in consequence excited and Pierre accompanied by Louis his t fadther determines to proceed in eat of his mssing parent In the course of ascent up the mountain Pierre has the  Thee ontihe under the Snow The Journal of a yon inhabitant of the Jun tranuated fro the French of oldPomowha Rigiu Tact society curosity to go near the edge of a dangerous ravine when his grandfather in his anxiety to warn him against the danger stumbles and sprains his foot No particular notice of the aeci dent is taken at the moment but it turns out to I be the pivot on which the whole plot turns On arriving at the pasture ground Pierre finds his father well and intending to return the following day the illness of some of his cows having prevented him from leaving the mountain at the time when the other shepherds took their departure The whole party goes to sleep that evening in a rude chalet in which the father has resided during the summer but next day a new difficulty arises the old mans foot has so much swollen that he cannot walk and as there is not assistance enough to carry him back to the village it is arranged that Pierre shall remain with him at the cottage while his father drives down the flock and brings back directly the needful aid from home The father departs accordingly although all parties have ominous misgivings The father trembles lest the snow should set in and bury them alive before his return while Pierie and his grandfather are apprehensive that if the snowstorm actually comes on it will not only be fatal to them but will overwhelm Franjois before he reaches the village Meanwhile the mountains have begun to be tinged with snow and a loud wind is whistling past the cabin when suddenly it is recollected that there is another tenant of the cottagone indeed who turns out in the issue to be a most important one Our wooden clock says the young hero in a diar which records the incidents of each dayhad scarcely struck threeat this moment I called my grandfathers attention to the bleating of the goat   Poor Blanchette said he  her milk is troublesome and she is calling us Light the lamp we will go and milk her and then have our supper  The wind roared violently It rushed among the shingles which shook with its force so that we had some fear that the roof of the chAlet would have been carried away I lifted my head several times Fear nothing said my grandfather this house has sustained many similar assaults The shingles are loaded with large stones and the roof being nearly flat gives very little hold to the wind He then made me a sign to go before him and we entered the stable When the goat saw us she redoubled her bleatings She seemed ready to break her halter by the efforts she made to get to us How greedily she ate the handful of salt that I gave her Her tongue licked my hand over and over again that she might not lose a grain She gave us a good pailful of milk Such is our introduction to Blanchette Before the reader has done with her ho will find that she rises in importance until he is as much interested about her as he is about the other inmates of the snow prison On the regularity

Tlie Ministers Wooing By H Beecher Stowe a Low  Co 11 In this novel the leading events of which the p preface informs us are  founded on actual J p facts and the principal characters of which are historic Mrs Stowe endeavours to depict the mannera and austere religious life of New England at the close of the last century She especially commends her work to the kindly  1 thoughts of the British firesidea compliment j c which we predict the British public will repay 11 by asking for the story at the circulating libra  S ries and in due course coming to the conclusion j that notwithstanding numerous blemishes which go a long way towards counterbalancing its I merits it is a tale to be read and for nine days  to be talked about The critical few will find amusement in comparing an American ladys description of the Transatlantic Puritanism to which Whitfield imparted fresh earnestness more than a hundred years ago with the light satiric view taken of the same subject by Mr Thackeray in  The Virginians The Ministers Wooing is a love tale a religious novel and an historicor rather biographicfiction all in one Regarded as the first it deserves almost unqualified praise judged of as the second it merits a certain amount of blame but viewed as an illustration of history it is open to very grave censure The opening chapters as we indicated last December induce the reader to hope he is going to be treated with a series of simple domestic episodes although his feelings are early harrowed with an enumeration of the horrors of the slave trade But unfortunately these expectations are to a certain extent disappointed and the whole question of negro emancipation is dragged up for rediscussion In this the author has acted very unwisely With all its misstatements and onesidedness exaggeration and reticence Uncle Toms Cabin was a powerful story and created a memorable sensation  equal perhaps to that caused amongst educated English people almost two hundred years before by Afra Behns Oroonoko the first  nigger novel of our literature Mrs Stowe would have decided well for her fame if imitating the caution of Hamilton with his famous speech she had allowed this bril liant success to remain in solitary splendour and had not lessened its effect by endeavouring to repeat it The reception that  Dred met with in this country must have convinced her that her English admirers were weary of listening to the cracking of Legrees whip and that their craving for imagined woes must for some time to come be gratified with more refined sorrows than the tortures of slavemarkets and plantations down South Very likely Mrs Stowe is well aware of all this for the tone of her arguments against slavery in the present work is milk and honey in comparison with the scalding indignation of the story that first brought her into notoriety There is a wide difference between the inspired angel of abolition who penned  Uncle Toms Cabin and the calm argumentative lady who in  The Ministers Wooing is content with coldly enunciating the moral obligation of all men to help the oppressed And this change can only be accounted for on the supposition that either she has so far outlived the ardour of her earlier impressions that what a few years since would have been the language of fervid poetry is now nothing more than a mere habit of sermonizing or else that accurately appreciating the state of public feeling she only breathes gently on the embers of a dying enthusiasm well knowing that a stronger current of air would altogether extinguish the feeble sparks that still linger in them The scheme of that part of the story on which the rest of the narrative is hung is simple and pretty enough The drama opens with a teaparty in the parlour of the Widow Scudder who is a lady blessed with a small farm and  a gambrelroofed cottage on the outskirts of Newport a charming daughter the heroine a sweet little maiden just emerging from chUdj hoodand a high reputation for the possession j of  faculty the precise meaning of which term  may be found in the Athenmtm for December  25 1858 j The principal inmate of the Widow Scudders house is Dr H the minister who does the wooing a divine of extreme Calvinistic J opinions of pure life and of a gentle nature  a man dwelling in a world of spiritual abstracI tions guileless and simpleminded as a child  austere in his habits and of inflexible firmness of principle Studious and abstracted he is a kind of Coleridge divested of poetic faculty and imbued with moral stability The good man is a bachelor something over forty years of age and besides officiating zealously amongst j his congregation ministering to his afflicted j black brethren and writing a profound system I of divinity finds time to act to the fair Mary Scudder his landladys daughter the part that Abelard did to Heloise He is her tutor in religious and secular studies and she in return instructs him in the art of loving but unlike Heloise of old Mary only conceives for him that reverential affection which a young maiden naturally entertains for her pastor who appears to her an the expression of all the goodness that is possible in humanity The Widow Scudder would gladly see her daughter love the pastor dearly enough to wish to be his wife  but the meek gentle child wilful in one thing only bestows her heart on a wicked scapegrace of a cousin James Marvyn who having run 31 away from home and been to sea returns from 3 foreign countries to laugh at the sanctimonious ways of the godly people of Newport and to question the doctrine of election and predestination The young man of course is condemned by the surrounding respectability as r utterly reprobate and poor little Mary is con tinually being informed that her cousin her playmate from infancy her dearest cousin is doomed to eternal perdition The child has also amongst other tenets of that religion which Calvinism grafted on the stern nature of the Puritan colonists called into existence has been taught that it is her duty to contemplate the idea of her own eternal punishment with lively pleasure if by such suffering the happiness of mankind at large could be increased Naturally she applies this terrible doctrine to the state of her own mind in relation to her cousin until she feels she could willingly surrender herself a sacrifice to neverending torment in order to secure him admission to an eternity of bliss One afternoon James has a stolen interview with her to say farewell as next day he is about to start on a long voyage After much earnest and pathetic conversation on religion which we extracted when noticing the first number of this work James gives her a parting kiss and once more goes off to sea The voyage is one of disaster The ship is wrecked and news comes home that Tames Marvyn is drowned The intelligence well nigh kills poor little Mary and for many a day she seems going the downward way to death Her mother who has become possessed of her darlings secret watches her narrowly anxiously and prayerfully But Mary does not die Her physical strength is gradually restored to her and though her heart is saddened for life she prepares like the noble selfsacrificing girl she is to forget her own woes as much as possible and to devote her life to making others happy Time passes on and Dr H wno has comforted her in her sorrow and sickness ignorant of the nature of the wound her affections have suffered begs her to be his wife To gratify her mother to make a good man happy and to secure to herself a field of usefulness Mary accepts him The wedding clothes are provided and the day for her marriage is fixedav the day is not a week distant on which January and May are to be united togetherand Mary is training herself to look cheerfully on her future as the bride of the good and venerable Dr H when one fine morning aa she walks in solitary meditation in the fields a voice is heard behind her and a quick step beats the ground and an arm is put round her waist and she falls fainting in her true lovers arms Instead of being drowned James Marvyn has returned home rich The rest of all this pretty romance can be imagined Mary acknowledges to James that he has her heart but she is nevertheless determined to keep her promiseher solemn engagement to good Dr H and bids her lover not to hinder her from doing her duty There is a pause of uncertainty and suspense The awful day draws nearer but ere it has arrived a jolly little dressmaker Miss Prissy who acts the part of an amiable sprite all through the play informs the Doctor of the state of the case The finehearted man takes all the sorrow of the position to himself surrenders the timid child he loves so dearly to the man of her choice and sets his face resolutely forward to do his duty in that unwedded life which it seems Providence has designed for him  You all know he said turning to Mary who sat very near him  the near and dear relation in which I have been expecting to stand towards this friend I should not have been worthy of that relation if I had not felt in my heart the true love of a husband as set forth in the New Testament who should love his wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it and if in case any peril or danger threatened this dear girl and I could not give myself for her I had never been worthy the honour she has done me For I take it wherever there is a cross or a burden to be borne by one or the other that the man who is Biade in the image of God as to strength and endurance should take it upon himself and not lay it upon her that is weaker for he is therefore strong not that he may tyrannize over the weak but bear their burdens for them even as Christ for his church I have just discovered he added looking kindly upon Mary  that there is a great cross and burden which must come either on thia dear child or on myself through no fault of either of us but through Gods good providence and therefore let me bear it Mary my dear child I will be to thee as a father but I will not force thy heart This is touching and well told But how does it all square with the facts on which the story ia founded Who is this good Dr H this pattern minister so forgetful of himself where the happiness of others is concerned who subsequent to the Declaration of Independence is represented as forty years of age childless and unwived  He is no other than the celebrated Samuel Hopkins DD pastor of the first Congregational Church in Newport and cofounder with Jonathan Edwards of that awful that indescribably ferocious system of Calvinistic theology known as the Hopkintonian or Hopkinsian But unfortunately for the truthfulness of Mrs Stowes tale Samuel Hopkins was born in the year 1721 and did not settle in Newport till the year 1770 Consequently instead of being forty at the outset of his wooing which commences after the recognition of American Independence by England he must be regarded as more than sixty years old But further Dr Hopkins married in 1748 Joanna Ingersol who presented him with eight children and livea with him as his wife till her death on the last day of August in 1793 And on the 14th of September 1794 the Doctor then in his seventyfourth year married again taking for his second wife Miss Elizabeth West a lady only sixteen or seventeen years younger than himself It is a matter of certainty that Samuel Hopkins was in no respect such a man as Mrs Stowe has depicted him It is true that he was an Abolitionist and published in 1776 A Dialogue concerning the Slavery of the Africans but instead of being a shiftless dreamer incapable of looking after his worldly interests and wanting a religious landlady to rouse him up and tell nim when he was hungry he was a keen and energetic man and as well able to make a bargain as any other citizen of the United States Although he owned a farm and made considerable sums by his literary productions he threatened to quit his congregation at Newport if they could not provide comfortably for him and Mrs Stowe can scarcely be ignorant of how active he was in organizing prayermeetings amongst his flock Such misrepresentations as these altogether overstep the limits which ought to restrain the imagination of a writer of historic fiction In such composition it is allowable to exercise the imagination in amplifying and giving colour to the views of history by the creation of any series of positions and incidents which are in accordance with recorded facts But surely a too daring disregard of veracity is exhibited by tho writer who professes to sketch the Life of an eminent person and at the same time misrepresents it in the most important particulars What object can Mrs Stowe have in saying that her story is founded on facts when the masterincident of the book is pure fiction Are the facts of Uncle Toms Cabin of a similar kind  Other historical characters besides Dr Hopkins are brought on the stage but not with greater felicity Col Aaron Burr figures away with Madame de Frontignac deluging that lady and all the rest of the fair sex whom he addresses with very awkward adulation But this is a slight fault and one easily accounted for Doubtless it has been Mrs Stowes pro vince throughout life to receive rather than to pay compliments We cannot discuss at length the religious side of this novel In that respect it forms a striking contrast to the Tales of Miss Sewell being marked by a boldness of speculation and language which one would in vain look for in the writings of our own countrywomen It is we are willing to believe written in a devout and reverential spirit but it is to be regretted that one of the saddest exhibitions of the perverseness of the human intellect when directed to the contemplation of sacred mysteries should have been dragged into a pretty love story to disfigure ana even to mar it The Eicture of Mrs Marvyns agony on hearing of er sons death and her despair of his salvation is as revolting a spectacle of spiritual Buffering as Uncle Tom dying under the whips of his persecutors was of bodily torture If the hook should become popular its success will be won not by its polemical qualities but by the winning graces of the heroine and her little friend of the great world Verginie In the construction and elaboration of Marys character genuine artistic power is manifested In conception it lacks originality for in many respects she is a combination of Longfellows Evangeline and that form of youngladyism which has for some years been fashionable in American novels and many features of her mind and incidents of her life have been taken with judicious selection from the numerous Puritan memoirs which formed an important division of American literature in the last and few preceding generations The Memoirs of Mrs Harriet NeweU and Hopkinss Memoirs of Miss Susanna Anthony who died at Newport Rhode Island in 1791 have manifestly been carefully read by Mrs Stowe In conclusion we may add that amongst the pleasant peculiarities of the book are innumerable Americanisms some of them intentionally and some unconsciously employed by the author To educate young ladies is to  fetch them up and a matron wno superintends her domestic servants is said  to follow them round Prominent too amongst its national characteristics the reader will notice the authors passion for  talking philosophy her familiar mention of Plato as  an old heathen and her anxiety to display an intimate acquaintance with the Art galleries and cathedrals of Europe The annoyance of our Transatlantic cousins at their own want of the memorials of ancient Art is one of their most patent foibles and we are not awafre that it was ever more humorously expressed than by the New York merchant who on being reminded amidst the ruins of Pompeii that his country was entirely devoid of any such interesting relics answered  Yes stranger thats an Almighty truth we have got

Puritans of Xew England  the difference between them is this that the Peer writes as a rhetorician whose heart is untouched while Mrs Stowe writes from the heart and with all her heart The people of whom she treats are in her belief the excellent ofthe earth She has lived in the land haunted by their traditions and peopled by their memories They had crossed the sea and had gone out into the wilderness to find freedom to worship iud Their talk was of religion  they applied scriptural tests to the conduct of daily life  they spoke of the commonest events of life in the iguage of Scripture

Untold the Last of the Saxon Kings LOUDON SATURDAY JUNE 17 1848 REVIEWS By the Athor of Rienzi  The Last of the Barons c 3 vols Bentley x will be a misfortune attending the criticism of this new and in many respects able work of Sir E Bulwer Ly ton that those who write on itand indeed those who read itcan scarcely determine whether to treat it as history or as fiction If as history it is written with too much of the air of mere invention if as fiction it includes too many of the details ofthe chronicler This is an evil attending the choice of the subjectand one which though many have made the attempt only one author of the class has been able in any great degree to overcome To tbis rare and almost wonderful exception it is not necessary that we should more expressly refer but we must add that even in that case the experiment however generally successful occasioned many important distortions and perversions of factsand we will venture to say that it has produced especially in the present generation much doubt confusion and error as to characters opinions and events These observations are in a manner challenged by Sir E B Lyttons dedicatory preface and by the notes which he has placed at the foot of his page and appended to each of his volumes They appear to set up a claim for his fiction notwithstanding his denial of the pretension to the dignity and importance of history We hold it impossible to reconcile the two satisfactorily Either let us have a production of mere fancy or let us have a book depending mainly on its facts and statements the value of which can be measured by ordinary and known standards The author commences with informing us that he has abandoned thc usual course of historical narrative in his incidentshe makes a merit of perverting what has hitherto been received in relation to the connexion between Harold and Edith We admit at once that for his purpose he had 1 reason for making the changebecause itrenders the story not merely more interesting but on every account more readable On this point Sir E B Lytton observes  The love tory of Harold nnd Edith is told differently from the wellknown legend which implies a leis pure connexion But the whole legend respecting the Edeva faira Edith the fair whose name meets us in the Doomsday Roll rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal but which on many accounts I hope may be intrusted fearlessly to the young That is to wy he made this important deviation because he did not wish to have his novel banished from drawingroom tables and the boudoirs of he ordinary readers of such productions We should have complained less of aberrations of this kind if the writer had not been rather ostentatious of his authorities from hich he clearly means it to be inferred that n all the main incidents of his story he has adhered to the most authentic representations e do not dispute that in many instances he lias done sobut we think that he has thereby rendered his work less attractive His archaegy spoils his book as a fictionjust as his departures from the same injure it as history he has thus put a curb on his imagination both regardspersons and eventsand would have produced a better and more popular work had he subjected himself to none of these restraints As it is the old figure of a man dancing a hornpipe in fetters recurs to the reader We may be surprised that he can do so well thus loaded but feel sure that he could have done much better unencumbered In fact the author has most succeeded where he has most rejected the inconvenient restraints to which he elsewhere submitted and those portions of his three volumes will be read with most pleasure where he has given way to the variety and gracefulness of his own fancy and the vigour and boldness of his own imagination The description for instance of all that relates to the war of Harold against Gryffyth in Wales is unsurpassed in interest and power by anything from his pen We will select our first specimen from this part of Vol II premising that Gryffyth his queen and his starving followers have been shut up in a mountain fastness and that Harold by a monk and a young Norman has sent them a message of mercy on submission  As the monk ceased the thrill of the audience was perceptible and a deep silence waa followed by a general murmur as if to constrain the King Then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man The red spot flushed the dark cheek and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow He made one stride towards thc monk and said in a voice loud and deep and slow rolling far up the hillMonk thou hast said and now hear the reply ofthe son of Llewellyn the true heir of Roderic the Great who from tlie heights of Eryri saw all the lands of the Cvmrian sleeping under the dragon of Uther King was I bom and king will I die I will not ride by the bide of the Saxon to the feet of Edward the son of the spoiler I will not to purchase base life surrender the claim vain before men and the hour but solemn before God and posteritythe claim of my line nnd my people AU Britain is oursall the Island of Pines And the children of Hengist tire traitors and rebelsnot the heirs of Ambrosius and Uther Say to Harold the Saxon  Ye have left us but the tomb of the Druid and the hills of the eagle but freedom and royalty are ours in life and in deathnot for you to demand them not for us to betray Nor fear ye O my chiefs few but unmatched in glory and truth fear not ye to perish by the hunger thus denounced as our doom on these heights that command the fruits of our own fields No die we may but not mute and revengeletw Go back whispering warrior go back false son of Cymryand tell Harold to look well to his walla and his trenches We will vouchsafe him grace for his gracewe will not take him by surprise nor under cloud of the night With the gleam of our spears ami the clash of our shields we will come from tho hill and famineworn as he deems us hold a feast in his walls which the vultures of Snowdon illume their pinions to share  Rash man and unhappy cried the monk what curse drawest thou down on thy head Wilt thou be the murtherer of thy men in strife unavailing and vain  Heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt causeto be shed Be dumb hush thy screech lying raven exclaimed Gryffyth his eyes darting tire and his slight form dilating  Once priest and monk went before us to inspire not to daunt and our cry Alleluia  was taught us by the saints ofthe Church on the day when Saxons fierce and many as Harolds fell on the field of MaesGarmon No the curse is on the head of the invader not on those who defend hearth and altar Yea as the song to the bard the cursk leaps through my veins and rushes forth from my lips By the land they have ravaged by the gore they have spilt on these crags our last refuge below the carn on yon heights where the Dead stir to hear meI launch the curse of the wronged and the doomed on the children of Hengist They in turn shall know the steel of the strangertheir crown shall be shivered as glass and their nobles bc as slaves in the lund And the line of Hengist and Cerdic shall be rased from the roll of empire And the ghosts of our fathers shall glide appeased over the grave of their nation But wewe though weak in the body in the soul shall be strong to the last The ploughshare may pass over our cities but the soil shall be trod by our steps and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards Nor in the great Judgment Day shall any race but the race of Cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth to answer for the sins of the brave So impressive the voice so graud the brow and sublime the wild gesture of the King as he thus spoke that not only the monk himself was awed  not only though he understood not the words did the Norman knight bow his head as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct flashes out from the cloudbut even the sullen and widespreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment But the spearmen and multitude above excited by the tidings of safety to life and worn out by repeated defeat and the dread fear of famine too remote to hear the King were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators creeping from rank to rank and already they begun to sway and move and sweep slowly down towards the King Recovering his surprise the Norman again neared Gryffyth and began to reurge his mission of peace But the chief waived him back sternly and said aloud though in Saxon No secrets can pass between Harold and me Thus much alone take thou back as answerI thank the Earl for myself my Queen and my people Noble have been his courtesies as foe as foe I thank himas King defy The torque he hath returned to my hand he shall see again ere the sun set Messengers ye aro answered withdraw and speed fast that we may pass not your steps on the road The monk sighed and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle nnd a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there that the King was alone in his fierce defiance Then lifting again the rood he turned away and with him went the Norman The above and nearly all that belongs to it is inventionand very admirably invented it is We know nothing much more animating and inspiring than the whole that relates to the CatKing as GryfTyth is called by the Norman his struggles his defeats and his suffering We venture to think that Sir E B Lytton w much mistaken when he represents not merely the clergy but the young soldiers and courtiers of the reign of the Confessor as well acquainted with the literature of Greece and Rome It is true that as regards abbots and monks he is in compensation very severe He does justice to such ecclesiastics as Lanfranc and Aclred but he makes an abbot who figures prominently in one or two scenes ignorant ofthe commonest rudiments of Latinwhile a younger brother in his company is lost in wonder at the learning of his superior The following is a short part of their dialogue  The Kings Norman favourites at least honoured the Church That is true said an abbot 4 and an it were not for two things I should love the Norman better than the Saxon What are they my father asked an aspiring young monk Inprints quoth the abbot proud of the one Latin word he thought he knew but that as we see was an error they cannot speak so as to be understood and I fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning Here was a sanctified groanCount William himself spoke to me in Latin  continued the abbot raising his eyebrows Did he Wonderful  exclaimed several voices And what did you answer holy fatherMarrysaid the abbot solemnly I replied InprinisGood said the young monk with a look of profound admiration We have introduced this extract by way of contrast with the learning attributed to other classes Even of GryfTyth the CatKing of Wales we are told that his mind had turned from the literature of Rome to the legends and songs and chronicles of his land nnd other personages both Saxon and Norman refer to Greek and Latin authors with fur too much familiarity Homeric fables and Homeric personages are mentioned and alluded to by the characters and though we may be willing to admit that more learning existed among our AngloSaxon forefathers than has by many been supposed yet we most seriously doubt whether it is consistent with the state of knowledge of the time to put quotations from Horace into the mouth of a young soldierstill more that he should employ such in conversation with a rude Saxon from the weald of Kent Of course what the author introduces on his own account and in his own person in the progress of the narrative is not liable to any such objection  and whether it did or did not require to be translated in ad 1052 it is quite clear that Sir E B Lytton is of opinion that it requires to be translated in ad 1848for we cannot call to mind an instance in which he has employed a scrap of Latin where he has not done his readers the favour to render it into English Whatever might be the case in England in the eleventh century wo are sure that Greek was not studied in Italy even in thc thirteenth centuryand that Dante knew nothing of Homer unless at secondhand In connexion with this matter we may here not unfitly notice the great number of Saxon and AngloSaxon words employed by Sir E B Lytton without explanation even where explanation seemed most necessary If the absence of this explanation should have the effect of inducing the readers of  Harold to make themselves in some degree proficients in the great and noble language of their remote ancestors so much thc better  but in the mean time it might not have been improper to have added an interpretation in brackets or otherwise  provided it were really necessary that the author should go out of his way to employ terms so little understood by the great body of persons to whom he addresses himself Sometimes the context will enable the reader to guess what is meant but generally we think he will be quite at a loss for the meaning We copy a fewand but a fewregarding which we are confident even welleducated persons will be at some loss weregeld lithtmen ceorl suhcendinen cyst mane uses dour cnehts quern  which with many more are of perpetual occurrence We say nothing of such words as thegn which might have been more intelligibly and less cacophonously written thaneor of zemmes which Sir E B Lytton himself seems sometimes to use indifferently with gemsbut we should like to know what is gained by the rejection of a word having the same meaning and in daily employment The author seems to have crammed himself from Mr DEyncourts folios as he admits in his prefatory epistleand then fancied that matters familiar to him must also be well known to others This is an ordinary error The great reputation which the author has justly acquired enables him easily to afford that such minor faults and blemishes should be pointed out For this reason we tell him that ne is not to suppose because he sees in a plan of London of the middle of the sixteenth century two rings marked down for the baiting of bulls and bears and because the sport may be mentioned by Fitzstephen that these places existed on the same spot in the middle of the eleventh century His mention of these rings forms part of a very interesting but not a very accurate description of London before the Conquest in his first volume The truth is that we have no sufficient materials for such a description and on this account we are willing to take Sir E B Lyttons fanciful representation which is highly picturesque He is seldom at fault when he relies on himself and his own resources One instance to the contrary may however be pointed out near the end of his second volume where William then Count or Dukeof Normandy challenges Harold to bend his bowan exertion to which the Saxon noble is not accustomed and which therefore he declines The meaning of bending a bow is not as Sir E B Lytton seems to imagine the pulling of a clothyard arrow to the head after the bow has been strung it is stringing a bow an operation requiring both art and strength and dangerous to the weak and the unskilful Of the story itself we have said little because the rude outline of nearly the whole of it is to be found in historyif history it deserve at that early date to be called Tlie loves of Harold and Edith form but a small portion of the tale and as that is the most imaginative portion so iu several respects it is the best The character of the heroine is delicately and touchingly drawn  and her feminine sweetness and tenderness are excellently set off by and contrasted with the more masculine proportions and appearance of Hilda her magical and mysterious grandmotherwho from first to last acts a very prominent part in all that relates to Harolds affection and to his ambition She is a very grand personage who adheres to the Saxon faith rejecting the Christian creed and resorts to all the solemn and awful incantations belonging to her ancient superstitious It must be confessed that she now and then reminds us of Norna in Sir W Scotts  Pirate and of Meg Merrilies in his  Guy Mannering but it is only for a momentand in such a manner as could not have been avoided by the author What follows is a small part of a scene in which the two lovers and Hilda are introduced in the second volume   There is no joy for me returned Edith plaintively and I have that on my heart she added with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone  which at last I will dare to speak I reproach thee Hilda that thou hast marred all my life that thou hast duped me with dreams and lett me alone in despair Speak on said Hilda calmly as a nurse to a froward child Hast thou not told me from the first dawn of my wondering reason that mv life and lot were interwoven withwith the word mad and daring must out with those of Harold the peerless  But for that which my fancy took from thy lips as a law I had never been so vain and so frantic I had never watched each play of his face and treasured each word from his lips I had never made my life but a part of his lifeall my soul but the shadow of his sun But for that I had hailed the calm of the cloisterbut for that I had glided in peace to my grave And nownow O Hilda Edith paused and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command And she resumed quickly thou knowest that these hopes were but dreamsthat the law ever stood between him and meand that it was guilt to love him I knew the law answered Hilda but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird Ye are sibbe to each other some five times removed and therefore an old man at Rome saith that ye ought not to wed When the shavelings obey the old man at Rome and put aside their own wives and frillas and abstain from the wine cup and the chase and the brawl I will stoop to hear of their lawswith disrelish it may be but without scorn It is no sin to love Harold and no monk and no law shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together form and heart Hilda Hilda madden me not with joy cried Edith starting up in rapturous emotion her young face dyed with blushes and all her renovated beauty so celestial that Hilda herself was almost awed as if by the vision of Freya the northern Venus charmed by a spell from the halls of Asgard  But that day is distant renewed the Vaia What mattera what matters cried the pure child of Nature I ask but hope Enoughoh enough if we are but wedded on the borders of the grave  Lo then said Hilda behold the sunfthTS dawns again As she spoke the Vaia stretchy her arm and through the intersticed columns of th fane Edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward Presently into the space of the eire came Harold her beloved His face was pale jjiv grief yet recent but perhaps more than everdiiajv was in his step and command on his brow for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of Saxon England And what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of man as the pare sense of power responsible in an earnest soulThon comest said Hilda in the hour I predicted atthe setting ofthe sun and the rising of the star Vak1 said Harold gloomily  I will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies for who shall judge of that powet of which he knows not the elements  or despaetht marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture The earlier portion of the story is perhaps too much made up of obscure history to be very interesting and the only incidents in the first volume that may be said really to belong to a novel consist of the return of Earl Godwin and his four sons from banishment and the declaration by Harold of his love for Edithwho as we have seen stood within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity to him The incidents acquire a more rapid movement in the second volumeand the interest is powerfully wound up in the third They therefore who pause and look back when they have arrived at the end of 300 pages will feel dissatisfied let them wait until they have finished the whole and their dissatisfaction will then be that they have come to the end of the work It is not unusual in productions of this clan to find that the person intended for the hero ii not the hero in fact Such in a degree is the case with Harold In various parts of tht story he is not so much its hero as William Duke of Normandy the victor at Hastings and Sir E B Lytton has drawn the character of William with such force and fulness that when ht and Harold are together it is not to be disputed that William attracts more attention if not interest than his younger rival We do not say that the affections of the reader are not with Harold but the genius the resources the mental power and subtlety of William engross our admirationand would make us feel certain even if we knew nothing historically of the issue that he must triumph We admit all along the courage and generosity of Harold but as the author tells us his parts are comparatively slowand when in Normandy he was outwitted and would have been more so hut for the sagacity and penetration of his little nephew Haco This may be true as history bot it is not right as artand here we have a particular example of the difficulties of the historical novel We cannot go thoroughly and heartily along with any hero whom we expect to set duped and who we know in the end will be conqueredIAROLD THE LAST OF THE SAXoN KINGS In three volumes London Bentley 1848 It is by no means our intention to enter into any lengthened investigation of the merits of this work nor is it necessary so to do Sir Bulwver Lytton is not a new aspirant after literary honours but as we had long since been given to understand that he had made his last appearance before the literary world the present emanation from his pen naturally attracts a considerable share of attention nor is it without good reason that this attention is excited The present woi k may worthily rank with its predecessors on the score of merit Cast long back in our history the plot unravels itself before our eyes as naturally as if it were a tale of yesterday our author tells us he had long pondered upon the idea of founding an historical romance upon the Norman invasion and accordingly having done so he has rendered the subject completely his own and has thus been enabled to present us with details minute and graphic concerning that period of our history The auce was one fraught with interest as being the last hours of the old Saxon mnonarchy The legend of Harold and Edith is related but differently to the received opinion concerning it and this has been done out of consideration to the younger portions of the reading public into whose hands such a work may naturally be expected to faUl Superstition has much to do with the agency by which the events are brought about but it would seem almost impossible to discover these superstitions from the narratives of these timesthey were believed in thought to have a part in every action of life so that unless we consent to listen to the voice of superstition we must not expect to obtain a correct idea of our Saxon forefathers No terror is sought to be inepired by these ghostly aids they are simply used as valuable assistants in times of emergency The author has succeeded in pourtraying a very beautiful character in Edith she is firm noble and affectionate loving wvith an unselfish love that teaches her that the splendour of affection is manifested not by basking in the enjoyment it affords butt where necessary in sacrificing it upon a high and holy shrine Her love for Harold was too strong to wish to plunge him into danger for her sake even though it brought her all she coveted on earththe desire to be near him Harold is a very fine creation admirably sustained throughout we may on the whole pronounce Harald to be one of the most striking of Sir Bulwer Lyltons ever striking novels There is something highly classical in the style which tells at once of the bent of the atithors mind and the high and ennobling studies to which hie has been accustomedHarold the last ofthe Saxon Kinqa vy Sir E Bulwer Lytton London Bentley 1i a somewhat affected and pedantic dedicatory epistle Sir Edward flulwer Lytton informs us that this nvwel is meant to instruct the ignorant reader as well ts to delight the mere seeker after amusement He also threatens us with a series of similar stories in which the earlier history of England is to be done into romance4 furnishing what lie considers genuine pictures of old English morals men and manners and exposing to the ignorant eye of his fellowcountrymen the true motives and characters of the great personages who have hitherto been doomed to be described only by professed historians and chroniclers A man more utterly inadequate to the task than the brilliant author of Pelhamn we can scarcelv conceive That one who looks upon Pelham as a gentleman upon The last Days of Pomopeii as a elaaical story and upon Lucretia as a tale favourable to virtue should also look upon himself as brmed tO somprobend the motie of th dark and the medieval ages is perhaps not a thing to create much surprise but at the same time we cannot but regard it as a mere literary hallucination to which we cordially trust that the public voice will give no encouragement whatever If indeed the public find it half such hard work to get through the first volume of Harold as we have found it ourselves we have small fear for the result If they smile with us at the authors pedantry at his amusing patronising kindness towards the simple reader at the benevolence with which he translates a Latin sentence for the benefit of the unlearned at the hodgepodge of old phraseology and the style of the Chroniclers intermingled with the true Bulwerian sentiment and language at the affectation with which dialogue and narrative is interlarded with scraps of Norman French Saxon technicalities and names of common objects and cant ejaculations if they yawn with us over the authors tedious historical disquisitions over the Ossianic raptures of Hilda and his very lively and exciting fragments on verbal derivations and the literary references which thickly strew his pages if besides all this they can see into the secret bitter dislike of that devoted spirit of religion which with whatever personal weaknesses was the animating spirit of the ConfessorKing we have little expectation that the world will petition Sir Edward to continue his coquetting with the muse of history or to turn the events of our annals into a Salmngundi of truth ard falsehood From all this our readers will not suppose that we have found the perusal of Harold the last of the Saxon Kings a very pleasant refreshment in the hot weather of July In truth we have toiled through its pages with a dogged perseverance but with little pleasure and no interest Here and there indeed the story becomes more lively and brilliant and the volumes are not without many passages worthy of the fame of its author Especially towards the terniination when Sir Edward drops more and more his assumed office of annalist and writes like a man of common sense his tale becomes more readable and lifelike until all at once with the beginning of some new chapter the style of the modern novelist is laid aside and a foolish bad imitation of the antique cast of chronicle is thrust upon the reluctant attention We need scarcely say that Sir E B Lyttons ideas of the religious principles of the time of his story are in the last degree superficial and incorrect He writes as much nonsense about plriests and monks and relics and Churchservices as the scribblers of the vulgarest tales about Jesuits and convents His portraits of such mlen as King Edward and his notions of the sentiments by which he was guided are as laughable misconceptions of matters of fact as ever came forth from the pen of romancer or polemic The scene of the monarchs deathbed is one of the choicest specimens of absurdity we ever were fated to read It will please and edify our readers to see Sir Edwards ideas as to how a Christian King dies  The King lay for some moments silent but evidently striving to recollect his thoughts Meanwhile the two arch prelates bent over him Stigand eagerly Alred fondly Then raising himself on one arm while with the other he pointed to Harold at the foot of the bed the King said  Your hearts I see are with Harold the Earl so be it je loctroi At these words he fell back on his pillow a loud shriek burst from his wifes lips all crowded around he lay as the dead At the cry and the indescribable movement of the throng the physician came quick from the lower part of the hall He made his way abruptly to the bedside and said chidingly  Air give him air The throng parted the leech moistened the Kings pale lips with the cordial but no breath seemed to come forth no pulse seemed to beat and while the two prelates knelt before the human body and by the blessed rood the rest descended the dais and hatened to depart Harold only remained but he had passed from the foot to the head of the bed  The crowd had gained the centre of the hall when a sound that startled them as if it had come from the grave chained every footstepthe sound of the Kings voice loud terribly distinct and full as with the vigour of youth restored All turned their eyes

the land Then I asked in my sorrow  Can nought avert the doom  and may not my people free themselves by repentance like the Nmnevites of old And the prophets answered I Nay nor shall the calamity

Untold the Last of the Saxon Kings LOUDON SATURDAY JUNE 17 1848 REVIEWS By the Athor of Rienzi  The Last of the Barons c 3 vols Bentley x will be a misfortune attending the criticism of this new and in many respects able work of Sir E Bulwer Ly ton that those who write on itand indeed those who read itcan scarcely determine whether to treat it as history or as fiction If as history it is written with too much of the air of mere invention if as fiction it includes too many of the details ofthe chronicler This is an evil attending the choice of the subjectand one which though many have made the attempt only one author of the class has been able in any great degree to overcome To tbis rare and almost wonderful exception it is not necessary that we should more expressly refer but we must add that even in that case the experiment however generally successful occasioned many important distortions and perversions of factsand we will venture to say that it has produced especially in the present generation much doubt confusion and error as to characters opinions and events These observations are in a manner challenged by Sir E B Lyttons dedicatory preface and by the notes which he has placed at the foot of his page and appended to each of his volumes They appear to set up a claim for his fiction notwithstanding his denial of the pretension to the dignity and importance of history We hold it impossible to reconcile the two satisfactorily Either let us have a production of mere fancy or let us have a book depending mainly on its facts and statements the value of which can be measured by ordinary and known standards The author commences with informing us that he has abandoned thc usual course of historical narrative in his incidentshe makes a merit of perverting what has hitherto been received in relation to the connexion between Harold and Edith We admit at once that for his purpose he had 1 reason for making the changebecause itrenders the story not merely more interesting but on every account more readable On this point Sir E B Lytton observes  The love tory of Harold nnd Edith is told differently from the wellknown legend which implies a leis pure connexion But the whole legend respecting the Edeva faira Edith the fair whose name meets us in the Doomsday Roll rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal but which on many accounts I hope may be intrusted fearlessly to the young That is to wy he made this important deviation because he did not wish to have his novel banished from drawingroom tables and the boudoirs of he ordinary readers of such productions We should have complained less of aberrations of this kind if the writer had not been rather ostentatious of his authorities from hich he clearly means it to be inferred that n all the main incidents of his story he has adhered to the most authentic representations e do not dispute that in many instances he lias done sobut we think that he has thereby rendered his work less attractive His archaegy spoils his book as a fictionjust as his departures from the same injure it as history he has thus put a curb on his imagination both regardspersons and eventsand would have produced a better and more popular work had he subjected himself to none of these restraints As it is the old figure of a man dancing a hornpipe in fetters recurs to the reader We may be surprised that he can do so well thus loaded but feel sure that he could have done much better unencumbered In fact the author has most succeeded where he has most rejected the inconvenient restraints to which he elsewhere submitted and those portions of his three volumes will be read with most pleasure where he has given way to the variety and gracefulness of his own fancy and the vigour and boldness of his own imagination The description for instance of all that relates to the war of Harold against Gryffyth in Wales is unsurpassed in interest and power by anything from his pen We will select our first specimen from this part of Vol II premising that Gryffyth his queen and his starving followers have been shut up in a mountain fastness and that Harold by a monk and a young Norman has sent them a message of mercy on submission  As the monk ceased the thrill of the audience was perceptible and a deep silence waa followed by a general murmur as if to constrain the King Then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man The red spot flushed the dark cheek and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow He made one stride towards thc monk and said in a voice loud and deep and slow rolling far up the hillMonk thou hast said and now hear the reply ofthe son of Llewellyn the true heir of Roderic the Great who from tlie heights of Eryri saw all the lands of the Cvmrian sleeping under the dragon of Uther King was I bom and king will I die I will not ride by the bide of the Saxon to the feet of Edward the son of the spoiler I will not to purchase base life surrender the claim vain before men and the hour but solemn before God and posteritythe claim of my line nnd my people AU Britain is oursall the Island of Pines And the children of Hengist tire traitors and rebelsnot the heirs of Ambrosius and Uther Say to Harold the Saxon  Ye have left us but the tomb of the Druid and the hills of the eagle but freedom and royalty are ours in life and in deathnot for you to demand them not for us to betray Nor fear ye O my chiefs few but unmatched in glory and truth fear not ye to perish by the hunger thus denounced as our doom on these heights that command the fruits of our own fields No die we may but not mute and revengeletw Go back whispering warrior go back false son of Cymryand tell Harold to look well to his walla and his trenches We will vouchsafe him grace for his gracewe will not take him by surprise nor under cloud of the night With the gleam of our spears ami the clash of our shields we will come from tho hill and famineworn as he deems us hold a feast in his walls which the vultures of Snowdon illume their pinions to share  Rash man and unhappy cried the monk what curse drawest thou down on thy head Wilt thou be the murtherer of thy men in strife unavailing and vain  Heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt causeto be shed Be dumb hush thy screech lying raven exclaimed Gryffyth his eyes darting tire and his slight form dilating  Once priest and monk went before us to inspire not to daunt and our cry Alleluia  was taught us by the saints ofthe Church on the day when Saxons fierce and many as Harolds fell on the field of MaesGarmon No the curse is on the head of the invader not on those who defend hearth and altar Yea as the song to the bard the cursk leaps through my veins and rushes forth from my lips By the land they have ravaged by the gore they have spilt on these crags our last refuge below the carn on yon heights where the Dead stir to hear meI launch the curse of the wronged and the doomed on the children of Hengist They in turn shall know the steel of the strangertheir crown shall be shivered as glass and their nobles bc as slaves in the lund And the line of Hengist and Cerdic shall be rased from the roll of empire And the ghosts of our fathers shall glide appeased over the grave of their nation But wewe though weak in the body in the soul shall be strong to the last The ploughshare may pass over our cities but the soil shall be trod by our steps and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards Nor in the great Judgment Day shall any race but the race of Cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth to answer for the sins of the brave So impressive the voice so graud the brow and sublime the wild gesture of the King as he thus spoke that not only the monk himself was awed  not only though he understood not the words did the Norman knight bow his head as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct flashes out from the cloudbut even the sullen and widespreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment But the spearmen and multitude above excited by the tidings of safety to life and worn out by repeated defeat and the dread fear of famine too remote to hear the King were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators creeping from rank to rank and already they begun to sway and move and sweep slowly down towards the King Recovering his surprise the Norman again neared Gryffyth and began to reurge his mission of peace But the chief waived him back sternly and said aloud though in Saxon No secrets can pass between Harold and me Thus much alone take thou back as answerI thank the Earl for myself my Queen and my people Noble have been his courtesies as foe as foe I thank himas King defy The torque he hath returned to my hand he shall see again ere the sun set Messengers ye aro answered withdraw and speed fast that we may pass not your steps on the road The monk sighed and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle nnd a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there that the King was alone in his fierce defiance Then lifting again the rood he turned away and with him went the Norman The above and nearly all that belongs to it is inventionand very admirably invented it is We know nothing much more animating and inspiring than the whole that relates to the CatKing as GryfTyth is called by the Norman his struggles his defeats and his suffering We venture to think that Sir E B Lytton w much mistaken when he represents not merely the clergy but the young soldiers and courtiers of the reign of the Confessor as well acquainted with the literature of Greece and Rome It is true that as regards abbots and monks he is in compensation very severe He does justice to such ecclesiastics as Lanfranc and Aclred but he makes an abbot who figures prominently in one or two scenes ignorant ofthe commonest rudiments of Latinwhile a younger brother in his company is lost in wonder at the learning of his superior The following is a short part of their dialogue  The Kings Norman favourites at least honoured the Church That is true said an abbot 4 and an it were not for two things I should love the Norman better than the Saxon What are they my father asked an aspiring young monk Inprints quoth the abbot proud of the one Latin word he thought he knew but that as we see was an error they cannot speak so as to be understood and I fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning Here was a sanctified groanCount William himself spoke to me in Latin  continued the abbot raising his eyebrows Did he Wonderful  exclaimed several voices And what did you answer holy fatherMarrysaid the abbot solemnly I replied InprinisGood said the young monk with a look of profound admiration We have introduced this extract by way of contrast with the learning attributed to other classes Even of GryfTyth the CatKing of Wales we are told that his mind had turned from the literature of Rome to the legends and songs and chronicles of his land nnd other personages both Saxon and Norman refer to Greek and Latin authors with fur too much familiarity Homeric fables and Homeric personages are mentioned and alluded to by the characters and though we may be willing to admit that more learning existed among our AngloSaxon forefathers than has by many been supposed yet we most seriously doubt whether it is consistent with the state of knowledge of the time to put quotations from Horace into the mouth of a young soldierstill more that he should employ such in conversation with a rude Saxon from the weald of Kent Of course what the author introduces on his own account and in his own person in the progress of the narrative is not liable to any such objection  and whether it did or did not require to be translated in ad 1052 it is quite clear that Sir E B Lytton is of opinion that it requires to be translated in ad 1848for we cannot call to mind an instance in which he has employed a scrap of Latin where he has not done his readers the favour to render it into English Whatever might be the case in England in the eleventh century wo are sure that Greek was not studied in Italy even in thc thirteenth centuryand that Dante knew nothing of Homer unless at secondhand In connexion with this matter we may here not unfitly notice the great number of Saxon and AngloSaxon words employed by Sir E B Lytton without explanation even where explanation seemed most necessary If the absence of this explanation should have the effect of inducing the readers of  Harold to make themselves in some degree proficients in the great and noble language of their remote ancestors so much thc better  but in the mean time it might not have been improper to have added an interpretation in brackets or otherwise  provided it were really necessary that the author should go out of his way to employ terms so little understood by the great body of persons to whom he addresses himself Sometimes the context will enable the reader to guess what is meant but generally we think he will be quite at a loss for the meaning We copy a fewand but a fewregarding which we are confident even welleducated persons will be at some loss weregeld lithtmen ceorl suhcendinen cyst mane uses dour cnehts quern  which with many more are of perpetual occurrence We say nothing of such words as thegn which might have been more intelligibly and less cacophonously written thaneor of zemmes which Sir E B Lytton himself seems sometimes to use indifferently with gemsbut we should like to know what is gained by the rejection of a word having the same meaning and in daily employment The author seems to have crammed himself from Mr DEyncourts folios as he admits in his prefatory epistleand then fancied that matters familiar to him must also be well known to others This is an ordinary error The great reputation which the author has justly acquired enables him easily to afford that such minor faults and blemishes should be pointed out For this reason we tell him that ne is not to suppose because he sees in a plan of London of the middle of the sixteenth century two rings marked down for the baiting of bulls and bears and because the sport may be mentioned by Fitzstephen that these places existed on the same spot in the middle of the eleventh century His mention of these rings forms part of a very interesting but not a very accurate description of London before the Conquest in his first volume The truth is that we have no sufficient materials for such a description and on this account we are willing to take Sir E B Lyttons fanciful representation which is highly picturesque He is seldom at fault when he relies on himself and his own resources One instance to the contrary may however be pointed out near the end of his second volume where William then Count or Dukeof Normandy challenges Harold to bend his bowan exertion to which the Saxon noble is not accustomed and which therefore he declines The meaning of bending a bow is not as Sir E B Lytton seems to imagine the pulling of a clothyard arrow to the head after the bow has been strung it is stringing a bow an operation requiring both art and strength and dangerous to the weak and the unskilful Of the story itself we have said little because the rude outline of nearly the whole of it is to be found in historyif history it deserve at that early date to be called Tlie loves of Harold and Edith form but a small portion of the tale and as that is the most imaginative portion so iu several respects it is the best The character of the heroine is delicately and touchingly drawn  and her feminine sweetness and tenderness are excellently set off by and contrasted with the more masculine proportions and appearance of Hilda her magical and mysterious grandmotherwho from first to last acts a very prominent part in all that relates to Harolds affection and to his ambition She is a very grand personage who adheres to the Saxon faith rejecting the Christian creed and resorts to all the solemn and awful incantations belonging to her ancient superstitious It must be confessed that she now and then reminds us of Norna in Sir W Scotts  Pirate and of Meg Merrilies in his  Guy Mannering but it is only for a momentand in such a manner as could not have been avoided by the author What follows is a small part of a scene in which the two lovers and Hilda are introduced in the second volume   There is no joy for me returned Edith plaintively and I have that on my heart she added with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone  which at last I will dare to speak I reproach thee Hilda that thou hast marred all my life that thou hast duped me with dreams and lett me alone in despair Speak on said Hilda calmly as a nurse to a froward child Hast thou not told me from the first dawn of my wondering reason that mv life and lot were interwoven withwith the word mad and daring must out with those of Harold the peerless  But for that which my fancy took from thy lips as a law I had never been so vain and so frantic I had never watched each play of his face and treasured each word from his lips I had never made my life but a part of his lifeall my soul but the shadow of his sun But for that I had hailed the calm of the cloisterbut for that I had glided in peace to my grave And nownow O Hilda Edith paused and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command And she resumed quickly thou knowest that these hopes were but dreamsthat the law ever stood between him and meand that it was guilt to love him I knew the law answered Hilda but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird Ye are sibbe to each other some five times removed and therefore an old man at Rome saith that ye ought not to wed When the shavelings obey the old man at Rome and put aside their own wives and frillas and abstain from the wine cup and the chase and the brawl I will stoop to hear of their lawswith disrelish it may be but without scorn It is no sin to love Harold and no monk and no law shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together form and heart Hilda Hilda madden me not with joy cried Edith starting up in rapturous emotion her young face dyed with blushes and all her renovated beauty so celestial that Hilda herself was almost awed as if by the vision of Freya the northern Venus charmed by a spell from the halls of Asgard  But that day is distant renewed the Vaia What mattera what matters cried the pure child of Nature I ask but hope Enoughoh enough if we are but wedded on the borders of the grave  Lo then said Hilda behold the sunfthTS dawns again As she spoke the Vaia stretchy her arm and through the intersticed columns of th fane Edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward Presently into the space of the eire came Harold her beloved His face was pale jjiv grief yet recent but perhaps more than everdiiajv was in his step and command on his brow for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of Saxon England And what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of man as the pare sense of power responsible in an earnest soulThon comest said Hilda in the hour I predicted atthe setting ofthe sun and the rising of the star Vak1 said Harold gloomily  I will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies for who shall judge of that powet of which he knows not the elements  or despaetht marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture The earlier portion of the story is perhaps too much made up of obscure history to be very interesting and the only incidents in the first volume that may be said really to belong to a novel consist of the return of Earl Godwin and his four sons from banishment and the declaration by Harold of his love for Edithwho as we have seen stood within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity to him The incidents acquire a more rapid movement in the second volumeand the interest is powerfully wound up in the third They therefore who pause and look back when they have arrived at the end of 300 pages will feel dissatisfied let them wait until they have finished the whole and their dissatisfaction will then be that they have come to the end of the work It is not unusual in productions of this clan to find that the person intended for the hero ii not the hero in fact Such in a degree is the case with Harold In various parts of tht story he is not so much its hero as William Duke of Normandy the victor at Hastings and Sir E B Lytton has drawn the character of William with such force and fulness that when ht and Harold are together it is not to be disputed that William attracts more attention if not interest than his younger rival We do not say that the affections of the reader are not with Harold but the genius the resources the mental power and subtlety of William engross our admirationand would make us feel certain even if we knew nothing historically of the issue that he must triumph We admit all along the courage and generosity of Harold but as the author tells us his parts are comparatively slowand when in Normandy he was outwitted and would have been more so hut for the sagacity and penetration of his little nephew Haco This may be true as history bot it is not right as artand here we have a particular example of the difficulties of the historical novel We cannot go thoroughly and heartily along with any hero whom we expect to set duped and who we know in the end will be conqueredIAROLD THE LAST OF THE SAXoN KINGS In three volumes London Bentley 1848 It is by no means our intention to enter into any lengthened investigation of the merits of this work nor is it necessary so to do Sir Bulwver Lytton is not a new aspirant after literary honours but as we had long since been given to understand that he had made his last appearance before the literary world the present emanation from his pen naturally attracts a considerable share of attention nor is it without good reason that this attention is excited The present woi k may worthily rank with its predecessors on the score of merit Cast long back in our history the plot unravels itself before our eyes as naturally as if it were a tale of yesterday our author tells us he had long pondered upon the idea of founding an historical romance upon the Norman invasion and accordingly having done so he has rendered the subject completely his own and has thus been enabled to present us with details minute and graphic concerning that period of our history The auce was one fraught with interest as being the last hours of the old Saxon mnonarchy The legend of Harold and Edith is related but differently to the received opinion concerning it and this has been done out of consideration to the younger portions of the reading public into whose hands such a work may naturally be expected to faUl Superstition has much to do with the agency by which the events are brought about but it would seem almost impossible to discover these superstitions from the narratives of these timesthey were believed in thought to have a part in every action of life so that unless we consent to listen to the voice of superstition we must not expect to obtain a correct idea of our Saxon forefathers No terror is sought to be inepired by these ghostly aids they are simply used as valuable assistants in times of emergency The author has succeeded in pourtraying a very beautiful character in Edith she is firm noble and affectionate loving wvith an unselfish love that teaches her that the splendour of affection is manifested not by basking in the enjoyment it affords butt where necessary in sacrificing it upon a high and holy shrine Her love for Harold was too strong to wish to plunge him into danger for her sake even though it brought her all she coveted on earththe desire to be near him Harold is a very fine creation admirably sustained throughout

White Fane By Jack London Methuen 6s In spite of the fluency which is apparent in Jack Londons writing he has put a strange atmosphere of life into his story of the wolfdog White Fang and the story in consequence has an interest of his own  He knows his business as well as he knows his public and he knows both thoroughly He can make a readable story against any living man He would invent a story about a carrot as quickly as a man could wittie it into the shape of a face And there is quality in his work That comes from the immense pleasure which he takes in telling his tale It is as apparent as his fluency and is infectious White Fangs adventures are ingeniously varied He mounts the ladder as it were ol civilisation He is the son of a bitch by a wolf he becomes a Red Indians dog of all work  is sold by the Indian to a lunatic halfbreed who makes him savage and trains him as a fighter until he is saved from the jaws of a bulldog by a white man who tames him by love White Fang in turn saves his masters life lrom a desperate escaped robber and the book ends happily with the hero licking the nose of his puppy for he has won the love of the housecollie It is a capital story marred a little by the brutality of detail given in the fight with the bulldogWhit Fang Bv Jack London Methuen  Co This is a stirring story of the life of a wolfdognot the stately animal known to English breeders as the Irish wolfhound but a dog born of a pure wolf sire by a threequarter wolf dam It owes something to the work of Mr C G D Roberts the author of  Red Fox and similar books  but it is good in itself full of interest movement and vivid description We note however that Mr London does not write so well now as when his first book appeared He has learnt a good deal but he has learnt without discrimination Here is a story dealing with wild primitive life A literary artist would know the kind of language demanded by such a theme Mr London has failed here and failed badly His tale is packed full of absurdly precious idioms literary cliches and pompous little mannerisms He has come upon the phrase  what of used in the sense of  because of The thing has pleased him That is a matter of taste But because it pleased him he uses it on nearly every page of this simple story His puppets continually feel the  urge  of this or that instinct they sense this or that in their fellows this or the other thing constitutes the clay of them they have thick hair  back of  their ears This sort of jargon is not vivid or fine but simply irritating,juvenile

WUTHERING HEIGHTS0 ELLTs BELL and Acton Bell appear in the light of two names bor rowed to represent two totally different styles of composition and two utterly opposed models of treatment of the novel rather than to indicate two real personages They are names coupled together as mysteriously in the literary as the sons of Leda are in the asterial world and there is something at least gained by being mysterious at starting Wuthering Heigrhts by Ellis Bell is a terrific story associated with an equally fearful and repuLsive spot It should have beei called Withering Heights for any thing from which the mind and body would nitore instinctively shrink tltan the mansion and its tenants cannot be easily imagined W Wuthering however as expressive in provincial phraseology of tthe frequency of atmospheric tumults out of doors must do however much the said tumults may be surpassed in frequency and violence by the disturbances that occur in dloors Our novel reading experience does not enable us to refer to any thing to be compared with the personages we are introduced to at this desolate spota perfect misanthropists heaven CAgnes Grey Isy Acton Bell is a story of quite a different character It is a simple tale oi t governesss experiences and trials of love borne with that meekness and nmet by that fortitude that insure a final triumph It hias nn alvantage over its predecessor that while its lannuaoe is less ambitious anl less repulsive it fills the mind with a lastingtr picture of love and happiness succeeding to scorn and affliction and teaches us to put every trust in a supreme wisdoom and goodness,biography
XAk wiam me ferdwnr Jerk By Charles B Taylor I MA Author of  Records of a Good Mants Life c Chapma and Ha With much grace and vigour of conception and with great sweetness of imaginative sentiment this little work fails to produce in the reader that tranquil or elevated mood of mind which is the result of a true work of art This is owing to the attempt to make it at once an imaginative presentation and a didactic asay The fictitious narrative an the moral essay cannot be run in one they are incompatible The incidents have no effect by being kept in subordination to an opinion which is to be impressed and people will not understand the moral to be proved by them because their imaginary character is continually obtruding itself Poor Sambos advice  when you preachee preachee and when you floggee floggee may be paradied for the use of didactic novelists The story and the moral had better be served up on different plates as somebody recommended with reference to the butter and the hairs in it at a slovenly inn Imaginative literature can only promote moral culture indirectly by the tastes and habitual temper which converace with it encourages The felicity however with which many of the characters in this book are drawn and siipported justifies the belief that the author if he would confine himself to legitimate novel writing and keep his moral precepts for his sermons would be eminently successful in the portraiture of domestic life,juvenile
Young Benjamin Franklin or the Right Road through Life a Boys Book on a Boys Own Subject By Henry Mayhew With Illus trations by John Gilbert Bryce Young Benjamin Franklin is a biographic fiction that will meet with readers of mature years who will lay it aside acknowledging that it is healthy in tone and amusing notwithstanding the many violations of artistic orthodoxy which render it useless as a memoir and unsound as a view of life In his Preface Mr Mayhew defends himself by anticipation against the censure to which he feels he has rendered himself liableand in doing so explains both thc object and the internal structure of his work I give he says the present volume to the youth of the time in the hope that it may serve them for what I myself felt the want of more than anything after leaving Westminster School as a young man crammed to the tip of ones tongue with Latin and Greek and nothing else viz for something like a guide to what Uncle Ben calls the right road through life To accomplish this undertaking an endeavour is made to set forth tho means by which Benjamin Franklin acquired that purpose and will which not only raised him to the foremost rank of transatlantic statesmen and scholars but also enabled him emphatically to lead thc lifo of goodness The opening chapters in which little Ben is displayed in the domestic circle of the Boston tallowchandler pinned down to the ungrateful occupation of cutting wicks in readiness for  melting day dreading his fathers penal  strap devouring the pages of  Robinson Crusoe and running away from the home to which he is brought back penitent and scared aro of no common merit Indeed they arouse a hope that the succeeding chapters will give a vigorous picture of the society so admirably adapted for literary illustration in which the early years of Franklin were passed No such portrait is however attempted With the conclusion of Part I Mr Mayhew may be said to bid farewell to his subject as faras nature and troth are concerned Little Ben bet ween the years often and twelve ls given over to the tutelage of his Uncle Ben who takes him about Boston to see life and instils into his ductile mind the

The Pleasures of Art The World of Opinion  Tho Purport of Intellectual Pleasure and other similar subjects of a metaphysical nature that little boys often years old are known to prefer to skating or squalcs Surely so practical a writer as Mr Mayhew does not need to be told that the intellectual and moral characteristics of a remarkable man cannot reasonably be accounted for by showing that he enjoyed the advantages of associating with a septuagenarian who poured into his ear sonorous preachings about tning3 in general which like Coleridges monologues commenced without premises und ceased

Westminster career Franklins character was formed by the stern lessons taught him in the school of adversity by the stirring events of contemporary history by the political atmosphere he breathed in early manhood and more than all by the characters of thc men with whom he as a bold and inquiring young man was brought into contact But Mr Mayhews theory astounding as it is has more kinship to troth

British oak without any touch of Yankee veneering So also Uncle Ben is the peculiar product of the nineteenth century being compounded in equal parts of Wordsworth Lord Shaftesbury ami Mr Buckle In his Preface Mr Mayhew argues that he is justified in creating Uncle Ben and giving him such prominence in the drama by that Shakspeorian nile of art  which often throws an internal moral principle into an external dvamaiis pmmtn As the Witches in  Macbeth are Merely the outward embodiment in a weird and shadowy form of Macbeths own ambition and have obviously been introduced into the play with

the difference between the Witches in  Macbeth and the Uncle Ben of the childs story Shakspeares conception was in accordance with historic truth and the notiorh relative to supernaturalism that

Young Lives By Richard Le Gallienne Arrowsmith fis 7ms is Mr Le Galliennes third novel and taken with these that preceded itThe Quest of the Golden Girl and The Romance of Zion Chapelit shows us clearly what ara his powers and limitations in fiction It shows us that tos the qelineation of a certain type of young man a product of the best two decades Mr Le Gallienne has considerable gifts he young man is of the Nonconformist middle dasses His home ls strict arid pious His own bent however is for poetry and gladness He is frank impulsive enthusiastic generous warmhearted intolerant of alltiiat is dull and mechanical and very tolerant of whatever is  done beautifully however it may conflict with the moral code He is an agnostic with leanings towards elaborate ritual a busy but superficial reader his gods being Keats and Pater a dilletante in art the last word being found in the pictures of Rossetti ana BurneJones A sentimentalist he oan adore many young women at once and in rhyming  love  and  dova  and  bosom  and  blossom  he is expert If he knew more he would perhaps be more admirable but far less  lovable  and to be  lovable is his end in life That is the type of young man to whioh we refer a type whioh at this moment is common in London and in all the great towns all over the oountry and it is this young man whom Mr Le Gallienne oan set down with precision and literary skill And as we said last week in noticing another new novel every work that accurately reproduces a type is a contribution oi real value to fiction Mr Le Gallienne is not a good novelist he has neither the concentration nor the dramatio power needful He ia always the essayist astorytolling glad of an opportunity to digress But though he has little to toll in the book before us and though it moves spasmodically and ends anywhere we oan imagine a great many simple people reading it with pleasure Especially in the provinces will it be enjoyed The tone is bright and sunny and the characters are pretty and gay But the readers will have to be simple we fear because with the exception of the type who rings true there is a great deal of chocolatebox unreality about the story Baptist ministers for example onwhose shelves is all the most exquisite literature of doubt are not really named Chrysostom Trotter It is largely these wilful little perversions of fact which Mr Le Gallienne always indulges in that keep sophisticated readers from his works But for their especial benefit we take it the author baa inserted iri thia story a chapter d clef describing a certain literary set whom his hero meets in the rooms of an enterprising publisher Mr Le Gallienne here hits round him with spirit sparing not even himself We quote a passage Presently there entered a tall young man with a long thin face curtained on eaoh side with enormous messes of black hairlike a slip of the young moon glimmering through a pine wood At the same moment there entered as if by design his very eatithesis a short firmlybuilt clerkly fellow with a head hkea billiardball in need of a shave a big brown  moustitohs aad enormous spectacles   That said the publisher referring to the mooninthepiriewood young man is our young apostle of sentiment our new maa of feeling the besthated maa we have and the other is our young apostle of blood He is all for musole aad brutalityaaa he makai all the mouser It is oae of our many fashions just now to sing  Britain aad Brutality But my impression is that our yoong maa of feeling wul have his daythough he will have to wait for it He would hasten it if he would cut his hair but tbat he says he will never do His hair is his battlecry aad hair too he says is a gift Well he enjoys himself and loves a fight though you mightnt think it to look at him In laying Young Lives aside we cannot honestly say it has interested us but it is innocent and bright and young and it is written with careYoung Lives Bv Richard Le Gallienne Bristol Arrowsmith A Duet with an Occasional Chorus By A Conan Doyle Grant Richards Here is another volume of secondrate sentiment from Mr Richard Le Gallienne We cannot profess to say whether it is autobiographical or notat any rate it reads as if it were meant to be It describes the little troubles and joys of a priggish literary young man in a Northern town whose home surroundings as is usual with literary young men of the kind who write about their homes were uncongenial The young manto the benefit probably of the home to judge from the way he describes himself as talking to his fatherdetermined to leave these surroundings and to set up for himself in literature He gets some poems published he falls in love and he keeps up his affection for his sister But it all reads false somehow The young man is most devoted to his sister which is very right and proper and charming no doubt but he is not content with that and must needs analyze his feelings and her feelings and explain to all the world why he was so fond of her and she of him as if their affection was something extraordinary and something to be inordinately proud of It is the same with his sweetheart Angel they go about trying to find recondite reasons and explanations for simple sentiments They see a Rossetti picture which they admire and they call it their Church and their altar They are probably not conscious hypocrites but they are the worse kind of unconscious hypocrites who having a fine feeling think they have it move really as soon as they have put a label on it and talked about it to the world The sentimentalist is the man who is not sure enough of himself to express his feelings as they are so he clothes them in terms which he imagines add a conventional dignity This book is full of that kind of sentimentality and it is bad Mr Conan Doyles tale on the other hand certainly does not err on the side of excessive sentimentality It is a story of two very commonplace and worthy young people who make love and get married Their attitude towards life is profoundly unimaginative and they would probably have been an exceedingly dull young couple to meet But they are fine in character and in the essentials of life are clean and straightforward The book is an excellent picture of the best sort of honest middleclass respectability which is unassuming and not discontented Of the two sets of characters Mr Doyles characters would certainly have less to talk about than Henry and Angel but in fiction they are distinctly more amusing and interesting for they are genuine and they are described simply and without affectation If Mr Le Gallienne did not convey the impression that he thought his people very fine they would be more tolerable but without a suspicion of satire they are duller than the limited yet excellent Crosses,biography
