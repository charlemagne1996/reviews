B4125,"['6252765', '8640526']",  transformation or the romance of monte beni by natl a niel hawthorne 3 vols smith  eldersince the publication of his last work seven years ago mr hawthorne has spent some time in rome where the scenes of  transformation  are almost exclusively laid judging from internal evidence we should conclude that his visit to the eternal city was very short limited probably to two or three winter or early spring months and of course including the carnival although the book is full of rome and of art the authors acquaintance with either is evidently superficial of italian rome he knows nothing of rome in summer he knows nothing of society and even of that curious phase of society exhibited by the  artist life  in rome he knows little or nothing it is true that none of those subjects fall specially within the scope of his book but any one who has lived long in rome and penetrated however slightly within the barriers of galleries and studios must have shown some glimpses of the knowledge he would thus acquire for which we look in vain through the three volumes of  transformation every thing told us about the city itself might have been gathered during a few weeks perambulation of its streets under the charge of a clever cicerone or with the perhaps more intelligent companionship of a guidebook and as for art mr hawthornes treatment is very simple he takes some of the most celebrated works guidos  beatrice cenci  archangel michael or the  cleopatra and makes studies of them though not with the sympathies of a pictorial but those of a rhapsodical artist in other respect also his sympathies are singularly narrow and national that the personages of his fiction when anglosaxon it alleven to the anonymous priest who crosses the storyshould be american or as the author prefers to call them new englanders is excusable enough he has the most perfect right to select his characters from his fellowcountrymen but that every modern work of art which he mentions with eulogy should be the production of new england genius while the only old english name introduced is that of gibson brought forward solely to controvert that artists wellknown theory of tinted statuary shows a narrow exclusiveness of mind which we did not expect to find in mr hawthorne the chief excellence of the book lies in its descriptive passage mr hawthorne has a quick eye for scenery natural or architectural with a vivid style and ready command of pictorial language which euable him to describe with force and felicity his enthusiasm for antiquity and art is also genuine though somewhat spasmodic as a work of fiction  transformation with its scanty incident its unsolved mystery and its inconclusive conclusion will hardly satisfy the english novelreader the story more a mystery than a horror would seem to have been founded upon that remarkable legend mentioned in  coningsby of the highly respectable county family of featherstonehaugh who for several generations had been distinguished by the strange and humiliating peculiarity of being born with sheeps tailsa fact which they had kept secret for generations but at length they took decided measures to get rid of this inconvenient appendage so  transformation  represents first the peculiarity and then the change which befalls a certain donatello count of monte beni who was born to long furry ears like a faun at his first introduction to the reader donatello is standing by the faun of praxiteles and some artist friends comment upon the resemblance between the man and the statue not only in external likeness but also in character  no faun in arcadia says one of them  was ever a greater simpleton than donatello he has hardly a mans share of wit small as that is it is a pity that there are no longer any of this congenial race of rustic creatures for him to consort with the resemblance is afterwards worked out with much skill and gracefulness marred only by incessant references to donatellos strange reluctance to show his ears on this lighthearted halfwitted and irresponsible creature a total change is effected by the perpetration of a hideous crime the agent of his transformation is called miriam who seems to have dispensed with any other name a being of course endowed with surpassing beauty who lives in a studio and is a mystery she is persecuted by a most disreputablelooking old man who claims to possess some secret by which he is enabled to control her destiny his name is never told nor his secret revealed and the whole idea has been oftenand we must add much betterworked out in the london journal and other penny periodicals donatello who has become attached to miriam gets provoked by the reiterated appearances of her persecutor always at inopportune moments and at length takes an opportunity of tumbling him over the tarpeian rock the revulsion caused by this crime transoms him from a halfwitted lighthearted faun to a responsible but melancholy man a strange and uncomfortable sort of connexion then springs up between the pair whom this murder has joined together and their final fate is left in impenetrable mystery miriam throughout the btory has nothing womanlike about her she resembles rather what the old demonologiets termed a  succubus and is last seen tossing her arms wildly about in the pantheon of donatellos destiny we can form only an unpleasant suspicion that he has fallen into the hands of the police besides this pair there is another hilda and kenyon the former a paintress and type of virgin purity the latter a sculptor and a model loverboth natives of new england and both mere abstractions or rather lay figures who talk aesthetics and philosophy get mixed up more or less with miriams mystery and donatellos crime make love to one another in a very insipid manner and in the end marry and return to their native land mr hawthorne has done and we hope will do much better than this we trust to meet him again on more congenial scenes his  scarlet letter and  house with seven gables have shown that he can draw the character of new englanders right well when he meets them  at home  in new england  transformation or the romance of monte beni by nathaniel hawthorne 3 vols smith elder  co not with impunity can a novelist produce two such bookseach of its class perfectas the scarlet letter and the house of the seven gables he is expected to go on and his third and fourth romances will be measured by their two predecessors without reference to the fact that there may be slow growth and solitary perfection in works of genius the yew and the locusttree have different natural habits then for one to whom all europe is looking for a part of its pleasure to stop the course of his labours is a piece of independence hard to forgive thirdly there is hazard in an attempt to change the scale of creative exercise when an artist has shown himself perfect in the one originally adopted the masters of cabinet  painting whom it would be wise to commission to cover a ceiling are not many raphael could produce the pitti ezekiel and the cartoons it is true rembrandt could paint the temple scene in jerusalem which england possesses as also the gigantic duke of gueldres in the berlin gallery  but raphaels and rembrandts are few it is only fit fair and friendly that the above three considerations should be allowed their full weight in adjudging the merit of mr hawthornes fourth and longest work of fiction produced after the pause of many years it would be idle to appeal to them were the production which calls them forth not a remarkable oneone of the most remarkable novels that 1860 is likely to give us whether from english french or american sources such an italian tale we have not had since herr andersen wrote his  improvisatore how potent is the spell of the south as filling the memories and quickening the imagination of the stranger how powerless over her own strongest sons in literary works of art and fancy we have occasion to see almost as often as we take up an italian novel mr hawthorne has drunk in the spirit ofitalian beauty at every pore the scene of this romance is principally at rome and the writers intense yearning to reproduce and accumulate his recollections of that wonderful city appears to have again and again possessed itself of heart and pen to the suspense not damage of his story who would object to avait for the progress of passion and the development of mystery on being beckoned aside into such a land of rich and melancholy enchantment as is disclosed in the folloaving exquisite picture of the borghese gardens  the entrance to these grounds as all my readers know for everybody nowa days has been in rome is just outside of the porta del popolo passing beneath that not very impressive specimen of michael angelos architecture a minutes walk will transport the visitor from the small uneasy lava atones of the roman pavement into broad gravelled carriagedrives whence a little farther stroll brings him to the soft turf of a beautiful seclusion a seclusion but seldom a solitude for priest noble and populace stranger and native all who breathe the roman air find free admission and come hither to taste the languid enjoyment of the daydream that they call life   the scenery amid which the youth now strayed was such as arrays itself in the imagination when we read the beautiful old myths and fancy a brighter sky a softer turf a more picturesque arrangement of venerable trees than we find in the rude and untrained landscapes of the western world the ilextrees southeast ancient and timehonoured were they seemed to have lived for ages undisturbed and to feel no dread of profanation by the axe any more than overthrow by the thunderstroke it had already passed out of their dreamy old memories that only a few years ago they were grievously imperilled by the gauls last assault upon the walls of rome as if confident in the long peace of their lifetime they assumed attitudes of indolent repose they leaned over the green turf in ponderous grace throwing abroad their great branches without danger of interfering with other trees though other majestic trees grew near enough for dignified society but too distant for constraint never was there a more venerable quietude than that which slept among their sheltering boughs never a sweeter sunshine than that now gladdening the gentle bloom which these leafy patriarchs strove to diffuse over the swelling and subsiding lawns in other portions of the grounds the stonepines lifted their dense clump of branches upon a slender length of stem so high that they looked like green islands in the air flinging down a shadow upon the turf so far off that you hardly knew which tree had made it again there were avenues of cypress resembling dark flames of huge funeral candles which spread dusk and twilight round about them instead of cheerful radiance the more open spots were all abloom even so early in the season with anemones of wondrous size both white and rosecoloured and violets that betrayed themselves by their rich fragrance even if their blue eyes failed to meet your own daisies too were abundant but larger than the modest little english flower and therefore of small account these wooded and flowery lawnb are more beautiful than the finest of english parkscenery more touching more impressive through the neglect that leaves nature bo much to her own avays and methods since man seldom interferes with her she sets to work in her own quiet way and makes herself at home there is enough of human care it is true bestowed long ago and still bestowed to prevent wildness from groaving into deformity and the result is an ideal landscape a woodland scene that seems to have been projected out of a poets mind if the ancient faun were other than a mere creation of old poetry and could have reappeared anywhere it must have been in such a scene as this in the openings of the wood there are fountains plashing into marble basins the depths of which are shaggy with waterweeds  or they tumble like natural cascades from rock to rock sending their murmur afar to make the quiet and silence more appreciable scattered here and there with careless artifice stand old altars bearing roman inscriptions statues grey with the long corrosion of even that soft atmosphere half hide and half reveal themselves high on pedestals or perhaps fallen and broken on the turf terminal figures columns of marble or granite porticoes arches are seen in the vistas of the woodpaths either veritable relics of antiquity or with so exquisite a touch of artful ruin on them that they are better than if really antique at all events grass grows on the tops of the shattered pillars and weeds and flowers root themselves in the chinks of the massive arches and fronts of temples and clamber at large over their pediments as if this were the thousandth summer since their winged seeds alighted there what a strange ideawhat a needless labourto construct artificial ruins in rome the nativesoil ofruin buteventhesesportiveimitations wrought by man in emulation of what time has done to temples and palaces are perhaps centuries old and beginning as illusions have grown to be venerable in sober earnest the result of all is a scene pensive lovely dreamlike enjoyable and sad such as is to be found nowhere save in these princely villaresidences in the neighbourhood of rome a scene that must have required generations and ages during which growth decay and mans intelligence wrought kindly together to render it so gently wild as we behold it now the final charm is bestowed by the malaria there is a piercing thrilling delicious kind of regret in the idea of so much beauty thrown away or only enjoyable at its halfdevelopment in winter and early spring and never to be dwelled amongst as the homescenery of any human being for if you come hither in summer and stray through these glades in the golden sunset fever walks arminarm with you and death awaits you at the end of the dim vista thus the scene is like eden in its loveliness like eden too in the fatal spell that removes it beyond the scope of mans actual possessions in other pages the catacombs of st calixtus the tarpeian rock the pantheon no less poetically and richly frame scenes of a passion and wild interest in harmony with their beauty most of all do we enjoy mr hawthornes sympathy with the worlds cathedral st peters having rebelled for years against the bigotry with which sticklers for pointed arches or unlearned constructions have decried this gorgeous centre of the roman catholic rite as a place mundane theatrical and out of style for such censors art nature and beauty have no existence save by the complacent favour of their own vanity we have inadvertently touched on the great scenic power and beauty of this italian romance ere offering a word on its matter and argument whether the elevating influences of remorse on certain natures have ever been taken as the theme of a story so fearlessly as here may be questioned casuists and moralists must discuss the truth of the data to mr hawthorne truth always seems to arrive through the medium of his imaginationsome faroff fantasy to suggest a train of thought and circumstance out of which philosophies are evolved and characters grow his hero the count of monte beni would never have lived had not the faun of praxiteles stirred the authors admiration and this mythical creature so engaged the dreamers mind that he draws out of the past the fancy of an old family endowed with certain constant attributes of sylvan gaiety and careless semianimal enjoyments such as belonged to the dances and sunshine of arcady such is donatello at the beginning of the tale and with these qualities are mixed up unquestioning simple love and fidelity which can take a form of unreasoning animal fury in a moment of emergency he is hurried into sudden murder for thesake of the woman he loves and with that the faun nature dies out and the sad consciencestricken human being begins in the writhings of pain to think to feellastly to aspire this in a few words is the meaning of  transformation and for the first moiety of the romance the story tums slowly with windings clearly to be traced yet poaverfully round its principal figure the other characters mr hawthorne must bear to be told are not new to a tale of his miriam the mysterious with her hideous tormentor was indicated in the zenobia of the blithedale romancehilda the pure and innocent is own cousin to phoebe in the house of the seven gableskenyon the sculptor though carefully wrought out is a stone image with little that appeals to our experience of men these are all the characters and when it is added that miriam is a magnificent paintress with a mystery that hilda is a copyist of pictures from new england and that kenyon is her countryman enough has been told to define the brain creatures who figure in the avild  romance of monte beni mr haavthorne must be reckoned aith for the second moiety of his book in spite of the delicious italian pictures noble speculations and snatches of arresting incident which it contains we knoav of little in romance more inconclusiae and hazy than the manner in which the tale is brought to its close hints will not suffice to satisfy interest which has been excited to voracity every incident need not lead to a mathematical conclusion nor coup de thcutrc as in the comedies of m scribe but the utter uncertainty which hangs about every one and every thing concerned in the strong emotions and combinations of half of this romance makes us part company with them as though ave avere aavaking

regards its merits and its powers of entertainment when we state that it is a sort of new arabian nightswith all the oriental tone and imagery of those fascinating fictionsall their rich and wild

B8877,['4358623'],  the queens miaries  as historical novel may win success in one of two ways it may either command attention by truthful and lifelike delineations of historical characters or it may awaken a milder kind of interest by taking up a period of history with which the novelreading public are not generally familiar the former is the method of the great masters of the art the latter is the method of writers who have sense enough to le conscious of mediocrity the one is associated with the name of sir walter scott the other with the anae of mr p r1 james the latter writer has been as to this matter wise in his generation his two horsemen are almost always discovered taking their accustomed ride on a summer evening during the exciting days of the league we know many very wellinformed people who have derived their principal knowledge of french history from a diligent perusal of such works as the  huguenot  rose dalbret and one in a thousand and it is undoubtedly pleasant to have historical information of some value thus tacked on to the fortunes of a young couple tried by many sorrows but certain to be made happy at the end on the other hand writers like sir e dward boliver lytton aiming unsuccessfuilly at the highest triumphs of art disregard the inferior source of interest to which we have referred and produce accordingly bad novels in the present instance mr whyte melville has done the same the  queens maries is we are sorry to say a very bad novel there can be nothing new to tell any one about the life of queen mary from her arrival in scotland till her marriage with darnley hence the most ignorant reader can get no information from these volumes we have here no historical knowledge made easy everybody knew before all that mr whyte melville records neither has the author succeeded in the delineation  the queens manes a romauce of holyrood by g j whyte mielvle two tols parker so  bourn of historical character on the contrary the

bothwell has been borrowed from the pretentious doggerel which mvr aytoun published some years ago under the name of a poem the borderer is delineated as from the first the unselfish lover of his queen  anl the brutality and cowardice which he displayed when he hat won the object of this pure devotion are glossed over in grandiloquent and meaningless sentences such as these 1the nman who would once have shed his hearts blood freely to shield her front the lightest injury goaded into madness ere longr snatched wildly at her beauty soiling her petals with unknightly hand and draaging the beloved one with him ruthlessly and shamelessly to the dust eveni uiore prfposterous if possile is mr melvilles portraiture of the regent alurray sir walter scott is not generally supposel to have been severe on queen miary or to have been very favourably disposed to the party which dethroned her yet in the abbot he dlescribes the regent as that distinguished statesman who possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed  and had he succeelel to the throne ais his legitimate inhleritance it is probable he wolul have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kingrs and this mnan mr melville brings before us as a lowm11inded shortsighted intriguer whose profoundest policy was to keep sober when other people were gretting drunk and whose highest statesmanship was to poison couriers at supper we should hardly have paused to commilent upon folly such as this were it not so very widespread just at present to be a jacobite or rather to affect to be a jacobite is nowadays a pleasant pastime it is cornme it faut it calls forth elegant sentimental writing and it affords opportunity for the covert insinuation that the elegant sentimental writer is a man t once of fine feeling and of high family but it is not real and it is not true it is a bad sig both of our historical knowledge and of our love of truth that within the last few years sir walter scott should have been more than once impeached as too little of a jacobiteas too severe upon queen mary and on claverhouse the fact is that mr whyte melville is not fitted to be an historical novelist he can write admirably the novel of our own dayhe can paint accurately the manners which le sees around him his true hero is the fast young man of the nineteenth century with high qualities hitherto undeveloped  his true heroine is the wellbred yotung lady of the same date admiring the fastness yet capable of appreciating the latent altitudes  digbv grand was his representative book in this line lie is without at rival he is above the schoolboy melodramaamusing though it beof frank fairlegh and lewis arundel  he is free from the taint of blackguardismn which mnars real ability in the author of  the sword and the gown  and he is immeasurably superior to the vulgarity of lady lees widowhood more than this mr melville always commands a style of much beauty and power and he sometimes reaches to genuine poetic feelingi  the old old story with all its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow was never told more touchingly than in the interpreter but he cannot write an historical novel in the first place he wants knowledge no byways of history are familiar to him by guiding us through which he might gain our attention he is forced to go in the beaten tracks and readers grow weary as they recognise the wellknown footimarks in the second place he wants imaginative power his characters are mere automiata whetherehis conceptions of them be right or wrong his representations of them are never lifelike he knows thoroughly the dandy of the park and can draw himr truly he is a thorough realist and can reproduce whatever he has seen and understood but the house of commons even of our own day would be somewhat beyond him and with the statesmen of past ages he is quite helpless holmby house was a striking instance of this the interest of that novel was entirely derived from the romantic lovestory which ran through it and which was ended so beautifully and so happily under the oaktree in the old park in northamptonshire every historical character in the book from falkland to cromwell was a mistake the same holds good as to  the queens maries with this unfortunate difference that while the historical part of the latter work is as bad as that of  holmnby house there is here no lovestory which can interest the most inveterate novelreader the whole plotif so it can be calledconsists in narrating the loves and alliances of queen mary and of her four maids of honour one of these young ladies falls in love with chastelar and when that worthy is executed for having taken the slight liberty of coming into the queens bedchamber at midnight nothing is left to the lady into whose bedchamber he did not come but to go into a convent and die which she accordingly does the second maid of honour falls in love with bothwells henchman the henchman is killed and the lady devotes herself like jephthas daughter to perpetual virginity the third faills in love with the english ambassador is jilted by him and then consents to marry a gentleman called ogilvy the fourth conducts herself much the most rationally of all throughout the whole story she loves and is loved by a worthy young mnan called maxwell whom she duly marries after she has succeeded in convincing him that a gentleman whom she is in the habit of meeting clandestinely in the gardens of holyrood is her exiled father and not a favoured lover finally as to the queen  still the stately flower bloomed on fair and fragrant under the pure air of heaven fair and fragrant in the close confinement and the darkened daylight of a prisonhouse all this is very sorry work there is nothing in the booknot even incident instead of the usual huntingfield with its impossible leaps we have a hawkingparty on the links of saint andrews composed of the

all was well as ho peered over the low bows of the vessel  his sailors eyo saw that all the strands of the cable but one were parted   and walking aft he knocked at the door of the stateroom occupied by lieutenant william bligh     though cable is nearly chafed through sir or the strands have parted there was a strong squall just before daylight and the ship strained very heavily upon it i think  keep your opinions to yourself you are a dd careless fellow and not fit even to keep anchor watch where is it chafed   about a fathom below the water sir answered the young man     bah said the

commander who conspired unconsciously with the young women of tahiti to provoke the mutiny on though bounty and to produce the extraordinary community on pitcairn island the story ends with the death

pitcairn island tales of adventure by louis becke and walter jeffery fisher unwin  probably there never ha3 been a narrative richer in romantic scenes than this account of the mutiny of the bounty and the experiences of capt bligh and of his comrades cut adrift in the middle of the pacific ocean the subsequent career of his wouldbe murderers constitutes an episode of crime seldom equalled and never surpassed but we do not remember that they have ever been the subject of a romance either in prose or verse except in byrons poem of the island our authors are already favourably known for their tales of adventure in the pacific islands the inhabitants of which have been thoroughly studied by them  they have dealt with their ample materials skilfully dwelling with much severity on capt blighs tyranny which caused not only this mutiny but also an outbreak in new south wales from which colony he was unceremoniously shipped and sent home his heroism and fortitude in safely navigating an open boat for a distance of 1400 miles proved that he must have possessed sterling merit it is however with the subsequent action of the mutineers that the reader is chiefly concerned the story of the loves of the sailors and the women of tahiti  white men and brown womenwho accompanied them to pitcairn island may be somewhat erotic but probably it is characteristic of this unusual form of courtship the narrative of the crimes which followed is of course more or less fanciful murder followed murder until only one of the original crew of the bounty survived all these are sensationally recounted the strangest point of the story and this is trueis that the survivor adams instead of being brutalised by his surroundings developed into an earnest christian and educated the hybrid offspring of these unions with a success which scarcely corroborates the usual view of the incorrigible depravity of humanity their primitive innocent simplicity the total absence of immorality and their genuine good nature have been the marvel of the few who have visited that lovely isle to this part of their subject our authors have done but scant justice although they have alluded to it and yet they might have added a most interesting chapter to their romance the reader of the gold finder by george griffith white  co will be surprised by the contrast between the commencement and the conclusion of the story it opens with a murder a felony or two and an  accursed bloodlegacy all leading up to the conventional hunt for the treasure of a wrecked spanish galleon of bygone days the real purport of the story becomes evident about halfway through the book lt contains the adventures of a modern pirate equipped with steam dynamite cartridges and the most approved instruments of modern warfare not satisfied with this the author causes certain parties to fit out a piratecatcher of equally perfect design and equipment and the story finishes with a bloody fight in which the villains are destroyed it reads like the history of a latterday alabama and so far as the narrative is concerned it constitutes a very readable volume of adventure and seafighting the little goldmagnet which points with the greatest nicety to though nearest piece of the precious metal plays a very subsidiary part in this volume the author evidently thinks that it is capable of better things in a literary sense for he concludes with the assurance that the magnet wrought wonders in the hands of its new and lawful possessors and that of these wonders  there will be more to tell

B1941,['6724682'],  the deemster  a romance by hall caine in 3 vols chatto this book would be welcome if only on the ground that it is well worthy of the author of the shadow of a crime in shifting his scene of action from the hills of cumberland to the isle of man mr hall caine has left behind him none of his three great gifts of imagination pathos and humour and he has found a people even more distinct than  cumshire folk with characters as well suited to exhibit human passion in its simplicity and a dialect as rich and racy as any in the north of england in addition he has found a story of intense terror mixed with intense pathos readers of focsle yarns will not be surprised at the attraction of the isle of man and its people to the writer of romance and will be glad that the field has been entered by so capable an author as mr hall caine it is to be hoped that the deemster himself is not a character common in the island for he is the incarnation of all that is most mean and despicable in human nature selfish cruel crafty and cowardly he is the evil genius of the piece and is drawn perhaps more thoroughly and carefully than any other of the characters it is he who manages to draw to himself in his fathers lifetime all his fathers property and turns his defrauded brother out of doors it is he who buys his wife of her father the archdeacon and breaks her heart with his infidelity in the first years of their married life it is he who cultivates the evil in his nephew dan and invents the lie which brings about the death of his own son ewan all through the book from the beginning to the welldeserved misery of his death he acts as a subtle malign influence poisoning the air little he gets by it except his barren position of power and the hatred of ail utterly without religion but superstitious to extreme his time is spent in doing illdeeds and striving to bribe providence to avert punishment one of the least adroit and most ridiculous of villains the evil he tries to do is always rebounding on his own head and the devil himself must have laughed when after haranguing the people and the bishop his brother as to the illdeeds of the bishops son and declaring that he will not lift a finger against the man who killed him he turns round to find that the corpse which was the subject of his oration was not that of his nephew but of his own son ewan the fact that the evil done by the deemster is not generally the exact injury contemplated by him but the casual action of a spirit of evil emanating from his infernal disposition is characteristic of the book it is not by themselves only and their passions that the fates of the principal characters are determined  and it is this which distinguishes the deemster rom what are usually called  romances the term serves to distinguish it from the novel or picture of modern life and manners but despite its narrativeform the spiritual grandeur of its conception and the tremendous character of the forces engaged raise it to the region of tragic drama among these forces the passions of though characters no doubt play the greatest part but above beyond and around these are the unseen if not supernatural powers of accident it is not without the aid of a network of circumstance woven by superstition and misconception and a thousand other impalpable devils that the noble natures of dan and ewan are brought into collision and dragged down to death and hell what mr hall caine calls the perfidy of circumstance is the great motor of the drama and dreams and presages second sight and curses superstitious terrors and evil thoughts all of them giving wings as it were to diverse spirits of evil which make a havoc of noble characters and lives of fair promise perform for him much the same office as the loves and hatreds of the gods with their emissaries of fates and furies dreams and omens for the poets and dramatists of greece it is this that raises the deemster into the rank of highest art and makes it not so much a romantic story of a few human individuals as a tragic poem of human life and fate yet the manner is that of a simple tale the characters are not complex they speak plain unconventional unpoetical english often the homespun of manx of analysis of character there is little the narrative if singularly vivid and abounding in remarkable incident is told without strain  fine  as the writing is in the best artistic sense there is not a word of what is usually called  fine writing to use an epithet once in favour with critics the method of presenting the facts to the reader is objective everything is described as if seen the characters are left mainly to reveal themselves by their deeds and the speech born of occasion the reader is a spectator not a confidant in describing the childhood of dan and ewan and mona the author employs anecdote mainly to distinguish character and even with regard to the deemster the most subtle of all the charactew we learn more by watching his deeds and listening to his words than by explanation of the author mr hall caine however mikes us know his men and women as well as if he told us all about them taeir presence their gestures the greater motives of their being are clear to us it is no minute and detailed portraiture but it is complete so far as is needed to distinguish one soul from another in force dan mylrea the bishops ungovernable son stands out clear from the resta being of intemperate will and passion beyond control but noble and honest withal capable of falling deeper and rising higher than ordinary mortals a scapegrace and prodigal on a grand scale gifted with the splendid health enormous strength and generous nature which made him a hero to his inferiors with the worst part of his nature j encouraged by his uncle the deemster and the best part of it but weakly attracted by the saintly example of his father the bishop he spends a youth of riot and instead of entering the church becomes the proprietor of a fishing smack after drinking away with his men the years earnings of the boat he pays his crew with a bill on which he forges the name of his cousin  the pazon as security ewan saves him from disgrace hy acknowledging the signature but his father casts him off and ewan while permittiog him to live in his house withdraws his friendship and forbids him from intercourse with his sister mona now the love between ewan and dan had surpassed the love of women and mona had been his dearest playfellow so was dan cut off from all the good influences of his life  they are taking the wrong way with me said dan dan does not improve he ruins his father by mismanaging his farm commits numerous excesses and the relations between himself and ewan become more and more strained one day a vile story is told to ewan by his father the deemster and maddened by the belief that dan has seduced mona he seeks him with a murderous heart pride and passion forbidding explanation they fight like devils and ewan reels and falls over the cliff far from this being the end of the story the events that follow are even more original striking and terrible and reveal more completely the genius of the author the truly tragic scene between dan and mons in which mona declares her love for the slayer of her brother the attempt of dan and his crew to bury the body at sea when it slips its weights and sails away to land the return of the boat the surrender of dan and his terrible expiation under the sentence of his father and the final scenes of the sweating sickness and the part dan played therein are all grandly conceived and grandly executed no doubt much fault might be found with the book while calling itself a romance it aims at such an appearance of literal truth that we cannot help asking ourselves if oil crist mylrea was really the bishop of mw at the beginning of last century and was brother to the deemster and our confidence in its realistic veracity on the one hand and our acceptance of the romantic illusion on the other are both weakened the book is too full of extraordinary incidents the curse of mrs kerruish is fulfilled so fully and literally the secondsight of kerry is so terribly accurate the story proceeds by such a constant succession of marvels that it is only the singular skill with which they are introduced and the convincing manner with which they are described that prevent faith from halting but after all these are small things compared with the undeniable grandeur and beauty of this work of art cosmo monkhouse,omance

B3660,"['6252765', '8640526']",  transformation or the romance of monte beni by natl a niel hawthorne 3 vols smith  eldersince the publication of his last work seven years ago mr hawthorne has spent some time in rome where the scenes of  transformation  are almost exclusively laid judging from internal evidence we should conclude that his visit to the eternal city was very short limited probably to two or three winter or early spring months and of course including the carnival although the book is full of rome and of art the authors acquaintance with either is evidently superficial of italian rome he knows nothing of rome in summer he knows nothing of society and even of that curious phase of society exhibited by the  artist life  in rome he knows little or nothing it is true that none of those subjects fall specially within the scope of his book but any one who has lived long in rome and penetrated however slightly within the barriers of galleries and studios must have shown some glimpses of the knowledge he would thus acquire for which we look in vain through the three volumes of  transformation every thing told us about the city itself might have been gathered during a few weeks perambulation of its streets under the charge of a clever cicerone or with the perhaps more intelligent companionship of a guidebook and as for art mr hawthornes treatment is very simple he takes some of the most celebrated works guidos  beatrice cenci  archangel michael or the  cleopatra and makes studies of them though not with the sympathies of a pictorial but those of a rhapsodical artist in other respect also his sympathies are singularly narrow and national that the personages of his fiction when anglosaxon it alleven to the anonymous priest who crosses the storyshould be american or as the author prefers to call them new englanders is excusable enough he has the most perfect right to select his characters from his fellowcountrymen but that every modern work of art which he mentions with eulogy should be the production of new england genius while the only old english name introduced is that of gibson brought forward solely to controvert that artists wellknown theory of tinted statuary shows a narrow exclusiveness of mind which we did not expect to find in mr hawthorne the chief excellence of the book lies in its descriptive passage mr hawthorne has a quick eye for scenery natural or architectural with a vivid style and ready command of pictorial language which euable him to describe with force and felicity his enthusiasm for antiquity and art is also genuine though somewhat spasmodic as a work of fiction  transformation with its scanty incident its unsolved mystery and its inconclusive conclusion will hardly satisfy the english novelreader the story more a mystery than a horror would seem to have been founded upon that remarkable legend mentioned in  coningsby of the highly respectable county family of featherstonehaugh who for several generations had been distinguished by the strange and humiliating peculiarity of being born with sheeps tailsa fact which they had kept secret for generations but at length they took decided measures to get rid of this inconvenient appendage so  transformation  represents first the peculiarity and then the change which befalls a certain donatello count of monte beni who was born to long furry ears like a faun at his first introduction to the reader donatello is standing by the faun of praxiteles and some artist friends comment upon the resemblance between the man and the statue not only in external likeness but also in character  no faun in arcadia says one of them  was ever a greater simpleton than donatello he has hardly a mans share of wit small as that is it is a pity that there are no longer any of this congenial race of rustic creatures for him to consort with the resemblance is afterwards worked out with much skill and gracefulness marred only by incessant references to donatellos strange reluctance to show his ears on this lighthearted halfwitted and irresponsible creature a total change is effected by the perpetration of a hideous crime the agent of his transformation is called miriam who seems to have dispensed with any other name a being of course endowed with surpassing beauty who lives in a studio and is a mystery she is persecuted by a most disreputablelooking old man who claims to possess some secret by which he is enabled to control her destiny his name is never told nor his secret revealed and the whole idea has been oftenand we must add much betterworked out in the london journal and other penny periodicals donatello who has become attached to miriam gets provoked by the reiterated appearances of her persecutor always at inopportune moments and at length takes an opportunity of tumbling him over the tarpeian rock the revulsion caused by this crime transoms him from a halfwitted lighthearted faun to a responsible but melancholy man a strange and uncomfortable sort of connexion then springs up between the pair whom this murder has joined together and their final fate is left in impenetrable mystery miriam throughout the btory has nothing womanlike about her she resembles rather what the old demonologiets termed a  succubus and is last seen tossing her arms wildly about in the pantheon of donatellos destiny we can form only an unpleasant suspicion that he has fallen into the hands of the police besides this pair there is another hilda and kenyon the former a paintress and type of virgin purity the latter a sculptor and a model loverboth natives of new england and both mere abstractions or rather lay figures who talk aesthetics and philosophy get mixed up more or less with miriams mystery and donatellos crime make love to one another in a very insipid manner and in the end marry and return to their native land mr hawthorne has done and we hope will do much better than this we trust to meet him again on more congenial scenes his  scarlet letter and  house with seven gables have shown that he can draw the character of new englanders right well when he meets them  at home  in new england  transformation or the romance of monte beni by nathaniel hawthorne 3 vols smith elder  co not with impunity can a novelist produce two such bookseach of its class perfectas the scarlet letter and the house of the seven gables he is expected to go on and his third and fourth romances will be measured by their two predecessors without reference to the fact that there may be slow growth and solitary perfection in works of genius the yew and the locusttree have different natural habits then for one to whom all europe is looking for a part of its pleasure to stop the course of his labours is a piece of independence hard to forgive thirdly there is hazard in an attempt to change the scale of creative exercise when an artist has shown himself perfect in the one originally adopted the masters of cabinet  painting whom it would be wise to commission to cover a ceiling are not many raphael could produce the pitti ezekiel and the cartoons it is true rembrandt could paint the temple scene in jerusalem which england possesses as also the gigantic duke of gueldres in the berlin gallery  but raphaels and rembrandts are few it is only fit fair and friendly that the above three considerations should be allowed their full weight in adjudging the merit of mr hawthornes fourth and longest work of fiction produced after the pause of many years it would be idle to appeal to them were the production which calls them forth not a remarkable oneone of the most remarkable novels that 1860 is likely to give us whether from english french or american sources such an italian tale we have not had since herr andersen wrote his  improvisatore how potent is the spell of the south as filling the memories and quickening the imagination of the stranger how powerless over her own strongest sons in literary works of art and fancy we have occasion to see almost as often as we take up an italian novel mr hawthorne has drunk in the spirit ofitalian beauty at every pore the scene of this romance is principally at rome and the writers intense yearning to reproduce and accumulate his recollections of that wonderful city appears to have again and again possessed itself of heart and pen to the suspense not damage of his story who would object to avait for the progress of passion and the development of mystery on being beckoned aside into such a land of rich and melancholy enchantment as is disclosed in the folloaving exquisite picture of the borghese gardens  the entrance to these grounds as all my readers know for everybody nowa days has been in rome is just outside of the porta del popolo passing beneath that not very impressive specimen of michael angelos architecture a minutes walk will transport the visitor from the small uneasy lava atones of the roman pavement into broad gravelled carriagedrives whence a little farther stroll brings him to the soft turf of a beautiful seclusion a seclusion but seldom a solitude for priest noble and populace stranger and native all who breathe the roman air find free admission and come hither to taste the languid enjoyment of the daydream that they call life   the scenery amid which the youth now strayed was such as arrays itself in the imagination when we read the beautiful old myths and fancy a brighter sky a softer turf a more picturesque arrangement of venerable trees than we find in the rude and untrained landscapes of the western world the ilextrees southeast ancient and timehonoured were they seemed to have lived for ages undisturbed and to feel no dread of profanation by the axe any more than overthrow by the thunderstroke it had already passed out of their dreamy old memories that only a few years ago they were grievously imperilled by the gauls last assault upon the walls of rome as if confident in the long peace of their lifetime they assumed attitudes of indolent repose they leaned over the green turf in ponderous grace throwing abroad their great branches without danger of interfering with other trees though other majestic trees grew near enough for dignified society but too distant for constraint never was there a more venerable quietude than that which slept among their sheltering boughs never a sweeter sunshine than that now gladdening the gentle bloom which these leafy patriarchs strove to diffuse over the swelling and subsiding lawns in other portions of the grounds the stonepines lifted their dense clump of branches upon a slender length of stem so high that they looked like green islands in the air flinging down a shadow upon the turf so far off that you hardly knew which tree had made it again there were avenues of cypress resembling dark flames of huge funeral candles which spread dusk and twilight round about them instead of cheerful radiance the more open spots were all abloom even so early in the season with anemones of wondrous size both white and rosecoloured and violets that betrayed themselves by their rich fragrance even if their blue eyes failed to meet your own daisies too were abundant but larger than the modest little english flower and therefore of small account these wooded and flowery lawnb are more beautiful than the finest of english parkscenery more touching more impressive through the neglect that leaves nature bo much to her own avays and methods since man seldom interferes with her she sets to work in her own quiet way and makes herself at home there is enough of human care it is true bestowed long ago and still bestowed to prevent wildness from groaving into deformity and the result is an ideal landscape a woodland scene that seems to have been projected out of a poets mind if the ancient faun were other than a mere creation of old poetry and could have reappeared anywhere it must have been in such a scene as this in the openings of the wood there are fountains plashing into marble basins the depths of which are shaggy with waterweeds  or they tumble like natural cascades from rock to rock sending their murmur afar to make the quiet and silence more appreciable scattered here and there with careless artifice stand old altars bearing roman inscriptions statues grey with the long corrosion of even that soft atmosphere half hide and half reveal themselves high on pedestals or perhaps fallen and broken on the turf terminal figures columns of marble or granite porticoes arches are seen in the vistas of the woodpaths either veritable relics of antiquity or with so exquisite a touch of artful ruin on them that they are better than if really antique at all events grass grows on the tops of the shattered pillars and weeds and flowers root themselves in the chinks of the massive arches and fronts of temples and clamber at large over their pediments as if this were the thousandth summer since their winged seeds alighted there what a strange ideawhat a needless labourto construct artificial ruins in rome the nativesoil ofruin buteventhesesportiveimitations wrought by man in emulation of what time has done to temples and palaces are perhaps centuries old and beginning as illusions have grown to be venerable in sober earnest the result of all is a scene pensive lovely dreamlike enjoyable and sad such as is to be found nowhere save in these princely villaresidences in the neighbourhood of rome a scene that must have required generations and ages during which growth decay and mans intelligence wrought kindly together to render it so gently wild as we behold it now the final charm is bestowed by the malaria there is a piercing thrilling delicious kind of regret in the idea of so much beauty thrown away or only enjoyable at its halfdevelopment in winter and early spring and never to be dwelled amongst as the homescenery of any human being for if you come hither in summer and stray through these glades in the golden sunset fever walks arminarm with you and death awaits you at the end of the dim vista thus the scene is like eden in its loveliness like eden too in the fatal spell that removes it beyond the scope of mans actual possessions in other pages the catacombs of st calixtus the tarpeian rock the pantheon no less poetically and richly frame scenes of a passion and wild interest in harmony with their beauty most of all do we enjoy mr hawthornes sympathy with the worlds cathedral st peters having rebelled for years against the bigotry with which sticklers for pointed arches or unlearned constructions have decried this gorgeous centre of the roman catholic rite as a place mundane theatrical and out of style for such censors art nature and beauty have no existence save by the complacent favour of their own vanity we have inadvertently touched on the great scenic power and beauty of this italian romance ere offering a word on its matter and argument whether the elevating influences of remorse on certain natures have ever been taken as the theme of a story so fearlessly as here may be questioned casuists and moralists must discuss the truth of the data to mr hawthorne truth always seems to arrive through the medium of his imaginationsome faroff fantasy to suggest a train of thought and circumstance out of which philosophies are evolved and characters grow his hero the count of monte beni would never have lived had not the faun of praxiteles stirred the authors admiration and this mythical creature so engaged the dreamers mind that he draws out of the past the fancy of an old family endowed with certain constant attributes of sylvan gaiety and careless semianimal enjoyments such as belonged to the dances and sunshine of arcady such is donatello at the beginning of the tale and with these qualities are mixed up unquestioning simple love and fidelity which can take a form of unreasoning animal fury in a moment of emergency he is hurried into sudden murder for thesake of the woman he loves and with that the faun nature dies out and the sad consciencestricken human being begins in the writhings of pain to think to feellastly to aspire this in a few words is the meaning of  transformation and for the first moiety of the romance the story tums slowly with windings clearly to be traced yet poaverfully round its principal figure the other characters mr hawthorne must bear to be told are not new to a tale of his miriam the mysterious with her hideous tormentor was indicated in the zenobia of the blithedale romancehilda the pure and innocent is own cousin to phoebe in the house of the seven gableskenyon the sculptor though carefully wrought out is a stone image with little that appeals to our experience of men these are all the characters and when it is added that miriam is a magnificent paintress with a mystery that hilda is a copyist of pictures from new england and that kenyon is her countryman enough has been told to define the brain creatures who figure in the avild  romance of monte beni mr haavthorne must be reckoned aith for the second moiety of his book in spite of the delicious italian pictures noble speculations and snatches of arresting incident which it contains we knoav of little in romance more inconclusiae and hazy than the manner in which the tale is brought to its close hints will not suffice to satisfy interest which has been excited to voracity every incident need not lead to a mathematical conclusion nor coup de thcutrc as in the comedies of m scribe but the utter uncertainty which hangs about every one and every thing concerned in the strong emotions and combinations of half of this romance makes us part company with them as though ave avere aavaking

B9104,['8856633'],  the story of jewdd a romance by all aziz efendi the cretan translated from the turkish by e j w gibb glasgow wilson  mccormick the book of sindibud or the story of the king his son the damsel and the seven vazirs from the persian and arabic with introduction notes and appendix by w a clouston glasgow privately printed we have always been told that the turks are a literary people who cannot write at least there are prodigious lists of eminent turkish writers but nobody can for his life remember what they have written mr gibb has set himself to combat this erroneous impression and after publishing a volume of ottoman poetry now presents us with a turkish romance the  ottoman poetry  showed a great deal of scholarship and literary sense on the part of the translator but hardly raised our opinion of the turkish muse the fresh acquisition gives englishmen another chance of redeeming themselves in the eyes of the porte it is the second part of a collection of tales entitled phantasms from the divine presence by one all the cretan we were aware that the cretans are always liars but this quality should be rather in favour of excellence in romance it cannot however be said that jewiid quite bears out this anticipation it ia good enough as an eastern tale but there is not much originality in its construction it is in fact the  arabian nights without their charm we are introduced to the hero jewiid in the character of the favourite pupil of a famous magician of antioch and the confidant of his most precious secrets the romance is supposed to throw some light on the practice of the occult sciences in the east but we confess to remaining in very much the same state of enlightenment as we enjoyed at the beginning of our study of the work jewiid indeed knows all about the charm of harut and mariit but he does not tell us exactly in what this potent spell consists and since he had the strength to resist the fascinations of a lady who is described as the darling of the world and the torment of mankind who endeavoured in a very particular manner to extract from him the secrets of magic we are not surprised that he resists though less seductive allurements of a modern and masculine reader positively there is but a single real incantation in the volume and that is only a love philtre which anybody might havo composed there are plenty of enchanted and also of enchanting persons hut we are not let into the secrets of their power we learn that both men and women who are really in love can resist the most powerful spells and remain constant to the beloved but though this is a lesson that perhaps comes rather unexpectedly from the east it is a mere truism in the ideal civilization of the west still although there is not very much that is novel or exciting in the tales that more orientdli are rolled together in  the story of jewfxd it is by no means devoid of interest we do not indeed learn very much of the methods of the professors of occult science among the dervishes but we get some good pictures of turkish manners the scenes of the everyday life of constantinople though no doubt idealized must have some basis of fact and there is a charming account of a garden party it is also interesting to find that the practice of making a wax figure in which pins and other aggressive weapons including  the business end of a tin tack produce corresponding effects upon the live original belongs to the east as well as to mediceval witchcraft and the sensible view taken of the ascetic calling by jewad is worthy of imitation by those who go in for useless mortification of the flesh a wellmeaning young prince had seen a vision which convinced him that the constancy of women was purely fictitious and that  beware she s fooling thee was the true view of the sex he thereupon resolved to lead a life of strict celibacy jewad combats this determination with success and this is part of his speech   if the poor one initiated into these unattainable mysteries called by the names of the powers of magic occult influence contraction and expansion the secret virtues of things and the divine knowledge be married and have a family the cares of children and wife will render him incapable of bearing the hardships of the world and it is clear that he must fall a prey to slovenliness and vanities and so lose the resigned soul in the vale of abandonment it is for this weighty reason that the qalendars who tread the path of poverty and wander through many lands are restrained from marrying because i am a seeker after strange knowledge and a newlystarted traveller on that path am i wifeless  which by the rule of mutual similarity might be worthy of note as an example for a beggar but not for a prince but since celibacy and freedom from earthly care of things necessarily cause exemption from the pomp of the world it is an evident matter that the opposite thereof is the titting condition for kings and kings sons philosophers have likened empire and sovereignty to a bath  the men outside of which desire to enter it but when they enter the warmth of the water afflicts them and great weariness comes upon them by reason of the fierceness of the heat and of the arising of perspiration and lassitude so that full speedily doth their desire to depart appear that the most part of the possessors of exceeding riches fancy the severing the thread of connexion with the rush and crush of men and sit with the head hanging on the collar of the robe of retirement and somehow choose the corner of privacy is of the things proved by the legion of the learned but this fancy is unlawful for kings  for besides it being impossible for them to abandon the pomp of earth the possession of the worldswaying minds by this idle notion is paralleled to longcontinued relaxation of the rein of the steed their royal zeal now it is not hidden from your imperial farseeing sagacity that the only way of preserving the just constitution of sovereigns from that deadly poison of the wellbeing of states the nurture of those fancies aforesaid is that bound by the tether of family and offspring and the solicitude for the circumstances of their successors and descendants they should be devoted to the aim of rendering prosperous their possessions and realms this seems very sound advice and there is much more in the volume that might be read with advantage mr gibb has done his work well it is true we miss occasional explanations of certain mystical terms such as that soninlaw the aged sphere which must read rather curiously to the uninitiated  and there are a few phrases which do not altogether accord with the usual notions of good english a fondness for the word  commence and for  somehow should be repressed at any sacrifice  and in spite of mr gibbs admission that he has purposely adopted a somewhat antiquated style to suit the tone of the narrative we cannot say we like such phrases as  anon  and anon an it be a largish ship cull a kiss patent brutality c nevertheless the book is very comfortable reading and it is always a good service to translate an unknown foreign and especially oriental work for the benefit of those who cannot read the original those who are familiar with prof comparettis researches on  the book of sindibud which were translated for the folklore societys publications by mr coote will perhaps wonder why mr clouston has now compiled another work on the subject but though the latter is heavily indebted to the formermore indeed than he has quite acknowledgedthe two books do not cover precisely the same ground prof comparetti confined himself chiefly to a study of the developments of the different versions of the collection of tales known under the name of the book of sindibad or the seven wise masters or syntipasor dolopathos or the seven yazlrs c according as it appears in arabic english greek latin or other european and asiatic literatures but especially devoted his attention to theold castilian version entitled  libro de los engannos et de los asayamientes de las mugeres which was translated from the arabic in the middle of the thirteenth century and by means of which prof comparetti was able to establish many interesting data in the history of the group of storybooks mr clouston has gone on a different tack he found that the italian scholars work assumed a more thorough knowledge of the eastern texts than could reasonably be expected among ordinary students and he endeavours to supply the deficiency by giving some of these texts as much in their entirety as the disagreeable nature of their contents allows thus he gives an epitome of the persian text of the fourteenth century by the late prof falconer the arabian version or  seven vazlrs from scotts edition  an appendix of those tales that are not found in these two versions but occur in others together with the old english metrical romance of  the seven wise masters and the latin original of the french metrical version  dolopathos recently discovered in addition to this useful series of texts in outline mr clouston has put together a good account of the history of the collection and the probable order of the different translations from the indian original through the pahlavi arabic syriac and hebrew to the spanish latin and greek versions his notes reveal no little research and he has ransacked the fabliaux literature of europe to discover parallels to the incidents nar rated in the eastern and western texts the i 4 gesta eomanorum boccaccio chaucer i alphonsus sansovino old jest  books welsh tales highland tales persian tartar and above all indian tales are put in requisition to prove the wide prevalence of the leading idea of the book of sindibiid that the leading idea is simply that all women are deceitful and all husbands fooled is too well known to need fresh statement this threadbare doctrine has ever commended itself to the mind of storytellers probably because it gives peculiar opportunities for the introduction of highly spiced dotails of the kind that used to be popular until modern civilization abolished the custom of sitting over the wine and walnuts some of though tricks ployed in the tales which make up  the book of sindibiid in one or other of its versions are undoubtedly ingenious and amusing but as a whole the collection is simply a monotonous string of anecdotes of womens infidelity as mr clouston has scrupulously removed the racy details which probably gave these anecdotes their former popularity and has only left the bare facts that such and such a dame fell in love with such and such a gallant and hid him in a chest when her husband came in or in some way or other amused herself at the goodmans expense the result is hardly entertaining as a study in comparative folklore the volume is valuable as a storybook it palls a little mr clouston however intended only the former purpose and in that ho has succeeded thoroughly as a guide to one of the most remarkable histories of a worldwide collection of tales his 4 book of sindibiid  is an important acquisition his comparative notes are especially valuable and seem on the whole very accurate though wo note occasional misprints,omance

misgivings but miss wilkins is to be congratulated on a striking success she has mastered the difficulty of writing in an artificial style so that her book is not merely in modern prose ornamented with turns of phrase imitated from the literature of the end of the seventeenth century but is written in an acquired language throughout showing very little signs of the labour and itudy which must have been given to the task one can read it with ease and with pleasure and the strain of writing in a studied style so far from hampering the authors invention seems to have spurred her imagination if one may express an individual preference  the hearts highway  may be said to be the most interesting of miss wilkinss books it seems to carry the reader along more rapidly than her new england stories and ones attention is not extorted but given readily one forgets to be critical in the interest of the story but here and there an expression catches ones eye possibly miss wilkins may have authority for the disagreeable split infinitive in 1682 but the phrase to fairly overreach p 5 had better have been altered a suffolk man would hardly have talked of suffolkshire it may bo doubted whether sportsmen were accustomed to shoot hying birds in 1682 and whether it would have been possible to take high honours at cambridge a few years earlier that the narrator should call his neighbours place sometimes cavendish hall aud sometimes cavendish court is a trifling blemish the incidents of fighting during the wars between the king and the parliament in the seventeenth century are somewhat loosely put together in a romance entitled the dogs f war by edgar pickering warne  co the story has been told very often especially of late and it has become hard to discover new features however the book before us is by no means without its merits and moat of the technicalities incident to seventeenthcentury life have been observed though not always used to the best advantage the narrative is again in the first person and where a statement is made which at the moment was hardly likely to be known to the narrator there is a footnote saying that the facts were ascertained afterwards it is satisfactory to rind that no attempt is made to explain why the story is written and the customary excuse that i he narrator thinks his children may like to read of his adventures is omitted the book is not one which will take a foremost place among the historical romances of the time but it is an honest and pleasing effort in fiction we ought perhaps to enter a caveat with regard

heaped up all the sensations which it was possible for him to devise amongst them he presents a picture of marseilles devastated by i he plague and makes it the background of a moving human drama at eaux st fer he introduces crebillon who assists madame la marquise to get up a little play for the special behoof of desparre crushing him dramatically by the revelation of a terrible secret bound up with his past life the subsequent story of the villainous duke is affecting enough mr bloundelleburton can be pathetic when he does not make too much of mere sensation his romance is full of movement

control of reasonll as its brethren of the heart can be and 1 that the certain remedy for a silly and ignoble love is a wise and noble one this and the following tale are founded on two of the best of our old dramas in pursuance of a system laid down in one of the critical dissertations with which these fictions are interspersedthat there is a great advantage in taking subjects from accredited writers as you are certain beforehand that they are at least adapted to the develop nent of character and passion  and that great wvriters have continually felt this bv repeatiuig one another as respects subljects to a singular extent this it must be confessed is reversing the plan which has been so long practised in one department of modern literature where novels have been sanis crbnzonie and every thing else save imrpudence turned into plays and as the drama has obtalined so many in diffirent pieces of romance it is but equitable that romance should wrest a few good stories from the drama however this may be the spirit of the famous aedils tragycdly the incidents the characters the passion often the very language are here reproduced before us in another forma wild gentle fearful

B3801,"['8654859', '8450493']",  elsie venner a romance of destiny by oliver wendell holmes macmillan  co  elsie venner is a very peculiar story partly psychological and partly physiological it turns upon the subtle question of how far physical accidents may influence moral development and whether the individual so influenced is accountable for what he does in accordance with such tendencies the story is very vaguely toldit is only indicated instead of being detailed and the reader is left a great deal to his own ingenuity to pick up the facts of the case elsie venner is a very beautiful girl endowed with a fatal deadly mesmeric beauty her looks attitudes and ways have a strange serpentlike aspectshebas eyes like a rattlesnake with a power of fascination that is allied to terror  she never sang or played she never bbaped her inner life into words such utterance was aa much denied to her nature as common articulate speech to the deafmute her only language must be in action she loved to dance to the sound of the castanets making a wild snapping accompaniment like the sound of the rattlesnake turning her body into the graceful undulating shapes of a serpent moving its coils there was a strange story about her which no one knew and strange whispers whioh no one cared to utter distinctly there seemed the struggle of two natures within her and the animal nature was the stronger with all her beauty she was dangerouslookinga glittering piercing eye and a round lithe sensuous figure os full of dangerous life as ever lay under the slender flanks and cleanshaped limbs of a panther she always wore a ring of gold or a broad necklace round her neck to hide some mysterious birthmark no ordinary rules or principles had influence over her and those who displeased her always died suddenly and mysteriously her love was as fatal as her hatred to the object of it the picture of this strangelyorganized young girl amid the natural human beings who made up the world in which she lived is nicely discriminated the touches of character are keen and caustic there are observations and thoughts well worth entering upon the memory but the story ib more curious than generally interesting it is told too vaguely to satisfy ordinary readersand stupid readers would find themselves altogether mystified the main topic of the book is aboutrattlesnakes  it would appear that the mother of elsie was bitten by one shortly before her birththe result waa fatal to the mother but the child lived and the characteristics of the terrible reptile were developed in her she was a lamia and had a serpents instincts in a human form the two natures struggling together are hinted at but the idea is not worked out definitely in the end however elsie having overlived the period of a reptiles natural life gradually grows back into humanity loses her reptile instinct and becomes a natural human woman but the crisis kills her her death is touching the whole is a suggestion rather than a story there are quaint and clever observations scattered throughout which recall the autocrat of the breakfasttable here is one men are tattooed with their special beliefs like so many south sea islanders but a real human heart with divine love in it beats with the same glow under all the patterns of all earths thousand tribes the commencement of the story promises more amusement than is carried out the description of the school at pijwachet in the lovely valley of the mink river is extremely amusing full of genuine fun  also the account of col sprowles party which reads as though it had been done from the life  elsie venner is a book which will interest thoughtful readers who care moro to have ideas suggested than for ready made amusement and this story opens into trains of thought that have as yet been scarcely touched upon and for which no theory has yet been shaped in the preface the author says that ho has received startling confirmation of the possibility of a character like that drawn as a purely imaginary conception in  elsie venner  elsie venner a romance of destiny by oliver wen dell holmes author of  the autocrat of the breakfast table etc macmillan and co elsie venner will sustain the fame of doctor holmes on this side the atlantic his pithy and humorous sketches interest englishmen the more for picturing a state of society curiously like and unlike our own doctor holmes gives us his own view of american institutions and we are sometimes left to doubt whether he is administering sober approval or amusing himself with some wellcovered irony in either case we have a faithful study of life in america and it is chiefly for thia that we like elsie venner as a novel the book fails in as far as the writer has at tempted to inculcate as he says  through all the disguise of fiction a grave scientific doctrine we object to any  grave scientific doctrine  as part of a novel but it happens that this one particular doctrine physiological and psychological is only a bit of outrageous fiction that excuses itself by a bold claim to be scientific truth elsie venner is the daughter of a lady who had been stung by a rattlesnake but whom the venom did not destroy until a few weeks after the childs birth elsie therefore has a large share of the serpents nature infused into her human mind and body she likes to go ont visiting among the reptiles and as far as they are concerned she is poison proof she haa a strange mark round her neck which will disappear when the snakish character ia purged from her when passionate she finds relief in an unwomanly dance furthermore 0 physiologists she makes a noise like that of the serpents rattle there ia such cruel fascination in her eye that few dare look at her by a glance she can compel one young lady to do whatever she wills on another one who does not know that she is being looked at elsie produces an eruption of cold sweat at last she falls desperately in love with her schoolmaster asks him to walk home with her and when he asks what he can do for her she answers  love me he objects to the proposal and leaves her to die of grief some cause whether the love or the grief is not clearly statednow works powerfully upon her frame and abe ena life ss a true woman the best authority we know for thia sort of physiological doctrine is keatss  lamia but doctor holmes who has been a professor of physiology declares himself to be serious and says that  since this story has been in  progress he has received the most startling confirmation of the possibility of the existence of a character like that which he had drawn bernard langdon the schoolmaster is natural enough and  there is a beautiful sketch of helen darley his assistant there is an old black woman whom we must own that we like quite as well as elsie a kindly humour animates all that is said of doctor kittredge and there is much true appreciation shown in the contrasted portraits of two clergymen one of them a

B4444,['4995976'],  fiction i the woodman a romance of the times of i i richard iii by g p ir james esq i author of a darnley c in 3 vols london newby 1849 mr james is inexhaustible and he is as facile in composition as he is fertile in invention another historical romance is to be added to the catalogue of his fictions that he continues to write and the public to read is proof of great capacities although he must needs draw somewhat more from memory and less from invention than at the beginning of his career of authorship if it be impossible that he can altogether avoid mannerism by which we mean the copying of himself yet it must be admitted that this his latest work shows no symptoms of exhausted fancy or overlaboured faculties the cause of this is the profound knowledge of the history of the middle ages its men manners and habits which has secured for his long series of historical novels an interest apart altogether from story or portrait to read a romance of his is to read the history of the times of which he treats only in a somewhat more lively and truthful and impressive form we have the result of his studies put into a pleasing picture which is readily remembered his personages may be real or ideal but when he does attempt to draw areal character itiselaborated withcare and history and memoir are consulted for traits which should as it were restore the dead for the benefit of the living perhaps as fine a theme for the novelist as any to be found in history is the character of rioad the third and the men and manners of his time the author is however subjected to the disadvantage of a comparison with the portraiture of shakspfer so great is the influence unconsciously exercised over us by the dramatist that our notions of the crookbacked tyrant are formed from the pa and not from history and any departure froml the main features of that representation is likely to be received with disapprobation by the reader as a violation not of truth only but of propriety mr james has boldly dared to introduce richard the third as not quite the fiend tradition and s1iak5pxri have made him and eonsequently more in accordance with such authentic memorials of him as have been reserved and which in the hands of modern historians have thrown a new light upon his character and career ilence a work which is more valuable more useful and likely to be of longer life than if it had been a mere romance to be read for its story and then thrown aside and forgotten mr james has produced a very perfect historical tableau in persons in costumes in scenery and accessories and we suspect that a much more accurate conception of the time of which he treats may be formed by a careful investigation of this romance than from any of our regular histories and even as a mere narrative it is one of his best and will profoundly interest those who care little for the profit to be derived from its perusal the plot is admirably constructed and ingeniously sustained and evolved the incidents are well imagined and the composition has more of the authors pictorial power than we have seen in any of his later productions lie has abbreviated his dialogues anl avoided that minuteness of inventory which was usually complained of by readers who were not possessed with a passion for antiquities we will not further describe the plot because the work will of course be found in every circulating library and be read by all who read novels and by many who do not confess to be readers of them it would mar much of their pleasure in the perusal to inform them here what is cointing so we content ourselves with a few extracts which will rather tempt to further acquaintance with the volumes than anticipate them the reader will probably be surprised to find richard described as a man having some tender feelings as in this masterly scene between himself and queen anne on receiving the news of the death of prince edward the instant she heard her husbands step she turned quickly round with a timid and inquiring glance but riclhard was in one of his milder moods the subject of his thought aid hers was one of common affection and lie advanced tenderly towards her and took her in his arms saying 1 have heard nothing ann but cast these fears from your mind i trust that this is nothing but one of those sicknvsses of childhood which come and pass away like spring showers the tears came into the queens eyes rising from very mingled emotions her apprehension for her child her husbands tenderness the feeling perhaps of her own

somewhat closer to him he said well well wipe away your tears love if we hear not better tidings today thou shalt go to mliddleham and i will go with thee  thanks my gracious lord thanks replied the

B2542,['6675108'],  uarda a romance of ancient egypt by georg ebers from the german by clara bell london sampson low  co 1877 tue very learned and brilliant author of this book tells us distinctly in his preface that its historical and archaeological features are but of secondary importance and that he wishes it to be read and criticised simply as a novel it seems to me that he has hot done his book justice by this remark and that most readers of this as of his previous novel an egyptian princess will in spite of the authors directions pay great attention to the scenery and costume and even seek to obtain from the story as such some better notion than most people have of old egyptian life the value of historical novels in teaching history has been variously estimated and scholastic people nowadays are inclined to despise them to me they seem very valuable aids in giving some sort of lifepicture of other days and if aristotle thought that tragic poetry was more philosophical than history on account of its filling out and colouring the dry outlines of hard fact so a good historical novel may be far more instructive and philosophical than many of our histories how many people have obtained true and lively views of charles the bold from anne of geierstcin or of the french revolution from the comtesse de charity  when therefore an egyptologist of prof ebers position gives us an egyptian novel based upon the monuments and papyri of the date of ramses il we expect not only entertainment but solid instruction nor will the reader find himself disappointed the external detail is very carefully filled in the theological and philosophical views of the priests are expanded in conversations perhaps too lengthy and minute characters from all classes of society are introduced and though their strange names are at first hard to remember we must do the author the credit to say that he has kept his characters distinct and has drawn thera with considerable psychological power but we confess that the less egyptian the story becomes the more interesting and lifelike is its progress as the author expressly wrarns us he has not excluded modern sentiment and this may not be false though it cannot be proved true of the old egyptians the scenery of mount sinai which he knows from personal experience is very admirably and vividly painted and we must admire his selfcontrol when he introduces moses in one scene and refrains from letting him reappear this is indeed treating the reader most generously but when we come to consider the historical sources which he has used it appears to us that he has made very free use of them indeed in some cases it is true that though he says that mes it was the egyptian name of moses he does not shock us with the whole theory of prof lauth who ascribes the stillextant roving adventures of a mohar of that name to the great lawgiver still the identification of the names is very doubtful but this is moderate compared with the account of king ramses il taken wholly from the wildest and most extreme flatteries which have survived in contradiction to many good historical inferences the king is not only represented as a marvellous warrior which may be true but as a father of his people as a man of genius of large heart and great benevolence which must surely bc false the iron despotism of his rule seems hardly compatible with the gentle and loveable features in prof ebers picture of him we also fancy from our scanty knowledge of the period that the noble and intellectual characters of the kings daughter bentanat and her intimates are beyond the condition of even the highest ladies of that time but here at least there is nothing to contradict any novelist the drawing of the greek invaders is also a questionable matter in the first place the fact of greek invasions in the fourteenth century bc is exceedingly doubtful nor are the two names occurring on though monuments which scholars would identify with aiuo and aato at all received in this sense by the most cautious critics but whether the danai did threaten egypt under ramses or not they were certainly not the beautiful and dignified people represented in the art of phidias 1000 years afterwards and yet such they appear in prof ebers sketch of them he has warned us in his excellent preface that we must not imagine the real old egyptians as they were represented in their own art he notes most justly that the rules and conventions of a strict hieratic canon prevented the artists of old egypt with a very few remarkable exceptions from attempting to imitate real life and he calls his novel an erlos ung siv eric in which he breaks through stiff formality and paints them as the most lively and versatile of men i fear that in the case of the danai he has allowed himself to fall into a trap of this kind and has been misled by an artistic type not worse but better than the real men who have indeed been perpetually misconceived because of the impressions produced by their art here and there through the book there are indications of awful oppression and cruelty which are without doubt historical and perhaps the most certain traits which we can attribute to the period the description of the gold mines for which he refers to diodorus discloses indeed one of the most shocking instances of wholesale cruelty that the world has witnessed but with great good taste he does not allow these scenes any prominence they form a dark background to the splendour of the pharaonic life the scepticism of the physician nebsecht and the ultramontane policy of the priests are both probable enough though they strike us as suggested by the authors personal experiences in the germany of the present day what prof ebers says of the art of the old egyptians is to a great extent true of their literature also so far as we possess it there are so many forms of politeness formulas of religion fixed types of language and general formality of expression that it is very hard to conceive warm hearts and wild passions under all this mass of conventional stiffness yet our author is certainly right and has done well to correct the impressions produced by the egyptian rituals and inscriptions and pictures his plot is vigorous and full of movement and if the great number and variety of his characters compel him to produce too many unexpected meetings they add to the interest and beauty of the story the reservation of ramses himself and the epic of pentaour till the third volume is another instance of wisc economy in an author who feels himself in no want of incident and who has rather too much than too little material at his disposal nevertheless uarda will hardly take a place among firstrate french or english works of fiction as an instructive and amusing sketch of life in egypt under ramses ii it should be widely and heartily welcome in adding a few words of criticism on the translation of the work we would not have it imagined that we underrate the difficulty of an idiomatic rendering of one language by another the translator is apt to see the original through the translation and so rest satisfied with sentences which seem foreign enough to the english reader viewed with a critical eye there aro many faults to be found in the present instance especially in the earlier parts in which the english version is often very strongly flavoured with german idioms there are also some useful notes omitted there are even somo mistakes such as haggard men for hagcre mcnschen birdhaunted woods for wildreiche wiilder and courageously for getrostall these in the preface elsewhere we have thichlegged for wadcnstarh used of a man and danaids for danaer such trifles might be multiplied and indeed it is only in the number of them that their weight as objections lies but anyone who has himself undertaken such a task will justly look away from these particulars and more especially in a novel attend to the general effect of the translation regarded merely as an english book he will find it on thc whole a readable and even spirited rendering and will be disposed to commend the translator for bringing so interesting a

B705,"['8675288', '2737970', '8740245']",  lorna doorie a romance of exmoor by rd blackmore 3 vols low  co lorna donne really deserves its title as a romance the tory is well told and although some impatient readers may call the pace too leisurely we think that even they if they once fairly begin it will read on to the end and close the book with regret there is a reality and truthfulness about the story which gain upon the reader as he proceeds the period is laid in the time of james the second aud we are completely transported out of the present day to the england that was when there were no roads at all across exmoor and for a man to travel safely from one town to another required not only a thorough knowledge of all the bogs pitholes soft places and sloughs but much wary walking and great good luck besides mr blackmore is quite at home in the local aspects of somerset and devonshire and he is thoroughly acquainted with the rustic life of england as it was in those days when there was no communication between one town and another except by packhorses for goods and stout nags for men and when the people from another parish were foreigners instead of neighbours when highwaymen flourished and the gibbets which studded exmoor told that some of them fell victims to their profession the story takes us completely into a bygone world the rustic life of england as it was led at plover barrow farm is set forth in a way to make one wish we might have paid a visit to that worthy and stalwart yeoman john ridd the owner of the place and the hero of the story plover barrow farm seems to have been a rustic paradise it is pervaded by a sense of homest labour and wholesome tranquillity with such a wealth of plenty and comfort and warmth that the reader is made to feel as if he had been carried far away from london and was breathing the pure air of exmoor and luxuriating in the good country fare so well and vividly described plover barrow farm had belonged to th same family of yeomen ever since the days of king alfred  and john ridd himself is quite  genuine hero whose fame for great stature and bodily strength and skill as a wrestler still survives in local tradition the story is narrated in the first person by john ridd himself it begins with him as a boy at school fetched home suddenly on account of the death of his father who had been set upon by a party of the doones and killed as he was returning home from market with some of his neighbours now the doones were a family of outlaws and freebooters who had established themselves in a valley on the borders of bagworthy forest supporting themselves by rapine and robbery and were the terror of the country for many miles round these doones are strictly historical personages and the account given of them in the novel is curious the chief or patriarch of the tribe sir endsor doone was originally a gentleman of estate standing well in the county but who owing to some sleight of law or star chamber proceeding had been dispossessed  and then he and his sons and nephews and all belonging to him declared themselves the enemies of law and established this stronghold where they built a village stealing the materials and entrenched themselves a in a camp they were strong handsome godless men who had neither mercy nor scruples they carried off not only horses sheep cattle and money but the wives and daughters of the inhabitants when it seemed good to them they were never brought to justice they were an established power the peaceable people feared them and in time almost got used to them the long immunity enjoyed by the doones throws a curious light on the condition of the western counties at that period these doones play a considerable part in the narrative they are like the giants in the old nursery tales and john ridd is like one of the champions who used to arise for the deliverance of the country people whoever has read the old nursery story of tom hickathrift will see a generic resemblance in the fortunes and character of though two heroes john ridd is a hero of what we flatteringly call the genuine english type he is brave modest and upright scorning lies and mean actions gifted with enormous bodily strength which stands him in good stead in his various adventures and dangers we cannot give an outline of the plot for it is a series of incidents how john ridd ventures into the very heart of the doones valley when a mere boy and how he there finds a beautiful fairy princess of eight years old named lorna doone granddaughter as she believes herself of the grand old sir endsor dooneand how he devotes himself to her and how the love he bears her grows np with him and continues the good influence of his lifehow he goes to see her at intervals though every visit is at the risk of hislife if discoveredand how at last after the death of sir endsor he rescues lorna from the cruel keeping of carver doone bis successor who is starving her to death unless she will consent to marry himhow he manages their escape in the midst of the great frost of 16s0 and how she is kept warm and happy at the farm and how the doones make a night attack to recover her and to burn the bidda out of house and homeand how they are repulsed though john ridd will not shoot his enemy carver doone because guns seem treacherous weaponsnl how lorna turns out to be no doone at all but a great scotoh heiress lady loma dugal who is fetched up to london made a ward in chancery and put under the guardianship of her uncle the earl and how she remains always faithful to the good john who has a narrow escape of being hanged by col kilke after the battle of sedgemoor in which he had taken no part except to help a wounded man upon the field and how that was the means of his being sent to london where he not only meets lorna but has an adventure with burglars which makes him much talked ofand the king bestows upon him the honour of knighthood and a coatofarmsall this and much more is narrated in a quiet and veracious style with unconscious touches of character and the introduction of persons who are not only historical but lifelike some of the incidents are narrated with ct powerbu oh as the outrage by the nea which at last aroused the longsuffering country people to avenge themselves and to destroy the whole race of doones and the final attack and destruction of their stronghold the deathwrestle between john ridd and his enemy carver doone is terrible and yet keep3 clear of being melodramatic  lbrna doonet a ronianee of 7z vxmdor by r d

story of the mutiny on board of hms bounty we aro by no means sure that the story is worth though rotelling but such as it is it is hore reproducod with abundant fulness and with remarkable vigour and faithfulness though right note is struck from the first when fletchor christian who anon becomes though mutineer is introduced in loving converse with mallina his tahitian sweetheart for the paradisiacal life though sailors of the bounty had led in tahiti for months was a strongor temptation to mutiny than the tyranny of their commander lieutenant bligh hore is the first appoarance of

pendulous to rest again a woman nude oxcept for though narrow girdle of leaves around her avaist raised hersolf from though foot of a coconut tree behind which she had crouched and looked at though ship lu her right hand was an open claspknife she leaned hor back against though tree and gazod steadily at the bounty for nearly a minute then with an angry exclamation cast the knife from hor into the sea    au hour later when daylight broke edward youug after calling though ships company again went to though bows to look at the cable  it was his last duty boforo roporting to his relief that all was well as ho peered over the low bows of the vessel  his sailors eyo saw that all the strands of the cable but one were parted   and walking aft he knocked at the door of the stateroom occupied by lieutenant william bligh     though cable is nearly chafed through sir or the strands have parted there was a strong squall just before daylight and the ship strained very heavily upon it i think  keep your opinions to yourself you are a dd careless fellow and not fit even to keep anchor watch where is it chafed   about a fathom below the water sir answered the young man     bah said the commander with a contemptuous laugh and you have the audacity to attempt to screen your carelessness by telling me it has chafeda couple of fathoms down for the hawsepipe and in fifteen fathoms of water the fact is some of the natives have been off in a canoe and have cut it under your nose    were you asleep on your watch mr young  answer me quickly  such was the irascible and tyrannous commander who conspired unconsciously with the young women of tahiti to provoke the mutiny on though bounty and to produce the extraordinary community on pitcairn island the story ends with the death of christian a comparison between him and bunyans hero would be a fruitful theme and last touch of all with the discovery of the pitcairn islanders granted that though sordid lawless tale should have been retold no better narrators could havo been found than mr becke and mr jeffery for both the natives of tahiti and the british sailors and officers aro very well  found  the mutineers a romance of pitcairn island tales of adventure by louis becke and walter jeffery fisher unwin  probably there never ha3 been a narrative richer in romantic scenes than this account of the mutiny of the bounty and the experiences of capt bligh and of his comrades cut adrift in the middle of the pacific ocean the subsequent career of his wouldbe murderers constitutes an episode of crime seldom equalled and never surpassed but we do not remember that they have ever been the subject of a romance either in prose or verse except in byrons poem of the island our authors are already favourably known for their tales of adventure in the pacific islands the inhabitants of which have been thoroughly studied by them  they have dealt with their ample materials skilfully dwelling with much severity on capt blighs tyranny which caused not only this mutiny but also an outbreak in new south wales from which colony he was unceremoniously shipped and sent home his heroism and fortitude in safely navigating an open boat for a distance of 1400 miles proved that he must have possessed sterling merit it is however with the subsequent action of the mutineers that the reader is chiefly concerned the story of the loves of the sailors and the women of tahiti  white men and brown womenwho accompanied them to pitcairn island may be somewhat erotic but probably it is characteristic of this unusual form of courtship the narrative of the crimes which followed is of course more or less fanciful murder followed murder until only one of the original crew of the bounty survived all these are sensationally recounted the strangest point of the story and this is trueis that the survivor adams instead of being brutalised by his surroundings developed into an earnest christian and educated the hybrid offspring of these unions with a success which scarcely corroborates the usual view of the incorrigible depravity of humanity their primitive innocent simplicity the total absence of immorality and their genuine good nature have been the marvel of the few who have visited that lovely isle to this part of their subject our authors have done but scant justice although they have alluded to it and yet they might have added a most interesting chapter to their romance the reader of the gold finder by george griffith white  co will be surprised by the contrast between the commencement and the conclusion of the story it opens with a murder a felony or two and an  accursed bloodlegacy all leading up to the conventional hunt for the treasure of a wrecked spanish galleon of bygone days the real purport of the story becomes evident about halfway through the book lt contains the adventures of a modern pirate equipped with steam dynamite cartridges and the most approved instruments of modern warfare not satisfied with this the author causes certain parties to fit out a piratecatcher of equally perfect design and equipment and the story finishes with a bloody fight in which the villains are destroyed it reads like the history of a latterday alabama and so far as the narrative is concerned it constitutes a very readable volume of adventure and seafighting the little goldmagnet which points with the greatest nicety to though nearest piece of the precious metal plays a very subsidiary part in this volume the author evidently thinks that it is capable of better things in a literary sense for he concludes with the assurance that the magnet wrought wonders in the hands of its new and lawful possessors and that of these wonders  there will be more to tell another time the book is a good specimen of the sensational fiction of the day,omance

B7406,"['8758234', '6718461']",  prince otto a romance by robert louis stevenson chatto  windus mr stevensons new book is so plainly aa essay in pure literature that to the average reader it may be something of a disappointment it has none of the qualities of an ordinary novel means atmosphere characters effectseverything is peculiar mr stevenson has worked from beginning to end on a convention which is hardly to be paralleled in modern literature the ordinary material of the novel he throws aside in half a dozen sentences he gives the results of a whole volume of realism he goes straight to the quick of things and concerns himself with none but essentials that his work is perfectly successful it would be rash to assert but in some respectsin certain qualities of other than verbal formit may be taken as a model by anybody with an understanding of art in its severer and more rigid sense and a desire to excel in the higher ranges of literary achievement the authors theme is the morals of marriage the hero is a delightful trifler with views concerning life and a secret passion for his wife the princess seraphina the heroine a young woman with ambition a strong sense of duty an incomparable ignorance of men and things and withal unconsciously in love with her husband prince otto their dominion is the principality of griinewald which marches with the duchy of gerolstein and in another direction with that  seaboard bohemia which is known to students of the winters tale to bring together these young people otto is sixandthirty but as young as most lads of twoandtwenty is the task that mr stevenson has set himself their story as imagined and set forth by him is delightful dumas would have told it with a more truly human feeling and a more general and taking sympathy than mr stevenson has been able to compass alfred de musset with a rarer note of passion a touch of humour that would have appealedtoawiderpublic but neither musset nor dumas could have written prince otto as we have it it is possible that in their several ways they might have proved their case more convincingly it is probable enough that they would have been a trifle less fantastic less individual and peculiar and for that reason in some measure more persuasive but when all is said mr stevenson has little or no reason to avoid such a comparison or to dread its results here and therein the turn of his dialogue the pregnant brevity of his descriptionshe reminds the reader of mr george meredith here and there he appears to be slightly too personal to be wholly acceptable a little too histrionic to be quite effective but his book has a real organic completeness it lives with its own life and succeeds by virtue of an inspiration to be found nowhere else it will scarcely be so popular it may be as  treasure island or  the dynamiter but it has been produced as a classic so to speak  it may be called the authors diploma piece and as a classic if in no other capacity it is tolerably certain to endure of course to some extent it is open to criticism otto is perhaps a trifle too histrionic especially in his relations with madame von boson and seraphina too priggish and unamiable it may be that gondremarkwho seems to be a kind of prose sketch of the german chancellorrequires more energy a more vigorous humanity than mr stevenson can wield but on the other hand madame von rosen is an admirable character in conception and in execution in the style there are notes of blank verse which afflict the reader with a sense of chill unknown to those who have delighted in the verbal felicity of  virginibus puerisque  and  travels with a donkey yet the vocabulary is choice and full the form varied the manner elegant and distinguished the chapter called  princess cinderella as a piece of romantic prose will bear comparison with the best work of its kind this is high praise no doubt but no one who reads it will assert that it is too high  perhaps indeed it is scarcely high enough and it is possible to say almost as much of the book considered as a whole for  prince otto is a protest against the existence of most of that which is unworthy in the theory and practice of modern literature and is plainly the work of a man who writes not for the public of mudie but with a constant respect for the principles of art and an unalterable sense of the excellence of beauty in life and literature alike  prince otto a romance by r l stevenson qhatto  windus it is perhaps not to late to remedy the accident by which notice of this book has been delayed till its successor has appeared little need be said for by this time the public has probably made up its mind they say that the reviewsthings i hear of but never seehave expressed more or less disappointment such feeling is creditable to them and not less to the author who raises extravagant expectations i have succeeded in unearthing a number of the acajsmt five years old in which i reviewed mr stevensons essays as his genius has been more widely revealed that review has lain upon my conscience but on reading it today there seems little to repudiate except a few pompous or gushing expressions severe it was and onesided but at that time unavoidably so he had not then attempted romance and upon his exquisite little tours and essays some admirers were then trying to build up a claim of original and profound philosophy against that claim i protested perhaps too seriously he had nothe never will haveany new gospel of life to give us he has developed precisely as i hoped and prophesied that he would there still however remains that strange mixture of audacious candour and j audacious reticence on the great issues of morality which attracted and distressed from the first on this much might be written interesting to mr stevenson and a few more but to most others neither acceptable nor helpful we have no right to demand his scheme of human life but this is certain that his puzzling enigmatic ethics whether they be individual or whether they are a true reflection of a present transitional state of society are the real hindrance to his aim of producing a great romance worthy of his genius in prince otto he tried and owns his failure it seems to me that if we are to deal at length with men and motives we must lay a good foundation of ethical principles and repose comfortably upon them is not this restful solidity the secret of most works of the imagination of sustained interest a friend  no mean critic  brings back my prince otto in a ragehe cannot read ita vicious style cannot explain why but does not like it yet he again and again plods through scotts ponderous stories not sparing himself a line this instance is suggestive sir walters mind was quite made up about the right and wrong of most things and persons he could afford to describe and judge them steadily without excitement or misgiving and the reader soothed and reassured resigns himself with confidence to the prolonged spell of the great magician not that scott is a greater or stevenson a lesser genius for all that it is but their fate equal in imagination the one is strengthened and disciplined to prolonged flights by his perfect assimilation of conventional principles the others course rapid erratic and interrupted displays far deeper insight far keener perception far i holder geniusa genius brilliant but seemingly troubled because it ventures into a i world ignored by scott where all is doubt i and difficulty  what then is the position to which mr  stevenson has so far attained  not i still think beside the great masters whose profound and simple humanity commands universal and perpetual sympathy may he not be regarded as the authors author just as keats has been called the poets poet  widely read his tales will perforce be if only for the weird and morbid interest which has lately marked them but read with imperfect appreciation even thus only an author or critic can appreciate the consummate art by which he has handled worse horrors than poes by means of a fantastic burlesque setting just strong enough te redeem their repulsiveness without marring their fascination that he should have dropped this sportive tone in dr jekyll amazes me if we are bound to take this cruel tale seriously i see not how to defend it life is already so full of doubts and miseries that all such sacrileges on human credulity as this or the peau de chagrin cannot but do harm manicheism is a contagious disease it may be ridiculed or preached sincerely but should not be preached gravely just for fun but in the new arabian nights and still more in the dynamiter the art is phenomenal it is not the oldfashioned ors celare ar tem but art so carelessly roguishly exposed that it charms by its very audacity the author seems to say now you need not agitate yourself so much over these horrorsthey are only madeup rubbish and i am laughing at you all the time i dont mind telling you this because you know in spite of it you wont go to bed till you have finished the book probably there is nothing else quite like this in literature though it is one of the many aspects of rabelais indeed no modern english book contains such a profusion and superfluity of talent as this little dynamiter it is a masterpiece upon which prince otto has not improved and no novelist can read it without gnawing envy thison two grounds one the insolent prodigality of its invention mr trollope once spun out a sixline story about a mustard plaster into a weary novelette mr stevenson flushes a regular threevolume covey of incident pursues it awhilefor a chapter a page a few linesand then gaily tosses it aside the novelist must be horrified to see all these valuable plots and promising openings bandied about instead of being hoarded and doled out to the world in expensive volumes the dynamiter contains a whole library of possible novels its charm lies in this wanton profusion of a spendthrift whose resources seem inexhaustible the other ground of envy is most interesting and may not yet have been adequately noticed space precludes more than a reference to it mr stevenson is a perfect adapter i have traced so many of his happiest conceptions to other books that still more might probably be traced by other readers no one unless inspired can evolve ideas and incidents without some peg of suggestion it is delightful to notice how mr stevenson hits upon some unlikely material in a book sees its capabilities turns it upside down inside out transforms it builds upon it a graceful creation of his own i wondered how anyone could invent the story of the fair cuban i wonder still more since i lit on a certain heavy book about hayti how suoh prose could be sublimated into such fiction much more could be said about mr stevensons peculiar genius and methods but after all it would be premature his later works have revised the criticism of their predecessors final judgment must he suspended till his laboursmay they be long and prosperousare completed hitherto i have written not about prince otto but about its author since the less is included in the greater for really there is little to be said it is too late to analyse the plot or characters or point out beauties or defects the only useful or interesting remark that occurs is a caveat as to the lukewarmness of the public the book is not a failure at allit is a success it is not uninterestingit is most fascinating it is confessedly a wild rambling nondescript book but it contains some things of rare beauty and sweetness and overflows with cleverness and originality it refines the odours of auerbachs pine woods and the splendours of ruskins skies but it is disappointing that is the true verdict and why because we and the author too are bent upon his producing something more sustained more suited to be placed beside and compared with and preferred to other great fictions and we all expected that prince otto was to prove the magnum opus well we were wrong it is not even equal to its predecessors but it still towers above its rivals faults it hasexasperating ones and a certain wrongheadedness which is a new feature what reader does not wish that he could have stood at the authors elbow with a few suggestions for my part i would have saidgive me either less or more delicacy in regard to

before only better realized lord fallowfield may be superficial and like some of the other characters superfluous yet he is not so superfluous since his reflections or want of reflection serve on several occasions to relieve the severe tension of the story as its matter is not unlikely to raise the question of the legitimate province of the novel it must be clearly stated briefly it is this  the year 1842 when the actual story begins ushers in the marriage of two wellborn and extremely fine specimens of the human race they are the parents of the future sir richard and are well dowered not only with a high spirit youth and beauty but with great worldly possessions on richard himself all subsequent events turn he is the centre and pivot of the story and on certain physical disabilities of his everything depends his is the sort of case in fact that might be supplied by any medical record but could only have been applied to fictional purposes by a writer of stout nerves for richards horribly dwarfed and crippled condition is not used episodically but is from first to last though dominant factor and the constant interest though he makes head against it for a long time with courage and nobility the plot is as it were against him from the beginning he comes into the world with a  superb  head and shoulders but shorn of the half of each of his legs with we are told but too explicitly feet protruding from the  stumps and arms almost reaching the ground richard is in fact the victim of an obscure prenatal process scientifically termed spontaneous mutilation the fathers death has taken place before his sons birth but not before he has suffered amputation of both his own legs owing to an accident the shock of his death and the manner of itthe days of chloroform had not dawned  also it is suggested the sight of a velasquez  dwarf in its frame have together made a fatal and irreparable impression on the mind of the boys mother surely the student of biology is more fitted to weigh this kind of evidence than the reviewer the result at any rate in the book is a being totally and irretrievably disgraced in physiquea monster this is the situation and this the hero offered to the casual reader we need scarcely add that to follow his long career is not to tread in paths of peace or pleasantness mrs harrison seemingly undismayed by her dismal task has taken him not on the ideal lines of miss mulocks old story  a noble life but more in the  modern spirit and manner in spite of the nature of the theme and the objections that may be offered to it the treatment if not particularly distinguished from the literary point of view shows at times a fine and dignified attitude in the mother and in the afflicted child a sweet and natural boyishness but it cannot in our eyes cover or redeem the inherent grotesqueness and repulsiveness of the subject the mother a woman nobly planned to warn to comfort and command weighed down by an irremediable sorrow and an everpresent terror on the very threshold of a life that had promised only fair things is a beautiful study of resignation and courage if we cannot look on her as a really vital creature but merely as one carefully and at times successfully vitalized the fault is of course our own the tracing of the physical moral and mental history of an abnormal being at the various crises of his fate and the fine and sympathetic influence of the mother show no doubt strong imagination and a great mastery over difficulties of the actual and probable effects of his affliction the author supplies disquieting and unmerciful glimpses one scene stands out as in some parts stronger and more human than the rest because it is in some ways more restrained it is when richard disappointed in his first hopes of marriage desperate in his fierce sense of humiliation and the aloofness of his fate and with all his vital energies in full cry confronts his mother in his bitter determination to live  fully if not worthily nothing is spared elsewhere nor even here perhaps that could agonise a proud yet gentle woman whose sons dire misfortune is in every sense her own the fifth book called  the rakes progress shows the most conspicuous faults of the enterprise unless indeed as we begin to believe the enterprise itself is the greatest fault of all the evil or diabolic side of life conveyed by it rings hollow the writing is overcharged lurid yet inadequate the author seems quite out of her depth here the neapolitan crisis is hardly more unpleasant than incredible and out of focus to use a bludgeon where a more delicate instrument might serve is always a mistake but the more one fastens on errors of detail and there are many and attempts to criticize the deeper the conviction grows that the whole scheme and substance of the book are radically untrue to life and out of drawing besides the story actually closes not on the tragic note but in england to the sound of sir richards wedding bells and the building up of a moral if not a physical ruin  fiction the history of richard cal shady  a romance by lucas malet methuen 6s when you see richard calmady sitting at table he is an apollo his splendid head his strong clearcut face which has all that gallant beauty which comes only to the children of true lovers his broad shoulders and noble carriage all mark him clearly as a man among men but see him stand upon the ground the hideous deformity in his stature allowing his long arms almost to touch the floor see the grotesque shuttle which is his laborious substitute for a walk see him even sittingwhen once the concealing table is removed and those legs ending at the knee are disclosed in all their ghastly rigidityand the apollo is at once forgotten and he becomes merely one of those repulsive freaks of a country fair with whom he himself could not fail to recognise his relationship and the very clear distinction of these two impressions scarcely ever confused which are produced by his physical personality is characteristic of his effect as a literary character the reader never sees him all at once the table may be there to conceal his legs and ones admiration may be concentrated on the apollo  or the deformity may obtrude itself on the view and one can think of nothing eke richard is either one or the other never a combination of the two and the consequence is that he does not end in being a very real person the artistic justification of richard and his deformity is in fact not himself but his influence upon others and especially upon the opposite sex he is himself more or less of a dummy an ingeniously but rather morbidly contrived prism by which all the many colours in that very subtly blended spectrum a womans sexual personality may be ascertained decomposed and separately set forth many women are successively put under the lens and subjected to the experiment there is clara the housemaid who nursed the young dwarf in his youth and wept when he resolved that he was old enough to have a valet there is mrs chifney the trainers wife at the stables who also wept simple soulbecause she thought he had a face with the resignation of an angel there is little lady constance quayle she too wept when richard released her from the engagement of marriage into which she had been forced by her relations but the three important patients the three characters which give the book its claim to be called real and vivid and alive are katherine calmady helen de vallorbes and honoria st quentin in these three persons the author shows with very great skill the effect of the deformity on the perfect mother the perfect sensualist and the perfect virgin it is difficult to say which of the three studies is the most admirable in all the author shows a subtlety a frankness and a tact which are insufficient to conquer ones distaste for the morbid instrument which has been chosen as the key to these womens hearts moreover all the three are drawn with an instinctive sympathy which is quite lacking in the portrait of the man and which shows even if we did not know that  lucas malet is the pseudonym of charles kingsleys daughter that the book is written by a woman perhaps of them all katherine calmady richards mother is the finest pure with that purity of one who has once sounded love to its depths and that love once lost prefers rather to remain ever afterwards chaste in the memory of the past than accept any second best in the opportunity of the present she walks through the book almost with a majesty at any rae with that calm dignity of motion which in richards eyes distinguished her so clearly from other women in a crowded room the second of the three women helen de vallorbes richards evil genius if she is certainly not a pleasant character is scarcely less real except in a few moments of crude melodrama than katherine calmady with the artistic temperaments capacities and limitations in emotion but with no more sentiment or morality in her view of life than to take the most enjoyment out of it she ends in only developing that side of human character which leads to passionate sensualism she is cruelshe was the child who laughed at richards infirmitycalculating in her pleasures and with all the subsequent repulsion for the objects of her desires which is the curse of ignoble passion to her the grotesquelydtformed richard becomes a subtle attraction she begins by inspiring him with love and ends by degrading that love to lust the character is melodramatic at times as when she is dressed in a  flowing yet clinging silken garment of turquoise shot with blue purple and shimmering glaucous green and the chief incident in her amorous relations with richard is described with quite unnecessary elaboration beyond these three characters of the book nothing else and nobody else matters richard does not matter  he is a dummy or a shadow it is perhaps just as well for if one began to consider this shortlegged hero seriously he would very soon become ridiculous cyrano de bergerac had to do a good deal of laughing at himself to maintain his heroic position in relation to his audience but even he was only grotesque as a lover  he was not grotesque as a man and a warrior the minor characters do not matter  they are not drawn with originality or comedy and they tend to become wearisome the melodramatic absurdity of some of the scenes does not matter although that of the clergyman julius march discovering thc old family legend in the library while the dwarf in the velasquez picture opposite seems to grin at him through the growing darkness is absolutely corellian in its obvious luridness the whole idea of this explanation of richards deformity by legend is unworthy of lucas malet it should be left to the how hells xnvelette the unreality of some of the dialogue does not matter although it frequently includes curiously unconversational words like  casement and  greensward and a speech by the old doctor on page 404 reads exactly like a schoolboys essay and quite unlike anything that any human being could have said in talking nothing matters in fact except that lucas malet has drawn three very real portraits of three very different but all interesting women and if we regret the rather grotesque figure which is made to assist in the development of these three characters we can forgive the author for the truth and humanity of the chief characters,omance
B4906,"['3263490', '8802799']",  the quest of the golden girl the most delightful heroes of fiction have ever been knightserrant homeless rascals and questing pilgrims so mr le gallienne is on a fair way to win our favour by merely refusing to let his newest hero sit and wait till his ideal lady comes along to go on a walkingtour to find a wife may sound a trifle too deliberate for romance but then grant a little allegory and it seems all right of his companions of the road we have rather more than a speaking acquaintance with three or four alastor it must be confessed is our favourite and alastor is no golden girl but a charming boy with the star of hope upon his brow and  little wings of haste upon his feet eager for life but life in the empyrean with all the scorn of twenty for the cold wisdom of his elders we should indeed have preferred his company on the quest but we had only the chance of a short meeting then after sundry adventures we fell in with nicolete fishing by the banks of a stream an independent vivacious rather overmature young woman of twenty at least so we guessed from her conversation but the shrewd quester quickly made up his mind that though she was adorable she was a little too young to spend his life with a few days however he does not grudge and in response to her request they set off together and alone on their wanderingfor ever she believes as the sun is shining in the merry month of may we following at a discreet distance prepare to enjoy their adventure enormously but such is their haste or our discretion that we never quite know what happened on the waysunstroke perhapsto reduce the independent and intellectual young woman to sheer inanity when the angry father comes to take her off his hands the hero has our congratulations if not our sympathy then there is sylvia joy whose petticoat and stockings hanging on a clothesline he fell in love with and whose further acquaintance he made when he was benevolently meddling in the affairs of a young married couple who had played away their happiness out of a foolish respect for theory sylvia is quite evidently not the golden girl in his haste he said she would do instead only she preferred her own good professional incomeshe was a talented dancerto anything but the most substantial chance of matrimony semiramis the american with her air of pathetic devotion to every male being within the range of her eyes he perhaps never took very seriously for though they went through the mystic rite of  pressing each others feet under the table at their first meeting that apparently is not the kind of thing the golden girl is in the habit of doing and meanwhile a face had haunted him a face set round with chestnut hair which he met one day on an  apocalyptic moorland he met it again years afterfor the walkingtour did not end his questin piccadilly and it was set about this time with golden locks the quest is at an end his one discontent is with the altered hue time can undo what art has done but she prophecies the death of their happiness when the chestnut hue returns is there symbolism here perhaps it is our own suggestion not the heros that only whilst an artificial light dwelled about elizabeth could the romance remain mr le gallienne will not kill the romance he lets her die instead his hero is puzzled over the psychology of this woman of his heart so should we be if we accepted his view of the matter why should he not love a lovable outcast why to explain his devotion to an unhappy woman who has fallen low should he insist that in spite of all her history she was a puritan  to read sundayschool stories and to think atheists the most depraved of human beings is not to be a puritan he should have the proud courage of his love or give it up besides the girls of a more or less golden hue this hero found some other entertaining things he discovered the foolishness of theory for instance and pleasantly illustrates the same he promulgates some opinions and theories of his own too which we may find amusing without endorsing for example that gipsies being now along with waterfalls and ruined castles  the public property of the emotions no longer touch the private heart or stir the private imagination  likewise  that there is an opportunity for a new  the quest of the golden girl a romance by richard le gallienne 59 net lane form of novel in which the novelist    will skip all the dull people and merely indicate such of them as are necessary to the action by an outline or a symbol another theory of his that innocence consists largely of unconsciousness of wrongdoing  is more relevant to our criticism we base our doubt of the converse of this on the very book before us mr le gallienne is not at all unconscious he desires and mean to be naughtynot wicked of course but the result is innocent enough it is the naughtiness of a boy in his teens however that is suggested not that of a man in his thirties good enough for fooling distasteful for sentiment mr le gallienne is not always fooling but the truth is we are handicapped in our appreciation of his fantasy by the too wide difference between his views of the romantic and our own we knew it when we reached p 48 where occurs the story of the love of the lady of the manor she was once an actress for the village schoolmaster they used to meet in the dingle and laugh and love and drink champagne  when it all came out there was a regular cartload of bottles found there the heart of mr le galliennes hero waxed soft at the tale i retraced my steps to the common and rambled up that green lane along which the romantic schoolmaster used to steal in the moonlight to the warm arms of his love how eagerly he bad trodden the very turf i was treadingwe never know at what moment we are treading sacred earth but was the lodestar of that lover the eyes of his lady or the glimmer of the champagne bottles  under the  cartload of these our feebler sense of the romantic was crushed and killed a m  the quest of the golden girl by r le gallienne lane life was to r l stevenson a road on which he walked in boyish quest of adventure and this attitude of his has been adopted by younger writers with irritating frequency here the idea of a walking tour in search of the golden girl or ideal wife suits the desultory and fanciful irresponsibility of mr le gailiennes style the adventures of the hero related in the first person are very loosely strung together with little confidences to the reader and reflections on the lack of progress in the story which smack of  padding at other times the author is fluent to excess his reflections on a single look are 44 similarly in that moment i seemed to have dived into this unknown girls eyes to have walked through the treasure palaces of her soul to have stood before the flaming gates of her heart to have gathered silver flowers in the fairy gardens of her dreams 1 had followed her white  robed spirit across the moonlit meadows of her fancy and by her side had climbed the dewy ladder of the morning star and then suddenly i had been whirled up again to the daylight through the magic fountains of her eyes there is more yet hut this will probably suffice and surely oaths barmaids ana whiskeyandsoda were out of place in a fanciful and frankly impossible idyl such as this mr le gallienne has enough wit and fancy to do without these wearisome adjuncts of some modern humour the plain sensuality of many pages the insistence on details modern taste has agreed to leave unmentioned is a much more serious matter sentimental journeys nowadays should surely leave out some of sternes effects there is here not to mince matters much of that odd and most uncomfortable coarseness which we are told on good authority distinguishes  the bright boy of fiction mr le gallienne can write a good deal better than he has done in the quest of the golden girl,omance

distinct than  cumshire folk with characters as well suited to exhibit human passion in its simplicity and a dialect as rich and racy as any in the north of england in addition he has found a story of intense terror mixed with intense pathos readers of focsle yarns will not be surprised at the attraction of the isle of man and its people to the writer of romance and will be glad that the field has been entered by so capable an author as mr hall caine it is to be hoped that the deemster himself is not a character common in the island for he is the incarnation of all that is most mean and despicable in human nature selfish cruel crafty and cowardly he is the evil genius of the piece and is drawn perhaps more thoroughly and carefully than any other of the characters it is he who manages

it wont break susi you see its not a gentlemans carriage there is a vast difference between a gentlemans carriage and a peasants cart just as there is between gentlemen and peasants your carriage is vast and roomy and highwheeled and cushioned and painted in short its a splendid thing to look at but take it out on a heavy road and down it breaks with a vengeance  its full of screws and such tomfoolery and only fit for a smooth road now a peasants cart goes through anything and mine is a perfect jewel the wheels are of my own make and peti has hooped them  peti was not quite so confident  i hope theres no water said he scratching his head weve had some heavy rains and if the low country is full of water never mind peti im sure its all in good order and you susi dear dont be afraid my brother pishta who lived on the other side of the river died last week when he was just about to leave the place he got a passport and a landlords discharge for the purpose those papers are of no use to his widow but they are just the thing for you and viola for they will help you to get away i know of a good place about a hundred miles from here where you mayearn an honest livelihood youre not fit for the kind of life youre leading ill take you to the place with my own horses you have not got much luggage the great thing is to get out of the county for its a rum affair such a county and the best of it is that it is not too large dont you think so petibut peti made no reply not even when susi catching at the faint ray of hope which fell into the gloom of her life inquired whether the gulyash a promise was not too good to be realised  the gypsy sat motionless with his eyes staring into the darkness which surrounded them they hurried on in silence whilst the fog grew dense and the sky blacker than before no trace was left of either willows mounds stacks or wellbeams still they pressed forward until the splashing in water of the horses hoofs stopped their progress petis fears were but too well founded the place where they halted was under water the gypsy descended to reconnoitre the extent as he advanced he beheld the plain like a wide lake of which he could not see the end he retraced his steps and walked to the right but he found that the water stretched in every direction at length he made his way to a dry place to which he directed the gulyash  let us go on in this direction said he as he took his place in the cart there is some chance of reaching the forest be careful ishtvan and keep close to the water or else youll lose your way this heres the yellow spring  christ save us cried susi  we are surely too late and my poor husband   no said the gipsy with illdissembled concern  unless the water has flooded the frogs dyke we shall find the black lake dry and if so were safe on with you ishtvanconfound the theiss said the gulyash as he whipped his horses on nonsense its not the theiss twas but yesterday i saw the river at ret its as quiet as a lamb but this water comes from the new ditch which the gentry have made they make the water mad with their ditches and dykes a thousand thunders  theres water here  and he pulled the horses back one of which had slipped and fallen susi wrung her hands peti jumped down and walked through the water he came back and led the horses onwards its not worth stopping for my beauties said he addressing the horses youll see some rougher work by and bye if you stay with the gulyash pishta they reached the opposite bank and hastened on until they were again stopped by the water the gypsy wrung his handsthe black lake is brimful theres not a horse in the world can ford it stop here said susiill walk through itnonsense susi the lake is full of holes you are weak if your foot slips youll never have the strength to get up and then you are done for hands off let go my bunda god will help me but i cannot leave my husband in this last extremity and she struggled to get down now susi be reasonable whats to become of your children if they hang your husband and you are drowned susi sat down by the side of the cart she covered her face with both her hands and wept bitterly dont be afraid child  said the gulyash either i go over or peti does you see the forest is just before us and if theres not a road confound it well make oneso we will cried peti  ill cross the water though the very devil were in it let me feel my way a little is not that the large tree we saw the other day  may be it is but i cant make it out on account of that confounded fog there are lots of high trees in the forestto the left of the tree about two hundred yards from it there isa clearing in the wood on the day i spoke of we drove through it with the cart dont you rememberhow the deuce shouldnt i remember there ought to be some reeds to the right ofthe treeso there ought to be now you go to the right and i to the left if i can find the clearing and if thats the tree i spoke of ill walk through the water for its a rising ground from that tree to the other bank of the theiss  ill go with you said susi my heart beats so fast theres a murmur in my earslet me go  ill die with fears if you tell me to remain here susi my soul if i can cross the waters 111 come back and carry you on my back but stay where you arestay for violas sake if not for your own they walked away and were lost in the darkness susi stood by the water looking at the forest alas sighed she  i am so near him and yet i cannot go to him the poor woman was right on the other side of the water scarcely more than a thousand yards from the place where susi trembled and prayed we find viola with his comrades encamped in one of the few oak forests of which hungary can boast peti will be recognised by every one as the omnipresent and most cunning tinker already often used in romancesand last and not worst used in the  giselle of mr palgrave simpson viola the robber is a freebooter uccording to the interesting pattern which schiller scott and longo intervallo mr james have successively followed but his trial a precious exposition by the way of hungarian justice is capitally describedand his final fate is as affecting as if it had not been foreseen from the first moment in which he appearsamong the lighter scenes that of the election is wrought up with great spirit and obvious resemblance to the life the strength however of the village notary lies in its romantic portions these though not new in incident are so forcibly wrought and so skilfully varied by touches of local colour as thoroughly to carry away and interest the

B1942,['6724682'],  the deemster  a romance by hall caine in 3 vols chatto this book would be welcome if only on the ground that it is well worthy of the author of the shadow of a crime in shifting his scene of action from the hills of cumberland to the isle of man mr hall caine has left behind him none of his three great gifts of imagination pathos and humour and he has found a people even more distinct than  cumshire folk with characters as well suited to exhibit human passion in its simplicity and a dialect as rich and racy as any in the north of england in addition he has found a story of intense terror mixed with intense pathos readers of focsle yarns will not be surprised at the attraction of the isle of man and its people to the writer of romance and will be glad that the field has been entered by so capable an author as mr hall caine it is to be hoped that the deemster himself is not a character common in the island for he is the incarnation of all that is most mean and despicable in human nature selfish cruel crafty and cowardly he is the evil genius of the piece and is drawn perhaps more thoroughly and carefully than any other of the characters it is he who manages to draw to himself in his fathers lifetime all his fathers property and turns his defrauded brother out of doors it is he who buys his wife of her father the archdeacon and breaks her heart with his

he cannot imagine a hero differing from the honest john even in the matter of style it is thus for instance that george cranleigh opens his narration of the present story 44 if any man came to me and said 4 you are going to tell your tale good sir without knowing how to handle it i should look at him at first with some surprise and anger at his interference yet in a very few minutes unless he wanted to argue about it probably he would have my confession and a prayer for his assistance for every one knows how to do a thing much better than the one who does it who would not suppose from such a beginning that this  romance of surrey  was an historical romance dating about the days of dutch william  not at all george cranleigh often called farmer jarge is a nineteenth century hero ruined at least his father sir harold cranleigh has been ruined by free trade mr blackmores special bogey against which even circassian surs are made to lift up their voice another point of resemblance between  dariel and mr blackmores most celebrated story is in the great length of both in the case of the firstmentioned the length is quite disproportionate either to the number of characters introduced or the complication of the history for though  dariel certainly does not lack the element of romance still less that of improbability for though first two hundred pages it jogs along in a very humdrum fashion and all the action there is is confined to four or five characters in the very opening chapter george riding home from market surprises a maiden of surpassing beauty upon her knees in a ruined chapel she proves to be dariel the daughter of sur imar a circassian prince who because a blood feud has arisen between him and his sister hasfor the sake of peace and lest she should be tempted to evil deeds with his daughter his fosterbrother stepan and a body of retainers come to england and settled peaceably in a deserted house in surrey it is difficult to feel stirred by a strong sense of romance at the thought of this prince of the tribe of the lesghians settled in surrey  perhaps because the situation lacks probability and certainly the romance is not supplied by the concurrent love of jackson stoneman the stockbroker for  our grace as the son of sir harold cranleigh of crogate hall perpetually calls his sister sir harold ruined as has been said has retired to a cottage on his estate they have now only one tenantfarmer left upon it and the hall is let to stoneman while george the second son turns himself into a farmer and grace into a dairymaid they enter so thoroughly into their parts that it can hardly be said that george ever talks like a gentleman and grace generally has the manners of a servant girl the scene of mr stonemans proposal and acceptance is a triumph of vulgarity grace never addresses her  admirer that is the name for him without bringing in his name  mr stoneman mr stoneman is it possible this is one of my brothers proceedings  tou have seen more of them than i have mr stoneman excuse me mr stoneman  take care mr stoneman and so forth while  mr stoneman himself is quite equal to the occasion this is how he introduces himself into the dairy while grace is weighing her butter  i wont say a word if i may come in o do let me come in and be calculated too if i may only sit upon a pan upside down or anyhow quite out of sight in the corner oh what a sweet place  i could live upon the smell of it but i wont even go near the lace edging of a pat however after though first two hundred pages have been passed we get to business and the story of sur imar with the events which follow upon it makes a much more exciting history the novel ought to have begun about this point for even then there are left 300 closely printed pages the plot without being very recondite or remarkably original is sufficiently complicated to be interesting and perhaps it would be scarcely fair to the author to explain it fully it turns as has been said on a blood feud prince rakhan of the osset tribe had secretly murdered the father of imar though imar was told by schamyl the historic champion of the caucasus that the older man had been killed by the russians rakhan had acted from revenge because the prince of the lesghians had refused him his daughter marva but marva escaped from her convent at tiflis and married rakhan ignorant of course of his crime later on rakhan persuaded imar that his wife orla had been unfaithful to him and imar though he did not kill orla caused her to commit suicide to discover his mistake before the breath had quite left her body he had his revenge however and killed rakhan in a duel this tragic history is told by imar himself to george he has scarcely finished it when he passes on to what thinks the reader a

something in the nature of a pleasurable anticipation few novelists of the present day have a more unerring instinct for charming incident or a more delicate sense behind the present inordinate demand for a sentimental outlook of the saving gift of humour the bath comedy  is a recollection of laughter still and how few booksthough so many set out with that intentionreally rouse amused appreciation the star dreamer is among the more serious novels which have come from the two authors the idea itself has both freshness and grace it deals with a woman as the humanising influence of lifethe power that personally creates to a certain extent all the minor graces of existezce that flings into the simple actualities of the daily round a charm and sweetness by which even the familiar trivialities take on a gracious and comfortable attractiveness two lonely philosophers live in the same house one is all day in his laboratory making experiments in herbs and medicines the other sits in a tower trying to discover new stars in the distant face of heaven into these two absorbed but attenuated lives comes a womanyoung pretty full of delicate perceptions and the unconscious joy of life she is the daughter of the alchemist and the cousin of the star dreamer and is herself widowed after a singularly disastrous marriage the book commences with her entrance into the laboratory of the neglected and halfdehumanised alchemist and the cheerful practicality of her presence pours itself instantly into the disordered existences of the two solitary and unbalanced researchers after truth upon this groundwork of a woman as the warm and dainty element of life the story is built up  the star dreamer gradually finds a more moving light shining in his own dwelling than he ever perceived through his telescopes a clever intrigue however is started to prevent their marriage and the plot develops into one of some excitement the end is as it should be happy the hero and heroine being left in the first tremulous ecstasy of a sharp escape from recent pain of the writing it is not necessary to speak the same qualities of vivacity and ease that characterise young april seem to give the book not only a singular freshness but in spite of its accomplished manner something pleasantly young and wholehearted it reads as if done very easily very naturally and with an intense pleasure in the doing as for ellinor the heroine she is not only a fascinating influence but a woman drawn with delightful exposures here and there of the inner vagaries of human nature her manner of falling in love could not have been a truer revelation of personality  the star dreamer by agnes and egerton castle the argument of the book is taken from keatss  endymion and it is dedicated to lady stanley as a  story of a womans influence the story has a kind of double backgrounda herbgarden and a laboratory across these backgrounds move the figures of the heroine her father and her lover the atmosphere combines open air with the closeness of sealed rooms the influence of the stars finally makes for happiness and a pretty ending   the dream life is over david we stand upon the threshold of the golden chamber shall we not enter constable 6s  new novels the star dreamer by agnes and egerton i castle constable  co there is a dwindling company of writers who may with special meaning be styled romancers we do not intend to connote by the word  romance  mere incident and adventure that is a vulgar misuse of a highsounding and noble term one of the very best descriptions of what romance is and is not was given by mr egerton castle some years ago in an essay in the anglosaxon review the difficulty of definition pervades our poor limited lives and language yet one may say that romance is life seen through a temperament and from this point of view all the work of mr and mrs castle may be regarded as eminently romantic we have said that this once glorious company dwindles and the name is frequently  soild with all ignoble use but in the forefront of romantic writers are undoubtedly the authors of  the star dreamer the key is struck on the threshold of this tale even by the single illustration facing the titlepage which is not the authors work in the introduction concerning bindon cheveral the atmosphere is suggested with great skill and art and when the story opens the reader comes ripe to it and in a mood to listen the star dreamer is in fact a model of what a romance should be its style is always pleasing and often distinguished sometimes it is perhaps a little too lush the narrative flows leisurely as should be the case if one desires to stop to enjoy things by the way and the sense of character is not domineering it is not for character that you go first and foremost to a romance mr and mrs castle think largely in pictures even sometimes in tableaux which make pretty effects and draw a judicious reader on one feels too that the authors take pleasure in creating the atmosphere which environs their story and enjoy adding every little touch that tells the garden is set forth in its colour and feeling the room is painted with particularity and every chair is in its right place and of the right kind all these attentions to detail help the milieu as there is nothing in the nature of a harsh catalogue here the period of the tale is the second decade of last century but at times it seems to convey an impression of even more ancient times there is master simon the simpler for example who appears somewhat anachronistic yet the stagemanagement is such that you insensibly believe in him sir david cheveral is the star dreamer and the story tells how he is awakened from his nocturnal communion with the heavens mr hardy has written of an astronomer but mr hardys novel was hardly a romance the people who move in this narrative are of the flesh and blood of the early nineteenth century and make you feel it the authors have achieved a remarkable success in the figure of ellinor marvell and have attempted a striking character in lady lochore that hectic reckless dying woman is a bold venture and very nearly succeeds in convincing one there is to criticise a delightful story just a touch of melodrama about her which gives one pause yet there is melodrama in life and it is not possible to deny the privilege of using it to romance even to the novel the book ends on a note of romantic rapture and glamour which may well rekindle youth in hearts no longer young and that is surely a great achievement this is undoubtedly the best book yet written by the authors incidentally we may spare a word of praise for the cunning which has extracted so much from the study of old herbals,omance

there are only three characters to speak of in the booksir richard calmady his mother and his cousin the other figures which crowd the stage are of no account and of the three the cousin mme helen de vallorbes is the most conspicuous and the least pleasant it is not a pleasant story at all and those who wish for entertainment and amusement had better avoid it it is a study of life under morbid and unnatural conditions in this respect it suggests reminiscences of  lhomme qui rit for the hero is a man blighted from birth with the curse of physical defect in  notre dame victor hugo also touches upon the same gruesome theme but lucas malet deals with this matter in her own fashion the story is cry simple the history of sir richard calmady begins some months before he was born his father having his leg smashed by a horse in his stable died under theamputationthat followed his legswcrecutoffat the knee in the days of charles ii the illegitimate son of sir thomas calmady an ancestor of sir richard had also lost his nether extremities his unnatural father having driven over the child as they came from the church where he had been marrying another woman the deserted mistress with the

his mother lady calmady who is painted in ideal colours as the most marvellous and devoted of mothers was filled with profound remorse at the effect which her own emotion has produced upon her child she dedicates herself to him and brings him up bravely sir richard himself is represented as almost human perfection cut short at the kneehandsome stately wellformed possessing in every respect an ideal physique with the exception of his shorn extremities the result of the feet being planted on to the extremities of the thighs rendered it impossible for him to be furnished with artificial limbs hence he could only hobble about in a more or less hideous fashion the first half of the book is devoted to a description of how the poor boy thus marred from birth grows up and suffers keenly at every turn from those slights from which   the history of sir richard calniady by lucas malet london metnuen and co 6i8 pages price 6s all his mothers loving care could not shield him his first love

cripples deformity his mother blazing with indignation had flung the child from her path and ordered her to leave the house the little girl had fallen against the wall and inflicted a scar upon her forehead which caused her to regard lady calmady with undyinghatred in her childish wrath she vowed to be revenged and she kept her word returning afterwards when she had made a more or less unhappy

girl recoils at the last moment from marrying the truncated suitor and sir richard thereupon maddened and despairing determined to have his fling and go to the devil he declares he will go the common way of common coarsegrained sensual men and be of this world worldly he saysi am going to have just all that my money and position and even this wild deformityfor by god i will use that too  what people wont give for love they will give for curiositycan tring me of pleasure and notoriety i am going to lay hold of life with these rather horribly strong arms of mine strong as a young bull apes i mean to tear the very vitals out of living to tear knowledge excitement intoxication out of it making them by right of conquest my own as i cannot have a wife i will have mistresses as i cannot have

in spite of the wreck of all his other gods he continues to cherish in a secret temple of his own as the one pure woman in the world in reality she is a veritable messalina although as the authoress says in a sentence of almost unique coarseness in modern novels the artist was at least as present in her as the whore and to the delineation of this great courtesan with fine aesthetic appreciations and inevitable animality lucas malet devotes herself with a minutenessof analysis much more frequently found in french than in english novels for some reason or other lucas malet appears to be fascinated by this shepanther of a woman she paints her minutely in almost every phase of emotion she describes the woman with the licentious city of naples as a background deliberately laying her snares and completing her arrangements to lure her cousin to his undoing it is not often that in english fiction there is a picture drawn at full length and in vivid colours of the way of a strange woman with the man whom she has marked down for her victim and what makes the thing all the more horrid is the emphasis which lucas malet lays upon the effect of physical deformity as an incentive to sensual desire in the midst of a scene in which helen was plying all her arts in order to fire calmadys blood sir richard had to move his positionshe stared fascinated by that cruel spectacle for the instant transformation of the apparently tall and conspicuously wellfavoured courtly gentleman just now sitting at table with her into this shuffling longarmed crippled dwarf was at first utterly incredible then portentous then by virtue of its very monstrosity absorbing and to her adorable whetting appetite as veritable famine might chastity became to her more than ever absurd a culpable waste of her own loveliness of sensation of emotion a sin against those vernal influences working in this generous nature surrounding her and working in her own blood all the primitive instinct of her womanhood called aloud in her that she must wedmust wed and the strident voice of the great painted city coming up to her urgent incessant carried the same message as did the radiant sea whose white lips kissed the indented coastline as though pale and hungry with love while the nan before her by his very abnormality and a certain secretness inevitable in that heightened her passion he was to her of all living men most desirable so that she must win him and hold him must see and know of course the inevitable result follows she held this man in the hollow of her hand by right divine of beauty wit and the manifold seductions of her richly endowed personality this of her many loves was the crown and the climax as the adulteress hunts for the precious life so this lithe shepanther tracked down her prey and triumphed without remorse in the satisfaction of her revenge and the consummation of her desire like her prototype in the book of proverbs she ate and drank and said  i have done no evil it is very different with her victim calmady who had wilfully trampled under foot all canons of morality and was shocked back into virtue by the sudden destruction of his last ideal  the last of mv selfmade gods he told her has indeed gone overboard he fled from the scene of his undoing took refuge on board his yacht but venturing out feverstricken to attend the opera he was again tracked down by his conqueror who came to him in his box and vowed her determination never to leave him  richard she said very softly laying her hand lightly upon his thighi forgive all i am not satisfied with loving i will come with you i will stay with you i will be faithful to you yes yes even that your love is unlike any other it is unique as you yourself are unique i want more of it  her lips were parted in naughty laughter and then not without a shrinking of quick horror richard beheld the soul in herthat being of lovely proportions exquisitely formed in every part yet black as the foul liquid lanes between the hulls of the money ships dowvn in naples harbourstep delicately in between those parted lips returning whence it came he refused to go with her whereupon she summoned a former lover into the box who struck richard again and again across the face with his metalbuttoned gloves calmady tried to strike him and fell heavily stunning himself as his temples struck the lower step of the descent from the back of the box the man kicked calmady as he lay asking  dear madame are you sufficiently avenged is it enough helen expressed herself satisfied and the two went out into the blackness of the dark night the third part of the book describes the regeneration of sir richard calmady the fever possessed him and he came for a time near to the door of death he was nursed back by his mother who rejoiced to welcome back the prodigal who had found the husks which the swine did eat so very bitter to his taste sir richards repentance was genuine and final his mother had the satisfaction of finding for him an excellent wife from whom he conceals nothing either of his deformities or of his lapses from the straight path her acceptance of him is characteristic and somewhat original  for heavens sake she said  dont take me out of pity i would never forgive you there is a good deal of us both one way and another and we should give each other a hell of a time if i was in love and you were not butshe put her hand on the peak of that very ugly saddle again but if you do care here i am i am yours body and soul marry me she said having made up her mind to accept him she found that his crippling was dearer to her than any other mans wholeness and his wrongdoings dearer than any other mans virtue what wve wonder wvould people think if a man were to say such a thing to a woman like helen everything goes so well that in the last page he tells his mother he is thankful that she brcught him into the world even as he was which was good for the most perfect of mothers to hear speaking of the book as a whole no one can deny its ability or the nerve of its authoress  but whether it is a book which makes altogether for edification is a question upon which readers will

capacities although he must needs draw somewhat more from memory and less from invention than at the beginning of his career of authorship if it be impossible that he can altogether avoid mannerism by which we mean the copying of himself yet it must be admitted that this his latest work shows no symptoms of exhausted fancy or overlaboured faculties the cause of this is the profound knowledge of the history of the middle ages its men manners and habits which has secured for his long series of historical novels an interest apart altogether from story or portrait to read a romance of his is to read the history of the times of which he treats only in a somewhat more lively and truthful and impressive form we have the result of his studies put into a pleasing picture which is readily remembered his personages may be real or ideal but when he does attempt to draw areal character itiselaborated withcare and history and memoir are consulted for traits which should as it were restore the dead for the benefit of the living perhaps as fine a theme for the novelist as any to be found in history is the character of rioad the third and the men and manners of his time the author is however subjected to the disadvantage of a comparison with the portraiture of shakspfer so great is the influence unconsciously exercised over us by the dramatist that our notions of the crookbacked tyrant are formed from the pa and not from history and any departure froml the main features of that representation is likely to be received with disapprobation by the reader as a violation not of truth only but of propriety mr james has boldly dared to introduce richard the third as not quite the fiend tradition and s1iak5pxri have made him and eonsequently more in accordance with such authentic memorials of him as have been reserved and which in the hands of modern historians have thrown a new light upon his character and career ilence a work which is more valuable more useful and likely to be of longer life than if it had been a mere romance to be read for its story and then thrown aside and forgotten mr james has produced a very perfect historical tableau in persons in costumes in scenery and accessories and we suspect that a much more accurate conception of the time of which he treats may be formed by a careful investigation of this romance than from any of our regular histories and even as a mere narrative it is one of his best and will profoundly interest those who care little for the profit to be derived from its perusal the plot is admirably constructed and ingeniously sustained and evolved the incidents are well imagined and the composition has more of the authors pictorial power than we have seen in any of his later productions lie has abbreviated his dialogues anl avoided that minuteness of inventory which was usually complained of by readers who were not possessed with a passion for antiquities we will not further describe the plot because the work will of course be found in every circulating library and be read by all who read novels and by many who do not confess to be readers of them it would mar much of their pleasure in the perusal to inform them here what is cointing so we content ourselves with a few extracts which will rather tempt to further acquaintance with the volumes than anticipate them the reader will probably be surprised to find richard described as a man having some tender feelings as in this masterly scene between himself and queen anne on receiving the news of the death of prince edward the instant she heard her husbands step she turned quickly round with a timid and inquiring glance but riclhard was in one of his milder moods the subject of his thought aid hers was one of common affection and lie advanced tenderly towards her and took her in his arms saying 1 have heard nothing ann but cast these fears from your mind i trust that this is nothing but one of those sicknvsses of childhood which come and pass away like spring showers the tears came into the queens eyes rising from very mingled emotions her apprehension for her child her husbands tenderness the feeling perhaps of her own failing health the recollections of early years all moved her heart and yet she feared that her emotions might rouse an impatient spirit in eichards breast it was not so however and pressing her somewhat closer to him he said well well wipe away your tears love if we hear not better tidings today thou shalt go to mliddleham and i will go with thee  thanks my gracious lord thanks replied the queen  perhaps it is but a weak womans fears for her only one that so sink my spirit but i feel today a sort of awe as if of approaching fate  you give way you give way  said richard with a slight touch of impatience  however there is good news abroad this rash exiled earl of richmond whom you have heard of deubtlesa haj on his betoa ship which the good doting duke now bitterly regrets be lent

B8925,['9286231'],  the claim jumpers by stewart edward white hodder  stoughton in this simple story of the adventures of a young man of new york in the west mr white takes something of a new departure here is none of the intensity which made the blazed trail notable and lent a certain distinction to  the magic forest and  the silent places the author pursued the vein of those books far enough as was apparent in the last of them and doubtless he was wise therefore to break fresh ground here he presents us with a young man and a maiden whose love affairs in a wild piece of mining country are made far more of than the matter referred to in the title the hero is a tenderfoot in the beginning having been brought up strictly upon the home shelter system  by parents whose reverence for social conventionsis a religion the girl on the contrary is of western origin and knows nothing of social conventions both are types with which many writers have made us familiar since bret harte wrote but mr white knows that his characters represent familiar typesthat his scheme is by no means original he has relied on his treatment to supply the element of freshness and we think him justified it is a good tale told simply and with spirit  there is no inspiration but there is creditable workmanship,omance
