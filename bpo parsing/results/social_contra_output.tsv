B105,['8525908'],  prudence palfrey prudence palfrey by t b aldrich in one volume george routledge and sons  prudence palfrey  is already on the railway stalls by the 3ide of its predecessor  marjorie daw in giving us this new novel mr aldrich has conferred a benefit on locomotive humanity aldrich has murdered sleep the unhappy nocturnal traveller will we can confidently assert be absorbed in  prudence palfrey until either the story or the journey comes to an abrupt end mr aldrichs sprightly and witty narration would carry his reader with unflagging interest through a far longer novel  prudence palfrey  is a short story and its winding up is so rapid that we can fancy it written as well as intended to be read on a railway journey and that the finale was dashed off as the train whirled screaming into the terminus  prudence palfrey is a pretty orphan heires3 of her guardian old mr dent the old gentleman was attached to prues mother and is now very much inclined to keep prue for himself altogether but mr dent has a penniless young nephew john and john falls in love with prue and she is more than half in love with him john doesnt speak to prudence but he tells his uncle all about it like a frank honest fellow as he is and when the uncle is very angry there are high words between them and john makes up his mind to go golddigging to california before he sets out the young people have one little accidental meeting remembered ali their lives afterwards john is too wise to ask for any promises he goes to put money in his pure and will come back for prue he tells her when he is rich prue says slyly but suppose i have married  old robin gray in the meantime and john replies generously  you are free to do it they part and prue waits heavyhearted till the crown shall become a pound and her john come back to marry her it seems doubtful however whether this will ever occur for john meets with a villainous chum who robs him of all his gains and escapes with the plunder leaving the luckless lover to begin all over again prudence waits three years uncertain whether john is alive or dead meantime old mr dent is laying his plans at home a new clergyman has been introduced chiefly by his influence into the old brick church the rev mr dillingham is young rich highlyeducated and of a serious disposition all the young ladies of his congregation set their caps at him he is charmed with the society of mr dent and his ward  though his manner to prue is never that of a lover and prue is a little nettled to find that she has so little power over the interesting and popular young clergyman therefore when one day mr dillingham suddenly proposes to prudence she cannot help feeling surprised and pleased and asks for a short respite to consider her answer the time allotted passes away and still prue wavers mr dillingham himself turns the balance how could he be so foolish as to select from all j the music on the piano that one little scotch song for prue to sing to him it is auld robin grey  and prudence sings with a strange passion breaks down and hurries away to her own room she can sing no more to mr dillingham that last meeting with john under the trees by the garden seat has she ever forgotten it  the old old love has come backfor ever up to this time the story has run on smoothly enough but now on a sudden john comes back a ragged wraith with a broken arm and discovers that the portrait of mr dillingham is the portrait of his villainous chum who ran off with the money bags and has since attempted to shoot john through the head on the same day mr dillingham absconds leaving a bleating and shepherdless flock and several damsels in despair and now discoveries are unearthed like potatoes mr dillingham preached from known authors mr dillingham had a habit of carrying off valuables from his friends houses  and lastly mr dillingham had proposed to and been accepted by a young lady a friend of prues if old mr dent is chagrined at his want of discrimination as regards the character of the enigmatical young clergyman he cannot feel more acutely ashamed of himself than does the reader of the story who has been completely gulled by mr aldrich to the very last moment the fault which most strikes us in the plot of mr aldrichs story is that he does not sufficiently explain though motives of the clerical scamp we are left to wonder what feelings on mr dillinghams part could have prompted him to come a wolf in sheeps clothing into the heart of johns family and why he sent an emissary to track and murder john if he meant to marry prudence and so possess himself of old mr dents money we could understand it but if this was his motive why does mr aldrich engage him subsidiarily to the other young lady who must eventually in any case have published his conduct and ruined his prospects  if mr aldrich intends the clerical gentleman to be a riddle without an answer he succeeds indubitably the story would have been a pretty and complete one and perhaps more artistic if mr dillingham had not been a villain but simply prues other suitorher  old robin gray but it would certainly not have been so excitingnot such a railway novel in fact there is one other character in the story which we must mention before we conclude it is parson wibird hawkins the old man who was shelved to make room for mr dillingham  who had been pastor of the parish for fifty years and of whom the parish was tired  whose dearest wish was that when the spirit of the lord came to take him it might find him in the pulpit of the old brick church who died very quietly on the evening of his abdication sitting in his study with his bible on his knees a brokenhearted man mr aldrich possesses a keen sense of the pathetic as well as of the humorous there are scraps of description in his storysuch as the old parsonage garden with its marigoldbeds and its little green bench under the vines and again the ruined fort on the hilltop with the varied landscape unrolling itself  like a coloured map beneathwhich though brief are rich and indelible we feel sure that  prudence palfrey  will be widely and deservedly popular m f,social_contra

B7145,['9446250'],  owen a waif by the author of no church c  3 vols hurst  blackett there is a great deal to be liked in this book but it is not equal to no church the writing is clever and pleasant and the tone is good but the story ls lacking in interest and drags heavily in partsoccupying so many years in the lives of its characters that the reader becomes a little fatigued and bored with them at last and it is not easy to follow the waif through the many changes and to vicissitudes he undergoes before he arrives at a happy and prosperous conclusion in the last chapter the opening scenes are perhaps the best of all the description of the tent full of wandering vagrants on their way from a great fair in markshire is curious and striking the goodnatured mrs chideny who takes pity on the ragged boy and persuades her drunken husband to befriend him on his road to london is a character that it is impossible not to like owen the waif finds it so at all events and devotes his whole future to the good motherly woman who has spoken to him the only kind words he has ever heard in his life deserted by his own mother a halfcrazy drunkard owen attaches himself to the fortunes of the chideny family who keep a small and humble greengrocers shop in lambeth while tarby the husband drinks and fights in  the cut owen carries on the business and goes to market and drives round his barrow and supports mrs chideny almost entirely by his own exertions tarby however becomes more than ever wild and reckless and having killed a policeman in one of his drunken brawls he is transported at last and the waif is left in charge of the wife and child and the interests of the greengrocery concern in hannah street next mrs chideny dies and owen has the little girl on his hands entirely by this time however he has made some friendstwo brothers of the name of dell one an engineer with a pretty little quiet niece the other a formidable policeman no 92 an old enemy of owens but at times of repose and relaxationof  unbuttonment as he calls it92 is inclined to be friendly and sociable and to give owen the best of advice the dells have persuaded owen to attend an evening school and to read useful books in the few leisure moments he can find and john dell obtains for him a situation in the foundry of which he is foreman and the chideny business is disposed of and little mary put out to nurse with an old woman in the country 92 retires from the service and ruth dell his daughter obtains a situation as schoolmistress and at a place called onsted wo find the principal characters all collected round the focus of the cherburys country seat isaac cherbury being the owner of the foundry where john dell and owen work the mother cherbury is a kind simpleminded old soul who patronises ruth and adopts little mary chideny and is civil to owen whenever he comes that way which he does as often as possible being very much in love with ruth dell ruth has however another loverone arthur glinden a young doctor a jealous exacting irritable young man who hates owen mortally but after several quarrels and reconciliations ruth eventually marries glinden and owen goe3 out to australia for six years the author has the kindness and generosity not to insist on our following the hero to the antipodes so wo are left dehind with the dells and cherburys till owen and tarby chideny return at the end of the six years both with a little money owen set3 up in business with john dell and tarby with his old enemy 92 then a series of lovers quarrels and anxieties begin owen finds mary a very pretty and welleducated young lady quite ready to marry him whenever he wishes it but he fixes a twelvemonth as a time of trial in consideration of bis wards youth and inexperiencehe being all the time terribly jealous of isaac cherbury an eccentric gentleman subject to bad headaches ruth is not happy with her husband who is still jealous of owen and when he is happily disposed of by a railway accident mary begins to be jealous of the go un of tic th m dr d  oi lai an su fu th st pi ai cc ac ri in w d tl ol ir b t n si s a a widowed ruth owens first love and so they go on making themselves and each other very uncomfortable about nothing after the manner of lovers and it takes a great deal of explan tion and trouble to set them all torights again they being what mr cherbury would eau  very fussy people the rest of the story relates to owens mother who turns up again constantly always drunk and abusive and disreputable and john dell it seems knew her and loved her in her youth and will not desert her now so he and owen try in vain to reclaim her and she at last dies in a refuge for the destitute established and supported by owen and ruth glinden succeeds in bringing about a kind of unsatisfactory deathbed repentance the moral of the wnole seems to be thisthat owen was a stern hard moral man with no real religious principle  if he had thought more of god and less of himself his mother declares he could have saved her eight years before owen acted and worked and strove to do what was right but he had no heavenborn softening influence at his heart so his efforts to do good were unsuccessful ruth and mary and john dell were thorough christians and therefore they succeeded better and were able to carry out owens plans we are in all probability intended to believe that owen eventually became an altered man but that is rather left to our imagination than stated as a fact the main impression left on our minds is that the story is wearisome the conversations and descriptions well written but wanting in interest and that the events are like angel visits few and very far between,social_contra

one member donna sabine de renny of coldscaur a queenly little lady whom he saved for his own purposes and who when he really fell in love with an even more chill and queenly dame proved to be rather an awkward possession he married his love who acceded for the sake of a crown and became immediately a mawkish suitor for her favours an abject slave meanwhile love was busy with the new countess of

detail would demand more columns than we have to spare it is above all a tale of action and once fairly into it no reader will easily set the book down mr hewletts ornate and yet at times almost biblical style is especially suited to the undiscoverable country where his scenes are set and its occasional extravagances do not offend us some of the conversational sparring between various

kingdom of jadis in the provinces whereof marvilion campflors and so onthe drama of renny is enacted to read it is like wandering down a long wall of tapestry where placenames profuse and pretty drawn equally from the romance languages and from english serve as a sort of lettering just as the stitches show in tapestry so here the threading in and out of words and phrases arrests attentionby its conspicuousness if not always by its effect of success and just as tapestry may give us any imaginable scene of joy or horror or solemnity but all most often at the level of decoration not quite seriously to be believed in so  the song of renny full of tremendous events and affairs strikes us as decorative work which amuses the imagination but makes no deeper appeal judged as such its chief faults are lack of spontaneity and the too frequent repetition of a few somewhat cheap devices the use of names for instance supposed to have lovely or terrible associations and the endlessly reiterated kissing we are asked to believe that the whole of the greatest house in the kingdom next only to the kings was murdered in one fell swoopsave for one little girl whom the marauder bore away on his saddlebow to his own fastness and that this proceeding was startling news to the country in general several years afterwards the little girl in question having undergone a sombre upbringing in her enemys castle runs away with a pagean incredible brute for her to have bestowed her love upon returning presently after the most woeful adventures to her own she is murdered failing her the inheritance falls to a girlcousin whose affections are won by an undistinguished but gifted and amiable minstrel for whose sake she renounces all her grandeur which yet again goes to a third girlcousin the three are surrounded as a matter of course by earls and princes bishops and chamberlains and waitingwomen who play their own games after the manner of such personages there is not a character among them that steps out of the tapestry into life though within their own borders they appear lively enough the dedication set us reflecting as to whether the whole story might not be intended as symbolicand we seem indeed able to make out here and there a something behind but if mr hewlett wrote in reality with any such intention he has hidden his meaning far too deep for an impatient age to take the trouble to discover it maintsonge is indeed the capital of jadis  the song of renny by maurice hewlerr macmillan  co 6s it has almost become impossible to criticise mr hewlett now one can only write about him you either like his style his rush and revel of words in which case a man likes him utterly or you are chilled and then one loses not a little of the beauty of prose poetry renny is but another example it is advertised as the revival of the forest lovers one of the most charming prose lyrics in our language and if we buy pills for our stomachs by advertisements why not buy books which after all are more digestible and innocuous it is not for us to quarrel with the advertisement yet things good things are not easily repeatable the words yes they are there with the old vitality and rapture what is missing is the lyric of tone inspiration  blow blow mr hewlett ah no we are not ungrateful as a matter of fact we do enjoy your spate even your tautology habit as it has become we do not quarrel with a waterfall because it makes so much foam there is joy in that foam and we like it if renny has not touched our heart it is because we rather incline in our mellow days to another school of fiction which deals more with the revelation of character than with its outward and sensuous presentation and just as one likes occasionally to enter a catholic church and feel the mediaeval spirit there so one plunges into a maurice hewlett for refreshment and recreation he gives us what incense gives to the old church renny is redolent with it we would always pay our obol for that we like a church too with plenty of gargoyles and that again mr hewlett provides with human things besides of love and of the passion of love as he might

B7384,['8725978'],  seonee  or camp life on the sat pura range a tale of indian adventure by lt a sterndale frgs sampson low fc co this narrative of indian life was written the author tells us mainly for the benefit of the younger followers of st hubert whether they be bound for india or not with the laudable intention of inculcating that love of nature which will open to them to many fresh sources of enjoyment and make the mere destroying of wild beasts a secondary object but he also hopes that some of the traits of animal character and notes on natural history scattered through his pages may recall pleasant memories of the past to many an old shikari the incidents related have all occurred either within his own experience or that of his friends but to escape the appearance of egotism and pedantry and to impart his information in a freer and more conversational manner the author avoids the first person altogether and introduces the reader to two imaginary personages whose daily life and adventures during several months residence in the central parts of india form the framework of the book the characters of these two fiiends are pleasantly drawn and well sustained and thus although subsidiary to the plan of the book command our interest both are sportsmen  the one a manly unaffected youngster has come out on a visit to the elder a military man but in charge of the district the latter is a somewhat ideal specimen of a classhappily never absolutely rare in india though producible by no known system of examination one who by studying in a sympathetic spirit ae feelings and traditions of the people acquires without blinding himself to their faults a hearty interest in them which is repaid by confidence and unlimited respect in such a district as that under review he has to hold the balance between the simple aboriginal nonaryan races the more astute hindu cultivators and the warlike pathans and others legacies of the moghul and of the mahrattarule and he succeeds by sheer force of character and by a combination of qualities not as yet equally prominent in the bengalgraduate whom the laputan element in our councils threatens to substitute for him  our hero is a bold rider fond of sport as a field for skill and endurance and for the acquisition of fresh knowledge for he is a keen naturalist and holds a study of the nature and character both of animals and plants to be an essential attribute of the true sportsman accordingly in these points he hardly yields to the hereditary skill and knowledge of the native shikari the character of more than one of these men the indispensable companions of the english sportsman on terms often necessarily more intimate than his other followers is drawn from the life many curious instancesare related of their skill knowledge and patience and of the courage they display the author very properly reminds us that  we talk much of our exploits with our doublebarrelled rifles and elephants but our deeds are often put to shame by the shikari with bis single arm and rusty matchlock it is singular that in some parts of india as for instance in sind the shikari belongs to  degraded caste the above sketch of major fordham whois the mentor of his younger friend and the chief speaker throughout the volume will indicate the tone in which our author deals not only with matters connected with sport and natural history but with the higher interests of angloindian life both its pleasures and its duties have a keen attraction for him although his story closes in the great mutiny he is entirely free from the pessimism so widely and only too naturally engendered by that catastrophe and which seems with many not only to have darkened their views of indian humanity but to have rendered unattractive even the fair face of nature herself the district of seonee is part of a great upland tract in the heart of the peninsular some 2000 feet above the sea having the nerbudda river on the north and the territory of nagpore on the south its climate is equable and excepting in the three autumn months tent life is pleasant throughout the year the landscape is varied  scenes of rich quiet beauty alternating with others of rugged grandeur  nothing can exceed the beauty of certain portions of the nerbudda river where it flows in long deep coollooking often winding reaches between high banks covered near the waters edge with short grass and crowned with magnificent old trees of all description which overhang the water under which sic you see herds of spotted deer and flocks of peafowl feeding of the greater fauna m the lordly bison haunts the bambooclad slopes of the satpura range and interferes not with his un wieldly neighbour and cousin the buffalo who keeps to his grassgrown plains the red deer herd in the fertile valleys watered by the halone and the bonjar the sambur and the axis the stately blue boll and the tiny toylike moose deer all have their haunts in the forests that are spread over the undulating plateaux there are the rocky ravines for the bears and the stony plains haunted by antelope and bustard the grim tiger roams over thousands of square miles and the stealthy panther scruples not to carry off his prey even from the heart of a station the mode of life the character of the country and of the sport in this favoured district are all pleasantly described page after page is filled not only with sporting stories of the ordinary type but with curious facts in natural history with quaint touches of native character in various classes of the people and with bits of tradition or legend brought out naturally in conversation during the different expeditions foremost among the objects of the chase is the tiger to whom as to the more wily and treacherous panther great numbers of human beings yearly fall victims one notorious maneater in the district was credited with some four hundred deaths thus the visit of a sportsman on these occasions is a real advantage though it may be feared that the destruction of crops by deer and other animals already great will increase as those checks on their numbers are removed the inhabitants of a village are often personally acquainted with the tigers of their neighbourhood each of whom has its idiosyncrasies they will tell you that such a one is daring and rash that one is savage and morose another is mild and harmless brave as the native shikari is he is not proof against superstition  in one district the whole population was prostrated with fear of a panther who was said to be something more tlnn he seemed being in reality as the story went on chinta a fellow of bad character and who had the power of turning himself into a wild beast on one occasion being hungry he told his wife who had hitherto doubted bis powers that he was going to turn into a panther and kill venison and he gave her a root which when he returned in panther form she was to give to him that he might regain his human shape he accordingly retired into a jungle whence she saw a panther issue and kill a deer but on his returning toward her all blood  stained she threw down the root in terror and fled her husband in despair after failing to find the root tore her in pieces and became a maneater however having baffled all the shikaris english and native he was at last killed by a starving gond who had tempted fate in hope of earning the government reward we have not space even to allude to the many varieties of shooting which may be enjoyed in seonee there is fishing to be had also but the great mahseerthe  indian salmon socalled though he is one of the cyprinidse barbus tordoes not show sport in proportion to his size we have been seriously informed that he rises at the swallows as they skim the surface and may be taken by a hook baited with one but we do not endorse the statement among the characters to whom we are introduced is an old fakir the descendant of taj khan a former pathan ruler of the district whose story is well and touchingly told another story the  legend of the rajah chand sa and of the hundred headless horsemen is a good specimen of the still flourishing art of storytelling we have now probably said enough to show that there is much in this volume which will commend it to a wider circle of readers than that for which it was primarily

him that if he will attempt to force three volumes on the public every year that he will soon be without readers except such as contract with a circulating library and make a point of gulping every thing published under the name of a novel or a romance it is now some fifteen months since mr boggy published his  three perils of man a work with which we were at some pains to make our readers acquainted we did justice to the interest of the narrative and to the vigrour of some of the descriptions while at the same time we pointed out some glaring absurdities and expressed our regret at

modesty and good breeding w1 e confess we have read the three perils of woman and indeed mr hogfgs former romance to some disadvantage on account of our imperfect knowledge of the barbarous jarcron he so copiously introduces in the novel before us he has puzzled us sadly and never was our jamieson so thumbed or our glossaries so frequently consulted to enable us to translate the  three perils of woman for our own right understanding and gratification and not for that of our family to whom we soon found we must make it a sealed book we have heard it remarked that our english readers affect to admire the wxaverly novels in proportion as they do not understand them  should this be the case with m1r hloggs romance his  three perils will be the most popular work on this side of the tweed that

interlard their fictions with appeals to the deity and the services of the church mr flioog thought he must be in fashion and how he has succeeded we shall show presently we recollect reading in some

those lie who would do good to themselves or to society of first finding their true path and of then woiking vigorously forward on it without looking to the right hand or the left the high reputation obtained by the former novels of mr savage will cause the public to sit down with much expectation of a feast before the present volumes every one will know his host and be justified in expecting choice food and good cookery that the food is of the wholesomest we have already shown and that it is well presented we are quite able to testify in the first place however it must be understood tbt reuben medlicolt does not present the usual characteristics of a novel in respect of intricacy of plot breathlessness of interest narrowingness of tyrants and devotedness of brets mr savage divides his work into nine books prefaces each with an argument after the manner of fielding and has indeed constructed his narrative very much more after the humour of fielding who raised novelwriting to the dignity of epic poetry than in accordance with the custom of these later times fielding however never directed all the forces of a work to any one didactic purpose and in that respect mr savage has followed the humour of our modern school that good for everything means good for nothing is the moral chosen by the author of this book and his great care throughout is to enforce it thoroughly by all the resources of his humour wit and knowledge while he is carrying the reader through a series of scenes and working out a group of wellcontrasted characters among the characters of the book dean

so troublesome a guest that the canon was generally aa veil pleased when he left his house as when he came to it the dean turned every house he entered topsy turvy but he provoked oldport roost by his unceremonious way of tumbling about his books which kept the canon in a continual fret particularly as the dean never restored a volume to its place so that his friend was continually hobbling after him to keep his library in order one evening while toe dean continued oldport a guest it suddenly occurred to him to pay the medlicotts a visit and accordingly leaving the canon to drink his wine alone the thing of all others least agreeable to him dr wyndham took up his huge goldheaded cane tod strode across the fields to the vicarage he was a man of huge frame and gladiatorial muscle nature seemed to have designed him fer physical as well as polemical conflicts he valued himself indeed on his personal strength as much as upon his prowess in controversy and was particularly proud of his

his distinguished relative and visitor he ventured to observe goodhumouredly that he did presume to know something of a garden though he waa an humble vicar and had all his life been ready to receive instruction from any one who was so competent to afford it on moat subject aa the dean aa be spoke he hastened to open a small wicketdoor in the hedge to admit the dignitary who instantly thrust himself in stooping more than waa necessary and observing that it would not have coat five shillings more to have made the door a couple of inchea higher the vicar again meekly smiled and excused the

peculiar to boyhood and youth  at least so far as it concerns the depiction of a boy of cleverness and sensibility the sketch of reuben and of one or two of his schoolfellows up to the age of sixteen or seventeen is elaborate and masterly here are some pictures of reuben at a showy ball given by the barsacs who take care to patronise a select number of mr borough a boys the longexpected evening came at last and reuben found himself transported into the midst of a tumultuous assembly of welldressed people in the gay house of which he had so long desired to penetrate the interior except his schoolfellows he was acquainted with nobody there was nobody to tell him the name of any one which of the company were the barsacs or whether they were present or not he was in their bouse for an hour without knowing more than the man in the moon as the raying is he knew the ball had commenced by hearing the music feeling the floors vibrate and finding himself swayed to and fro occasionally by the movements of the dancers though he could scarcely see them he wondered what had become of winning and paid close attention to the ladies in white dresses among whom alone be expected to find miss

replied winning little guessing reubens interest in the answer pale sherry was pale  but at the same time very pretty she was what people commonly called an interesting girl she had soft grey eyes which had a particularly earnest and devoted expression in them when she was talking to you which was very flattering and very fascinating besides she had a nice figure and a demure and composed manner which corresponded admirably with her pale complexion and soft eyes none of the barsac girls were mere girls the eldest was probably twentyseven and there was net more than three er four years difference in standing between the eldest and the youngest jf course it was condescending ef the angelic blanche to dance with a boy of thirteen but he was tall for his age aad she acted her part with perfect goodhumour and goodnature keeping him right in the figure as far as she could and trying te put kan as much at his ease aa possible both were dificult things to do t not onlj was reubens

previous works of the same writer have already taken a most honourable place  reuben medlicott or the coming mau by  m w savage 3 vols chapman  hall we are bound to state that mr savage does not improve as a novelist  my uncle the curate as the athentpum said on the occasion of its appearance ath no 1115 was a dull bookbut this is a duller onenot solely because of its subject but in part from the manner in which that subject is wrought out a narrative of foibles bearing bitter apples for fruitof hopes disappointed and promises unfulfilledcan rarely be very inspiriting yet miss edgeworth in her stories of vivian the persuadable man and of basil lowe the procrastinator knew how to administer such relief and contrast that we could read those admirably executed tales without our hopes in humanity being chilled and without our views of life becoming pinched and dwarfed by reason of the low and waste monotony of the prospect within which they were confined it may be recollected that we object to mr thackeray as to a novelist who deals too grudgingly with all that is amiable and elevated  but even into his most discouraging scenessuch for instance as the surprise of becky over her petit soaper with lord steynehe will every now and then throw a touch of strong feeling and human interest now we have met with few writers who scatter their amenities so sparingly as mr savage without commanding de balzacs force or minuteness he has all de balzacs dreariness his story contains a character and exhibits a complete picturebut the person selected is singularly unpleasingand the fulllength gallery picture has not an inch of blue sky or an episode of flowervase in the background by way of relief failure at schoolfailure at collegefailure in parliamentfailure at the barfailure in platform oratoryfailure even in the quaker asceticism through which the coming man passes as one phase of his many changes such are the incidents of mr selvages book reuben medlicott has many showy qualities and gracious gifts but he is as unstable as water and as vain as a foolish french beauty of the ancien regime such a hero mr savage may rest assured would never have married the daughter of the quaint old dissenting dame from whom he had his schooling nor is there any one character in the book which may serve as a foil to the hero in right of extraordinary gifts or virtues his mother is foolish his father is a nonentityhis aunt is weak the idol of his schoolboy days marries his grandfatherhis favourite associates a french shoemaker and a sister are not much better than they should be the descriptions are more smart than strongmore diffuse than impressive we select one of the best and most manageable scenes a protestant meeting at chichester all tremendous demonstrations resemble one another very closely an excited knot of noblemen and gentlemen on a platform a tumultuous sea of heads on the floor an agitated bevvy of mothers aunts and sisters in a gallery a little table for reporters a peer in the chair if a peer can be found to fill it but never anything beneath the baronetage on the present occasion the platform was thronged with parsons and squires until it overflowed and every now and then a vicar or a pair of topboots came tumbling down among the smockfrocks who united their shoulders to heave him up again when this disaster befell a man of ordinary dimensions he was reinstated on the platform with no great difficulty  but when it happened to public characters of more than average weight the attempt to replace them sometimes proved as ineffectual as in the case of the celebrated humpty dumpty in the nursery rhyme it was unquestionably a  tremendous demonstration of the lungs of the men of sussex john bull bellowed like a herd of his fourfooted namesakes and the protestant lion roared his best without the slightest respect to the nerves of though ladies bottom would have been greatly scandalised awful resolutions were proposed by peers and seconded by commoners but as to the eloquence it was uniformly stifled by its own applause and perished for ever in the premature raptures of the audience it was proved however beyond a doubt that there were two curtii present ready to jump into any chasm which the british soil might please to open beneath their feet a brutus in buckskin was equally prepared to sacrifice all the private affections to the public welfare  as to sydneys hampdens and russells they appeared that day in a force that reflected undying honour upon the patriotism of englishmen how often popery was flatly negatived with the energy of cromwell himself is not to be told in figures but three orators at least pledged their lives and fortunes to defend the throne and the altar the same number of prophetic voices foretold the sunset of british liberty and thrice three times was it powerfully urged upon thc vast assembly to unite heart and hand in a  strong pull a long pull and a pull altogether in the front of the gallery assigned to the ladies who came to brave the roaring of the lion aforesaid sat mrs medlicott and hannah and mary hopkins their eyes were riveted on the platform but it was not on the chairman they gazed although he was the earl of stromness nor on the vicar for he was lost in the crowd nor on mr pigwidgeon ludicrous figure as he cut for there was no novelty in that you had only to watch the point where the three lines of female vision united to convince yourself that they sought nothing saw nothing thought of nothing during that great day and demonstration but the youngest of thc patriot band he who came to dedicate the firstfruits of his talents and his fame to the service of his creed and his country probably few of the ladies present had been unobservant of reuben from un early period of the day for he was conspicuous not only by his heindsome person but by his dress which could scarcely have been gayer or more elaborate had he been going to be married instead of only going to make a speech his hair artfully divided thone like apollos and flowed on his shoulders almost as wantonly as in his boyhood a bouquet nearly as large as barsacs bloomed in his buttonhole and the virgin whiteness of his gloves typified the maiden eloquence with which ho was about to enchant the world the foppery was not entirely his own  the gloves were due to his mother the flowers had bein insisted on and even arranged on his breast by the young quakeress nor was it amiss that so much care had been bestowed on his toilette for had he been confounded with the parsons nnd the squires his rising would not have commanded the attention that it did and his oratory would probably have been lost like that of the rest in the incessant uproar of the meeting everything however was propitious but perhaps most of all the emphatic and gracious manner in which the earl of stromness a man of the highest courtesy introduced him to the audience as  the son of his respected friend the rev thomas medlicott instantly the chawbacons hundreds of whom were the earls tenants raised a shout that well nigh brought down the roof of the courthouse the 4m was little in unison with the modesty and gentleness with which the palpitating reuben took his place in the front of the platform his rising was soft as the south wind  and you might have marked its effects in the female gallery how the breeze fluttered the bonnets rustled among thc ribbons and especially how it made the maternal stomacher risc and fall like a sail when the wind is irresolute he rose he spoke he triumphed his was the only speech that was not only delivered but of which a considcmble portion was heard a most excellent speech it was of the school of oratory it belonged to though there were principles of eloquence by which it would have been cruel to have tried it if however it had the defects of youth it had its merits also it was fresh it was fury it was animated and courageous there was not a quintilian in the meeting to find fault with it tried by the test of success not demosthenes himself could have gained a completer victory up hew a cloud of hats before the exordium was over the orator was actually invisible for a second though same demonstration was repeated a score of times upon one occasion mr pigwidgeon who was striking another stroke for a dinner must throw up his beaver among the rest and he never recovered it for it fell among the mob and was trampled to pieces in an instant the hat was not worth sixpence but he vowed it was a new onea thing he had never been known to possess in his life what signified lr pigwidgeona hat or mr pigwidgeon himself even protestantism was forgotten in the excitement and enthusiasm occasioned by the bowers of reubens rhetoric not unaided by the flowers in his coat if one passage outshone another where all was splendour it was the dangerous topic of apostacythe graphic picture of a renegade divine which reached its climax when the orator described the vain endeavours of such a sillen character to regain his lost position and imagined thc reception he would assuredly meet with from every honest man here he turned to good account the lines in milton  thinkst thou revolted spirit thy shape thu same or undiniinishd glory as when once thou stoodat erect in henvn erect and pure the air was darkened with waving hats again thc enthusiasm mounted to though galleries the women waved their handkerchiefs wildly and mrs medlicott and the quakeresses who had taken ort their bonnets in consequence of the heat tossed them about fanatically and almost forgot their sex in the violence of their transports in short it was a relief to everybody when though last bolt was launched and the last longprotracted peal of applause greeted the solemn and highwrought peroration the above passage we think will be found to illustrate within itself at once mr savages strength and his want of strength in fact this second disappointment convinces us that the threevolume novel is not our authors forte the sharp clever sketch  the short philosophical tale in which want of incident is forgiven for the sake of pithy apothegms or logical sequencesthe satire that keeps on the levels in place of soaring high or sinking deepare all at his command it is fatal to a mans individuality to fancy that there is but one form

B1046,['8592004'],  the lovels of arden the locels of arden by the author of  lady audleys secret c c c in three volumes john maxwell aud co if there were anything more than the stringing together of unnatural and inartistic plots and the heaping of coarse drapery upon a number of stagepuppets in miss braddons novels it might be expected that in the twenty or more that she has written her literary resources would be somewhat exhausted as it is she is as fresh as ever the same puppets can be used over and over again with quite as much reason as on the first occasion and with their frequent use and constant exercise in their rearrangement comes a certain skill that makes the novels run more easily to the sort of readers who alone can take pleasure in such works as hers in many ways indeed she improves as she goes on in this latest of her productions the difficulties of english grammar are mastered the spelling of the trite french extracts is correct and the vulgarities of thought are somewhat smoothed over the ordinary materials of the sensational school too are here used very sparingly there is not so much as the mention of poisoning in the book there is not even any actual adultery in the first volume it is true miss braddons admirers will be cheered by the hope that not only will the seventh commandment be broken but that there will be incest as well but they will be disappointed at last if there is any disappointment after enjoying long chapters full of the outpourings of a mans lawless passion and the excitement of a married womans dalliance with him as far as eye and ear and mouth are concerned in finding that no actual sin has been committed and that virtue triumphs in the end miss braddons chief skill has always been shown in her mode of tickling without surfeiting the appetites of her readers and she excels in  the lovels of arden clarissa lovel the heroine is first introduced to us as a young lady of exquisite refinement and beauty just come from school who flirts with george fairfax a gentleman equally refined and beautiful during a night journey from london to yorkshire which they make in a firstclass railway carriage that has no other occupants miss lovels father of course descended from one of the oldest families in england has been brought down in the world by the extravagances of his wife who had spent his money in fascinating mr fairfaxs father and for some time we are allowed to suppose that the lovers of the second generation may be brother and sister but the errant mother and father have sinned only in thought and the errant daughter and son are to do no more their first meeting is soon followed by a long intimacy consequent on their being visitors at the same country house where also is staying lady geraldine

tells her that he likes her better than his betrothed and means to marry her lam not one of those saints he says in the hoarse hard voice  that is essential to such a declaration  who think of everybodys happiness before their own clarissa i am very human with all humanitys selfishness i want to be happy i want a wife for whom i can feel something more than a cold wellbred liking i did not think that it wa3 in me to feel more than that i thought i had outlived my capacity for loving wasted the strength of my hearts youth on worthless fancies spent all my patrimony of affection  but the light shines on me again and i thank my god that it is so yes clarissa come what may i thank my god that i am not so old a man in heart and feeling as i thought myself of course clarissa tries  to stem the current of his talk with her heart beating stormily but with semblance of exceeding calmness  but of course she reciprocates his passion though she seems to be in a vague way conscious that it would have been more decent for him to be formally off with the old love before he is on with the new she behaves as well as could be expected of her she refuses him  and refuses him again when the intended wedding is put off in consequence of the providential death of lady geraldines father he is mightily insulted and goes away in high dudgeon first unfolding to her his plans with an honesty

to say that he is a millionaire he is also a widower with a daughter older than miss lovel miss lovel loathes him but she marries him because he and her father wish it in due time  god gives her a son she tries to be a good wife and after a little mild flirtation with mr fairfax she prays that she may not meet him again  her prayers were not grantedperhaps they did not come so entirely from the heart as prayers should that would fain bring a blessing she meets him often and he is most seductive when he appears before her in evening dress which has a sensuous meaning to miss braddon which we believe no other novelist has detected  the broad expanse of shirt front she exclaims in a sentence sufficiently eloquent though a verb is missing  with its delicate embroidery not obtrusively splendid but minutely elaborate rather involving the largest expenditure of needlework to produce the smallest and vaguest effect a suspicion of richness as it were nothing more the expanse of linen proclaims the breadth of chest and gives a factitious slimness to the waist mr fairfaxs factitious slimness overcomes mrs granger 8he confesses her love for him but refuses to run away ith him lest her son should  blush for his mother byandby  i have never found that sons have a faculty of blushing on account of that kind of thing mr fairfax answers and adds in a stage whisper  egad thered be a great deal of blushing going on at the crack clubs if they had   though mrs granger refuses to run away she does not mind talking and thinking adultery during a volumefull of clandestine interviews at last her lover by a very mean trick puts her in such a suspicious situation that her husband finding her in it insists on a separation she runs away with her baby but not with mr fairfax her baby nearly dies and her husband telegraphed for comes to help her to nurse him then she falls ill and her husband nurses her too the end of it is that mr granger says  my darling we will begin the world

to their interesting catalogue than is this volume miss mitford5 stories deserve to be widely known among the people her homely pictures of human character and her charitable mode of treating the errors of human kind are calculated to inspire a love of that valuable element in all religionstoleration miss mitford aims at leading mens thoughts from the busy haunts of trade and selfishness to something purer and more elevating she teaches that there is much in nature to be enjoyed which the citizen should seekmuch grandeur to be seen where dogmatism cannot intrude and many beautiful thoughts and holy aspirations to be drawn whither exclusiveness is not found her little tales always impress us with a feeling that mankind is really more innocent than we have been taught to believe country stories are an average specimen of miss mitfords powers as a writer and we rejoice that a knowledge of her works is to be extended by the medium of the parlour library  country stories literature notices of new av o ii k s by mary russel mitford authoress of  our village  belford regis  iticnzi c miss mitfords delightful style and the native and most truly english nature of the subjects she treats of in her prose poems are so universally known as scarcely to demand from us either description or commendation we knoxv no one writer either among the living or the dead that has done such ample justice to the domestic rural life of old kngland or whom it is more reviving to take up for an hour or txvo when the dust of this workaday world has accumulated thick upon uswhen our ears and all our other senses are dinned and dulled by the loud uproar of a city life and when the heart itself is sterilised and stupified by this  getting and spending which thc greatest of living poetsa mind kindred to her ownhas declared to be a xvaste of hours when pursued too far and to the exclusion of the study and observance of nature mt miss mitford whose whole life has been spent in a holy worship of nature is sure to lead us to some sweet and tranquillizing scene peopled xvith beings of gentle domestic virtues like her own who harmonise with the landscape just as the figures do in the best pictures of gainsborough and calcott the village green the churchyard the lonely lanes closed in with scented hedgeroxvs the meadows by the riverside the walk round the grey ruins of the old abbey are things that never tyre in her company to us the reading of her books has precisely the effect of a perambulation in thc real scenes xvith a dear friend discoursing by our side and telling us pleasant stories connected with the beautiful spots and we never lay down one of her volumes without feeling in a better humour with ourselves and thc whole world the effect is calm and soothing rather than exhilarating or exciting in any xvay  and by the time our young readers shall have attained our tried age they will find this feeling far more acceptable than the excitement they may now delight in we believe crabbes exquisite description of poor  ruth  in her cottage in her happiest days has been applied to miss mitford before  but it is so thoroughly applicable to her personal character as well as to her books for never did writing so truly reflect the real character and habits of the author that xve will use it again even at the hazard of misquoting as xve cannot at the moment lay our hand on thc matchless poem  sh is not merrv but she gives our hearth a sober cheerfulness thats moro than mirth to every person capable of seeing and feeling this delicate but most absolute distinction the present volume will be welcomethrice welcome we last month gave one of the  country stories the volume contains eleven others written with eepial grace anel delicacy they are all interesting but for the sake of certain local associations which many will share with us we love the simple story of  the lost dahlia better perhaps than any of the rest the dear old abbey of reading which we never can look at or think of without being flooded with recollections of past times deserved this tender reverential tribute and we thank thee mary mitford from our heart of hearts for bestowing it with so bounteous a hand  the eye of many a one now in the distant corners of the earth but whose happy boyhood was passed in the shade of those mouldering timehonoured walls will not be a stranger to a tear in reading the  lost dahlia miss mitfords sketches of character in humble or rustie life have much of the truth without the gloom of that great mastercrabbe with her it is all nature but not  nature pictured too severely true she avoids the subjects which too much harrow up the mind and her gentle satire anel in a way she is a satirist of a high order is always softeneel and sweetened by her ineffable goodnature she never has the heart to dismiss the very worst of her personages without giving them some redeeming virtues this perhaps is being more true to nature than the conti arv course which is more commonly adopteel by writers of fictionor at all events it is consoling to believe that it is so,social_contra

fruitful though for anything that i could ever learn fallacious entitlement this village with a name that waters on ones tongue though it keeps not the word of promise to ones palatem pilgrimages i say thither were of good account to me through another mere accident one day on my retn i was driven to take shelter from a rainstorm in a little hovel by the roadsidea sort of cobblers stall the tenant and his son were upon their work and after the customary use of greetings i entered familiarly into talk with them as indeed i always do seeing that your cobbler is often a man of con templative facultythat there is really something of mystery in his craft before i had been with them long the ola maii found that there lacked something for his work and in order to provide it he sent his son out on ajob of some five minutes the interval was a short one but it was too long for his active impatience he became uneasy shuffled about the room and at last took up a scrap or two of leather and fell to work upon them  for said he  it will never do vou know sir to be idlenot at any ratei should faint away i happened just then to be in an impressible mood without occupation myself and weighed somewhat down by the want of it accordingly the phrase the oddness of it in the first place and still more the sense made a deep and lasting impression upon me as soon as the rain had spent itself i went my way homeward ruminating and revolving what i had heard like a curious man over a riddle i could not have bestowed my thoughts better the subject concerned me nearly it went to the very heart of my happiness some people are perpetual martyrs to idleness others have only their turns and returnsof it i was of the latter clauss reluctant impatient idler nevertheless i was so much within the mischief as to feel that the words came home to me they stung my conscience severely they were gall and wormword for me nevertheless i dwelled so long albit perhaps unwillingly upon the expression that i became it were privy to it i was in a condition to feel and revere its efficacy i determined to make much of it to realise it inuse to act it out i had heard and read repeatedly that idleness is a very great evil but the censure did not appear to me to ome up to the real truth i began to think that it was not only a very great evil but the greatest eviland not only the greatest evil but in fact the only onethe only mental one i meaon for of course  to morality a man may be very active and very viciously active too but the one great sensible and conceivable evil is

B1924,['6786994'],  the little regiment and other episodes of the american civil war tttll  by stephen crane william heinemann mr crane has attempted the bold and dangerous task of writing two books on exactly the same subject from exactly the same standpoint and making use of exactly the same background this has proved a stumblingblock to many more experienced authors and it is high praise to say that the little regiment in every way a companion volume to the red badge of courage is not one whit behind it in power or picturesqueness it is true that war is a farreaching inexhaustible subject but mr crane does not content himself with birdseye views of the battlefield he takes his stand with the rank and file of the army with the men who fight wherever their feet are planted until more orders come knowing absolutely nothing of the general significance of their actions the awful monotony of his pictures is almost depressing  there is no room for variety of any kind the present volume is made up of six episodes the story entitled the little regiment stands out from the others as the most finished the most complete piece of work mr crane has given us it is a short sketch but brimful of the grim reality of war although individuals seem almost insignificant in such a picture each man is perfectly realised dan and billie live before our eyes and we feel sure we should recognise  the man who sat on the horsehair trunk  among a thousand as a word painting the little regiment is truly wonderful in every sentence we can hear even more clearly than in the red badge of courage the pantherlike screaming the witches crooning of the shells the cracking of the skirmishers the spattering and zipping of the bullets while through all these pulsates the fierce elation of the men amid the horrors great dashes of crimson and blobs of blue break occasionally through the dim and mystic clouds of grey mist and the whole demoniacal howling of the battle quivers in our brain for hours mr crane relies for his effects on daring and original colour similes he is a word artist of infinite resource and for everything he invents a special hue the sense of smell which plays such a prominent part in zolas debdcle is conspicuous by its absence we certainly miss the odeur de la guerre mr cranes peculiar genius is admirably adapted to the exigencies of the short story he writes at such fever heat and puts so much of the rush and turmoil of battle into his short quivering sentences that a longcontinued story like the red badge of courage comes as a strain to the mind of the average reader who closes the book with a genuine sigh of relief in these episodes the pace is faster the intensity more striking than ever  but the pauses between the stories give time for breathing compared with the little regiment the other episodes are more sketchy and less compact an indiana campaign is a pleasant piece of comedy which comes as a relief amid the allpervading gloom but mr crane lacks the necessary lightness of touch the veteran the story of an old man who meets his death in the flames while trying to rescue some colts is a trifle theatrical and commonplace a woman figures in three miraculous soldiers and a grey sleeve but she seems out of her element and only half realised a mystery of heroism a new version of an episode in the cave of adullam and a splendid psychological revelation of the feelings of a desperado is in itsway as perfect a piece of work as the little regiment though the tone is quieter and more subdued,social_contra

B7137,"['8766574', '8507622']",  noblesse oblige novels and novelettes by sarah tytler 3 vols hurst  blackett vestinays martyrdom a story of the catacombs by emma raymond pitman hodder  stoughton the spanish barber by the author of mary powell nisbet  co perhaps the latest production of miss tytler an author not without experience might have been fraught with more interest to the general reader if the necessities of custom had not required that the matter of half a volume should be spread out into three taking the most favourable view of noblesse oblige the best friends of its author could scarcely venture to say that it offers anything of engrossing interest either in the characters or in the story yet there are glimpses here and there of humour and intention especially where the author does not attempt too high a flight in the social scale which might have formed as it were the cadre of a good story before the sevenfold process of dilution was applied small countrytown scenes and society might have afforded a good deal of amusement at least we should imagine so from the description of the misses medlar the twicefour blooming daughters of the  first attorney in wellfield  the low and vulgar wellfield wags we are told multiplied the number of the miss medlars to forty the forty miss medlars j then by a natural and wicked association they had changed the miss medlars into thieves the forty thieves innocent though they were of stealing mens hearts they were tall stout passably goodlooking girls their bane was plethora in constitution as well as number few men could serenely contemplate a wife of eleven stone weight any more than thirtynine sistersinlaw happy had it been if miss tytler had traced out the lives of these smalltown beauties instead of giving way to that alluring form of ambition which forces a certain class of novelists in spite of nature and in defiance of art to draw highlife groups for which assuredly they have never had any proper models what can we expect when we find colloquial phrases not used in the upper classes or in any educated class cropping up to the surface continually in certain parts of the book lord wriothesleys illness had seemed nothing out of the common she seems to be learning to live without rest or refreshment of any kind for as small and frail as she is  once they had arrived and got a cup of tea she would be able to chat with phoebe  she felt a vast deal better already and able for any amount of gossip i am glad i have got anything i wanted and am the better of we take these singular specimens of english as we find them here and there and we have only to observe that they are not placed in the mouths of persons supposed to be uneducated or even of the misses medlar but that they proceed either directly from the author or from the more refined personages of the story including the countess of exmoor and her daughter the lady dorothea latimer it is wonderful how the author identifies herself with the great latimers and how she despises the small latimers otherwise  the essex latimers who will succeed to the title in consequence of the death of lady dorotheas brother lord wriothesley yet these despised latimers are kind enough to give a home to lady dorothea who conde scends while utterly despising them and calling them commonplace goodish sort of people to avail herself of the accommodation of their house for the purposes of her wedding the difference between the present earls family and the relatives who are to succeed him and who are of course of the same aristocratic stock is surely a difference twixt tweedledum and tweedledee but the author revels in such a difference and so far from exhibiting it as a personal prejudice in the mouth of one of her characters makes herself a party to it in the most uncompromising and glaring manner in short miss tytler is an oligarch to the backbone except in one particular point and there nature creeps out the two heroines of the story lady dorothea and miss phoebe pas ton are both wooed by men of rank yet they both condescend to marry men of far inferior positions thus the independence of the sex is vindicated and the authors female conscience is saved it will be better for her readers and herself if in future works she makes her matter in some degree commensurate with her space and abstains from the attempt to describe phases of society with which her acquaintance is evidently imperfect passing to the second work on the above list we come to a tale of other times but one which is also of serious earnest quality as almost all visitors to rome have joined a party to see the catacombs and have made their way through the narrow passages lined with the empty restingplaces of early christians pausing now to observe a phial of blood now some ancient device on the wall it is likely that the present story will revive many interesting associations miss pitman promises to introduce us to the life of that roman community which was addressed in an epistle and was visited by st paul and which dragged out a troubled and anxious existence under the shadow of the emperor nero vestina who gives her name to the story is a noble roman maiden aud a convert to christianity at first she keeps her religious change a secret but after a time her mother and her brother follow her example and they are martyred before her but there are other and much more important characters in the story miss pitman tells us at the end that many of the incidents here recorded are historical facts and could have been presented in a series of historical chapters but to many minds the thin disguise of fiction is more attractive and to many more the dry historical account seems repulsive while they will welcome the same information in this form it is for this reason no doubt that st paul himself is brought on the stage and that we are shown the apostle during his first visit to rome arguing with the jews and preaching to christians in the hired house where he was suffered to dwell with the soldier who had charge of him several names mentioned in st pauls epistles occur also in the story onesimus demas alexander the coppersmith take a prominent part on the whole miss pitmans work is a fair sample of the religious historical story there is a certain superficial verisimilitude in the use made of the smallest biblical hints and in the working out of characters whose names and leading peculiarities alone are mentioned by the apostle miss pitman enters sometimes into the spirit of her story and the description of  vestinas martyrdom or rather of her timely release from martyrdom is simple and touching when we are told however that the facts presented to us might have occupied a series of historical chapters we feel bound to point out the abundance of grave errors in the historical parts of the story miss pitman has apparently taken her dates from the margin of her bible and seeing there that st paul arrived in rome ad 63 and that the epistle to philemon was written a year later she has not scrupled to bring in the story of onesimus the slave and to describe his being sent back to his master even with these materials before her she has made a mistake for in this epistle st paul speaks of demas as his fellowlabourer while according to miss pitman demas had already forsaken the apostle but the other facts which have to tally with these dates are still more unfortunately chosen we read that in ad 63 vespasian had defeated the jews vespasian was not sent against them till the year 66 nero is represented in the same year as accompanied by his young wife octavia he had put her away the year before and had married poppaja a few days afterwards the late attempt to rehabilitate nero seems to have led miss pitman to state that he set the city on fire to satisfy a brutal jest  as is now universally believed from corroborative testimony the peculiar felicity of the word  now  appears most strongly when we remember that modern criticism has shaken what ancient historians believed but if in this case ancient opinions are attributed to the moderns modern words are in return ascribed to the ancients miss pitman talks incomprehensibly of the  bagnio or public way to what language does she think that word belongs  yet even this is outdone by the statement that the part of rome lying beyond the tiber was called in ad 63 the trastevere what possible sense that name could have till the river itself had become the italian tevere instead of the latin tiber or tiberinus we must leave to miss pitman to discover when she says too that  to dwell in the trastevere was to be accounted among the scum and offscouring of the inhabitants we cannot but feel for the good name of that friend of horaces who lived far across tiber near caesars gardens after these specimens of miss pitmans mistakes we need hardly add that the laliclavu8 or broad stripe was not worn on the toga or upper garment but on the tunica or under garment that pan was a greek deity and not  the god of the country among the romans and that the lupercalia were not festivities in his honour but were offered to the god of fertility accuracy on these points is a minor consideration though it was hardly necessary for miss pitman to enter into details which she could not verify her other blunders are much more serious and affect the value of her book we abandon neither serious purpose nor grave mistakes when we come to the third of the above works in punch for the year 1844 will be found one of those humorous paragraphs illustrated with quaint woodcuts by thackeray and called forth by a statement in the times of the day to the effect that some british society had hit upon a novel plan of introducing tracts into spain viz by bottling them securely corked these same bottles were cast adrift at the entrance of the bay of cadiz and being washed on shore by the tide found their way landwards through the medium of the sailors  so no doubt  reported the agents of the parent society thackerays humorous paper is in the form of a remonstrance addressed to espartero then an exile in england there are three illustrations no 1 depicts a sailor waistdeep in the sea clutching a bottle floating towards him on the crest of a wave  rum praps exclaims the excited salt no 2 the same sailor on shore a fellow salt and a boy personating audience he is in the act of inserting the screw into the cork and exclaims  sherry i hope no 3 in withdrawing the cork he finds some paper adhering and with disappointment dismay and contempt depicted on his countenance exclaims  tracts by jingo the title of this book the spanish barber by the author of  mary powell suggested  rum praps and a perusal of the table of contents and the first chapter led to sherry i hope this chapter has much of the power of this quaint and original writer but a further perusal induced disappointment and the exclamation of tracts by jingo involuntarily escaped our lips miss mannings story is evidently written for the purpose of what is termed in the exeter hall vernacular  doing the good work a certain lay figure is set for the converted sinner who goes on converting other sinners in a style of simple addition quite delightful to contemplate given a spanish barber locality gibraltar who shaves a lay figure named caravantes probably so called because the barber quotes cervantes and boasts that he knows the adventures of the knight of la mancha by heart proverbs and all the shavee converts the shaver at once the shaver his wife they quote texts and the shaver decides to close his shop on sunday this naturally curtails his trade but he pursues the  good work leaving his wife in the charge of and to be maintained by her parents he crosses to oran as a colporteur laden with a sack of tracts he lends a shivering jew his cloak who returns it by the hands of his son a delicate youth consumptive of course this young jew is converted his father smothers himself with dust curses the barber and dies a  contrabandist is introduced who uses very coarse language and cuts the throats of his fellow creatures without the slightest compunction he repents conveniently and ever after trades honestly paying all importduties in a very  goodygoody manner indeed no englishman worthy the name he bears will speak slightingly or contemptuously of true religion nor of those who seek to carry the godly precept of loving ones neighbour as oneself into daily practice but goodygoody stories like the present serve no purpose worthy the name of purpose  and such a pen as that which traced mary powell should leave such  good work  to smallbeer chroniclers of the  moral

strong artistic effect  the latter alternative is the less humiliating of the twor but in place ol electing to sa by it we shall endeavour to present the teader with such characteristics of the boob as may enable him to judge whether miss tytleri char is pr or not proven the body of this book we maintain is in elf a charge against the english nation and if miss tyer were a red republican working under flse colours he could not have written anything more damaging to the principles and fielings which she a ntly advocates i noblesse oblige is lhe story of an earls son who falls in love with an artists daughter the brockootes family seem to have a notion that the leaders of englih politics must necessarily spring from the old tic families and young lord wriothesley is the coming hero he is to gain for the exmoors the glory of great reputation and his sister lady dorothea is to strengthen the family by a rich match lord wriothesley is rather infirm of purpose for instead of passing reform bills and organising emigration schemes he falls in love in a sort of helpless fashion with phoebe paston the artists daughter lady dorothea on the other hand knows her duty and performs it she is about to may a lord fairchester whom she does not particularly love then she gets to love him very much then it turns out that there is a mistake in the title atid then the young woman who is represented as a miracle of goodness aned kindness and honor turns him off  if lord fairchester is reduced to john blount she observes tranquilly to phxebe he will be no match for dorothea latimer owe exmoors have always sacrificed our private feelings and had not to do with mwial1iianvx when she parts with her lover she informs him that their two souls are united for ever which means we presume that her delicate sense of honour will not prevent her marrying her body to somebody else meanwhile lord wriothesley dangles after the artists daughter much to the discomfort of her other lover an artist whose only comfort is that wriothesley is a good young man and means no harm he had no doubt thwt lard wriothesley was of such a set whitewashed and vituos os became a latimer but man enough to have his iudividual tastes although peer enough to hanker after forbidden fruit lord wriothesley could not have phoebe paston mny more than the prince of wales could have had her but he could admire her court her and dangle after her in a dilettante virtuous iatimer fasbion only robbing her of her virgin fancy her maiden meditations the first bloom of her heart phoebe is a curious young woman who has occasional fits of satllennew and frequent fits of loquacity strangely enough she has a horror of reviewers and rates them so sudly that in selfhumiliation we cannot forbear to quote her speeches it must be said however that phoebe has just been paid a visit by her cousin frank hall a reviewer and by a stranger and this is the fahion in which she receives and entertains her guests  but the

presume it is with a subtle sarcasm that she represents his preferring the wines at the gartick club to those of lord exmoor phoebes father is an artist of great reputation who looks upon himself as a sort of vassal or serf of the exmoor family the other characters are unhmportant now it would seem that the great occupation in life of these people is to talk of the differences of class indeed the word  class  crops up in these  pages until we get heartily sick of it two women almost strangers meet hurriedly in the street they have not seen each other for some time and the one asks the other how she likes the place phoebe replies that she has every reason to speak well of the people whereupon mrs edgecumbe immediately points out that such people are necessarily unknown to her  you see i have known my class these thousand years and the other is not at all in my way poor phoebe she is beset on all sides by  class  and it is an open question whether one ought to be more ashanied of the despicable titleworship on the part of her neighbours or more disgusted with the profound selfconsciousness of rank on the part of her grand friends lord exmoors family talk as if they had just acquired their patent of no bty and were overcome by the new sensation even the mild and characterless lord wriothesley when he visits phoebes father has to beg that there will be no fuss made about him and hopes that paston will not turn courtier but the oddest exhilbitions of this feeling occur in its reflex action upon the people around phoebe is writing to lady dorothea and she says is it not the boast of the ermoora that they have once and again at such seasons jeopardied lands and life for king and country  may not we follow at a distance and hazard in our turn our small private fortunes for the credit of our friends and our class is there no noblesse oblige in the middle rank and the mercantile world also p forgive me for likening myself to you lady dorothea but i wish you could see my uncle now he sets himself to breast the blast and begin life anew with my aunt standing by and fairly for etting that she used to take a great deal out of him and demand special consideration from him for being a wingfield of batty and wingfield a norman mercantile house in these parts lady dorothea now more eagerly deferential to him than i could have imagined a woman a little hard and exacting in her better days could under any circumstances become  a norman mercantile house  is excellent elsewhere phoebe remarks of her titled friends  they are great people and as such perfectly exceptional no more to be measured by small people in their actions and the consequences of their actions than kings are to be measured it was probably owing to her deference to this divine right of great people that phoebe although she loved barty wooler and was by him beloved invariably snubbed him in order to remain single and let lord wriothesley flirt with her indeed she looks forward to the certainty of his proposing to her and she allows her neighbours to talk of the match as settled without taking any particular thought as to what she must do should he be so indiscreet phoebe has a great liking for lord wriothesley but then she is of opinion that  love and love alone can cross securely the chasm between clas and class and so she allows matters to drift apparently hoping that lord wriothesley would marry her and yet not removing barty wooler too far out of reach finally lord wriothesley dies and then she falls back upon barty and marries him she admits that she might have married lord wriothesley  out of pure gratitude loyalty and reverence but that her heart was b alty s the time we hope barty liked the position dy dorotheas affairs end in a marriage also for she at

B704,['8847522'],  dariel a rjomtmce of surrey raw novels by r d blackmore blackwood  sons mb blackmobjc seems to have been so enamoured of the character of john rigg yeoman of the parish of gare that he cannot imagine a hero differing from the honest john even in the matter of style it is thus for instance that george cranleigh opens his narration of the present story 44 if any man came to me and said 4 you are going to tell your tale good sir without knowing how to handle it i should look at him at first with some surprise and anger at his interference yet in a very few minutes unless he wanted to argue about it probably he would have my confession and a prayer for his assistance for every one knows how to do a thing much better than the one who does it who would not suppose from such a beginning that this  romance of surrey  was an historical romance dating about the days of dutch william  not at all george cranleigh often called farmer jarge is a nineteenth century hero ruined at least his father sir harold cranleigh has been ruined by free trade mr blackmores special bogey against which even circassian surs are made to lift up their voice another point of resemblance between  dariel and mr blackmores most celebrated story is in the great length of both in the case of the firstmentioned the length is quite disproportionate either to the number of characters introduced or the complication of the history for though  dariel certainly does not lack the element of romance still less that of improbability for though first two hundred pages it jogs along in a very humdrum fashion and all the action there is is confined to four or five characters in the very opening chapter george riding home from market surprises a maiden of surpassing beauty upon her knees in a ruined chapel she proves to be dariel the daughter of sur imar a circassian prince who because a blood feud has arisen between him and his sister hasfor the sake of peace and lest she should be tempted to evil deeds with his daughter his fosterbrother stepan and a body of retainers come to england and settled peaceably in a deserted house in surrey it is difficult to feel stirred by a strong sense of romance at the thought of this prince of the tribe of the lesghians settled in surrey  perhaps because the situation lacks probability and certainly the romance is not supplied by the concurrent love of jackson stoneman the stockbroker for  our grace as the son of sir harold cranleigh of crogate hall perpetually calls his sister sir harold ruined as has been said has retired to a cottage on his estate they have now only one tenantfarmer left upon it and the hall is let to stoneman while george the second son turns himself into a farmer and grace into a dairymaid they enter so thoroughly into their parts that it can hardly be said that george ever talks like a gentleman and grace generally has the manners of a servant girl the scene of mr stonemans proposal and acceptance is a triumph of vulgarity grace never addresses her  admirer that is the name for him without bringing in his name  mr stoneman mr stoneman is it possible this is one of my brothers proceedings  tou have seen more of them than i have mr stoneman excuse me mr stoneman  take care mr stoneman and so forth while  mr stoneman himself is quite equal to the occasion this is how he introduces himself into the dairy while grace is weighing her butter  i wont say a word if i may come in o do let me come in and be calculated too if i may only sit upon a pan upside down or anyhow quite out of sight in the corner oh what a sweet place  i could live upon the smell of it but i wont even go near the lace edging of a pat however after though first two hundred pages have been passed we get to business and the story of sur imar with the events which follow upon it makes a much more exciting history the novel ought to have begun about this point for even then there are left 300 closely printed pages the plot without being very recondite or remarkably original is sufficiently complicated to be interesting and perhaps it would be scarcely fair to the author to explain it fully it turns as has been said on a blood feud prince rakhan of the osset tribe had secretly murdered the father of imar though imar was told by schamyl the historic champion of the caucasus that the older man had been killed by the russians rakhan had acted from revenge because the prince of the lesghians had refused him his daughter marva but marva escaped from her convent at tiflis and married rakhan ignorant of course of his crime later on rakhan persuaded imar that his wife orla had been unfaithful to him and imar though he did not kill orla caused her to commit suicide to discover his mistake before the breath had quite left her body he had his revenge however and killed rakhan in a duel this tragic history is told by imar himself to george he has scarcely finished it when he passes on to what thinks the reader a denunciation of free trade imar had hoped to reconcile the feud by a marriage between his daughter and his sister marvas son has ersay rather her supposititious sonuntil he is overruled by the love of dariel and george all these events however are only the forerunners of further plots on the part of marva which make of the last third of the book an exciting narrative when during this portion mr blackmore takes his readers into the scenery of the caucasus his writing improves greatly in character he is more at home with nature than with modern men and women on the whole he would do well to eschew contemporary history about the date of the french war and the days of nelson is as late as he can wisely allow himself to go,social_contra

night  toiling to leave a memory behind him failed in an aspiration which though not the noblest is still perhaps noble moreover it would be pleasant to think that all the affectionate solicitude of his friends to win for him the princes suffrages was not thrown away that stevenson had the kind of genius which manifests itself in a strong magnetic personality is made clear now that his voice is still by the loyalty of his friends would that the memory of certain other dead men we could namemen greater than he  had encountered the same loyalty  dead as living no writer surely has owed so much to the affection of friends as stevenson every writing man may be said to begin life well who has the good luck to be born north of the tweed scotchmen are sufficiently few in number to be legitimately clannish and they never fail to exercise their right second to his own fame every scot has the fame of every other scot at heart even carlyle gloried in the  waverley novels  until sir walter seemed to snub him when straightway he found them barren no doubt if this clannishness were resented in england matters would not run so smoothly with the writing scot but englishmen are too many to be clannish themselves and they take with a smile the quaint doings of the mutual admiration society beyond the tweed in london stevenson had at his feet a group of english pressmen who proclaimed him to be the great novelist of the agea sort of sublimated walter scott it was refreshing to hear them at first the cry was  scott and stevenson  at last it was  stevenson and scott yea the greatest imaginative writer that has appeared in great britain since shakespeare died was compared and to his disadvantage with a novelist whose characters already are fainting in the struggle for life for oven now within three years of his death the public writers seem to be able to remember only two  dr jekyll and mr hyde stevenson has style said these loving brothers of the pen  and remember that scott has none cobbett when prostrated by pessimistic thoughts about the future of the british constitution exclaimed  thank god we have a house of lords and in the same way did many a literary student when inclined to pessimistic misgivings about the lovely nature of the writing man exclaim  thank god we have stevenson and the savile club not even the sweetness of stevensons disposition could have saved him from friends like these had it not been for his stock of common sense of this sweetness of disposition and of this good sense we could quote many instances but let one suffice when  kidnapped appeared although in reviewing it we enjoyed the great pleasure of giving high praise to certain parts of that delightful narrative we refused to be scared by stevensons friends from making certain strictures it occurred to us that while some portions of the story were full of that organic detail of which scott was such a master and without which no really vital story can be told it was not so with certain othor parts from this we drew the conclusion that the book really consisted of two distinct parts two stories which stevenson had tried in vain to weld into one we surmised that the purely jacobite adventures of balfour and alan breck were written first and that then the writer anxious to win the suffrages of the general novelreader whose power is so great with byles the butcher looked about him for some story on the old lines that he experienced great difficulty in finding one ana that he was at last driven upon the old situation of the villain uncle plotting to make away with s  the nephew by kidnapping him and sending him off to the plantations the athenaum whose kindness towards all writers poets and prosemen great and small has won for it such an infinity of gratitude said this but in its usual kind and gentle way this aroused the wrath of the stevensonians yet we were not at all surprised to get from the author of kidnapped himself a charming letter from which the following sentences may be given   i wish to thank you for your notice of  kidnapped and that not because it was kind though for that also i valued it but in the same sense as i have thanked you before now for a hundred articles on a hundred different writers  you who fight the good fight contending with stupidity and i would fain hope not all in vain  in my own case for instance surely not in vain what you say of the two parts in  kidnapped was felt by no one more painfully than by myself i began it partly as a lark partly as a potboiler  and suddenly it moved david and alan stepped out from the canvas and i found i was in another world but there was the cursed beginning and a cursed end must be appended and an old friend byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping at the back door so it had to go into the world one part as it does seem to me alive one part merely galvanised  no work only an essay for a man of tentative method and weak health and a scarcity of private means and not too much of that frugality which is the artists proper virtue the days of sinecures and patrons look very golden the days of professional literature very hard yet i do not so far deceive myself as to think i should change any character by changing my epoch the sum of virtue in our books is in a relation of equality to the sum of virtues in ourselves  and my  kidnapped  was doomed while still in the womb and while i was yet in the cradle to be the thing it is thoroughly characteristic of stevenson are these words and it is because of thisamiability of hisno less than on account of his talentsthat we sincerely hope he may leave that memory behind him which he toiled to leave and yet we tremble to think of the provoking way time has of making short work with novels for the fieldings scotts brontes thackerays dickenses and george eliots that survive think of the host whose very captains such as bulwer disraeli ainsworth g p r james wilkie collins trollope are half forgotten nor is the reason of this far to seek though it may not be exactly true that each generation demands to be represented by its own poet it seems that even in regard to poetry a live dog is better than a dead lion if his voice is attuned to the convolutions of the contemporary ear but it is largely true that in the widespreading valley of prose literature at the foot of parnassus each generation demands to be represented by its own novelists and turns away from all but the very few among the novelists of previous time for one great difference between a poem and a novel is undoubtedly this that a poem ho wsoever humble professes to be and is a work of art written primarily for the poets own delectation  offered indeed as a medium through which he would fain express that ego so dear to him but a novel howsoever full of literary qualities is primarily a manufacture for a marketa fact which scott frankly confronted though perhaps not quite so frankly as does the novelist of the present hour who improving even upon the advertising methods of the late illustrious author of  the mysteries of london instructs the interviewer or paragraphist in his or her employ to inform though world of the number of copies printed the rate of the royalty hisor her publisher allows per copy and the amount of the publishers chequedoes this as regularly as the directors of a jointstock business give their balancesheet to the world we have no quarrel with all this we merely state the fact that as patent soap mustard liver pills and novels are nowa days in the same category the manufacturers of these commodities must allow prince posterity to have his marketing done for himself we have been led to dwell at some length upon this subject through an embarrassing consciousness that what we are about to say upon stevensons work may vex and hurt those fervid and tooloving souls who as we have shown above are more stevensonian than stevenson himself let our excuse be that it is though aim of this journal and always has been to exercise a twofold function in criticism although its main business week by week has been to give an account and a brief criticism of the literature of the hour it has also aspired when occasion arose to take up a higher groundin a word it has aspired to deal with those laws of cause and effect in literary art which are unchangeable and eternal and when a place has been claimed for a contemporary writer in the classic literature of the world it has triedhonestly and faithfully tried according to its lights to find a proper place for him but then it must be remembered that in exercising these two functions it often becomes necessary to apply to one and the same writer canons of criticism of two opposite kinds that loose leniency of judgement which may he rightly exercised when the critic has only to balance one work of contemporary fiction with another would be quite out of place when in discussing an edition like this a writers entire works are confronted in order that his proper place may be found in the field of uni versal criticism take for instance the little story  dr jekyll and mr hyde the laudatory criticism upon which is in bulk as regards the story itself like the comets tail in relation to though comet on its appearance as a story a shilling shocker for the railway bookstalls the critics attention was directed to its vividness of narrative and kindred qualities and though perfectly conscious of its worthlessness in the world of literary art he might well be justified in comparing it to its advantage with other tories of its class and literary standing but when it is offered as a classicand this is really how it is offered  it has to be 1 udged by critical canons of a very different ind it has then to be compared and contrasted with stories having a like motive stories that deal with an idea as old as the oldest literatureas old no doubt as those primaeval days when man awoke to the consciousness that he is a moral and a responsible beingstories whose temper has always been up to now of the loftiest kind it is many years since in writing of the parables of buddhaghosha it was our business to treat at length of the grand idea of mans dual nature and the many beautiful forms in which it has been embodied we said then that from the lovely modern story of arsene houssaye where a young man starting along lifes road sees on a lawn a beautiful girl and loves her and afterwardswhen sin has soiled him finds that she was his own soul stained now by his own sin and from the still more impressive though less lovely modern story of edgar poe 4 william wilson up to the earliest allegories upon the subject no writer or storyteller had dared to degrade by gross treatment a motive of such universal appeal to the great heart of the  great man mankind we traced the idea as far as our knowledge went through calderon back to oriental sources and found as we then could truly affirm that this motivefrom the ethical point of view the most pathetic and solemn of all motiveshad been always treated with a nobility and a greatness that did honour to literary art manu after telling us that single is each man born into the world  single dies implores each one to collect virtue in order that after death he may be met by the virtuous part of his dual self a beautiful companion and guide in traversing that gloom which is so hard to be traversed fine as this is it is surpassed by an arabian story we then quoted since versified by sir edwin arnoldthe story of the wicked king who met after death a frightful hag for an eternal companion and found her to be only a part of his own dual nature the embodiment of his own evil deeds and even this is surpassed by that lovely allegory in arda yiraf in which a virtuous soul in paradise walking amid pleasant trees whose fragrance was wafted from god meets a part of his own dual nature a beautiful maiden who says to him 0 youth i am thine own actions and we instanced other stories and allegories equally beautiful in which this supreme thought has been treated as soetically as it deserves it was left for tevenson to degrade it into a hideous tale of murder and whitechapel mystery a story of astonishing brutality in which the separation of the two natures of the mans soul is effected not by psychological development and not by the awful alchemy of the spiritworld beyond the grave as in all the previous versions but by the operation of a dose of some supposed new drug if the whole thing is meant as a horrible joke in imitation of de quinceys  murder considered as one of the fine arts it tells poorly for stevensons sense of humour if it is meant as a serious allegory it is an outrage upon the grand allegories of the same motive with which most literatures have been enriched that a story so coarse should have met with the plaudits that dr jekyll and mr hyde met with at the time of its publication  that it should now be quoted in leading articles of important papers every few days while all the various and beautiful renderings of the motive are ignored  what does it mean is it a sign that the shrinkage of the world the solidarity of civilization making the record of each days doings too big for the day has worked a great change in our public writers  is it that they not only have no time to think but no time to read anything beyond the publications of the hour is it that good work is unknown to them and that bad work is forced upon them and that in their busy ignorance they must needs accept it and turn to it for convenient illustration  that stevenson should have been impelled to write the story shows what the  suicide club had already shown that underneath the apparent health which gives such a charm to  treasure island and kidnapped there was that morbid strain which is so often associated with physical disease had it not been for the influence upon him of the healthiest of all writers since chaucerwalter scottstevenson might have been in the ranks of those pompous problemmongers of fiction and the stage who do their best to make life hideous it must be remembered that he was a critic first and a creator afterwards he himself tells us how critically ho studied the methods of other writers before he took to writing himself no one really understood better than he hesiods fine saying that the muses were born in order that they might be a forgetfulness of evils and a truce from cares no one understood better than he jouberts saying  fiction has no business to exist unless it is more beautiful than reality in literature the one aim is the beautiful once lose sight of that and you have the mere frightful reality and for the most part he succeeded in keeping down the morbid impulses of a spirit imprisoned and fretted in a crazy body save in such great mistakes as dr jekyll and mr hyde and a few other stories stevenson acted upon jouberts excellent maxim but scott and scott alone is always right in this matterright by instinct he alone is always a delight if all art is dedicated to joy as schiller declares and if there is no higher and more serious problem than how to make men happy then the waverley novels are among the most precious things in the literature of the world it is in literary criticism especially that though wise man refuses to prophesy unless he knows and no man knows anything about what the future will do with any writer or any book but in the long run the work of every artist in imaginative literature from homer to dickens is remembered by his characters and by his characters alone and the secret of the characterdrawing of the great masters seems to be this while moulding the character from broad general elements from universal types of humanity they are able to delude the readers imagination into mistaking the picture for real portraiture and this they achieve by making the portrait seem to be drawn from particular and peculiar individual traits instead of from generalities and especially by hiding away all purposes  aesthetic ethic or political stevenson as a critic was fully conscious of this law of imaginative art one great virtue of the great masters stevenson appreciated to the full their winsome softness of touch in character drawing we are not fond of comparing literary with pictorial art but between the work of the novelist and the work of the portrait painter there does seem a true analogy as regards the hardness and softness of touch in the drawing of characters in landscape painting that hardness which the general public love is a fault but in portrait painting so important is it to avoid hardness that unless the picture seems to have been blown upon the canvas as in the best work of gainsborough rather than to have been laid upon it by the brush the painter has not achieved a perfect success in the imaginative literature of england the two great masters of this softness of touch in portraiture are addison and sterne three or four hardlydrawn lines in sir roger or the two shandys or corporal trim would have so completely ruined the portraits that they would never have come down to us close upon addison comes fielding and then scott in whose vast gallery almost every portrait is painted with a gainsborough softness scarcely one is limned with those hard lines which are too often apt to mar the glorious work of dickens after scott comes thackeray unless it be mrs gaskell we are not in this article dealing with or even alluding to contemporary writers or we might easily say what novelists follow mrs gaskell whether or not stevensons instinct was for hardness or softness of touch though  new arabian nights show that he did not at first achieve softness his imagination though not robust was fine and it was based on reason he was always able to give a good account of his incidents and ready to do so in a letter now before us he says speaking of the fight on board the covenant in  kidnapped david and alan had every advantage on their side position arms training a good conscience  a handful of merchant sailors not well led in the first attack not led at all in the second could only by an accident have taken the round house by attack  and since the defenders had fire and arms and food it is even doubtful if they could have been starved out the only doubtful point with me is whether the seamen would have ever ventured on the second onslaught i half believe they would not but with all his undoubted talents and with all his 6tudy of and insight into the artistic methods of the masters has stevenson created any characters so new and so true that they will take their places in the great portrait gallery of classic english fiction  certainly there are one or two that ought to live if room can be found for them among these we are not sure that we can place alan breck he is delightful but a delightful bit of sir walters imagination if the master of ballantrae does not survive it will bo parti because of hardness of touch except for the feeble impression that the character made upon the critics who must in some degree be taken to express the general feeling we should have prophesied a long life for catriona she is a perfectly delightful character delightfully rendered though discussion of stevensons poetry we must

to the suicide club  and the rajas diamond tlhe other tales have no link with these nor are thley in the same genre and the blunder is unfortunate as the greater stories are thus named of the less the modernisation of the caliph haroun alraschid was an adventurous idea brilliantly carried out it puslies one step further into capital farce tennysons identification of king arthur uith a certain english gentleman of stateliest port but the tories themselves a mixture of melodrama and burlesque have not the remotet air of realit and hardly bear a second reading moreover the suicide club  contains ne picture thlat of mr malthus of such a nightmare horriblenes that it would not have passed the censor in any community of utopia there must have been a strain of lbrutalitv tomehere in stevenons fine natuie which cropped out once and again even in the later books  the body snatcher publihed ave the mark as a christmas stoi was the ornl tale in which thlis strain predominated  but

strong cen  stark characters enough in other talesnorthmour for examjle in thle pavilion on the links and the fraudulent banker huddletone in the same story is as much as mr malthus a study in the psychology of fear but these characters are well within the limits of literary decency the pavilion on the links indeed has all the qualities which combine to make the true stevenson there is the landscape so well drawn and so completely in key with the beauty or horror of the situation  there is the single vivid incident etched in with acid sharp and unforgettablein this case the noise of the wet finger on the windowpane without and the voice that shouted traditore through the shutters there is the wholesomeness of the sentiment  in the aristotelian sense of thle word  and there is the perfection of thle phraning the romantic tale of the strange courtship that weent on in the two hours before dawn inside the  sire de imaltroits oor  is singularly beautiful and unlike anything elc in fiction and then there are those charming french  artits in  providence and the guitar studied it would seem from a brokerdown actor and his wife full of sentiment described in the  inland oyage who preaclh tlat christian lesson which stevenson was never tired of inculcating that the life of a man does not consit in the abundance of things which he possesses finally there is a lodging for the night with its two scenes in the inn parlour and the lord of brisetouts kotel i do not believe that villon was as stevenson has represented him a compound of wolf and pig with some unexplalned calacity for making lballades but with no capacity fior seeing anything in his chivalrous host for the night but a very dull old gentleman the philosophy of revolt against societv which stevenson has elsewhere expounded should have saved him from such a lapse of critical imagination but strike out the name of the poet and one can enjoy to the full the vividnes of the contrast between the two scene and the wintry paris landscape that unites them the mention of villon brings me to speak of the only part of stevenon early writing which seem to fail of its mark and that i the critical work collected into  familiar studic of men and books stevenson in his humble lpreface recognie his tendency to depreciate a curious fault in an exponent of the philosophy of looking always on the better side but stevenson was not built for a critic his imagination was always at work on the material that came before him for study what seemed a striking saying summoned up in his mind a vivid picture of the man who would say such a thing and this became for him the man s true portrait but if the saying was really but an obiter dictum not really characteristic or if by some chance it had been misinterpreted then the whole character was miread i do not believe as i have said in the character drawn of francois villon most scotsmen fail to see the likeness in the portrait of burns but with that controveraan englishman had better not intermeddle but any reader of pepys diary  can see that stevensons  little sensualist in a periwig  is far enough from the truth about that interesting person it may be worth while to indicate a few points in which the painter has misrepresented his sitter because when a great artist paints a portrait we are apt to take the lifelikeness for granted and also because stevenson believed he had done pepys something more than justice take for a very clear example of misrepresentation the passage about the relations of pepys with william pen the quakermeanwhile there was growing up next door to him that beautiful nature william pen it is odd that pepys condemned him for a fop odd though natural enough when you see pens portrait that pepys was jealous of him with his wife but the cream of the story is when pen publishes his  sandy founda tion shaken and pepys has it read aloud by his wife i find it he savs  so well writ as i think it is too good for him ever to have writ it and it is a serious sort of book and not fit for cverybody to read tht italics are stevensons nothing is more galling to the mnerely respectable than to be brought in cortact with religious ardour pepys had his own foundation sandy enough but dear to him from practical considerations and he would read the book with true uneasiness of spirit for conceive the blow if by some plague accident this pen wvere to convert him and so on for some dozen lines more but if the reader one in ten thousand were to turn to pepys to see what he really did say about pens bookl he would find that what he thought dangerous in it wovas not its enthusiasm but its heresy this is the passage  pelling bath got me wl pens book against the trinity i got my wife to read it to me etc the title of the book was  the sandy foundations shaken or those doctrines of one god subsisting in three distinct and separate persons etc refuted from the authority of scripture testimonies and right reason so that all stevensons very cynical commentary on the words not fit for everybody to read rests on a simple misunderstanding or take another point pepys buys a i roguish french book and notes in his diary that he bought it in plain binding meaning to burn it when read  that it may not stand in the list of books nor among them to disgrace them if it should be found stevenson paraphrases this  he is full of precautions to conceal the disgrace of the purchase but pepyvs is writing as a collector with a respect to the dignity of his library he is not even considering the question about the morality or immorality of reading  roguish  books so again stevensons idea that pepys was a sort of leaf insect who took his moral colour from his neighbours and was only virtuous when under the influence of sir william coventry is not supported by the diary coventry was no better than his contemporaries in regard to the seenth commandment and in regard to the eighth we find him more than once making a sort of apologia to pepys or once more what ground is there for stevensons wild idea that pepys intended his diar to be one day made public  i the greatness of his life he says  was open yet he longed to communicate its smallness also and while contemporaries bowed before him he must buttonhole posterity with the news that his periwig was once alive with nits i confess lively writing of this sort whet it belittles the characters of the dead without a spark of evidence makes me angry stevenson quotes the solemn sentence with which the diary closes but if he had raised his eves to the sentence next before it he would have found that it disposed of his theory  and thus ends all that i doubt i shall ever be able to do with my own eves in the keeping of my journal i being not able to do it any longer having done now so long as to undo my eves almost every time that i take a pen in my hand and therefore whatever comes of it i must forbear and therefore resolve from this time

my book open to add here end there a note in shorthand with my own hand young entlemen with a genius for style should be warned oxf riticism the valuable part of stevensons writing outside his stories  that in which he writes about himself about himself aid his travels and his meditations on men and things we could niever have too much because he looked at the world with tresh eyes i have a fancy for testing a mans powers of natural description by his handling of a snowstorm iand i remember the joy it gave me years ago to come upon this passage of our author the snow fell with rigorous relentless persistence sometimes the wind made a sllv and scattered it in flying vortices smetimes there was a lull and flake after flake descended out f the black nigh air silent circuitous

footfall giv fii the alarm if there were any belated birds in heaven they br w the island like a laree white datch and the bridges like slim white spars on the black ground of the river but in the travel books natural description is kept in due subordination to the proper study of mankind and there as in the moral essays wie find stevenson acclaiming with joy mans imperfect virtues and calling upon every body to take up the great task of being happy themselves anti making others happp quotation would be an endless luxury but one passage may be allowed which we may well believe seemed to its author the conclusion of the whole matter certainly for himselfall who have meant good vork with their wvhole hearts have done good work although they may die before they have the time to sign it

appeared they are so original  in fact they treat of so strange a subjectmatter and in so strange a way that the unregenerate saxon may find them at first a little difficult on a further acquaintance he will find that their local colour their idiom their whole method combine to produoe an effect whioh may be unaccustomed but is therefore the more irresistible 44 why asks miss madeod in her dedicatory epistle to mr george meredith why do i write these things  it is because i wish to say to you and to all who may read this book that in what i have said lies the secret of the gad the beauty of the world the pathos of life the gloom the spiritual glamour it is out of these the heritanoe of tiie gad that i have wrought these tales this dearly commits the writer to the romantic method that we find preserved in all these tales though they have here and there a touch of that realism which romance has never been entirely withoutceltic romance especially the first of them the sineater is a capital example in its romantic kind you feel in reading it that the talewriter has not gone to her subjectmatter as a purely disinterested agent on the contrary she brings her passionate predilections instead of being disinterested she is perfervidly interested she goes prepared to find the things that count oeltically speaking and she finds themthe gloom the spiritual glamour and the rest tomorrow some new realist will go over the same ground and bring back his very different report of things as they really are and tell us what queer kind of porridge he saw the achannas eat but miss madeod being to the manner born writes from the inside and not from the outride is affected through her imagination and not through her nerves and is sometimes so carried away by her subject that she forgets how suburban the modern reader is apt to be and how he likes his sealions caged and labelled and his peatsmoke described in terms of fleetstreet not only does she forget this she deliberately does all she can to inorease the sea terror the wildness and the gaelic savour of her tales the sineater begins with the wet wind and the sea mist of the western ides and ends with the wild cry of the man neil ross as he goes down in the  black eddy  that rushes between skerrymohr and skerrybeag an eirig rn anama  in ransom for my soul all through it one hears the seanoises and feels the seawind and the sineater is treated in bold accord with such elemental circumstance half man half myth he is the scapegoat of the sea he bears the sins of others but with no scapegoats innocence therein lies the motive which is treated in this tale with so much force at last he makes his seaexit on a spar that is like the cross nay in the words of aulay maoneill who tells his end  it was the cross he was on i saw that thing with the fear upon me ah poor drifting wreck that he was judas on the cross it was his eric still more strange and from an english point of view more simply and artistically constructed and written is  the dannanron perhaps the finest thing in the book   you know what is said in the ides about    about this or that man who is under jheasan  who is spellbound    and    about the seals and    says marcus aohanna to anne the heroine of this strange tale   they say that seals he repeated slowly they say that seals are men under magic spells here we have suggested a fine dramatic motive at the threshold of an old gaelic folktale and miss madeod uses her opportunity with singular control of the magic machinery of an uncanny subject the figure of gloom aohanna who plays the tune of the dannanron on his feadan an oatenpipe or flute is one not easily forgotten he lives with unreal reality in ones mind his wild tunes hold ones ear though they are

B7365,"['6821226', '8899301']",  fiction the undying past by hermann sudkrmann translated by beatrice marshall lane 6s sudermanns es war is not one of his greatest books but it is infinitely superior to most of the novels published today and it is with pleasure that we find mr lane issuing miss marshalls translation of it it is no easy task to translate sudermann and it cannot be said altogether that miss marshal has attained a very high standard we are constantly reminded by such little things as two consecutive hyphened adjectives long involved sentences and sentences which begin with a conjunction and have no verb that the work is translated but at least it may be said that she has given us a readable and fairly literary rendering of the original many people are puzzled by the last few pages of the book the position is one in which two men bosom friends have been estranged by a woman leo von sellenthin has been the lover of felicitas in the days when she was married to a man named rhaden the discovery of the liaison is followed by a duel in which rhaden is killed von sellenthin leaves the country and in his absence felicitas consoles herself by marrying his great friend ulrich von kletzingk when leo returns he finds the edition unbearable and declines to go near felicitas er husband naturally assumes that it is because he had killed rhaden for he is quite unaware of the true state of affairs finally a peace is patched up at felicitass own invitation and before they realise it leo and the woman find themselves on the brink of resuming their old relationship the man recoils in time and they decide to die together but ulrich surprises them alone at nighthis wife leaves him and goes to live alone in berlin the barrier between the friends appears to have been removed and most people interpret the end of the book as meaning that the old friendship will be renewed but this view appears to be untenable to any who read the book with an understanding of sudermanns views of life the real ending appears to be that by the undying past by that sin against the first husband not only is the second husbands hie blighted but the friends are set for ever upon different paths the undying past is not the past of the friendship which nothing can kill but the undying past of the sin which kills everything the fact that the book can be thus discussed even in the space of a brief review is testimony to its virility and power the three chief characters in es war are wonderfully drawn leo with his strength of body and honest frank views of life ulrich the weakling who has lived by sheer force of will the dreamer who can see evil in no man and felicitas what is felicitas  to some she is an enigma to others she is a very ordinary woman who sinned not from wickedness but inability to fight against herself felicitas is one of the most complex studies of womankind that sudermann has given us and yet even among english women there are characters not widely different from that of the heroine if such she can be called of the undying past  the undying past by hermann suder mann translated by beatrice marshall john lane  es war the longest and most ambitious of sudermanns novels was not published till 1894 but most of it was written we believe some ten years earlier and this no doubt accounts for a certain immaturity and want of harmony apparent in portions of the work however if from the artistic point of view it is hardly equal to some of the authors novels that appeared before it it is none the less a fine and forcible romance and contains some of his best writing the hero leo sellenthin one of those robust fullblooded sons of east prussia whom sudermann is so fond of depicting is a really convincing character and the way in which his philosophy of life as exemplified in his motto  nichts bereuen is put to the proof provides a thoroughly interesting theme which is effectively though perhaps too sensationally worked out the consequences of sin he discovers are not to be evaded by simply ignoring them but neither is a cure to be found in remorse  only after he has made full confession of his guilt and put the past behind him once for all can he start a new life hopefully and courageously  high festival in his heart compared with him most of the other characters in the book are more or less conventional much care has been bestowed upon the siren lady felicitas but in spite of it all she remains a stage type and is never completely alive the author is happier with hertha a rather charming specimen of the sentimentally innocent backfisch  so dear to german hearts  and in pastor brenckenberg he has produced an original and humorous sketch of an oldfashioned country parson it is well that a writer so prominent in germany as sudermann should be presented to english readers the translation as a whole moves freely and naturally and will satisfy the general reader but hardly a more exacting critic it is not nearly scrupulous enough in following the text and often unpardonably thoughtless or perfunctory to give a single instance the letter which felicitas sends to leo after his return closes with the characteristic ally melodramatic sentence  dich rust das ungliick which cannot be considered satisfactorily rendered by  our unhappiness makes it imperative that you should come we have also noted

the authors own fancy  his present concern with the socialist community is merely to establish a theatre a little removed from the highway of ordinary travel where the creatures of his brain may play their phantasmagorical antics without exposing them to too close a comparison with the actual events of real lives we are cautioned consequently against supposing that any of the characters introduced are intended to be portraits of his quondam associates who put their hands to the plough but did turn back like wise men and sought the old paths a new moral world was a fine dream but for ladies and gentlemen it turned out a very indifferent reality as hawthorne says while our enterprise lay all in theory we had pleased ourselves with delectable visions of the spiritualisatiou of labour it was to be our form of prayer and ceremonial of worship each stroke of the hoe was to uncover some aromatic root of wisdom pausing in the field to let the wind exhale the moisture from our foreheads we were to look upward and catch glimpses into the faroff soul of truth in this point of view matters did not turn out quite so well as we anticipated it is very true that sometimes gazing casually around me out of the midst of my toil 1 used to discern a richer picturesqueness in the visible scene of earth and sky but this was all the clods of earth which we so constantly belaboured and turned over and over were never etherealised into thought our thoughts on the contrary were fast becoming cloddish our labour symbolised nothing and left us mentally sluggish in the dusk of the evening intellectual

individuals and eau never be melted or welded into one substance out of such reminiscences of a romantic episode in his history mixed up with other curious developments witnessed of late years in new england mr hawthorne constructs his tale he has made a desperate attempt to get ont of the beaten track and let bis fancy rove in the realms of fairyland and in terrestrial spheres not less fantastical yet who ever read anything more real or in fact more thoroughly bostonian the shadow of a temporary phantom there is both soul and substance in the picture blithedale might have been pitched anywhere and might have been the scene of any sort of extravagance on the part of witches fairies angels or devils bnt you feel that you are reading a story of yesterday in which the characters are drawn from life and reflect the sentiments current in the intellectual circles of massachussets the form of the romance is autobiographical which gives fine effect to the pictorial style in which hawthorne has attained a rare degree of excellence his characteristics as a writer and primarily as an observer and thinker are happily hit off by himself in the remarks that come from miles coverdale after zenobia dropped the curtain when he was reconnoitring from the window of his hotel as if such were the proper barrier to be interposed between a character like hers and a perceptive faculty like mine for was mine a mere vulgar curiosity  zenobia should have known me better than to suppose it she should have been able to appreciate that quality of the intellect and the heart which impelled me often against my will and to the detriment of my own comfort to live in other lives and to endeavourby generous sympathies by delicate intuition by taking note of things too slight for record and by bringing spirit into manifold accordance with the companions whom god assigned meto learn the secret which tas hidden even from tltemstlvcs with a faculty so fit for the work

usual quantity of comedy and tragedy for of the four chief charactersnamely zenobia and priscilla hollingsworth and coverdalethe first as just stated committed a tragedy the second and third perpetrated a comedy and the fourth did neither the one nor the other but remained a bachelora disappointed one however for he had a few qualms of poetic tenderness toward his sybilline sister though he was hardly conscious of the fact till some years after priscilla had been brought by hollingsworth who had rescued her from some impending danger and to whom the girl clung with a gratitude which ripened into love ere long zenobias affections began to flow in the same direction and the unfortunate man had more love bestowed upon him than he well knew what to do with he was but a rough shaggyhaired blacksmith but with a deep strong heart and a copious supply of magnetic power which threw a spell over the highspirited imperial woman as well as the weak girl isle had a ruling passion in the philanthropic line which was to reform criminals by giving them board and lodging as in our model prisons in a huge penitentiary which he wished to erect and where he could bring them under training proper to fit them for their place in society better have the  scoundrels whipped carlyle would say however this was his schemehis one ideato which he would and did sacrifice truth honour and friendship when they stood in the way of its accomplishment he had come in no good faith to blithedale he did not believe in socialismit was not his ism but like others there he was a disappointed man and in a fit of dejection joined the community carrying his scheme with him and contenting himself with nothing short of appropriating the whole conoern to his own purposes zenobia is won over to bis plan and places her wealth at his disposal some curious revelations however are made in her former history and an unexpected reverse of fortune is at hand the circumstances are too complicated to admit of condensed recital suffice it to say that zenobia and priscilla are discovered to be halfsisters the wealth of the former is transferred to the latter zenobia is deserted and drowns herself in despair hollingsworth prefers the newlydowered priscilla but instead of building his penitentiary is haunted by zenobias ghost and passes his days in remorse and wretchedness from his life is drawn the following moral that admiting what te called philanthropy when adopted as a profession to be often useful by its energetic impulse to society at large it is perilous to the individual whose ruling passion in one exclusive channel it thus becomes it ruins or is fearfully apt to rain the heart the rich juices of which god never meant should be pressed violently out snd distilled into alcoholic liquor by an unnatural process but should render life sweet bland and gently beneficent and insensibly influence other hearts and other lives to the same blessed end i see in hollingsworth an exemplification of the most awful truth in banyans book of suchfrom the gate of heaven there is a byway to the pit 1 the moral of zenobias career is a legacy from herself committed to the care of coverdale previous to the fatal plunge a moral why thisthat in the battlefield of life the downright stroke that would fall only on a mans steel headpiece is sure to light on a womans heart over which she wears no breastplate and whose wisdom it is therefore to keep out of the conflict or this that the whole universe her own sex and yours aud providence or destiny to boot make common cause against the woman who swerves one hairsbreadth out of the beaten track yes and add for i may aa well own it now that with that one hairsbreadth she goes all astray and never sees the world in its true aspect afterward 1 this is a harsh moral though a fit one for zenobias life this was her experience but we doubt whether it be a fair and faithful picture of reality a lesson so extreme and unqualified appears on the face of it morbid and exaggerated but this is characteristic of hawthorne he is a morbid and moody man who seems to have got out of his proper orbit so as  never to see the world in its true aspect himself he is in his element when dissecting a corpse and smelling putrefaction always he gives you the dark side of humanity and always paints it in such beautiful colours that you are charmed even by what is inexpressibly painful anguish utters no shriek but what is musical and the voice of villainy itself is melodious hawthorne could charm you into admiration of a dunghill he has an eye for the beautiful but only dim perceptions of the right the good and the true your moral faculties are unhealthily excited when excited at all this is a serious defect in a work of so much purity and power and is the source of several artistic faults which would have been remedied by greater moral earnestness in the writer it makes him timid hesitating and slow in his movements with all his originality there is no bold stroke of art but only a succession of beautiful sketches all on the same level and often sprawling and monotonous for want of that concentration of purpose and fullness of design which can only emanate from an earnest and even tumultuous nature with the general effect therefore of this work we are dissatisfied  with most of its scenes and sentiments we are delighted hawthorne is a painter not a sculptor he excels in pictorial colouring not in correct harmony of design notwithstanding the ease with which he now handles his pencil he has reached his present position by slow and laborious effort his latest production is his best and gives promise of something still better in point of mere style he stands at the head of american writers and is one of the few among them who write for immortality as a specimen of his style as well as of millenial life take the following picture of a modern arcadia arcadians though we were our costume bore no resemblance to the beribboned doublets silk breeches and stockings and slippers fastened with artificial roses that distinguish the pastoral people of poetry and the stage in outward show i humbly conceive we looked rather like a gang ot beggars or banditti than either a company of honest labouring men or a conclave of philosophers whatever might be our points of difference we all of os seemed to have come to blithedale with the one thrifty and laudable idea of wearing oat our old clothes such garments as had an airing whenever we strode a field i coats with high col1 ara and with no collars broadskirted or swallowtailed and with the waist at every point between the hip and armit j pantaloons of a dozen successive epochs and greatly deaced at the knees by the humiliations of the wearer before his ladylovein short we were a living epitome of defunct fashions and the very raggedest presentment of men who had seen better days it was gentility in tatters often retaining a scholarlike or clerical air you might have taken us for the denizens of grubstreet intent on getting a comfortable livelihood by agricultural labour or coleridges projected pantisocracy in full experiment or candide and his motley associates at work in their cabbagegarden or anything else that was miserably out at elbows and most clumsily patched in the rear we might have been sworn comrades to falstaffs ragged regiment little skill as we boasted in other points of husbandry every mothers son of ns would have served admirably to stick up for a scarecrow and the worst of the matter was that the first ensrgeue movement essential to our downright stroke of real labour was sure to put a finish to these poor habiliments 80 we gradually siting them all aside and took to honest homespun and linseywouey as preferable on the whole to the plan recommended think by virgil nudusara t set nudus which as silas foster remarked when i translated the maxim would be apt to astonish the womenfolks after a reasonable training the yeoman life throve well with us  to be sure our next neighbours pretended to be incredulous as to our real proficiency in the business which we had taken in hand they told slanderous fables about our inability to yoke our new oxen or to drive them afieid when yoked or to release the poor brutes from their conjugal bond at nightfall they had the face to ssy too that the cows laughed at oar awkwardness at milkingtime and invariably kicked over the pails    they further averred that we hoed up whole acres of indian corn and other crops and drew the earth carefully about the weeds and that we raised five hundred tufts of burdock mistaking them for cabbages and that by dint of unskilful planting few of our seeds ever came up at all or if they esme up it was sternforemost finally and as an ultimate catastrophe these mendacious rogues circulated a report that we communitarians were exterminated to the last man by severing ourselves asunder with the sweep of our own scythes ana that the world had lost nothing by this little accident the working of their communitarianism and the relation which it sustained to the oldworld system is clearly indicated in some of the incidental occur rences which were brought out now and then as when silas foster asked  which man among you is the best judge of swine or as when he told them  we shall never make any hand at marketgardening unless the women folks will undertake to do all the weeding we havent time enough for that and the regular farmwork reckoning titree of you city folks as worth one common fieldhand no no i tell you we shall have to get up a little too early in the morning to compete with the marketgardeners round boston whereupon follows this reflection it struck me as rather odd that one of the first questions raised after oar separation from the greedy straggling selfseeking world should relate to the possibility of getting the advantage over the outside barbarians in their own field of labour but to own the truth i very soon became sensible that as regarded society at large we stood in a position of new hostility rather than new brotherhood nor could this fail to be the case in some degree until the bigger and better half of society should range itself on our side constituting so pitiful a minority as now we were inevitably estranged from the rest of mankind

and without any regard to fashion or smartness her brown hair fell down from beneath a hood not in curls but with only a alight wave  her face was of a wan almost sickly hue betokening habitual seclusion from the sun and free atmosphere like a flowershrub that had done its best to blossom in too scanty light to complete the pitiableness of her aspect she shivered either with cold or fear or nervous excitement so that you might have beheld her shadow vibrating on the firelighted wall in short there has seldom been seen so depressed and sad a figure as this young girls  and it was hardly possible to help being angry with her from mere despair of doing anything for her comfort the fantasy occurred to me that be wu some desolate kind of a creature doomed to wander about in snowstorms

air performed its work upon her and the description of priscilla some mouths later may be quoted as a fair specimen of the sterling qualities that characterise mr hawthornes style priscilla had now grown to be a very pretty girl and still kept budding and blossoming and daily putting on some new charm which you no sooner became sensible of than you thought it worth all that she had previously possessed so unformed vague and without substance as she had come to us it seemed as if we could see nature shaping out a woman before our very eyes and yet had only a more reverential sense of the mystery of a womans soul and frame yesterday her cheek was paletoday it had a bloom priscillas smile like a babys first one was a wondrous novelty her imperfections and shortcomings affected me with a kind of playful pathos which was as absolutely bewitching a sensation as ever i experienced after she had been a month or two at blithedale her animal spirits waxed high and kept her pretty constantly in a state of bubble and ferment impelling her to far more bodily activity than she had yet strength to endure she was fond of playing with the other girls out of doors there is hardly another sight in the world so pretty as that of a company of young girls almost women grown at play and so giving themselves up to their airy impulse that their tiptoes barely touch the ground girls are incomparably wilder and more effervescent than boys more untamable and regardless of rule and limit with an evershifting variety breaking continually into new modes of fun yet with a harmonious propriety through all their steps their voices appear free as the wind but keep consonance with a strain of music inaudible to us young men and boys on the other hand play according to recognised law old traditionary games permitting no caprice of fancy but with scope enough for the outbreak of savage instincts for young or old in play or in earnest man is prone to be a brute especially is it delightful to see a vigorous young girl run a race with ber head thrown back her limbs moving more friskily than they need and an air between that of a bird and a young colt but priscillas peculiar charm in a footrace was the weakness and irregularity with which she ran growing up without exercise except to her poor little finger8 she had never yet acquired the perfect use of her legs setting buoyantly forth therefore as if no rival less swift thsn atalanta could compete with her she ran falteringly and often tumbled on the grass such an incident though it seems too slight to think of was a thing to laugh at but which brought the water into ones eyes and lingered in the memory after far greater joys and sorrows were swept out of it as antiquated trash priscillas life as i beheld it was full of trifles that affected me in just this way when she had come to be quite at home among us i used to fancy that priscilla played more pranks and perpetrated more mischief than any other girl in the community for example i once heard silas foster in a very gruff voice threatening to rivet th iee horseshoes round priscillas neck and chain her to a post because she with nome other young people had clambered upon a load of hay and caused it to slide off the cart how she made her peace i never knew but very soon afterwards i saw old silas with his brawny hands round priscillas waist swinging her to and fro and finally depositing her on one of the oxen to take her first lessons in riding she met with terrible mishaps in her efforts to milk a cow she let the poultry into the garden she generally spoilt whatever part of the dinner she took in charge sbe broke crockery she dropped our biggest pitcher into the well andexcept with her needle and those little wooden instruments for pursemakingwas as unserviceable a member of society as any young lady in the land there was no other sort of efficiency about her yet everybody was kind to priscilla  everybody loved her and laughed at her to her face and did not laugh behind her back  everybody would have given her half of his last crust or the bigger share of his plumcake these were pretty certain indications that we were all conscious of a pleasant weakness in the girl and considered her not quite able to look after her own interests or fight her battle with the world and hollingsworthperhaps because he had been the means of introducing priscilla to her new abodeappeared to consider her his own especial charge there are more characters to the plot the blithedale people now and then visit the town and two people from

B6566,['3763815'],  three months under the snow i tnis is one of those delightful books which young readers will peruse with all the interest of robinson crusoe and which many old folks too will etoy with equal pleasure we heartily recommend the little volume as a work very suitable for a present to young people al d that our readers may see the grounds on which we cordially praise it we proceed to furnish them with a short resume of its contents during seven months of the year the lofty mountain chain of switzerland known as the jura is covered with a mantle of snow and ice which prevents all access to it by travellers but during the other five months from may until october the scene changes then the snow disappears the forests are clad in all their verdant livery and excellent pastures are furnished by the rich grass allured by the latter attraction the swiss drive forth their herds to browse upon the mountain peaks of jura on these occasions the shepherds remain with their flocks until the hard winter again sets in residing during their absence from home in rude chalets formed of stone and occupying their intervals of leisure with the manufacture of the grweere cheeses so well known in the list of epicura delicacies the scene of the narrative of  three months under the snow which by the way is founded to 1 a very great extent upon facts is laid among the spots just described and commences at a time when the shepherds had driven back their flocks from the mountains of the jura one of these i shepherds frangoisthe father of pierre lopraz the little hero of the bookdoes not as was expected return with the others alarm is in consequence excited and pierre accompanied by louis his t fadther determines to proceed in eat of his mssing parent in the course of ascent up the mountain pierre has the  thee ontihe under the snow the journal of a yon inhabitant of the jun tranuated fro the french of oldpomowha rigiu tact society curosity to go near the edge of a dangerous ravine when his grandfather in his anxiety to warn him against the danger stumbles and sprains his foot no particular notice of the aeci dent is taken at the moment but it turns out to i be the pivot on which the whole plot turns on arriving at the pasture ground pierre finds his father well and intending to return the following day the illness of some of his cows having prevented him from leaving the mountain at the time when the other shepherds took their departure the whole party goes to sleep that evening in a rude chalet in which the father has resided during the summer but next day a new difficulty arises the old mans foot has so much swollen that he cannot walk and as there is not assistance enough to carry him back to the village it is arranged that pierre shall remain with him at the cottage while his father drives down the flock and brings back directly the needful aid from home the father departs accordingly although all parties have ominous misgivings the father trembles lest the snow should set in and bury them alive before his return while pierie and his grandfather are apprehensive that if the snowstorm actually comes on it will not only be fatal to them but will overwhelm franjois before he reaches the village meanwhile the mountains have begun to be tinged with snow and a loud wind is whistling past the cabin when suddenly it is recollected that there is another tenant of the cottagone indeed who turns out in the issue to be a most important one our wooden clock says the young hero in a diar which records the incidents of each dayhad scarcely struck threeat this moment i called my grandfathers attention to the bleating of the goat   poor blanchette said he  her milk is troublesome and she is calling us light the lamp we will go and milk her and then have our supper  the wind roared violently it rushed among the shingles which shook with its force so that we had some fear that the roof of the chalet would have been carried away i lifted my head several times fear nothing said my grandfather this house has sustained many similar assaults the shingles are loaded with large stones and the roof being nearly flat gives very little hold to the wind he then made me a sign to go before him and we entered the stable when the goat saw us she redoubled her bleatings she seemed ready to break her halter by the efforts she made to get to us how greedily she ate the handful of salt that i gave her her tongue licked my hand over and over again that she might not lose a grain she gave us a good pailful of milk such is our introduction to blanchette before the reader has done with her ho will find that she rises in importance until he is as much interested about her as he is about the other inmates of the snow prison on the regularity indeed with which she yields her milk the lives of the prisoners are found in a great measure to depend up to this time although the wind iwa been roaring around the mountain cottage there had been nothing to indicate that positive danger had set in on the following morning however when i i pierre awoke he was surprised to find himself in complete darkness at first he thought that his sleep had left him at an earlier hour than usual  grandfather he cried  you are up before daylight  my dear boy replied the old man  if we were to wait the light of day we should remain long enough in bed i fear the snow is above thewindow the terrible truth at last flashed on the mind they were entombed in the snow which had fallen thickly and heavily during the night they knew too from experience that there was little or no prospect of obtaining relief until the spring returned it is at this point that the peculiar value of the book as teaching presence of mind in danger and cheerful confidence in providence appears the old man who is pious takes a hopeful view of things and like mariners on a raft after the wreck of their vessel the little party begins to scrutinise the stores that are left to enable them to accomplish their arctic voyage pierre seeing that a glimmering of the sun appears down the chimney through a part which the snow has not choked up manages to emerge to the roof of the chalet  i but as nothing but bleak desolation meets his gaze he speedily comes down again a fire is lighted but in the midst of their confusion the little hut itself gets nearly burned down by the kindling of  some straw still their hearts do not fail to guard against similar emergencies they fill a tub with snow and place it beside the fireplace ready to extinguish any future conflagration their situation too is not found so cheerless as might have been imagined happily their wooden clock keeps correct time so that they do not lose their reckoning there is plenty of hay also for blanchette on whose life theirs now depend a limited stock of potatoes is also discovered while a bottle or two of swiss wine and some three loaves of hard mountain bread with a few other trifles turn up pierre likewise in the course of his researches finds an axe some straw to plait into hats and what proves a greater treasure still an old work of devotion which supplies them with admirable counsel in their difficulties leading them to earnest prayer to god for his protection and for the improvement of the trials which he has sent to them blanchette moreover is brought from the stable to the hut and proves pleasant company for them a month or more passes in this was pierre takes another journey to the roof and watching carefully the mode in which the snow lies conceives it possible to digg away some of the superincumbent portions of it so as to open the door and admit light to the window the brave and noble boy at the risk of much inconvenience and peril accomplishes his obect and once more the light of day refracted from piles of glittering snow and ice breaks in upon them they have not time however to enjoy this very much before another snowstorm sets in blocking the cottage doors and windows and covering the roof with a heavier load than before the old mans piety comes again to his aid and he encourages his nephew not to despond but to believe that this disappointment is ordered b7 providence for wise purposesa conclusion which is proved by the event but we must take the narration of this incident from the work itself december 13thwe had a dreadful alarm yesterday today even i can scarcely collect my thoughts enough to write down what has passed alas we are not yet sure that we have escaped all danger i was busy milking the goat while my grandfather was lighting the fire suddenly she pricked up her ears as if she heard some extraordinary noise and began to tremble all over swhat is the matter poor blanchette  i said caressing her but immediately we heard the most dreadful howlings as if it were over our heads  wolves i exclaimed silence my boy caress blanehette said my grandfather and he approached her himself and gave her some salt she continued to tremble and the howlings continued also well louis said he in a low voice  what would have become of us had you opened a passage to the window who knows if even the chimney might not have afforded a passage to those ravenous beasts   and do you think we are safe even as we are p i  i hope sobut speak low and do not cease to caress blanchetteher bleating might betray us one would have thought that she had the same fears for she did not make the slighitest noise my grandfather came and sat down by me i held the goat in my arms he had his hand laid upon my shoulder and i needed all the encouragement of his calm and serene countenance to keep me from shrieking aloud with fright au that i had previously experienced in the chalet could not be compared to the agony of yesterday throughout the whole day we passed it by the side of blanchette and at several intervals we heard the howlings of the wolves at one time it was so loud that i thought my last hour was come they are digging through the snow i cried clasping my grandfather in my arms they will i get in and devour us  the grandfather calms him however and the danger passes away the wolves it is conjectured had not scented the rich prize below but had brought the carcass of some animal and made the outcry which alarmed the inmates of the cottage by their quarling as they devoured their prey as the winter advanced a more serious trouble arose to daunt the heart of poor pierre for his grandfather unable to stand the severe cold gradually drooped and finally died what followed is well calculated to teach young people the value of calmness selfpossession and moral courage most boys under similar circumstances would have been iin danger of losing their reason but pierre encouraged by the excellent advice which his grandfather had given him before his death bears up even under his new trial the scene in which he is represented as digging a grave for his grandfather and interring him is not only admirably painted but divested of all repulsive features our youang hero was now lft alonea solitary hermit on the top of the jurawith nothing but his goat blanchette to keep him company and iyet he was not quit alone either for as mungo p ark was cheered in the african desert by seeing a flower so pierre was reminded of the omnipresence of the great creator by another equally striking incident a piece of rubbish had fallen down his chimney the noise attracted his attention and as apprehensive of the soot having taken fire he looked up an iron tube which sewved as an escape for the smoke a star passed over its orifice crossing it slowly at its greatest breadth the appearance lasted but a moment yet it affected pierre greatly reminding him that even in his forlorn condition apparently forgotten by every human being there was one to whom he could make known by prayer his wants and difficulties he had indeed poor fellow need of all the comfort he could get for one morning he heard around him what sounded like the final cruh of naturethe ceiling cracked pieces of plaster fell and a portion of the wall of the cottage lost its perpendicular after the uproar had ceased he began to fear that an avalanche had fallen in his neighbourhood covering for aught he knew the chalet with its fragments however the shock roused him from a state of dejection to face a new and perhaps more perplexing difficulty blanchette the goat began to cease giving her milka dreadful discovery for it threatens to reduce him to the cruel alternative of starvation or of killing the poor animal which has cheered by its company his solitary hours from day to day the condition of blanchette is recorded in pierres diary and we read with deep interest the accounts which show the allimportant milk to be continually diminishing  january 27the milk decreases and the goat fattens in proportion  february 2she has given even less milk than the day before and i have gained nothing but the pain of hearing her bleat most sorrowfully for more than half the day  february 8i will own my weakness i shed tears today when i made a last vain attempt to milk blanchette when she saw me stoop she gave me a look of defiance as if she were standing on her guard against any further attempt i threw away my pail i sat down near the poor beast embraced her and wept bitterly what is the poor fellow to do now  it breaks his heart to think of killing the affectionate animal ah happily his trials are well nigh over on the 24th of february he lighted his fire scarcely had he done so when the smoke began to ascend and he heard a great noise without at first he thought it was the wolves which had returned but human voices are heard hailing him quicker and quicker come the strokes of the

observation and description but we are often disappointed in reading the descriptive passages whether of scenery or action by an almost aggressive and artificial straining after effect this very conscious effort is rendered still more laboured by the use of long unexpected and sometimes pedantic words on the very first page we read of a travelling showman that  he was sensible of the strain upon his receptivity to compass the transcendent reality later the  transcendent reality  of rushing water is thus described it had a secondary tone seeming keyed higher sic a clear metallic tintinnabulation like elfin minstrelsy barely heard yet not discriminated by the senses    many a broken stellular reflection flashed from the dark lustrous surface and the foam of the rapids was

perhaps intentional the character of mr jardine must be excepted this social prig of conventionality is a clever study hilary lloyd the travelling showman is a connecting link between the two extremes of social life he is a hero of a wellknown type a sort of halfgentleman submerged by force of circumstances with a strong individuality of his own naturally he is in no way spoiled by his sudden accession to fortune when the windfall arrives though we cannot but think that the true romance of the story is marred by his dismissal of the pretty peasant girl with a gratuity to remember him by and his subsequent marriage to the lady of society a slightly silly person with no force of character at the same time we follow his fortune throughout with deep interest and if we have insisted strongly on certain defects it is chiefly because of our regret that they should appear in a novel which is in other respects so attractive  the windfall by gertrude m koxe illustrated by arthur

rather late in the day that the daughter of his old friend had been left practically alone in the svorld had bequeathed to her five hundred pounds a small amount but a fortune in the eyes of amabel she sat far into the night thinking out her plans invested the money svould bring in at the most 25 a year an amount svhich would make very little difference to her and she svas resolved to have a good time for once in her life to be young to enjoy herself to buy what she fancied to treat her jaded eye to nesv scenes to taste the ssveetness of continual change to surfeit herself svith plays and nesv novels and perhapstoo wonderful to dwell on except in passing to go to balls she was determined to make up to the best of her ability for those bleak years svhich lay behind her during which in

age of thirty is alsvays a bugbear to an unmarried woman why has never been explained since she should then be at the zenith of her looks and her svisdom but looks and wisdom dont alsvays mature

develop properly without some sunshine since then he had watched her development it ssas so rapid and so surprising that muriel did not want to talk about it her thin cheeks and attenuated figure had filled out her face had taken the delicate colour of a blossom her eyes had grosvn bright she rivalled her cousin in her capacity for enjoyment she seemed like a girl in her teens muriel began to feel

collection of short stories is that it is amazing so practised a hand should have wasted so many admirable suggestive and tortuous plots on little excursions when they might have served him for long exercises in taletelling in somo of the very shortest of these stories thore aro the elements of what was wont to bo called a threevolume novel but the  throedecker  in both services is become or is becoming a tiling of the past when ono reads farther however and especially when one has exhausted the budget we have only gratitude to utter for mr barrs delightful conduct of though entertainment ho writes with such verve and gusto his stylo is so frosh bright and occasionally quaint his practico as  luke sharp of the detroit free press has stood him in good stead his incidents are so neatly contrived and dovetailed and his portraiture in the thumbnail space is so careful and considerable that one is completely satisfied as after a good dinner carping is silenced and content reigns all the stories touch nearly or remotely on the subject of revenge sometimes in the spirit of comedy more often of tragedy and some of these latter are sufficiently gruesome more notably an alpine divorce and which was the murderer two florentine balconies  is also good of that genre but it is so full of suggestion that it must stand as one of those that demand fuller treatment for entire satisfaction but taking one consideration with another we prefer mr bar when he wears the comic mask over the stelvio pass is admirable  a deal on change is delightful but tho bromley gibberts story is the thing for our money it is excellent sport in the way of both character and situation for we know just such an editor as shorely of the weekly sponge and such an author as bromley gibberts and his whole game of getting the shifty and indeterminate editor to accept the story of the wholesale murder is in the most mirthful spirit of comedy  revenge i short stories  by robert barr chatto  i windusthe author

next election  and the sharp practice of druce the financier acquiesced in by his victim general sneed on the ground that old druce has the money and he can buy all the law he wants in new york are hardly exaggerated instances of the remarkable elasticity of certain institutions  and the teterrima causa of the latter story  a deal on change the social neglect of the millionaires daughterinlaw by the generals daughters is also very characteristic  the exposure of lord stansford  seems to owe a little to mr anstey and  an alpine divorce  may have been suggested by an  overtrue  tale of some years since  but on the whole the originality of these short pieces is on a par with the variety they display most are more than a little lurid in their colouring  the vengeance of the dead  having a strongly sulphureous tinge  but our own taste inclines to such lighter themes as out of thun in which the author uses his happy gift in describing the espuglerie of a coquettish but charming girl who

the batch the motive is in itself almost irredeemably unpleasing and the treatment it receives makes it revolting it may be said to produce almost physical sensations of dislike it is so base and creeping in kind what it has of cleverness is centrod in its power to produce this sensation it is a cleverness some people would be glad to dispense with if it cannot be turned into more desirable

like a bald police case with one or two imaginary details thrown in which only serve to destroy the feeling of reality without having any softening or palliating influence  a cruel mistress has a

sensitive and introspective temperament who failing as an actress hastily accepts an offer of marriage from a wealthy admirer hector vassal whose cold and ruthless character the author with a

conflict in every interest their ideas in every aspect of life and one day the inevitable happens the story is not to be told apart from the context but it may be said that the final development of the plot is a very clever and ingenious display of mechanism the psychology and soulstirrings of the scourgestick are not its strongest point the writing is too much in gasps dots and dashes take the

story of esther vrintz  ihe scourgestick by mrs campbell praed william heinemann mrs campbell praed has struck out in this volume into a vein new to her and fortunately for her readers she has produced a story of much more than her usual significance and power one cannot but shrink occasionally from the excessive morbidness of the book it deals with a girl of sensitive and introspective temperament who failing as an actress hastily accepts an offer of marriage from a wealthy admirer hector vassal whose cold and ruthless character the author with a motiflike persistence likens to the type of the roman emperors  agatha greste who had odd fancies used to say that he was a reincarnation of the roman period of course they are unhappytheir tastes conflict in every interest their ideas in every aspect of life and one day the inevitable happens the story is not to be told apart from the context but it may be said that the final development of the plot is a very clever and ingenious display of mechanism the psychology and soulstirrings of the scourgestick are not its strongest point the writing is too much in gasps dots and dashes take the place which under the old dispensation of feminine literature would have been filled by italics open the book at random and your eye lights on a paragraph like this  anythinganything butthat i should feel it was the offence against the

praed 6s heine mann  the little more and how much it is here it is not even a  little more but a great excess a wasted excess of almost excellent stuff the literary outpourings of a repressed and sentimental woman would be lengthy of course and readers could spare some time to get that particular impression concerning the heroine but we do not need to measure st peters inch by inch with a tapeline to guess its vastness  and the inexhaustibleness of a bore can be divined in five minutes mrs praed convinces us she is thinking and feeling deeply while we journey through her story of the scourgestick  in her company but she is never content to suggest she always drives an idea to death the book is an exasperating example of undoubted talent ill employed and genuine emotion ending in uncontrolled gush but it is interesting the heroine a woman of the artistic temperament after a stage failure hides her head in a marriage with a millionaire it is an unhappy marriage she seeks relief in literature and by this means gains the friendship and love of a publishers reader and her husbands enemya human being so gifted morally and mentally that had he been a womanand indeed his sex is

things touching things we have found on every page we have not skipped but life is short and we shall never turn back to find such as we have missed there is a group of interesting characters many of them well drawn but half of them unnecessary the best of those in the centre of the stage is mr vassal the millionaire who reminds all his sensitive acquaintances of the proud lustful days of the roman empire he has the advantage of not being over elaborated and of not being permitted to talk very much  the scourgestick new n0vel8 by mrs campbell praed heinemann nought made me eer go right but heavens scourgestick such is the moral of the history of esther vassal a careful and on the whole able study of character it has serious faults of style but it shows a considerable advance in the authors powers esther is a girl of strong artistic leanings who fails on the stage in an ambitious part too great for her inexperience in the reaction and face to face with poverty she accepts marriage at nineteen with a man of great wealth who really loves her so far aa he is capable of love but being an elderly sensualist of peculiar malignity produces such a revulsion of feeling on his wifes part as to upset her health and nearly destroy her reason in the depths she is counselled to try writing as a distraction her success is partly due to the heavenborn reader to a publisher and robert vassal her husbands detested nephew and heir by baleful fate developes from the impersonal counsellor into the inevitable lover who comes along as mr vassal says in about the seventh year of an uncongenial marriage these vassals have an flsschylean doom connected with their race and one of esthers morbid fancies is that the invisible embodiment of generations of hatred makes ever a third in her meetings with her husband or her lover it will be seen that the effectiveness of this scheme depends upon its handling and it is fair to say that in spite of the great prolixity of esthers introspections we never lose sight of the thread of development in her character or miss distinctness in the traits of robert the appreciative and ardent lover yet ever too laodicean to sin boldly of the sardonic but somewhat illused old voluptuary vassal of the literary doctor ever of lady cotherstone most trenchant of county leaders or of cosmo paravel the last thing in dilettanti dons the

have a certain continuity he has attempted to reproduce atmosphere it may be said without delay that northeast has achieved his end but another and to our mind a greater achievement is that he has succeeded in producing sentiment without sentimentality it is a matter of common knowledge that sentiment pervades primitive communities and affects even their roughest and most rugged members it is therefore not surprising that it should enter largely into these stories though the prevailing element in 4 bunch grass is humour mr vachell has given us some quaint characters from aletheabelle  the little  school  marm who quelled a mutiny among her unruly pupils by exhibiting to their astonished gaze a  rattler and then killing it for their moral and physical benefitto uncle jap who held an illuminating conversation with an oil millionaire enforcing his remarks with the aid of a revolver one or two of the tales as the author himself freely admits are obviously due to a prentice hand but the general level of the work is excellent the semidetachment of mr wrens stories in  dew and mildew is apt to be a little bewildering he seems to have hesitated between a novel and a collection of short stories and finally to have fallen between the two giving the novel if anything a slight preference the same characters appear practically throughout the book which has as a background a series of tragedies connected with suddendeath lodge humour and shrewd characterization of natives are mr wrens strong points and he can describe a fight with no little vigour but we tyre of his rather laboured satire of the ignorant mp who goes out to india on a brief visit and short storieseven semidetached onesare not a suitable medium for long discussions on education the author has createdor rather we should imagine drawn from lifetwo delightfully amusing children altogether it is a wellwritten interesting book which would have been vastly improved if mr wren had frankly made it a novel and deleted the excrescences it is always pleasant to adventure with mr roberts into natures fastnesses and in the feet of the furtive he is singularly happy  moreover we can as we read congratulate ourselves on gaining instructive information in a lively manner with surprising versatility the author tums from the adventures of a salmon to those of a bear attacked by wolves from those of an indian leopard escaped from a circus into the great northwest to those of a cheeky little chipmunk about all of them he writes with sympathy knowledge and not a little humour the story of the man shipwrecked naked and weaponless on a desert island and in spite of these drawbacks proving himself king of beasts is told with admirable raciness and vigour but there are no weaklings in mr robertos

antiquary arnold deserves high praise intentionally avoiding theories he is content to be an anecdotist and three of the seven stories presented in this volume are triumphs of anecdote so coherent and artistic that merely to read them is to memorise them sufficiently to tell them effectively without reference to the text only the best anecdotes have the excellence which dr james commands when he is

and his  casting of the runes  upon a hostile critic jeopardises the latters life in another masterly story judge jeffreys flashes on a case of murder a facetiousness which irresistibly reminds one of the judicial humorists of our day the portrait of jeffreys in high good humour dazzling in his frivolity is clever enough to impress even a mind made languid by indulgence in thrills masterly too is the exposure of a criminal archdeacon in  the stalls of barchester cathedral dr james has the art of inventing weird incidents one of his characters putting ahand under his pillow to get his watch encounters a hairy mouth another looking clairvoyantly through his table into the floor and thence downwards infinitely sees a form with a burnt human face clambering upwards with the  writhings of a wasp creeping out of a rotten apple our authors antiquarianism is used sparingly but well it would be natural to say a good word for a volume of essays provided with so much food for meditation and philosophical mirth as is contained in among the idolmakers williams  norgate and by pouring his ideas into the mould of the short story mr l p jacks further increases our obligation  for though by

though few seem able to offer it as a feast admirable is our authors study of the effect of shock and disappointment on the mind of an apparently perfectly balanced academic type and it is followed by a clever description of a reformers paradise in which those whom the world calls cranks make a bizarre display of their theories somewhat tantalising and misty at the climax is a little spiritual biography named  a psychologist among the saints this story and the last encourage the idea of a superhuman directing hand or of fate the belief that the popular magazine has secured the monopoly of the short story driving the artist to the more  legitimate  modes of expression is largely fallacious the superstitious dread of being classed as  raconteurs which assailed many meritorious writers

werner laurie is a more ambitious venture for he discards the gay trappings of the farceur and attempts serious observation upon life he is not entirely successful in this new r61e because his irrepressible gaiety bursts its bonds indifferent to congruity his quiet facetiousness and irony cling round him where the utmost artistic repression is required the majority of the stories are of tragic intent and many of them are highly ingenious in construction they are told with a sure instinct for a storys sequence and rhythm the mechanism is well oiled and the touch upon the levers is light and flexible mr pain is an epicure in  situations and ho manoeuvres them with much adroitness and dexterity his humour has intact all its sly elvish flavour but somehow the cumulative effect fails he lacks the inevitability the wizardry of the true artist the common things of life he cannot touch into life he flounders in the more familiar watersand inconsequently relapses into his old capers with a naive indiscretion delightful in itself but fatal to the purpose of his story his shortcomings in tragedy are obvious in spite of some shrewd characterization  short stories a tirle

galsworthy exposes his lack of originality with this story may be paired a clever tale called the pack in which the simious imitativeness shown in ragging and mobbing is cleverly illustrated two

power is chiefly felt another good story introduces a halfwitted worshipper of pan who plays delightfully on a leaf held to his lips on the low plane of the horrible mr blackwood attains a measure of success in the wendigo a tale of a flying monstrosity which inspires horror and obedience simultaneously in the terror of the twins a story of diabolic power lodged in idiocy and surviving death to commit a shocking crime mr blackwoods talent is misapplied taken altogether the sketches of which sea dog8 eveleigh nash is composed are no t worthy of mr morley roberts perhaps the subtitle a set of seacomedies hamiered him or again and more probably he was handicapped by an influence which exercises pernicious sway with only too many modern writers the need of subservience to the persistently and unnecessarily banal standards which the editors of popular magazines apply to fiction the author makes no attempt to be funny in the last sketch of the collection and this is the best of the seven in the first and longest there is a straining after what some admirer has called  w w jacobean effects and the result is disastrous  short stories i am linking these two volumes together for no better

one to read again there are thirtythree of them and only one that is not wholly worthy of its place the best of them are so brilliantly imagined or so sensitively human and of such subtle artistic quality that i doubt if any living english writer except kipling can show anything to surpass them the one that is not good is a vision of judgment this handles a big idea with a merely perky cleverness that would make one suspect it belonged to m1r wellss early lays if he lid not himself say it belongs to his later  a smaller man than mr wells would have spoilt the whole thing by being

B352,"['6172982', '5008917', '3161534']",  aurora leigh by elizabeth barrett browning chapman and hall we thank the authoress of aurora leigh for her christmas gift to usand with the less critical reserve because a book of purpose so noble and elevated bearing a name so known and honoured rather commands our welcome than demands our sentence for her who wrote the  romaunt of margaret and  lady geraldine the laurel crown baa long ago been woven what then can the charons of literature do when such come to his river but set them forthwith on their way to the elysian fields not that he who takes our poetess for guide will wander in elysian meadows or tread upon the asphodel her footsteps are on earth often in earths darkest and commonest ways her way lies through sorrows and battled efforts and useless hopes and yet perhaps he who reads  aurora leigh  as earnestly as  aurora leigh  was written may in some degree pass as did the florentine and his leader from the gloom of the inferno to the pleasant daylight of upper air the story of aurora leigh is not original in so far as love is not original nor heroic struggle nor disappointment nor death but it claims such merit in that the writer seems to draw her materials from a source open for such a purpose only to herthe records of her proper life if this be so much in the narrative which seems improbable may be simply true it is told like the tale of an jeschylean drama through the lips of some three or four speakers but its pauses are filled with a fullertoned chorus than the atheniansan underwail of human music with its strophe and antistrophe of suffering and hope the incidents of the book would have thrilled in a novelthe loftiness of the philosophy would have allured in a treatisetogether they compose a poem whose action criticism must allow to be as sustained as its scope is large and noble  aurora leigh the heroine inherits with the learning of her english father the warm blood of an italian mother and with such natal antecedents and some repression becomes naturally a poetess her neighbour and cousin romney leigh is a poet also but too practical for print by no means one who stands high upon the bank of theories observes the swimmers and criesvery fine but keeps dry linen equally rather a very earnest plunger into them and one bent upon setting a wrong world right by means of them  aurora counts up somewhat sarcastically his ends  to reform make trade a christian possibility and individual right no general wrong wipe out earths furrows of the  mine and  thine and leave our green for men to pluy at bowls with innings for them all at which  game it is needless to say that he must fail and does accordingly fail but  auroras  enthusiasm for art is at least as great as romneys for actionand between their keen intellects a fire is struck which lights up many a dark dialectic corner let those who care to follow such a light no ignis fatuus be it said turn to the volume they will find what  aurora has to say for the followers of her art thc only truthtellers now left to god thc only speakers of essential truth opposed to relative comparative and temporal truthsthe only holders by his sunskirts through constitutional grey glooms and how frequently she can praise her art itself o lifeo poetry which means life in lifecognizant of life beyond this bloodheat passionate for truth beyond these sensespoetry my life my eagle with both grappling feet still hot from zeus thunder who has ravished me away from all the shepherds sheep and dogs and set me in th olympian roar and round but om readers must believe that what we quote only excludes something worthier quotation the nine books are full of brilliant passages and they must wonder for themselves at the writers tide of thought running without an ebbat her affluence of ideas and opulence of illustrationgolden treasures these which never tempt her like atalantas apples to swerve from the straight course to the goal of her meaning yet sometimes it must be confessed this eagle of thoughtthough it be joves own bird sinks under ganymede hts flight is high still absolute truth sits higher but no tenderness can be more womanly and deep then aurora leighsif her philosophy reaches now and then short it cant be denied that she is a  bluebut then she wears her blue so chiefly in her eyes it comforts you cutirely for her fame and the reader will say as much with lady waldemar when the third book brings him to marian erle and her piteous history there the authoress with a womans right pleads against a womans wrong and we acknowledge many will with tealsthe righteousness of though indignation and the fitness of the compassion which storms or sighs through her passionate language our limit will not permit us to dwell upon this episodebut we make room for a remark upon a subject that will doubtless call forth many a one it is customary that virtuous women should preserve silence nay rather profess ignorance of that great sin whose innocent victim was the gentle marian erle through this coan veil of conclusion our authoress sternly strikes her hand she declares the protest of silence not loud enough to daunt the hand before the eyes not large enough to hide and she bids them flash forth with a light too intense for those sons of darkness to endure the subject is profoundly difficult and painful but it must be a timid and selfish prudery that could condemn the example of fearless ay and feminine boldness which the writer has in this respect not shrunk from setting we have touched but lightly on the plot and we cannot much dilate upon the purpose of the volume both deserve a separate and careful notice the conclusion that where we disavow being keeper to our brotherwere his cain is illogical but romneys efforts are generous if extravagant well intended if futile the keynote of the book is struck in the constant protest against his modern fashion by which we talk by aggregates and think by systemsand being used to face our evils in statistics are inclined to cap them with unreal remedies drawn out in haste on th other side o the itate these reformers say 1 have a pattern on my nail and i will carve the world new after it and  aurora is mainly right in reiterating that tis impossible to get at men excepting through their souls she exalts with great force the efficacy of art in such work in many a passage which presses for our mention we must leave the reader to learn how romneys failure marians fate and her lovers suffering teach aurora that art is much but love is more and the reader must for himself appreciate how splendidly and with what pathos the ninth book brings the volume to a close in a flow of unbroken beauty thus far we have not stinted our praise of this remarkable production justice and the dignity of our craft demand that we should find fault with the occasional extravagance of epithet and simile in which our authoress indulges it is harshespecially at this chilly seasonto blaine the general world for being a fullveined heaving doublebreasted age and she must forgive our wandering fancy for connecting with such a passage as the following the cruel yelhw morning pecked at her upou thc straw inside  the unavoidable idea of a hugeous  buff cochin china breakfasting voraciously we have baid that  aurora  is now and then indistinct and seems not only to  fly too high but to fly on sometimes with a tired wing in the story too there is an omission which seems unintentional and which the interest excited makes unpardonablean omission of any mention of marian eries subsequent fortunes we cannot help also saying that romney leigh acts throughout in very decided defiance to the adage which tells us its best to bc off with the old love before you get on with the new we present our readers with one or two final brilliancies taken with a hasty hand and of which the setting is frequently costlier than the gem the elegance of mrs brownings scholarship is conspicuous in the following  in the hollow by the stream the beechtrcc lcaneth downof which you said the bread in it hath a naiads heart and pines for waters beware of tragic masks we lie before

god shall help the workers for his world the singers shall have help of him not last certainly not lastin such a rollcall will be heard the name of her who gave us  aurora leigh in dismissing our subject we would linger especially on the fearless loyalty to her race and love of truth conspicuous in her writings her heroes if noble are all called noble for their nobleness mrs browning has long sat highest of her sisterhoodbut she may challenge a wider competition than that of one sex or age an irresistible comparison rises in our mind between the vague eolian vibrations of  maud and the

the fervour of the poets iheas not by a correctness of arraniminent mrs browning is less fanciful than felicia hemans less sweetly lyrical than eliza cook less emotional than l e l hlut she surpasses them each and all in the intellectual breadth of her poems thus her name is not familiar in our streets the balladsinger does not torture ter genius neither is she familiar by cottage firesides because to understand lher poems aright and especially her latest poem a certain amnunt of mental culture is required she does not in the absence of thought pile up glittering similes merely to catch the eve and which are as coldly beautiful as icespars with the sun shining on their bald tops write when and where she may she will always command intelligent readersl she may be accused of carelessness in the construction of her sentences and we are not disposed to defend her against the charge of mannerism but thete drawbacks are only occasional in her grand flights we can overlook incidental failings knowing as we do that the eagle which soars nearest to the sun is no less a royal bird because the tip of his pinion has been soiled in its contact with the earth that the highest convictions of life and art have entered into the composition of this new poem aurora leaqh there can be no doubt since every page shows the result rather than the process of thought the whole poem is wonderfully suggestive it takes up an ordinary subject of the day and in a poetical sensewe are not so sure about the philosophical sensemakes it extraordinary this is clearly not a poem for flippant readersnot a poem that any one for fashions sake may canter through it is not a fashionable rotten row of rhythm but the bold broad path leading tosome magnifieent cathedral in its every pagethereisalivingthought throbbinglikeapnl e life is always more serious thanthefool in hisfollv believes and this poem is life intensified its obvious pleasure and that which will make itself first of all felt is the story for this is charmin2ly varied and although it bristles with conceits and ethical crotchets yet it speaks a language which is absolutely universal the love which is purified by wanderings and sufferings comes honue at last like a wounded bird to its nest as did aurora and romney leighs every man and woman can understand that though not every reader will be able to divide the natural fronm the philosophic love so as to see that beneath the hard crust of the latter mrs browning is developing an important social truth scores of individuals who have no taste for statistics or unadorned facts will read this remarkable poem and thereby better understand the surgings of society the social volcanoes which strnigle in the very centre of english life first the enjoyment of the story will break upon them with a new rapture like morning then as they read more intensely for the storys sake they will perceive that romney and aurora leigh are types of distinctive endeavours to elevate the condition of humanityromney dealing with statistically packed disorders  in the body and aurora contending with the diseases of tie soul rhese converging actionsthe two cousins like their ideas have been moving in distant orbitscome home at last to reap the knowledge that it is idle if not wicked to expect too much from individual effort to give up much on each side then tawe all but the triumph of the poet of aurora is complete when at length romney in the luxury of requited love exclaims fewer systems we who are held and do not hold les mapning out of massea to be saved lisv nations or by sexes fouriers void and comte is dwarfedand cabet puerile subsists no law of life outside of life no p feet manners without chi intian seals the christ himself had been no lawgiver unless le had given the lifo too with the law late in the season of life but not too late these toilers in a noble causea cause made only slightly less noble by the impatience and fretfulnest of the poet and philanthropistare brought to see that all work for the regeneration of men is circumcribed by two circles the first circle is that which isgrandest broadest ftrd mostluminous and designated  gods love  the next is termed the love of wedded souls there certainly is poetic force if not human justice in afflicting lromney with blindneess in the sequelmade blind by the vulgar wretches whose condition he had eniployed his generous youth to ameliorate the situation is pathetic but it shows clearly the domination of that ideaauroras ideawhich sought to elevate the flesh by the elevation of soul aurora must gaze for romney now she must shine out for two and no less work for both it will be seen therefore that this poem has a design hut whether this design has been developed with philosophic regularity as it certainiv has been unfolded with poetic beauty is a question that every reader will answer for himself we have no hesitation in saying that no modern poem has so many passages of brilliant description if it were worth while to cite any passages unworthy the poem we should instance the feeble gossip in the church when romney is about as some respectable persons would say to make a fool of himself by marrying a seamstress but then romney is true to his principle of ihumnan equality our objection to this gossip is not that it is a fabrication and wholly untrue to life but that it is ill suited to the character and manner of the poem it cannot be looked upon as that true repose or artistic declension so often successfully applied by great poets just before the situation is strained towards its highest pitch it is rather like an indignity to the muse just as if an arabian steed of high mettle and proud action were compelled to bear the dishonour of panniers mrs brownings views on art are so elaborated form in fact so large a feature in this poem that they would require a long article either to support or refute them we therefore leave them to the quarterlies at the same time suggesting that they afford material for a very interesting paper our object is rather to give our readers some choice poetic portions of the poem if we retrace the story it will be in so brief a manner as to do no injustice to mrs browning by cheating her readers of an anticipated pleasure our object is to render the extracts still more interesting by showing them in their natural conjunctions first then this book is an autobigraphy written when aurora leigh was still  what men call young when she had not so far left the shores of life as not to hear  the intirmur of the outer infinite our first extract will lodge us on the threshold of auroras career it is full of wisdom anti truth too and for these so truthful words grim men should be tolerant of

another similar collection of tales to which they have ven the title of  rates and taxes the various narratives are held together by a little story the separate portions of which cornmence and finish the volume after the fashion of mr dickenss christmas numbers in the present instance we are introduced to the state of things at one time existing in  the united parishes of st barabbas and ananias the less which parishes though united in name were very disunited in spirit being in fact at constant feud how the new curate by his mild and benignant spirit effected a thorough reconciliation and a genuine union and how the rate and taxcollectors had weekly meetings at the  greyhound and told stories based on their personal experiences we must leave the reader to find out for himself we shall only inform him that the stories so told are five in number by five different authors and that they are all sufficiently entertaining to draw us on from page to page very agreeably to make comparisons between the different writers would be invidious and somewhat difficult as a strong family likeness is to be traced throughout all the tales are written in what we may describe as a rather  rapid style all have a little humour a little sentiment a little lovingkindness and the other usual ingredients of christmas literature and all are of proper length for indolent holiday reading the associated writers have reason to be satisfied with their performance mr ballantynes story of the lighthouse is a union of fiction and useful knowledge at the commencement we are introduced to the bell rock on the coast of forfarshire at a time early in the present century when it boasted no lighthouse and when ckers used to put off from shore after great storms to collect any merchandise or waifs and strays that might have been left there by the ships which so often went to ruin on its razorlike edges in the progress of the tale we have a dramatic description of the erection of the famous bell rock lighthouse by robert stevenson and woven with this grand undertaking is a story of love and adventure in which the doings of the pressgang during the war with revolutionary france and the fortunes at sea of the young hero of the fiction form principal features the style is a little conventional but the narrative is lively the characters talk easily and naturally and the picture of the dangers and difficulties attending the erection of the pharos is striking and vivid the admirers of hans christian andersen will rejoice in the ample collection of stories from his pen translated by dr dulcken under the title of  what the moon saw and other tales as andersen has probably a larger public in england and america than he possesses in his own country this version of the original productions will doubtless command a large sale for ourselves we cannot pretend to be among the worthy danes enthusiastic followers we do not deny his ability he has a good deal of invention and something of the northern quaintness of fancy runs through many of his conceptions but his simplicity seems to us not unfrequently to border on the puerile his imagination wants richness and he has a way of mixing up the real and the ideal which is simply confusing and unpleasant and indicates we conceive a defect in art his very enchantments have a depressing drab hue in them a certain quakerish misgiving seems to beset him in the midst of faery however he has hit the tastes of a very lage number of people and that is a fact not to be despised in the tales in the present volume called  what the moon saw we have an instance of the faults we have been noticing in andersens genius a young painter having left the country for the city to seek his fortune feels disconsolate and lonely but is comforted every night at his garret window by the brief visits of the moon the moon is so obliging as to talk to him and to tell him what he has seen on his travels for the danish moon is masculine and hence the tales anecdotes discourses or whatever they may be called which follow such a notion can only be saved from silliness by a tog and glowing imagination such as we do not here see much of what the moon has to say is simply humdrum there are no wings of poetry to lift us above the bare foolishness of the idea the ancient greeks could make a divine dream out of endymion and diana but andersen is not an ancient greek and his talking moon telling a young artist pretty stories about good little girls and worthy old maids and babies and editors is to our minds very much of a bore the longer stories however are better though wanting in fullness and force of colour much the same may be said of mr bayess illustrations they are thoroughly germanfanciful but with something ascetic in the fancy and executed in the favourite modem manner which delights il making all surfaces look the same and that like no real surface under heaven madame de chatelains 1 sedan chair and sir wilfreds seven flights is a collection of fairy tales and supernatural narratives clustered about one parent fiction with which all are slowly connected the sedan chair in question is a magic structure endured with powers simila to those of the wonderful carpet 1 in the arabian tale or the wishing caps in northern legends that is to say the owner has only to seat himself in it and to desire to be in a certain place and he is there in a moment when he wishes to return the sedan having disappeared immediately on  setting down he is to exclaim sedan appear and there it stands ready to do its masters bidding it has been constructed by a moorish astrologer and is the property of the successive heads of the old english family of the nevilles by whom it is preserved in a strange dunsky mansion at westminster the first possessor is sir wilfred neville a harumscarum fellow of queen elizabeths reign who uses it for visiting various parts of the world where he meets with a variety of strange adventures seven of these adventures form the subjects of the  seven flights  here related and an amusing set of tales they are madame de chatelain is not a very powerful or a very eloquent writer but her stories are agreeable and for light reading they will serve to while away a wintery hour alices adventures in wonderland is a delightful book for childrenor for the matter of that for grownup people provided they have wisdom and sympathy enough to enjoy a piece of downright hearty drollery and fanciful humour alice is a little girl who falls down a rabbithole into some strange subterranean region where she meets all kinds of odd people and things and goes through a world of marvellous adventures the style in which these things are related is admirable for its appearance of wondering belief as if the mind of the child were somehow transfused into the narrative and the book small as it is is crammed full of curious invention exquisite also are the illustrations fortytwo in number by mr tenniela most charming contrast in their grace delicacy finish  and airy fancy to the ugly phantasmagoria in which so many of the artists of the present day indulge balderscourt follows the fashion common with christmas books and is a concretion of small stories embedded in one large mass a christmas party is assembled at an old eliabethan mansion on the welsh borders and as the younger ones want something to excite them in the long evenings the elders relate or read diverse tales some of these have relation to matters of fact others are purely imaginary a few fairy tales being among the number the book is well written and fall of amusing matter while some very fair illustrations add to the attractiveness of the whole miss bowmans  boy pilgrims  is a book of which the object is the conveying of information on geography and history though it takes the form of a story two boys set out under the guardianship of a friend to visit the chief countries and cities of the east and thus we are introduced to acounts of 4gy syria palestine and other bible lands plenty of adventure seasons the less exciting parts of the narrative and for boys who like this mode of getting at facts the book is excellently adapted  fairy knowabit by  a l 0 er is one of those compounds of scientific fact with fairy fiction with which we have on other occasions expressed our disagreement it is thought that children like this sort of compound we greatly doubt it they like both the ingredients but not the mixture no child with a childs natural dowry of fancy despises a good fairy tale and no ordinarily intelligent child is disgusted with such elements of science as are fit for its comprehension when simplified and popularized but little boys and girls dont like being cajoled into a species of school lesson under pretence of reading a story of enchantment and we must say that all the useful knowledge fairies we have arer encountered are dreadful prigs with the bewitching trikus of their race completely taken out of them  a l  es  book however is a good one of its class it really contains a great deal of information  and if the young ones do not object to the maner of course we have nothing more to say mr rennes  featherland or how the birds lived at greelawn is a tale which will probably amuse children being all about birds and beasts who are made to talk in the manner of human beings the last book on our list fairy lend or recreation for the rising generation by the late thomas and jane hood their son and daughter is a second edition and therefore known to the

chambers ye christmas number of london society beetons christmas annual beeton comic newes christmas box it is difficult to say why the public taste should be supposed to evince a disposition about christmas time to peruse collections of somewhat trivial stories set for the most part in a more or less clever framework of more or less improbable circumstances the idea of a framework of some sort depending usually upon the occurrence of some incident which renders the relation of a series of tales not altogether unlikely is old enoughlas old as the arabian nights chaucer aud boccaccio adopted it and in our own dlay it was revived by mr dickens in one of the chapters of  pickwick the device we confess has always seemed to us a somewhat inartistic one it is raisemblable enough when the scone is laid in the east where the art of storytelling has been systematically cultivatel but we can hardly bring ourselves to imagine a party of english people when snowed up or upset or burnt out setting gravely to work to relate a string of stories to one another howbeit mr dickens set the example some years ago in his very clever seven poor travellers if we recollect right of giving the public as a christmas tieat a1 m1osaiic of stories ariained aftteir this timchonoured fashion afnd since then not only the journal which he hinmst if conducts but a host of others have annually produced  christmasnumbers in which the old pattern has been invariably with more or less important variations adhered to in some instances howeveras in some of the works before us  the framework is altogether dispensed with and the stories poetry c simply follow one another without any connec ting link while in more than one instance the collection is independent and does not forin a niumber of any periodical work  w e have now been so long accustomed to the appearance of these christmas stories that weas well probably as inot readershave formed some sort of theory as to what a christmas story should be like we expect something either fantastic touching or simply laughable something either hovering on the verge of the horrible or something which will go near to move us to tears or will quite shake our sides but somehow we hardly expect to be really frightened or seriously affected we want the ghost to be a placable ghost and the loves to be made happy and if the latter are unreal lovers so much the better the childlovers in one of mr dickenss stories were quite real enough for a christmas tale in fact the more childlike and pantomimic the whole thing is the better is it in oui opinion adapted to the season  the various collections before us a few only out of the many that have been published are as miscellaneous as their titles first comes the christmas number of all the year round a sequel to the very popular  mis lirripers lodgings  of last year here what we have called the framewoik is doubtless the mai attraction at the first sentence we recognise the handiwork of amr dickens and we are only too glad to welcome our old friend in one of his lighter moods and to be spared awhile the  podsnapperries  and other dry husks with which we have recently had to content ourselves the character of mrs lirriper the goodhearted lodginghousekeeper is doubtless well known to our readers and her more effective utterances have ere this become so familiar by the numerous extracts which have been given by our daily contemporaries that we deem it superfluoustoofferanyfurther specimensbhere suffice it to say that not a few of the characters and scenes described by the garrulous old lodging housekeeper bear mar s of the hand which gave us mrs gamp and mr micawber we may particularise the scene between majorjackman and the taxgatherer i i i i i i i i ii which as a piece of burlesque is excellent of the stories which ariso out of mrs lirripers visit to france we can hardly spea in terms of praise the first is too gh y another is dull and a third though cle brings back reminiscences of the fanoru ghostly mailcoach which carried though deadletters in pickwick the story of the poor relation is readable and suitable and that of the schoolboy though much too prolix is in its wild but somewhat picturesquo improbability by far the most seasonaake of the collection a bunch of keys the next work on our list aspires more we apprehend to the nature of a giftbook than a mere ephemeral production to be bought at a railwaystation and left in the carriage in form it is a handsome and wellgotup volume and the reface tells us that it arose from a desire on the part of halfadozen young writers that the good ol0 custom of christmas annuals should not die out altogether the editor is mr thomas hood the framework is contributed by mr t w robertson and the stories are written by messrs t archer w s gilbert t hood iv j prowse and clement scott mr robertson has bestowed more pains than are usual upo01 his part of the task andl has given uis a very

kindheinrted lighthousekeeper who gets theni to fish with a net the result of which is that they catch a  bunch of keys and the more intellectual lrother getting wet in the process ii put to bed and dreams a series of stories comwietel with the keys awaking subsequently ho is warmed with a good thrashing by his indignant parent who has come in search of him and we are left to infer he was happy ever afterwards it will be seen that mr robertson has travelled a good deal out of the beaten track in endeavouring to invent a novel setting for his stories the idea is we think successful for it shocks us less to conceive that a clever lad might lream stories than that half adozen casual acquaintances should all have tales ready to be told at a moments notice the great faiilt of most of the stories is that they ar x too tr agric only one of thernthat written by mfr gilbertat all approaches t what a christmas story should be like of the others threel are tatles of wild passion and the fourth is a regular conventional lovestory which might well form an episode in a threevoluime novel we must inot however neglect to mention with praise one of the moro passionate talesthat of mr prowse it is in our opinion wholly inappropriate to a light work like that before us being indeed 91e of the most painful sketched we over ruad but it shows very considerable power and we have little doubt that its author it ho can continue to draw such characters as that of makjor grant will ere long make a mark as a writer of fiction  tenants at will is the title of the christmas number of hamberss journal here the artifice consists in the author of the introduction being hoaxel by an old college friend who pretends that he is the secretary of a  society for the itpestablishment of the character of haunted houses and palms off upon him a number of ghoststories of no very great novelty of character the introduction is by far the ixiost amusing part of this collection that gorgeouslycovered and cleverlyillustrated magazine london society has also issued an extra christmas number containing no less than fourteen stories and poems we cannot say much for the merit of the letterpress but many of the illustrations are pretty and wellengraved and we hare no doubt that the stories some of which are by wellknown authors will be found sufficiently amusing by those less

native biography the true personality of the arab persian or central asiatic writer who has earned high distinction among eastern poets as it is to certify which of the detached pieces attributed to him are really his own and the case of omar khayyam of nishapur supplies no exception to the rule fortunately for the reputation of this particular bard there has risen at the present day a new generation of english orientalists distinguished by thoroughness of performance as well as fullness of promise who seem bent on giving us on his behalf something more than a patchwork portrait or such frontispiece to his writings as would satisfy the ordinary and unexacting western critic enlightened and encouraged on one side by the research of russian savants and on the other by though enterprise of american publishers they carry on their labours with a sober enthusiasm and quiet tenacity of purpose which cannot fail to bear good fruit so that almost before the close of the passing century we

recognise the more notable workers in a scantily peopled field in mr nathan haskell doles fairly exhaustive compilation the reader must not expect to find necessarily much new light or new matter it

hitherto been applied to them there is much of interest in the notes essays and reviews by which the anglicised or europeanized verse is accompanied but any analysis of papers mostly printed years ago would be manifestly out of place at the present time and we may content ourselves with congratulating the able compiler on the value of his reproductions and the uses he has made of them if we venture to take exception to the assertion that thanks to the attention bestowed upon his writings by modern european critics  old omar stands clearly outlined before our vision and that  if he should teappear in our day it would be as a leader of modern thought we do so under the impression that notwithstanding all that has been said and conjectured about him we have not yet attained to a full appreciation of his already published writings moreover the notion of his reappearance amongst us as a successful uptodate teacher implies a certain experience of the later world which could hardly be acquired by intuition and which even an omar khayyam could not afford to ignore the section described as  comparative versions of the rubaiyat constitutes fitzgerald a kind of fugleman to the corps of translatorsthat is to say his rendering of the supposed original leads the way and gives as it were the cue to others but as might have been anticipated the position is not maintained fitzgeralds genius was never trammelled by adherence to a rigid text and it soon becomes apparent that each expositor abandoning his imaginative and erratic leader follows out his own method of interpreting the persian manuscript in the order prescribed for this particular set of quatrains come nicolas mccarthy korney whinfield garner bodenstedt and graf von schnell elsewhere we search for and discover with

given to the retrospect of prof cowells labours more especially for republishing that eminent scholars contribution to vol xxx of the calcutta review it is pleasant to recall how favourable and yet well poised is the professors estimate of the author of the rubaiyat as shown in the following extract  we find some excuse for his errors if we remember though state of the world at that time his clear strong sense revolted from the prevailing mysticism where all the earnest spirits of the age found their refuge and his honest independence was equally shocked by the hypocrites who aped their fervour and enthusiasm and at that dark hour of mans history whither out of islam was the thoughtful mohammedan to repair  no missionarys step bringing good tidings had appeared on the mountains of persia  the few christians who might cross his path in his native land would only seem to him idolaterschristianity came before omar only in the form of the first crusade unless oriental chronology is hopelessly misleading in regard to local history this must indeed have been about the period in which omar khayyam flourished and it is probable that the crusaders made their victorious entry into jerusalem under godfrey de bouillon shortly before his death though we have no evidence to affirm that he took the same exalted view of christianity as his religious brother and predecessor albiruni who spoke of its tenets with an admiration quite exceptional in the case of a votary of islam he could for the occasion pray with his fellowmen not only outside the precincts of the mosque but without the aid of a mohammedan spiritual guide his pen thus bears testimony on the subject wanting the rose the thorn well might avail wanting the day i make dark night avail wanting praise prayer and sheikh prescribd by rule i make church bells and christian rite avail and now before closing our brief notice of mr doles compilation we may appropriately take note of some three or four rubaiyat significant

most sympathetic interpreters attempted to bring out an underlying christian spirit which is by no means quite occult or to be sought for only between the lines of his verse surely the two following quatrains taken from whinfields translation possess a sufficient flavour of christianity to acquit their author of any wholesale charge of irreligion or infidelity  whateer thou doest never grieve thy

left terrible memories ineffaceable scars on the country yet there is humour in most troubles if it be sought for and if the right temperament undertakes the seeking these comments have been inspired by a reading of the volume by anton tchekoff entitled the kiss it consists of fifteen short stories or sketches and they run as follows in their order a pleasant story of an officers visionary passion a tale of misplaced love a trial for murder a mass for the dead a sketch of a boy suffering from a diseased arm who runs away from hospital a fantasy of a mournful reedplayer of morbid tendencies a story of adultery and death another murder trial a note on a starving child two women discussing the possibility of killing their husbands a man driving his sick wife to hospital discovers that on the way his burden has become a corpse and himself dies frozen a story of hate a fairly pleasant interlude of a wealthy princess and her unscrupulous actions and a tale of peasant poverty and misery one we have omitted concerning a careless spendthrift and sponger who as a matter of course makes love in the wrong quarter taken at one sitting the effect of the whole bunch is simply suicidalone turns in desperation to some healthy english classic be it pickwick or pendennis for relief from the overwhelming depression the art of the writer is not disputed the very effect produced on the reader is sufficient testimony to his power the language is simple expressive clear to perfection and there are passages of description all too brief which reveal the russian landscapes the lowly cottages the interiors of the poor hovelhomes in a most vivid manner but in spite of the acknowledged skill and sincerity of these exponents of another literature there is an atmosphere about these stories and studies of the sad side of life which can never appeal to the englishman beyond a certain pointwhich can in fact repel him too united has been the chorus of praise it is fairly certain that many reviewers have taken their cue from the popular turn for russian art and gone into hypocritical ecstasies over these morbid tales with no critical restraint some few of them we can read with pleasure some no doubt are in their way little triumphs but it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in them to warrant the indiscriminate admiration which has been unleashed and that there are a dozen authors in england at the present moment whose gifts are as great and whose work is better worth examination it is well to study a foreign literature to translate it and to discover wherein its

translated by adeline lister kaye heinenann 68 of the nine stories contained in this volume two have already been translated iutk english the others are representative of chekhovs earliest productions as a writer of stories chekhov was virtually exempted from a period of apprenticeship his first sketches have almost everything in common with those of his maturity the humour is slightly less gentle and the characters harsher but the difference is nothing like that between his first plays and his triumph in the cherry orchard in the volume before us almost all the stories deal with village and country life and have therefore a distinct unity which is lacking in other selections from chekhovs fiction the longest tale which gives the book its title is the description of a little boysa midsummer journey across the steppe to the town where he is to begin his studies the apparently infinite distances of russia and her contemplative stoic peasantry are made to seem very distinct in this story we can almost smell the hot earth and we completely share little egors feelings as in the other stories there is no climax chekhov contents himself with describing the growth or the decline

wonderfully welldrawn character in lucius davoren of ferdinand sievewright in him we discover one of the most dangerous desperadoes of his classeducated accomplished pleasing in manner and personally well favoured in the prologue we find him in the far west an adventurer who scruples at nothing not even murder he afterwards appears on the field as a skilled musician and succeeds in decoying away from his guests house the victim and dupe of his polished villany again he figures as a thief and wouldbe parricide there were many episodes in this mans career that encircled him with a certain halo of romance which could not fail to draw on our sympathy and pity but he was not assigned too prominent a position although he was undoubtedly the pivot upon which the whole story worked  just as i am

her place she knew how to keep it it is in the culling of such a peculiar class of character although they abound almost everywhere that miss braddon proves herself so thorough a student of the

been considerably disappointed a our expectations nf its merits were not only grounded on mir own estimate of the authors distinguished talents but in some degree prejudiced in its favour by the flattering opinions of our contemporaries lt is however one of the disadvantages attendant on voluminous authorship that the talent displayed in a mans subsequent productions is too frequently measured bv the standard of his earlier works and positive merit is weighed by comparative investigation in this point of view the  red rover is far inferior to its predecessors from the same pen a it excels in power and originality the similar attempts of its authors literary rivals as a tale of the sea it possesses the same characteristics with the  pilot  in style and expression whilst the plot is totally divested of imagination or probability and the agents of the story are marked with less vivid individuality for our own parts we do not conceive the overllow of technicalities with which the style of the  american novelist is burthened to be either suitable or popular in a work of amusement to thc particular class from whom it is drawn it must be naturally highly attractive but these unfortunately form but a small portion of the  reading public and to twothirds of the remainder the peculiar excellencies of mr cooper are either unapparent or unappreciated wc have no objection to the occasional introduction of a seaman or the faithful delineation of a nautical scene as a relief to the less marked positions and personages of a novel but what we dissent from is the assumption of that character by the narrator throughout all his volumes the author before us is particularly fond ofjirit alluding to the intended or immediate motions of his vessel and then proceeding to particularise the peculiar and minute manteuvres for effecting the requisite movement now the lint is all that is requisite the second is unintelligible to one half of his readers and superfluous to all it is quite sufficient to inform us of the course or tacks of the ship in question without enumerating every sheet and block overhauling anti belaying by which this is effected it would appear very ridiculous if some of our medical authors instead of simply mentioning that their heroine had gracefully moved her head from left tu right should state  that she contracted by a gentle exertion the sternocleido mastoidieal muscle of the neck  that the coadylcs of the os occipitis slowly moved in their recipient cavities in the atlantean vertebra and her cranium was inclined in a lateral direction yet the bulk of readers would be as much at home in the one description as the other and perhaps more so in this however wc by no means wish to detract from the real talent displayed in mr coopers novels wc only conceive his technical descriptions to be often overdone and still more often out of place but we must come to the work before us the tale is laid some seventy years ago and the scene is as usual on the coast of north america where a ship of singular appearance and a suspicious character is represented as lying in the harbour of newport in rhode island the vessel is of course the ship of the red rover a pirate whose exploits have raised him high in the chronicles of buccaneering annalists and whose habits at least the current reports regarding them are thus detailed by a gossiping tailor of newport   and are the villains so bloodyminded that they are called ked    such is the title of their loader returned the worthy tailor who by this time was swelling willi the

yonder slaver that has been lying the week past the lord knows why in our outer harbour we are shortly after introduced to this redoubted personage under a masquerading dress which he frequently assumes throughout the progress of the story and at the same time to another character who takes the post of second importance in the novel this is young wilder a british officer dispatched as a spy

luxury appeared the frowning appendages of war the cabin in hilled lour of those dark cannon whose weight and number had been first to catch the attention of wilder notwithstanding they were placed in such close proximity to the articles of ease just enumerated it only needed a seamans eye to perceive that they stood ready for instant service and that five minutes of preparation would strip the place of all its tinsel and leave it a warm and well protected battery pistols sabres halfpikes boardingaxes and all the minor implements of marine warfare were arranged about the cabin in suth a manner as to aid in giving it an appearance of wild embellishment while at the same time each was convenient to the hand  around the mast was placed a stand of intekets and strong wooden bars that were evidently made ta fit in brackets on either side of the door sufficiently showed that the hulkhead might easily be converted into a barrier the entire arrangement proclaimed that the cabin was considered the citadel tit thc ship in support of this bitter opinion upicarcd a hatch which evidently communicated with the apartments of the inferior officers and which also opened a direct passage into the magazine these dispositions a little different from what he had been accustomed to see instantly struck the eye of wilder though leisure was not then given to reflect on their uses and objects a new set of characters are now introduced namely miss grayson her aunt and governess who are about embarking in another vessel for carolina of course young wilder falls in love at first sight with the heroine anti as he has learned the intention of the pirate to attack the ship in which she was to embark he employs every means in his power and very silly means they arvy to dissuade her lt

approved style of the historical novel with a dialogue between two soldier friends in the low countries two hundred years ago  who call each other comrade dash dowtn a plumed hat toss oft a stoup of wine and have a faroff memory in their deep grey eyes and for this reason because the vividness of the local colouring though safety in the application of it and the tinsel of the dummy royalties that crowd the canvas make a novel whose scene is remote in time and country the citadel of ignorant and shallow writers and though fools paradise of those vacuous gapers who must have blazonry and bunting even in what they read and so  i faith and  byre ladye  do duty for dialogue  and a surface of pomp and circumstance ostentation and affectation pass themselves off as the workings of human nature on that large class who have either never felt or never analysed their feelings but when an author who has some instinctive insight into though machinery of thc heart and who writes besides with that  easy grace and selfrestrained strength which is the sure token of a gentleman of culture and a man of the world selects a certain century to frame his picture in it is the picture and not the frame that we observe and his manipulation of accessories that are unfamiliar to us makes us either admire his skill the more or possibly regret that the strangeness of the surroundings distracts and distorts our view of the characters conspicuous instances of this are  romola and those novels of scott which are chiefly historical surely it is always in spite of and not because of their pecuharity that we praise those books and it is because in  sister louise an honest development of characters wrought with no little skill and delicacy outshines its setting of upholstering gorgeousness that we say it is a good book worth writing and worth reading an outline of the story is briefly this louise de la valliere and athenee de mortemar are two girls well born and straitly bred who become maids of honour at the court of the youthful and beautiful louis quatorze with the strictest propriety wre are told how they both of them ceased in any sense of the word to deserve that designation louise has a devoted lover the marquis de bragelone he of the faroff eyes athenee has a dashing admirer henri le blanc the brother of louise and these two gentlemen complicate themselves in fruitless rivalry with the king to whose attractions both ladies but for different reasons succumb each retiring at the close of his reignlouise to the selftormenting repentance of a convent where she dies and athenee to the seclusion of displacement and disgust where she passes from our view  and the widow scarron madame de maintenon reigns in her stead the person and character of the heroine louise are carefully and we should imagine truly drawn  soft blue eyes and tender quivering mouth delicate rather than regular of features a face of which the primrose is the type among flowers and the pearl among precious stones her figure was well formed and agile though hampered by a limp in afterlife rivals declared she was lame and denied she was beautiful but the very vehemence of their criticism offers its best contradiction    her nature was one of entire selfdevotion totally irrespective of self in striking contrast to her stands out the saucy and unscrupulous athenee who loves the king designedly and not because she cannot help it supplants her early friend jilts her first lover is worldly to the backbone and yet not without shallow qualms of temporary contrition nor without that intermittent breath of a better affection which blows hot and cold in so many shallow women there is great sameness in love affairs says this roue of twenty one man pleases more than another and that is all and so for a vantageground she marries the rich monsieur de montespan and keeps a line to hold her former lover weaving her net round the king all the while louise on the other hand is a tender and true woman all sensitiveness and selfabnegation  every sense and instinct of nature and romance held in thrall by youthful kinghood and worshipping with idolatry a thoroughly selfish man  simply because something must be offered up there is something very touching in the story of her love and how it slowly palls upon the king and how she falls from disappointment to despair till remorse and a broken heart beat themselves away in an ascetic infatuation and the king the petted and pampered the favourite of gods and men following his better instincts in trying to love her notwithstanding the boredom which grows upon him all the more because of her utter resignation of all her personality to him he too is painted with truth and not without force but there is an uneasiness about any character that is half fact and half fiction still it is work worthy of an artist to trace the course of such a love as his  whose gradations are slow and sure custom indifference weariness and neglect he is princely according to the popular idea of kinghood in magnificence in assumption of omnipotence in graceful treading on the necks of men  he wages battle under the eyes of ladies and in full dress but indeed it is not so difficult to draw something that will pass muster for a character if you put it on a pedestal saying  this is a great king and the millinery is a la louis quatorze to reveal what detail of plot there is would be hardly fair for there is very little and the book does not depend upon its plot and is all the more readable for the simplicity of it the description of the hunt is good or it would not have been written by the author of  katerfelto the conversations are terse and witty and smack very strongly of the french the opening scene in the low countries is superfluous  and the whole of the last book which is an enlargement on the penances of  louise de la misericorde might have been curtailed with advantage but even as it is the story is commendably short nor is there a weak sentence throughout nor one that jars upon the taste even the magnificence is not tawdrily described the book is natural notwithstanding its setting and is obviously written by a gentleman the sentences are occasionally very long but they never seem longwinded it is true that we meet with many familiar commonplaces in an elegant disguise and that many a harmless sentiment stalks by us with an unwonted dignity but it is none the less a pleasure and not a common one to meet with a story not very long and not very pretentious temperately and smoothly told where there is nothing of strain or vulgarity or rant no stilts and no crimes except adultery  no horrors and no vapours of course there is much that might be quarrelled with is it true as is here laid down that when a man and a woman carry a sorrow between them the man displays and the woman feels it the most  is it true that there is a sinking of the heart which never deceives and is surely followed by evil  it is rather that the shadow of the present throws itself back into the past but assertions like these not being written by one of the great masters of mental analysis are harmless enough and were possibly not intended as deliberate conclusions on the other hand the book abounds in aphorisms and epigrammatic bits of description here is one which if it is original is too good not to be quoted  the princess henriette was just enough of a stuart to see clearly the one side of a question to ignore the other and to defy the consequences of the whole a book that is short natural and interesting is worth reading,social_contra

B7926,['5419845'],  review of literature some account of the life and writings of lope felix de vega carpio by henry richard lord holland concludedfrom page87 tihe play which lord holland has selected as a specimen of lopes dramatic productions is called la estrella de sevilla his lordship points out as a particular merit the art with which the plot is conducted we subjoin a short sketch of it the king of castille is in love with estrella and to further his designs upon her confers many favours on her brother bustos tabera but both tabera and estrella entertain a preference for sancho ortiz who is desirous of marrying the young lady the king one day contrives to take out tabera with him in his coach and has instructed arias his favourite to make proposals to estrella these proposals she scornfully rejects but a bribe induces her attendant matilda to promise that the king shall at night be introduced into estrellas chamber in the beginning of the second act he is admitted into the house but has scarcely cntercd when tabera comes home and is much surprised at the absence of matilda and the darkness of the apartments he overhears matilda and the king and becoming alarmed at a mans voice jealous of his sisters honour and perplexed by the equivocal answers of the stranger he draws upon him the king to extricate himself from the danger declares his name but tabera galled and alarmed affects to disbelieve him in urging the impossibility of such an attempt from the king he contrivcs to upbraid him most bitterly for his base and dishonourable conduct he allows him however to escape but puts to death the female slave who procured him admittance the king returns to his palace and with great indignation relates his adventure to arias who stimulates him to revenge but the cause of his majestys animosity is so little creditable and the character of tabera is so popular that no pretext can be found for his execution arias suggests to the king the policy of instigating sancho ortiz who is a loyal and intrepid soldier to murder him the scene that ensues between the king and sancho contains in the original much passion and some strong sentiments the king persuades sancho to kill his enemy without however informing him of that enemys name except by a note which on the kings exit sancho is about to read when a letter is brought to him from estrella containing tender information the mos favourable to his hopes and declning her brother taberas readiness to conclude the nuptials without delay sancho is setting off delighted but suddenly remembering the kings command he stops to ascertain from his majestys note what man is to be dispatched he opens the scroll and reads the man sancho whonl you must kill is bustos tabera his excessive anguish at this discovery makes him half doubt the truth of it and he reads the fatal words repeatedly in hopes of finding some mistake  in this soliloquy which is very long observes lord holland  there is a great mix ture of natural passion misplaced wit aw  trivial conceit i should have inserted it but he begins by comparing in a metaphor of considerable length the vicissitudes of life to a particular game of cards with which 1 anu  probably my readers are unacquainted a  part of the speech is in the style of ovid  sancho is alternately a good lower and a loyal subject and with great impartiality devow nearly an equal number of verses to each amtiment he is at last however syed by the consideration that a king is responsible to god alone for his actions and that the only duty of a subject is to obey him he infcm also from these premises that the merit of wis obedience is enhanced if by executing the kings mandates he sacrifices his own affections and incurs the enmity of the person he loves best on earth he has just made up his mind to the murder when tabera enters sancho takes an opportunity of picking a quarrel and kills him a couple of alcaldes come in and apprehend the murderer meantime eatrella is dressing herself just as she has finished her toilette the body of her brother is brought in and the act concludes with her lamentations over it in the opening of the third act thc king is informed of sanchos behaviour that he has avowed the murder but refused to disclose the motives of it the king is struck with lis magnanimity but at the sampliec cmbarrmsssed by it  tell him he at length exclaims to arias  to de dare who instigated him to this crime though  it be the king himself tll hinm i am his friend i but that uniea he immediately explains his conduct he n tomorrow perish on a public  scaflold esrah en tcrs and after a speech which however poctically it may be conceived is neither well placed norhalipily cxecuted clainms a privilege sanctiured by the ancient spanish usages of deciding as nearest relation of the deceased the fate of her brothers murderer the king moved by her beauty and tcars has not force enough to resist her entreaties and in a speech full of hyperbolical compliruqnts on her charms presents hcr vaith a royal kejhich will admit her to the prison and sectirc to her the delivery of the prisoner she leaves the royal presencewith some ambiguous cxprcssions which the king construes into vows of revenge from the moment that he ceases to contemplate her features he condemns his own wcakncss and is penetrated with remorse in the dialogue between estrella and him there arc some very pretty verses but both the sentiments and expressions seem suitcd to a sonnet rtthcr than to a tragedy the next scene is a prison in which clarindo sanchos servant who is the gracioso of this piece gives sancho his reasons for not composing a poem on his misfortunes arias coming in delivers the kings message and sancho answers in ambiguous terms 1 let those whose o duty it is to speak speak my duty was to act  and i have acted when arias retiresclarindo and his master discuss the subject of honour and sanchos passion mixed witn his romantic notions very naturally persuades his setant that re is mad at length enters a lady veiled to wvhom in virtue of the kings order the prisoner is delivered she offers him liberty which he irefuses to accept unless she unveils herself she after some importunity consents and discovers herself to be estrella sancho struck with her love thinks some extravagant flight of generosity is requaiod of him and obstinately refuses to leave his prison after several witticisms on his conduct they separate both resolving to die one literally on a scaffold the other figuratively of love this scene where the situation seems to suggest some fine sentiments is in lord hlollands judgmnat the coldest and worst in theplay in the succming scenes the king stung with rcmorsc is nevertheless overruled by the sophistry of arias and consents to avail himself of sanchogenerosity by not acknowledging himself the criminal but at thc same time resolves to exert his influence with the judges to procure an accuittal of sancho ortiz or at least a mitigation i of the sentence which may enable him under pretence of banishnmcnt to reward sancho ortiz i for his fidelity the judges however to the kings great dismay come in with the sentence of death and excuse themselves to his majesty by appcalin to the nature of their office or rather to that of their wands which are the insignia of it the king unable to shake their integrity promises to marry estrella to a grandee of castile on condition that she shall withdraw the prosecution against the murderer to this she consents he king pronounces sanchos pardon but the judges loudly remonstrate against such a procceding and at length extort from the king the confession that the murder had been coinmitted at his instigation esticlla pressed by the kin to marry sancho acknowledges her lovf for him but cannot overcome hcr repugnance at seeing herbrothersmurderer at her bedand board and obstinately persists in her refusal this conduct produces an exclamation of wonder at the heroic qualities of the sevillians from all present except the gracioso who observes that to him they all appear mad  whether says lord holland  we agree  with him in this judgment or with the king who after promising to procure a great match for estrella compliments the author on the poem and thinks the subject worthy to be waitten on tablets of brass we cannot but acknowledge that there are many situations in the play truly tragic that it excites great interest in the perusal and is calculated to produce yet greater effect upon the stage of the plays in general lord holland ob serves that they do not admit of the distinction of tragedies and comedies according to the common or at least the french acccpt lion ot those terms fur the comcdes contain not only distressing situations and persons of high rank but even murders and the tragedies have some characters so low and dialogue so fumiliar that they scarcely can claim the title of even serious plays yet there is an evident difference both in the conception and in the execution of two distinct species of dramas in one the characters and incidents are intended to excite surprise and admiration in the other merriment occasiunally mixed with interest it is in the variety of his plots that his chief skill seems to consist and among the vast numbers that he invented i there is csaciy one which does not strongly fx ithe atteatioa the art of exciting curiosity land interesting the feelings was the great spell by which he enchanted the populace to whose taste for wonders he is accused of having sacrificed so much solid reputation on one occasion a spectator is said to have interfered with great anxiety for the protection of an unfortunate prin cess crying out against the cruel murderer who to all appearance was slaying an innocent lady after all these kind statements which we have gleanedfronthe candid biographer the merit of lope appears to us to have consisted rather in quantity than in quality he brought forth a vast number of foxes but very very seldom a lion        i so much for the spaniard let us now say a few words upou the merits of his editor the general style otf lord hollands prose is nervous clear and withoutony sacrifice of precision eloquent he does not rush into the common vice of biographers and commentatorsi wh6 extol their hero in terms the most cxttavagantly partial nis criticisms indeed are always candid and in our opinion almost every whcrejjust as far as general principles are in question but where the minutiae of natural feeling or dramatic ef sect are the subjects of discussion his remarks convey at least to our minds the idea that he has judged rather from a profound study of boks than from an accurate observation of men we will give an example or two itisareceived maxim among the spaniards both in real life and upon thestagethat love cannot exist without jealousy but in lopes plays jiatousy ofterexists without love which lord holland thinks very singular andhis lordship is yet more surprised that in some of those plays jealousy precedes and produces love for ha ctll k preposterous to suppose thata manmay excite lovein one woman by falling in love with another i norcan he conceive that love has ever more particles in it of pride than of tender ness does this argue strongly for lord hollands knowledge of the human heart  again he objects to epigranimatic dialogue on the stage as  more calculated for the cx prcession of wit than of passion but is wit to be excluded from the scene because an injudicious author may sometimes misapply it  if so comedy instead of making us laugh will make us sleep wit is certainly unseasonable in trragedy where the feelings are to be excited but there arefew itcidents truly comic that are much injured by the wit with which they are gemmed     44tbert4 he praisehe lamentation of ary queen of scots in lopes poem of the corona  tragica the passage is too long for

of poetical amateurs be able to discover any mighty magnifietuce in eight lines that amplify a thought as old as the waters themselves  the prettiest lines of which any mention is made and though not

grown and tall if not an adam at his birth he is no love at all having given this favourable specimen of lord hollands translation we may be allowed to advise our readers to search for no more such specimens if they do they will be heavily disappointed among other general observations at the beginning of the work he says that  to accomplish the chief objects of poetry the sersification must be smooth the language pure and impressive and the images just natural and appropriate our interest should be excited  by the nature of the subject and kept up  by the spirit of the narration if we judge the noble lord by his own rules we shall find him guilty without travelling beyond his own words the adaptation of the imagery the interenting nature of the sulject and the spirit of the narration which are three of the assistants that be requires for a poet are no concern of a translator if they are ill managed the translator incurs no blame except perhaps that of having selected an unfortunate exercise for his muse but the smoothness of the versification and the purity and impressite structure of the language are entirely in the hands of the translatorand here it is that lord holland conspicuously fails as to the versijlcation our dislike of it admits no exception but the stanzas last quoted we will give our readers ageneral idea of the rest of it two spanish lines which his lordship quotes he would probably in prose have thus translated if you allow me i compare to your ra y whatever the sea the air or the earth contajns but in verse lord holland thus transposes his

she rave esfr 0 sentence fraught with pain  my brother dead by sancho ortiz slain the rest of the dialogue is of a piece with these anty and indeed all the seen that lord holland has translated are done in such a style that if we had not been accquainted with his grave turn we should have thought he intended to burlesque the expression and versification of some of the rhyming tragedies that poor dryden used to write in a hurry when he wanted a dinner we will give examples 4lsoof the noble lords success in purity and impressive structure of language translating a passage where two of the characters are speaking of the style called cultismo or the polished style an affected metaphorical involved and obscure method of writing which was at one time gaining ground among the spanish authors he writes l a plain or polishd bard  s my styles polite l my secrets then remain with me to write s your secrets  why l because politely pennd theirmeaning sure nosoul can comprehend in the second line lord holland appears to us to have given a most happy exemplification of the obscure style which lope attacks for we were several minutes before we discovered what at last by the help of transposition we guessed that this line means remain then with me to write my secrets the following couplets which we have before quoted for another purpose afford a farthcr specimen of pure and impressive language be silent then while i the mode devise seeret but sure these brothers to chastise untroubled in my looks they shall not know what breeds the vengeance or whence comes the blow the participle untreubled agrees by the grammar with the pronoun they but it ought to agree for the sense with the pronoun 1 how would this read in a language where the grammatical agreement is pointed out by the inflex ion of cases  in latin for instance donec hosfratres poena afecerq rultu men imperturbati nescient c the idioms of language differ but the principles of grammar are immutable instead of  how sit my garments lord holland says how set my garments is it at this time of day that we must repeat the old distinction that to sit is a neuter verb but to set is active and signifies the causing to sit we have been accustomed to learn that smitten is the participle of the verb smite yet lord holland makes the participle smit in another place he revives the obsolete custom of saying writ in stead of written with all these errors and many more of which these are intended but as a sample the present work cannot but be considered as a most valuable acquisition to british literature there is no nation more ignorant than england of the affairs of its neighbours and a book which avoiding tedious detail gives a clear and general notion of the writings of a country so eminent as spain was once must be perused with pleasure acd remembered with profit by the cvtiqqs the literary and the learned we are informed that lord holland is engaged in preparing a life of his regretted friend and uncle mr fox we hope this information may not prove unfounded for though we do not flatter his lordship on his poetical attcmpts we entertain a strong hope that his prose composi tions willcontinueto increasethe reputationwhich he has sought and in many respects deservedly acquired from his life of lope de vega  horative,social_contra
