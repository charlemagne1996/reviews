B5780,"['3169788', '6799254']",  the washer of the ford the scottish highlander was never a complete convert to the christian faith not that he had doubts after accepting it unlike his lowland neighbour he has always been little of a theologian he is not given to forming little sects the wide fold of the catholic church has been good enough for him or if not that then in later days strong undiluted calvinism the narrative of the christian story the mysteries of the faith as distinguished from nice doctrinal subtleties and the ritual of the church have always appealed to him strongly from the first even christian morality made its way with peculiar ease among the wild people in certain directions in compensation for its total want of success in others but christianity never uprooted the older faiths had to settle down in fact side by side with them in the highland mind intermingling constantly and with such confusion that only the priest and maybe not even he could disentangle the real thing this is a truth constantly met with in all celtic saint lore in highland folklore and in the highland mind today when you reach it it is the truth which miss fiona macleod has illustrated by her  legendary moralities rhese are neither pagan nor christian they are both though more one than the other and recognised maybe as both by the early imagination in which they grew as she says  the washer of the ford might well have appeared to a single generation now as a terrible and sombre pagan goddess of death now as a symbolic figure in the new faith foreshadowing spiritual salvation and the mystery of resurrection quite apart from the beauty of the legends they are thus highlyinstructive as examples of the double working of the human mind almost any of the stories here would illustrate this but muime chriosd does it as well as any the name signifies the foster mother of christ and was given to st bridget of whom there are many legends and bits of legends in scotland and ireland possibly they will never be more faithfully toldthe faithfulness touching the grotesque as well as the poetical sidethan in miss macleods version bridget passed a mysteriously holy girlhood in iona in the druid days before the coming of st colum on a certain day she wandered far and came to where the heather was evermore withered and parched till it passed into reaches of desert sand with palmtrees then a voice reached her ear as out of a sleep that of her father livach talking in the good gaelic of the drought and the sufferings of man and beast round the village of bethlehem he tells her he must set off from their home at the inn and journey to the quenchless well on the mount of olives meanwhile she must give away no drop of water nor accomnmodate anyone in his absence but when days had passed there came to the inn a tired man and a woman soorm to be come a mother riding on an ass joseph a carpenter in arimatheaand mary his wife they too spoke the sweet gaelic of the isles and bridget saw something in the womans face that made her give them all the little water and ale left in the house and because they were weary she lodged them in the stable livach comes back and full of curiosity about his guests goes to the stable which is like  a shell filled with the fires of sunrise plushing open the door they see mary with the babe upon her knee then bridget took him in her arms covering him with her mantle so is she known as st bride of the mantle she nursed him all through the night and so too she is known as muime chriosd the fostermother of christ when she woke the holy company were gone but the power of miracle was on her she did wanderful things going out of the city she followed in the moonlight the footprints of a womnan and child all night she walked never weary yet never seeing any figures though the steps were newly made at last the stopped and she saw the lights of jerusalem but the wind stirring among the olives smelled of heather and rustled in the bracken the lights of the holy city faded she was on duni  iona lay green and gold isled in her blue waters from the sheiling of duvach her father rose a thin column of pale blue smoke but this rough version cannot give a fair idea of one of the most mysteriously beautiful and bold  the washer of the ford and other legendary moraliti by fiona macleod patrick geddes and colleagues renderings of the christian story as conceived by a people who after their dreamy fashion mingled the mount of olives with their own familiar hills and with the hills of heaven the  annirchoille  on the other hand is frankly pagan a story of reaction against the christian spirit of renunciation with passages of striking beauty it is nevertheless in form at least far less convincing i feel sure with the asstuance of ignorance that it has not the accent of its time true to the general spirit of revolt it may be against a faith that despises the bodys needs and joys but the telling is after the fashion of the pagans of this decade now just a trifle exaggerated and again finely swinburnian as in athals song fior i see this thing that the old gods are the gods that die not all else is a seeming a dream a madness a tide ever ebbing i wish i had room to speak at length of other things in the book of that wild tale of alternate madness and terror and exquisite peace in which the whole of death is portrayed  the washer of the ford of the shadow seers especially that one called  the smoothing of the hand  and of the passage in the fisher of men which speaks of the signs of change that the soul knows before the coming of death though pain have not spoken this book so far surpasses miss macleods earlier efforts that any uncertainty one might have had about the best direction of her great talents is gone entirely its superiority i feel sure lies in the fact that here she is in the region of pure poetry her former books dealt more with the drama of common life and i doubt if she realises how the people fed on such imaginative and spiritual food as makes the substance of her legends would act and speak in the stress of living there was a sweetness that cloyed in most of the earlier stories but here where it is the spirit and the dreams of the highlanders more than their outward life that are her themes she is on ground where few could come near her she knows her way about and with her certainty has come an enormous increase of artistic power a m  literature the celtic revival the washer of the ford and other legendary moralities by fiona macleod edin burgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss fiona macleod is a prominent figure in the celtic revival to some extent she may be said to have originated it to a large extent she has contributed to its success her books make us acquainted with the celt in his primitive and unsophisticated form this i believe is the fourth of them and excellent as its predecessors were it is unquestionably the best its superior merit is not due to any accident of subject or treatment it may well be the result of deeper knowledge of more real experience and of sympathies developed in a spiritual direction evidently a gael herself a celt of the celts miss macleod has felt her way through the celtic gloom and the comparative twilight which relieves it into the large atmosphere in which the celtic imagination is capable of great achievements the celtic gloom is miss macleods own phrase she uses it in the prologue addressed to mr george meredith in her third volume as expressing the prevailing note of celtic life such a note it unquestionably was in her pharaie a pathetic and beautiful story whioh to many an english reader was a revelation of things undreamed of before in highland life and character but there was a sadness in the air and on the sea a sadness which no tenderness of love could uplift from the hearts of the sorrowful actors in the story and its very beauty intensified its pathos one perceived the same prevailing note in the mountain lovers though in that book the joyous note of love that seeks and wins its own was a compensating presence here again was a lavish amount of beauty it was evident in the writing in the powerful nature sketches and in the conception of the two lovers and the triumph of their love but the fatalism of the celtic gloom lies like a shadow across ones recollection of even these brighter things the tales in miss macleods next volume the sineater were avowedly with one or two exceptions representative of the darker side of celtic feeling in power of treatment in the fierce imaginative realism of some of them and the profound depth of sadness or bitterness in others they bore fresh witness to the genius which by that time most of her critics recognised in miss macleods work but some of us still looked to her for a fuller revelation of the celt than she had yet given usa revelation of the glamour as well as the gloom in his life of the light that irradiated it as well as the shadow that enfolded it this fuller revelation we have in the present volume the distinction between this book and its predecessors is indicated in its title miss macleod called her previous writings romances and tales the contents of this book she describes as  legendary moralities therein lies the difference the free play of fancy in the tales left the domain of the moralities untouched the imagination in them was bold and brilliant but it exercised itself with possibilities in nature rather than with the spiritual side of human life there was an instinctive groping towards this spiritual side in pharais and the mountain lovers but the external condition was one of gloom and there was no clear irradiation from within here with a more subjective treatment we have spiritual perceptions and suggestions the titlepiece very aptly forms the threshold of the new departure for it links the old order and the new there is all the fierceness of the gael in it the passion of blood the gloom the fatalism but on the other side there is the mystery of the unseen world a mystery which is expressed in hope and reliance as well as in terror it is both a pagan and a christian mystery the bloodguilty and sinful souls who come up to the washer of the ford are cast into the water to remain there till they are white and then the washer plays upon them with her sword and makes white dust of them with her feet but the blind harper who comes with a song of peace is bidden to follow the bells of joy that were his tears and the song of the prayer that came out of his heart for him the washer of the ford is a mary magdalen and the ford is the river of peace the three moralities which immediately follow the titlepiecemuime chriosd the fisher of men and the last supper are the pearls of the volume ana in the present writers opinion are the finest things miss macleod has written muime chriosd the fostermother of christ is her rendering of the legend of st bride st bridget of the isles the legend is a vague and meagre suggestion of a mary of the gael who is held  in universal honour and reverence as second only to the virgin herself this the reader learns from miss macleods brief prefatory note apparently there is nothing else to be learnt save by some gift of insight into the bodiless and unvocal land of gaelic dream such a gift is peculiarly miss macleods own and this singularly beautiful story is one of the fruits of it among the christ myths which the inspired imaginations of many races have produced it is one of the loveliest miss macleods st bridget is a daughter of a druid princess and predestined to immortal honour brought in her childhood to iona her beauty and the spiritual charm about her work a magic to which the fair things in nature are ministers she has ecstatic visitations and experiences iona and her surroundings there are marvellously exchanged for the eastern bethlehem and the byre in which joseph of arimathea and mary rest for the night and it is bridget who receives the holy babe from his mother and knows him to be the prince of peace but to attempt to give in a few words an idea of this remarkable story of vision and dream of realised vision and embodied dreamis almost presumptuous as well might one make a picture of a rose and invite a lookeron to inhale its fragrance and feel the soft velvet of its leaves  the fisher of men and  the last supper  are alto christ myths scarcely less beautiful than muime chriosd and with a pathos in their beauty which is peculiar to themselves the christ in the first of them is the man of sorrows whose acquaintance with grief makes his sympathy so divinely human a weary presence in a shadowy glen there breathes from him a sweet assurance ci fellowship in travail from which any other weary and waiting soul may take comfort in the last supper the weariness of the christ is like a veil that falls away and leaves a face of joy revealed the supper in the huntsmans booth in the shadowy glen as seen by the child whose eyes iota kissed would be like enchantment if one did not feel it to be so absolutely real the master and his disciples are there and the disciples weave with their shuttles called beauty and wonder and mystery fair and wonderful shapes that go forth into the world to bless it trrlyit is a beautiful conception from this part of the book i take the only extract i can allow myself it is from  the fisher of men  god sends the gloom upon the cloud and there is rain god sends the gloom upon the hill and there is mist god sends the gloom upon the sun and there is winter it is god too sends the gloom upon the soul and there is change the swallow knows when to lift up her wing over against the shadow that creeps out of the north the wild swan knows when the smell of snow is behind the sun the salmon lone in the brown pool among the hills hears the deep sea and his tongue pants for salt and his fins quiver and he know that his time is come and that the sea calls    how then shall the soul not know when the change is nigh at last is it a less thing than a reed which sees the yellow birchgold adrift on the lake and the gown of the heather grow russet when the purple has passed into the sky and the white bogdown wave grey and tattered where the loneroid grows dark and pungent which sees and knows that the breath of the deathweaver at the pole is fast faring along the frozen norland peaks p it is more than a  reed it is more than a wild doe on the hills it is more than a swallow lifting her wing against the coming of the shadow it is more wan a swan drunken with the savour of the blue wine of the waves when the green arctic lawns are white and still it is more than these which has the son of god for brother and is clothed with light god doth not extinguish at the dark tomb what he hath litten in the dark womb i have left myself very little room for any mention of the other parts of the book though these remaining parts have their special claims to notice the three marvels of hyhy being another name for ionaare very suggestive glimpses of that early christianity of the isles the crudeness of which was tempered by the druid love of nature st columba is the central figure in these pieces and miss macleod gives us an impression of the militant sainthalf pagan and persecutor as well aa monk and priestwhioh is probably as true as any and is certainly picturesque and real but the straggle between the dying paganism of the lues and the new faith is nowhere so well shown as in  the annirchoille here we have the story of a young monk who enjoyed the favour of st colum he was an apt pupil but he had a comely person a young mans desires and the gift of song colum overheard him singing some amatory verses and doomed him to sackcloth and dust upon his head afterwards when the youth had again been heard singing of white hands and a honey mouth colum sent him to the monk molios who in the holy isle off arran had overcome hit own sinful lusts by mach mortification of the flesh under the guidance of molios young oathal developed so muck piety that the good monk thought him fit for martyrdom and proposed to send him to the isle of mist in the north where the pagans had lately flayed a monk alive but colum decided that cathal should live and should seek to win souls in arran and it was as he went to do this that he was smitten by the beauty of ardanna for her love he renounced his religion and for his sin molios caused him to be left to die in the hollow heart of a great oak and die he did but it waa to find himself a denizen of the elfland of the woods with an  annirehoilte a woodnymph for a fairy mate and all the green delights of the earth for his enjoyment the picture of these delights is one of the most charming mies macleod gives us let it not be supposed however that she has any designs against the christian faith it is not pantheism or any other paganism that she teaches but that largeness of faith and affection whioh has room for the human and the divine for the joy and beauty of life as well as for ita more solemn aspirations but this review must really end and i will trust that it has gone far enough to attract readers to a book which i am myself loth to lay down george cotterell,folklore

B1812,"['2696129', '8520482', '8689924', '2469660']",  tales of the teutonic lands by g w tuox aa and e h jones longman and co 2872 while many of our poets are turning for inspiration to the old medixval legends and knightly traditions mr cox is engaged in a far different task that of demonstrating the utterly untrustworthy character of our old national tales like the german critics of another school he endeavours to resolve every legend into its pristine elements and traces the rise of popular beliefs back to the emblematic sayings and oriental imagery of the pflmxeval aryan herdsman to question the doctrines of the school of comparative mythologists which is represented in england by professor max mfiller mr tylor mr baringgould and by mr cox himself is now as great a heresy as to doubt the common origin of the language of shakespeare and the language of the vedas or to deny that when moores lalla rookh was sungby moonlight in the persian tongue along the streets of ispahan it was merely a change from one dialect to another strikingly as the theory of the  solar  origin of myths is confirmed by every fresh discovery that is made we are yet inclined to think that m r c o x sometimes seems to carry it to excess and that many solar myths are capable of a much simpler interpretation we foresee also f o r t h e comparative mythologists an approaching conflict with the theologians in fact it is impossible to read such a work as the mythology of the aryan nations  without seeing how the theories and views therein laid down may be one day used in much the same way as the destructive criticisms of niebuhr the present volume is on the same plan as a former volume by the same authors  popular romances of the middle ages  as in that work the old tomes of sir thomas mallory were modernised and recast with a characteristic preface pointing out the singular similarity between the arthurian legend and other aryan lore so in the present case teutonic and scandinavian legends are retold of these the stories of the volsungs and the nibelungenlied are comparatively fresh to english readers the lay of gudrun and the  grettir saga  are known to the admirers of mr morris and the story of burnt njal has been already told by dr dasent but reading these stories anew by the light thrown on them in mr cox preface we find fresh matter of interest in tracing back the various incidents to their primitive form that the remarkable coincidences found in the tales in many instances are proof conclusive of a common origin can scarcely be doubted in the mythology of almost every nation we find the same episodes repeated take for example the tale of hugdietrich and hildeburg here we have the old story  a maiden living high up in a lone tower a prince to gain access to her disguising himself as a woman the child when born exposed in the woods carried off by a wolf and saved unknowingly by its grandfather in these episodes we see merely versions of  the old tales in which a maiden is shut up in a lonely tower and none can approach her except the knight who is destined to win her whether it be danae or rapunzel or the rose of the alhambra all precautions are in vain craft achieves what force vainly strives to accomplish and in the guise of the womanly theseus or achilleus or dionysos hugdietrich finds his way to the prison house of hildeburg where like odysseus he shows his skill in weaving the legend of the birth of his child is a travesty of the myths of cyrus romulus telephos and many others it is to be noticed however that the exposure and preservation of the child does not as in such cases as that of oedipus bring destruction on the parents if all these episodes are precisely similar it follows that the earliest version we can find will give us the key to the enigma and this mr cox has elsewhere found in the  solar myth  explanation which practically reduces every legend to a mere allegory of the successions of day and night thus the wellknown story of danae shut up in a brazen tower and visited by zeus in the form of a shower of gold is explained as an allegory of the sun pouring his bright golden rays upon the earth and bringing to light the hidden treasures of vegetation which lie hidden in her dark bosoma more poetical solution of the mysterious shower of gold than the matteroffact explanation of horace which seems almost as if objecting by anticipation to the modern viewaurum per medios ire satellites et perrumpere amat saxa potentius ictu fulmineo again we find in these stories the frequent recurrence of the posthumous child who revenges the death of his father or whose birth is the cause of the death of his mother in the first story which mr cox gives us volsung the son of rerir is like macduff from his mothers womb untimely rippd the explanation given of this that it is simply an allegory of  one day succeeding another though founded on many plausible grounds seems to us scarcely satisfactory the frequent recurrence of the fatal births are we think more symbolical of the little regard in which women were held in ancient times and we can quite understand how of some of the fierce heroes of antiquity it might well be said that their mothers had but little part in their birth and nature and that they drew their strength from the savage beasts that acted as their foster mothers we think too that too much stress is laid on the derivations of the old namesfor example the name astyages which is identified with azidahaka or zohak is considered to afford conclusive proof of the unhistorical character of the story for our own part we fail to see why a persian should not bear the name of the  biting snake as well as an indian should be termed the  bear  or the  wolf we can imagine centuries hence a future mythologist questioning the existence of the grosvenor family on the ground that their name gros veneur recalls the tradition of ierne the hunter that in many instances the comparative mythologists have succeeded in explaining the grotesque and often repulsive features of the old legends we freely admit and we perfectly agree in many cases with the interpretations which trace them back to allegories of the succes sion of day and night our aryan forefathers in the remote distance of countless ages may well have deified the powers of nature to the savage the roar of the water fall the sound of the night winds moaning through the forests may well have been the voices of the gods in the early stage when man seeks theological  expla nations for natural processes we can clearly see howv the sun and moon the snow and frost the wind and vapour which we now recognise as merely fulfilling his word were to the mind of our simple and untutored forefathers guided by supreme deities each to be feared and adored and so when the fierce rays of an eastern sun drank up the cool dews wlhich overspread the face of the earth we can easily see how from the saying the sungod has destroyed the goddess of the dew was developed such a legend as that of apollo and daphne but still we think that the presence of human feelings and sympathies in popular legends has scarcely received sufficient consideration grotesque and repulsive as many of them are we can plainly trace ideas of a conflict between moral light and moral darkness of human feelings underlying the whole it may be that the tale of orpheus and eurydice can be interpreted as a solar myth the journey of orpheus in search of his lost bride tells also of the love that conquers death and the myths of the sungod trampling the night under his feet symbolise that future triumph of good over evil to which all creeds all nations alike look forward as regards the mode in which these legends are told we must give great credit both to mr cox and mr e h jones though we are at a loss to understand why the latter chooses to write yarl instead of jarl that the wild scandinavian legends lose nothing in their new dress may be seen by comparingsay the legend of baldur and the death of njal and bergthora with the corre sponding versions in mallets  northern antiquities a book which was always a great favourite of ours we can recommend teutonic tales to all classes of readers as being a volume full of the most exciting adventures of curious legend and of old tradition a volume which will serve to interest and amuse the most idle reader and may form an almost inexhaustible storehouse of reflection and study to the more thoughtful student  tales of the teutonic lands tales of the teutonic lands by george w cox ma and eustace hinton jones authors ofpopular romances of the middle ages longmans students of mythology will not complain and they who read only for amusement will be glad at the issuing of another quite popular volume by such a master in the science of comparative mythology as mr cox in the  popular romances of the middle ages he and his skilful fellowworkman mr e h jones drew chiefly upon the arthurian cycle of legends and other old tales that were popular with our english forefathers for illustrations of the way in which various portions of the great body of aryan mythology have been nationalised and localised their purpose thoroughly accomplished being to give the pith of the original stories in a form that would furnish a true idea of their mediaeval shape and at the same time make easy the apprehension of their relation to the sources from which they sprang the same process has been adopted by the same compilers in the volume before us which ought to be even more welcome than its predecessor to many readers because most of the stories told in it are less familiar in this country than those told in the other nearly all the condensed translations are by mr jones and include the stories of the volsungs the nibelung story the gudrun lay and the tales of fri th j of and ingebjorg of grettir though strong of gunnlaug and the fair helga and of burnt njal mr cox contributes only versions of the stories of walter of aquitaine and hugdietrich and hildeburg but his introduction though much shorter than we should like it to be gives an interesting analysis of the mythological import of all the stories and helps to prove the wholly mythical character of the vast mass of popular tradition j the study of such traditions in such a way as mr cox adopts and suggests as he truly says  throws a fresh light on the history of the human mind and invests these stories with a deeper nay with an imperishable interest and if comparative mythology while it explains the growth of papular stories shows that their growth was inevitable and that it implies no corruption of the human intellect and no debasement of human affections it will do a work the importance of which can scarcely be exaggerated it will show that the multiplication of these myths was a necessary phase of the education of the world and will impart to the epic narratives into which they have developed a higher and more abiding charm it is hardly necessary that we should review this book at any length ox the versions of the old teutonic stories it is enough to say that they are very carefully and very well translated of the introduction we are bound to say that il is too short to contain much new criticism and perhaps too short properly to inform readers not already instructed in comparative mythology concerning mr coxs views but it is very interesting and suggestive this paragraph concerning the volsung story of fafnir and begin will show how mr cox connects teutonic myths with the myths of other races that like the teutonic race may be referred back to the aryan source and how he finds in all a subtle meaning that is none the less charming because it may not b3 altogether within the region of proof as in the arthur story no sooner are the adventures of one hero ended than another starts up to do the same things over aain or the same series of exploits is being achieved by two or more knights at the same time but the main point to be noticed is that the objects of their career and the mode in which they seek to attain them are always the same and in most cases tell their own tale with a clearness which it is impossible to misapprehend the story of sigmund is in its main features the story of the son who avenges him and sigurds victory is won only with the sword which odin himself had shattered in his fathers hand it is the myth of theseus or of perseus or of many another hero of more southern lands but the myth has been modified to suit the harsher climates of northern europe in both it is the uncouth smith of the gods who forges the weapon by which the solar hero is to smite the dragon or worm of darkness and cold and fafnir answers probably in name as well as in character to the delphian python but there is a hatred between begin and fafnir which we do not find between hephaistos and python the northern myth drew a distinction between the gigantic hrimthursar the powers of frost or the deadly worm which does their work and the dwarfs who like regin represent the wonderful properties of the mineral and vegetable kingdoms the capacity for growth and energy locked up under the surface of the earth hence from begin comes the command which charges sigurd to slay his kinsman fafnir and thus to end their quarrel for the treasures which fafnir had contrived to get into his own keeping the mode by which this antagonism was brought about is among the most significant features of the legend the treasures are the ransom by which odin loki and hahnir the gods of the bright heaven are compelled to purchase their freedom from the sons of reidmar whose brother the otter they have slain by way of atonement they are not only to fill the otters skin with gold but so to cover it with gold that not a white hair upon it shall remain visible  in other words they are to set the earth free from its fetters of ice and so to spread over it the golden sunshine that not a single streak of snow shall be seen npon it they who take up these  tales of the teutonic lands merely for amusement will find the volume as amusing as they could desire more serious readers will find in it an excellent supplement to mr coxs very learned and very attractive treatise on the mythology of the aryan nations e  tales of the teutonic lands by george w cox ma and eustace hinton jones longmans  co we cordially welcome the new volume of popular romancesfor which we are indebted to mr cox and mr hinton jones they are doing right good service in making attractive to every eye the grand old stories which in their original shape are too often treated with indifference and sometimes even inspire repugnance more captivating in shape and style than mr ludlows useful work on  popular epics their volumes ought to find favour with the widening circle of readers who appreciate and enjoy the fiction of antiquity inexpressibly grateful should we be to them and to all workers in similar fields if we could reasonably hope that their efforts would result in a preference being given by the general public to the masterpieces of the past over the puerilities of the presentif we could look forward to a golden time in which our young men and women will reserve their enthusiasm for genuine art setting their faces against impostors of every kind but more especially against such twaddle as is now incessantly shaping itself into three volumes and assuming the name of a novel the present volume commences with the stories of the volsungs followed by the nibelung story to which they gave rise and the legend of walter of aquitaine into which it in its turn was resolved then comes the story of hugdietrich and hildeburg  another version of the tales in which a maiden is shut up in a lonely tower and none can approach her except the knight who is destined to win her this is followed by the gudrun lay that record of the fortunes of one of the fearless maidens who are born to be the cause of strife and warfare and who after long suffering and shameful toil are raised to the glory which is their birthright next in order is the story of frithiof and ingebjorg the tale of the godlike hero whom an unwitting offence compels to wander as an exile over land and sea achieving mighty exploits but ever longing to see once more the maiden from whom he has been parted till the time comes when his crime has been expiated and he wins her as his bride the rest of the volume is devoted to three icelandic tales first among them comes that of grettir the strong with its ghastly vampire horrors and its groups of heroic forms struggling in mortal combat then the story of gunnlaugs adventures in london streets and elsewhere and of helgas lifelong sorrow for his death and lastly the tale of the burning of nj al and his household that lurid picture of wild northern life in the introduction which mr cox has prefixed to these stories their principal characteristics and mutual relations are excellently described and it is remarkable for the modem tion and good sense he displays in it while applying and defending his favourite theory there is comparatively speaking very little in it to excite the ire of the numerous objectors to that solar myth which like the justice of aristides has been rendered unpopular by repeated mention there is much in it which must elicit the full acquiescence of all who have conscientiously explored the borderland between history and fable commencing with some remarks on the recurrence of myths in popular traditions mr cox proceeds to estimate the relative values of the historical and mythical elements in legendary lore we quite agree with him in the conclusion he draws with reference to this subject that  we cannot dig out history from quarries in which history and myth may be mingled together and that the attempt to dig it out will be rewarded by the discovery of something which may look like bones but which we cannot even piece into the skeleton that once upheld a living form as fully are we of his opinion in what he says about the pseudohistorical names in the volsung and nibelung tales every one knows that the heroes of the nibelungenlied have been  mixed up with historical persons of the fourth fifth and sixth centuries  but it is equally well known that they are often mere reflexes of older forms their words frequently are but echoes of earlier utterances if the historical persons of whom mention has been madesiegbert king of austrasia and gundicarius king of burgundy and attila the hun  have no connexion with the heroes of the edda whose names offer so striking a resemblance to theirs they evidently can have but little with those who figure in the nibelungenlied and the natural inference to be drawn from this would seem to be that it is extremely dangerous to attribute an historical basis to a popular tale merely because the names which occur in it are historical but an inference of a very different kind has been drawn from the facts which we have stated by prof mahaffy in his  prolegomena to ancient history according to him the fact that the names of the heroes of the nibelung story not only  appear to correspond to those of the edda but also correspond just as closely to historical personages who lived after the edda was known and referred to in literature proves that  there is an historical basis for this later poem and that therefore all the explanations of the nibelungenlied proposed by the comparative mythologists are false and delusive the extraordinary piece of reasoning by which prof mahaffy arrives at this result is quoted at length by mr cox who then takes the almost unnecessary trouble to refute it controversialists have often been warned against relying on illustrations of their arguments prof mahaffys reasoning was up to a certain point conducted not without skill and the grounds on which it relied were sufficiently sound but the illustration in which it culminated was as dangerous to its maintenance as is too often the final card to a childs pasteboard edifice we utterly refuse to believe in prof mahaffys  historical basis  of the nibelungenlied to identify the actual attila with the fictitious etzel but if he had confined himself to the remarks which in his prolegomena preceded his unhappy illustration we should have found many points on which to agree with him in what he has said about the preference to be given in some cases of mythexplanation to the meteorological over the solar theory we are to a considerable extent of his opinion but no great stress is laid in the volume now before us on myths and their interpretation except in the introduction no attempt is made to prove the solar character of any of the heroes who figure on the stage the stories are left to produce their own effect and we are enabled to gaze upon the pictures they call up before the minds eye without being constantly recalled by coldblooded footnotes from enjoyment to criticism there is a strong human interest in these tales especially in those of which the scene is laid in iceland of which most readers would be loth to be deprived even although they were tendered in exchange any amount of cosmical allegory the science of comparative mythology is to its devotees seductive and engrossing in the extreme but for the world at large it is not likely to possess the interest which attaches itself to stories based on such inexhaustible themes afforded by the adventures of brave men the loves of fair women  tale of the teutonic lands by g w cox ma and e h jonzs london lougmans mr cox continues his work in translating or supervising while another translates the myths of the aryan races into modern english narratives illuminated by modern germanenglish scholarship i use the last words designedly because we are all aware that mr cox derives his special inspiration in the work to which he has so zealously applied himself from the individual teaching of an illustrious german scholar who is an english professor and who first let offif one may say so and with vast effect the conclusions of scientific philology among the ranks of the english learned and unlearned public the force of the impact upon mr cox is unexhausted and he has moved in one line ever since if some students have thought that in applying and developing in reference to the whole system and to all the various systems of the aryan epics romances and fables the law of the solar origin of myths as propounded by professor mix mailerif some have thought that in the execution of this task mr cox has shown a somewhat inelastic spirit no one will charge him with having shown an indolent one a little more play of humour and imagination might not perhaps have been without its fruit even upon the mode of exercise of his scholarship for there is i suppose it may be safely said as little doubt of the truth of the law of solar origin as a positive discovery in the science of religion and language as there is doubt that mr cox has pushed that law too far and tried to unlock with it doors of which it is not the key granting the independent and exclusive solar origin of some primitive myths common to the rc and granting the tendency of other history and legend having its origin in fact to mythicise and arrange itself according to the solar model and so conform to the solar scheme of narrative it is obvious that the nicest discrimination and play of instinct as well as a learning far more extended and a sfing far more thorough than one generation can bring to bear upon the matter will be neededlbefore scholars can part the solar from the nonsolar elements of fable and tell in which lock the key of that particular discovery will turn and in which it will not in mr coxs zeal there would thus seem to have been not enough of patience as well as not enough of humour and elasticity comic journalists have not been slow to point out the latter deficiencies and to show for instance how the facts of napoleons story with his birth from an island of the sea hisdivorce from his first bride his triumphant midcareer his downgoing after wideblazing battle into another island of the western sea is at least as solar in its complexion and details as many of those which mr coxs method explains away out of the field of fact altogether the comic journalist having exhausted this point of view the lover of scholarship may still i think remonstrate against the want of patience understanding patience in quite a different sense from industry with which mr cox has proceeded to try his key in all locks it is true that he does not ignore the contentions of those who criticise him and that in his present volume replying to writers who have evidently exaggerated from the other side he makes much more allowance than he has hitherto seemed willing to make for historical elements falling into the mythical mould but he does not show himself prepared to make much for the play of the inventive faney outside of solar traditions nor yet for elements of mythology and fable imported from nonaryan races theniebelungen lied and the scandinaviancycles the sagas of the volsungs of grettir of frithiof of gudrun and of njal are those with which the new volume is occupied several of these are in the possession of the english reader in literary forms than which nothing better is to be desired and that brings us to another point of criticism against mr cox and his method it is not the most successful method from the literary point of view while xr coxs tales of the greek gods and heroes are assuredly preferable from all points of view to lempriare and his mediaval tales in a less degree of comparison better and more scholarly than a book like mr ludlows  popular epics they neither of them represent the proper and final form which these things ought to wear either for children or their elders they break i think a law of literature literature demands that the faculties of criticism and the faculties of imagination should be addressed separately mr coxs method of telling stories has tried to address them both together it tried to keep the narrative interest of the stories and at the same time to couch them in phrases that shall continually keep the solar origin of them before the mind and make you remember that you are hearing not of people that lived but of the sun the dawn the noon evening and sunset it tries this and it fails the story becomes tedious thus semitransparently clothed in a terminology of the atmospheric phenomena the question of original signification and the question of narrative interest ought i repeat to be kept apart the modes by which we ought to possess these ancient cycles for our modern uses are two eitherthat of exact and faithful translation3 without criticalafterthought from each inone or another of its ancient forms or else by poetical and sympathetic revivification in the ancient spirit alile without afterthought as in the work of mr morris thoselmodes for them in their live use for our ig t the most rigorous methods of philo l ogical analysis in they description and classification for our uderstanding the one when we want to enjoy themthe other when we want to know about them but not the two together not though to say so seems ungrateful to the learning and toil of one of the most zealous and ingenious of workers this union by which a somewhat premature science is yoked to a somewhat disenchanted poetry and that grumble over it is fair to say that in these condensations by mr cox and mr jones of the teutonic major and minor epics and sagas the anatomy is much less displayed the solar terminology very much less brought into view than in former ones of the hellenic cycle,folklore

we shall select two or three of these irish legends the first is entitled the lrg end of bottlehill come listen to a tale of times of old come listen to me it was in the good days when the little people most impudently called fairies were more frequently seen than they are in these unbelieving times that a farmer named mlick purcell rented a few acres of barren around in the neighbourlhood of the once celebrated preceptory of mourne situated about three miles from mallow and thirteen from  the beautiful city called cork mick had a wife and family they all did what they could and that was but little for the poor mans had no child grown up big enough to help him iii his work and all the poor woman could do was to mind the children and to milk the one cow and to boil the potatoes and carry the eggs to market to mallow but with all they could do twas hard enough on them to pay the rent well they did manacre it for a good while but at last came a bad year and the little grain of oats was all spoiled and the chickens died of the pip and the pi got the measlesshe was sold in m1allow and brought almost nothing and poor miick found that he hadnt enough to half pay his rent and two gales were due why then mlolly says lie  what 11 we do v  wisha then mavournene wlhat would you do but take the cow to the fair of cork and sell her says she and monday is fair day and so you must go tomorrow that the poor beast may be rested agaim the fair and what 11 we do when she s gone says mick sorrowfully  never a know i know lick but sure god wont leave us without him mick and you know bow good he was to us when poor little billy was sick and we had nothingr at all for him to take that good doctor gentlemen at ballydahin come riding and asking for a drink of milk and how he gave us two shillinos and how he sent the things and the bottles for the child and gave me my breakfast when i went over to ask a question so he did and how lhe came to see billy and never left off his goodness till he was quite well  oh you are always that way molly and i believe you are right after all so i wont be sorry for selling the cow but ill go tomorrow and you must put a needle and thread  rough my coat tor you know  tis ripped wider the arn molly told himi he shouldl have every th1inhg righlit and about twelve oclock next dav he left her getting a charge not to sell his cowv except for the higlles penny mick promised to nliud it and went his way along the road he drove his cow slowly through the little stream which crosses it and rtins under the old walls of mlourne as he passel lie

mick  he cant belong to this earth but swhere is the cow  she too was gone and iick went homeward muttering prayers and bolling fast the bottle and what would i do if it broke thought hie  oh  but i 11 take care of that  so he put it into his bosom and went on anxious to prove his bottle and loubting of the reception he should meet from his wife lbalancing his anxieties wvith his expectation his fears wviti his hopes he reached home in the evenina and surprised his wife sitting over the turf fire in the big chimney oh mick are you come back sure you werent at cork all the way w that has

now molly says mlick  cant you hearken to reason didnt i tell you how the old man or wh0jatsoever he  was nmet me no did not meet me neither hut he was thlere with meon the lig hill and how he tnmae me sell him the cow and told me the  hxotte was the only thing for me  yys indeed the only thing for you you fool i said molly seizing the biottle to url it at her poor husbands head but mlick eaught it a quietl for hie ininded the old i inwas adviice loosened lis wifes gsp aud i the bottle again in his bosom poor placed tle bottle arain in him bosom poor lolly sat down crying while mick told her his story with many a crossing and blessing between him and harm his wife could not hell believing him particularly as she had as much faith in fairies as she had in the priest who indeed never liscouraged her belief in the fairies may be he didnt know she believed in them and may be he believed them himself she got up however without saying one word and began to sweep thfe earthen floor with a bunch of heath then she tilied up every thing and put out the long table and spread the clean cloth for she had only one upon it anl alick placing the bottle on the ground looked at it and said bottle do your duty  l look thiere  look there marnmy  sail his chubby eldest son a loy about five years old look there  look there  and he sprung to his mothers side as two tiny3 little fellows rose like liglht froin the bottle and in an instant covered the table with dishes and plates of gold and silver full of the finest victuals that ever were seen and when all wvas done wvent into the bottle again alick and his wife looked at every thingr with astonishment they had never seen such plates and dishles before and didnt think they could ever admire them enough the very sight almost took away their appetites but at length amolly said come and sit down mick and try and eat a bit sure you ought to be hungry after such a good days work w hy then the man told no lie about the bottle lick sat down after putting the children to the table and they made a hearty meal though they couldnt taste half thle dishes now says molly  i wonder will those two good little gentlemen carry away these file things again they waited but no one came so molly put up the dishes and plates very carefully saying  why then mick that was no lie sure enough  but you ll be a rich mhan yet ialick purcell  mick and his wife and children went to their bed not to sleep but to settle about selling the fine things they did not want and to take more land amick xvent to cork and sold his plate and bought a horse and cart and began to show that he was making money and tley did all they could to keep thle bottle a secret buat for all that their landlord found it out for hie came to alick one lay and asked him where he got all his mnoneysure it was not by the farm  and hie bothered him so much that at last amick told him of the biottle eis lanidlord offered him a deal of money for it but mliek would not give it till at last lhe offered to give hinm all his farm for ever so alick whco was very irich thought hed never want any more money and gave limn the bottle  but mlick was mistaken  he and his famnily spent money as if there  as no end of it and to make the story short they became poorer and poorer till at las tipev hlad nothing left but one cow and mick once more drove his cow before him to sell hier at cork fair hoping to meet the old man and get another bottle it was hardly daybreak when lie left   1 home and he walked on at a good pace till he reached the big hill the mists were sleep ing

ascending into the clear blue sky  till its form like a speck in the airinesn blending and thrilling with music was nmelting in light m mick crossed himself listening as he advanced to the sweet song of the lark 1ut thinking notwithstanding all the time of tile little old man when just as he reached tfie summit of the hill and cast his eves over the extensive prospect before and around him he was startled and rejoiced by the same wellknown voice well mick purcell j toll you you would be a rich man  nieed then sure enough 1 was thats no lie for you sir good morning to you but it is not rich i

to brings home the bottlewell he arrived with it safely enough and called out as soon as he saw molly oh  sure ife another bottle   arrah  then have you  why then you re a lucky man amick purcell thats whifat you are  in an instant she put ev ery thing right and alick looking at his bottle exult inglt cried out  bottle do your duty in a twinkling two great stout men with bio cudgels issued from the bottle i do not know how they got room in it and belaboured poor mick and his wife and all his family till they lay on the floor when in they event again mlick as soon as be recovered got up and looked about him he thomudht and thought and at last he took up his wife and his children and leaving them to recover as well as they could he took the bottle under his coat and went to his landlord who had a great company he got a servant to tell him lhe wanted to speak to him and at last he came out to mick v well what do you want now nothing sir only i heave another bottle 01 ho is it as good as the first yes sir and better if you like i will slhow it to you before all the ladies and gentlemen c come along then so saying mick was brought into the great hall where he sat bis old

the landlord nvas tumbled on the floor ladies and gentlemen servants and all were running and roaringr and sprawling and kicking and 5hrieking wine  cups and salvers were knocked about in every direction until the landlord called out  stop those two devils mick purcell or ill have you hanged   they never shall stop said amick till i get my own bottle that i see up there at top of that slhelf 4 give it down to him give it down to hnim before wve are all killed  says the landlord m mick put his bottle in his bosom in iumped the two men into the new bottle and he carried them home i need not lengthen mv story by telling how he got richer than ever how his son married his landlords only daughter how he and his wife died when they were very old and how some of the servants fighting at their wake broke the bottles but still the hill has the name upoil i it ay and so twill be always bottle luill to the end of the world and so it ought for it is a strange story the next legend we shall quote is entitled tihe field of boliauns torn fitzpatrick was the eldest son of a comfortable farmer who lived at ballincollig tom was just turned of nineandtwentywhen he met the following adventure and was as clever clean tight goodlooking a boy as any in the whole county cork one fine day in harvestit was indeed ladyday in harvest that every body knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the yeartom was taking a ramble through the ground and went sauntering along the sunny side of a lhedge thinking in himself where would be the great harin if people instead of idling and going about doing nothing at all were to shake out the hay and bind and stook the oats that was lying on the ledge specially as the weather had been rather broken of late he all of a sudden heard a clacking sort of noise a little before him in the hedge dear me said tom  but isnt it surprising to hear the storieclhatters sinainry so late in the season  so tom stole on going on the tops of his toes to try if he could get a sight of what was making the noise to see if hie was right in his guess the noise stopped but as tom looked sharply through the bushes what should he see in a nook of the hledge but a brown pitcher that might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor and by and by a little wee dinny dony bit of an old man with a little innffy of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his head and a deeshy daushy leather apron hangingbefore him pulled out a little wooden stool and stood up upon it and dipped a ittle piggin into the pitcher and took out the full of it and put it beside the stool and thern sat down under the pitcher and began to work at putting a heelpiece on a bit of a broglue just fitting for himself well by the powers  said tom to himself  i often etad toll of the cluricaune and to tell gods truth i never rightly believed in them but here s one of them in real earnest if i go knowingly to work i in a made man they say a body must never take their eyes off them or they 11 escape  tom now stole on a little farther with his eye fixed on the little man just as a cat does with a mouse or as we read in books the rattlesnake does withl the birds he wants to enchant so when he got up quite close to him  god bless your work neighbour said tom  the little man raised up his head and thank you kindly said he  i wonder youd be working on the holiday  said tom t hats my own business not yours was the reply w jrell may be you d be civil enough to tell us what you ve got in the pitcher there  said torn i  that i will with pleasure said lhe its good beer b eer  said tom  thunder and fire where did you get it  w where lid i oet it is it why i made it and what do you think i made it of  devil a one of me knows said toin but of malt i suppose what else  there you re out i made it of hcath of heath  said tom bursting out laughint sure you dont think me to be such a fool as to believe that  i io as you please said he  but what i tell you is the truth did you never hear tell of the danes   and that i did said tom  werent them the fellows we gave such a licking when they thouglht to take limerick from us  hen  said the little man drily is that all you know about the matter  well but about them danes said tom  why all the about them there is is that when they were here they taught us to make beer out of the heath and the secret s in mny family ever since  twill you give a body a taste of your beer  said tom  ill tell you what it is young manit wouild be fitter for you to be lookiing after your fathiers property thaii to be botherino decent quiet people with your foolish questions there now while you re idling away your time here theres the cows have broke into the oats and are knocking the corni all about  tom was taken so by surprise with this that lhe wvas just on the very point of turnincr round when he recollected himself so afiraid that the like might happen again hie made a grab at the cluricaune and catught him up in his hand but in his hurry hie overset the pitcher and spilled all the beer so that hie could not get a taste of it to tell what sort it was isle then swore what lhe would not do to him if he did not show him where his money wats tom looked so nwicked and so bloodyminded that the little man was quite frightened so says hli 1 conie along n itll j11c a 0o111 le of fields off and ill show vvu a tvtw k jf gold i i i i i so they went and tom held the cluricaune fast in his hand and never took his eves from off him though they had to cross hedges and ditches and a crooked bit of bog for the cluricaune seemed out of pure mischief to pick out the hardest and most con trary way till at last they came to a geat field all full of boliaun buies ragweed and the cluricaune pointed to a big boliaun and says hie  dig under that bohiaun and youll get the vreat crock all full of guineas tom in his hurry had never minded three bringing a spade with him so he thought to run home and fetch one and that hie might know the place again he took off one of h red garters and tied it round the boliaun i suppose said the cluricaune very civilly youve no farther occasion for me no says tom you may go away now if you please and god speed you and may good lick attend you wherever you go well good bye to you tom fitzpatrick said the luricaune and much good may do you with what youll get 6so tom ran for the dear life till hle came home anid got a spade and then away with him as hard as he could go back to the tield of boliauns but when hie got there lo arnd behold not a boliaun in the field but had a red garter the very identical model of his own tied about it and as to diggi g up the wnhole field that was all nonsense for there was more than forty good irish acres in it so tom cane horn again with his spade on h is shoulder a little cooler than he went and inany s the hearty curse lhe grave the cluricaune every time he thoulght of the neat turn he had served him the last we shall quote isthe little sh0e now

B8350,['6697436'],  it the land of mzarcels folk tales from austria and bohemia by theodor verna leken with preface by e johnson sonnenschein what a man will go through nay what a man must go through when he has got a fine crafty fish at the end of his line which he means to land over boulders under trees through the flashing waters eager chasing patient waiting but what matters so long as victory crowns the fight and the hard won spoil lies panting on the green grass his silver armour glittering in the sunlight and it is just such another struggle that the folklore collector has while lie sits and angles with all his craft and daintiest bait some aged crone alongside the cottage fire failing memory meanders on through the days of youth and what folks did and said then lurking suspicion as to what  the man wants  sends the longed for tale hither and thither old memories of those who told these things in the bygone rise up like eddies in the babbling burn baffling and bewildering the eager sportsman but what matters all the toil and trouble if at last the longedfor tale is landed and laid in all its quaintness snug in the notebook weird and wonderful and all aglow with the light of other days patience and perseverance mingled with sympathy and cunning is needed before these old world relies can be secured every collection of folktales represents an amount of labour the world at large little dreams of and not labour only but often selfdenial of the highest kind as we see in such lives as that of the late elias lunrott to whose industry and hardihood we owe the ifalerala now things are somewhat changed universities do not think it waste of money to give grants to students that they may go and live nmong the people in order to collect the songs tales and superstitions that still linger among them even now men are engaged in this work on the shores of the baltic and we are told that thousands of songs and tales have been already gathered in if finland can do so why not england with all her wealth and power there is not a moment to waste for we all know how hard it is even now to squeeze the veriest morsel of folklore out of the country folks how they apologise for telling us such nonsense and emphatically declare their own disbelief in the whole thing and then what a ghostly simulacrum appearsthe flesh and blood yea and spirit gone and lo a handful of dry bones and it must be so it is one thing to hear a tale as it comes fresh from the lips of the peasant sitting by the great hearth on the winter nightwithout the wild wind roaring amid the sounding pines and howling like a demon pack around the house corner within no light but the wooden splints with their flickering flame playing on the faces of the family who sit half iraped in the gloomit is quite another to hear the same story told by those who mixing in the busy world have cast off all the old thoughts who hear no demons cry in the night wind nor think of poor souls in vain trying to rest on the housetop as they race on in wild unrest till the day of doom but who tap the barometer and regard all as the effects of the immutable laws of nature we cannot be too thankful to grimm asbjdrnsen castr n erdelyi and the numerous collectors who saved the tales when they were in some decgree alive for so soon as education and its various attendants enter the folklore domain the whole thing is clianged stories about men who were chopped into mincemeat upon three consecutive days and were no worse but rather the better for the process take flight old women who were changed into burning ovens finnish wolves who became shops full of the most precious goods and a man behind the counter sz6kely women who could become rivers with eight tributaries and mtagvar lads who turned into millet fields without the sniallet inconvenience and all the rest of the marvellous host disappear into thin air and their memory even is hid in dark places compare an ordinary fairy talc as told to our children with its variant as told amid the lapps anl the difference between a dead and a living folltale will soon be seen the one is stripped of most of its wonders anl what remains is watered down or apologised for while the other bristles with the wildest notionsa man becomes a magpie and no one is astonished a man drinks an inland sea dry and it is treated as a mere matter of course even the snow himself occasionally woos some fair girl by the fjord side  such tales at the first glance may appear mere nonsense and to collect them a waste of time but more careful consideration has shown such is not the case that there is method in their madness and that they are a by no means unimllortant factor in the history of early man thus it is we heartily welcome any new eolleetion of stories especially when it deals with districts of which we as yet know but little the collection before us we are told was faithfully taken down from word of mou1th by prof vernaleken from the people of lower austria and bohemia and is one which presents many points of great interest we find as usual the wonderful similarity that exists betwveen tales told in the mos4 distant places hondiddlelo and his fidle is a version of the wellknown story of a mans king or otherwise who wished to kceep the fruit of a certain tree but could not as some one always stole it at night the thief being caulght by the youngest son the story here told is wonderfully abridged as compared with the magyar version which supplies the beginning of the story that appears in this case to have been lost hondiddledo

the sun kings diughiter and a peasant lad the thieves in this case being three swaan maidells one of whom ashiepattle captures through seizing her swanll ress the finnish version in common with the

riotif of the story and so moditied it to suit thlemqelves this tale showvs the great imnportance of colleeting all the variants of a tale as it is only by this means we can discover what the tale

B7963,['6737396'],  wideawake stories a collection of tales told by little children between sunset and 8unrise in the panjab and kashmir by f a steel and r c temple bombay education societys press london triibner we are indebted to mrs steel and capt temple for a charming volume of stories admirably fitted for the entertainment of children and at though same time containing much valuable information for students its contents naturally resemble those of the collections previously made by miss frere miss stokes the rev lal behan day and mr damant but its authors justly claim for it the merit of special genuineness inasmuch as it has been mostly procured at firsthand from the lips of purely village children who have never been inside a school and  whose complete freedom from any european influence is beyond all question the fortythree tales now presented in purely literary form have for the most part been already published in the indian antiquary the calcutta review and the legends of the panjdb where they appeared in a literal version to which reference can be made by those scholars who insist upon a strict translation however uncouth to english ears but for all ordinary purposes the present volume will suffice by itself being provided with thirtyfour pages of excellent notes an analysis of the tales on the plan adopted by the folklore society of england occupying thirtyseven pages and fifty pages devoted to  a survey of the incidents in modern indian folktales all testifying to the wide knowledge and painstaking industry of their author capt temple during the working hours of the day says mrs steel no tales are to be heard in a panjabi village but after sunset comes  storytelling time the heat is still too great for sleep the darkness of night is relieved but slightly inside the mudbuilt cottages by the dim smoky flame of an oilfed wick so there is nothing for the children to do but to tell stories by way of passing the time they have worked hard all daythe boys half hidden in clouds of dust tending the herds the girls  kneading drying and stacking the fuelcakes so necessary in that i woodless country now has come their time for rest and amusement so after their scanty supper is over the bairns drag their woodenlegged stringwoven bedsteads into the open and settle themselves down like young birds in a nost three or four to a bed while others coil up on mats upon though grouud and some stealing in for an hour from distant alleys beg a place here or there though stars twinkle overhead the mosquito sings through the hot air the village dogs bark at imaginary foes and from one crowded nest after another rises a childish voice telling some tale old yet ever newtales that wero told in the sunrise of the world and will be told in its sunset the most novel of the stories contained in the present collection is that of little anklebone no 14 it appears to be unique among indian folktales says capt temple who compares it with grimms  singing bone a boy is eaten by a wolf which at his request hangs his anklebone by a thread to a tree though bone maintains an  independent existence and without changing its form acts like a human being piping to beasts and obtaining milk from tigresses and shewolves another unfamiliar tale apparently of literary origin is  the lord of death no 27 a certain road had the reputation of being fatal to all who travelled that way an old man who was walking along it sat down to rest and perceived near him a scorpion which turned into a snake he followed it and saw it kill many persons then it turned into a buffalo and afterwards into an ox still continuing its homicidal practices afterwards it became a beautiful girl whose charms produced a fatal rivalry between two brothers finally it assumed the form of a whitebearded man him though traveller who had never ceased to follow close upon the destroyer accosted and learned from him that he was called  the lord of death because he went about bringing death to the world hearing this the old traveller begged for death but was told that his appointed time was not yet come no 42 is a remarkable story about a mother and daughter who worshipped the sun  giving everything they earned to it except two meal cakes on which they lived one day the daughter who was alone in the house had eaten her share of this food when a beggar came asking for aid not liking to refuse she gave him in the name of the sun half of her mothers cake the mother returning hungry to dinner found only half a cake to eat and was so annoyed that she drove her daughter from her house but the sun protected the outcast who became the bride of a prince her mother found out where she was and presented herself in her rags to the princess intending to put her to shame but the sun continued its protection to the daughter and turned the mother into a golden stool no 40 describes a singular form of selfsacrifice on thc part of a king who was accustomed to give away a hundredweight of gold in charity every morning before breakfast in order to obtain the necessary amount of the precious metal he allowed himself to be fried and eaten every day by a faqir who after the operation restored him to life no 22 is a curious specimen of the stories in which women figure who are snakes in disguise the snakewoman in this story was called in the original a zamia  said in kashmir to bc a snake two hundred years old and to possess the power of becoming a woman a malignant being the nature of which has been discussed in the indian antiquary vol xi pp 23035 and in the folklore societys edition of comparettis researches into the book of sindibdd no 26 is one of the many forms of the tale which tells how a man becomes rich by the help of some wonderworking object but has it stolen from him by an envious neighbour who is eventually punished for the theft in the present instance the miracles are due to a conch which requires to be blown in a particular manner the thief not understanding how to use it is obliged to surrender it to its original owner but stipulates that he is to get a double share of whatever that owner obtains from it the rightful proprietor of the conch from a feeling similar to that which made the hero of another wellknown tale ask for stripes as his reward spitefully prays for the loss of an eye he straightway becomes oneeyed but the thief in consequence of his too grasping stipulation loses both eyes falls into a well and is drowned nos 3139 give in a readable form a number of the stories about raja rasalu

not the fairy ones alone that is one point to be noted about the book reading andersen in a practically complete edition like thisfor one always forgets to remember his novelsone is struck by the excellence of even his average work he wrote a little handful of stories that deserve immortality but as can be seen here out of the slightest of motiveshecould make something at least pretty his talent his art never forsook him even when his genius was not alight dr sommers translation is exceedingly good it is so very simple that you may not see at first its real skill but read a few of the stories through and its charm steals over you it is simple not in the sense that it condescends to children but with the simplicity of good literature the translators work should receive recognition we hope it may and that mr gaskin for all his merits may not run away with all the praise a good many of mr gaskins drawings for the book will have been seen at the arts and crafts exhibition where they had an honoured place and no wonder the school of draughtmanship to which outwardly he belongs has prodiiced a great deal of work beautiful regarded as mere decorati n but which set to illustrate tales of real moving human life is unsatisfactoryit delights the eye but it is not what illustrations should be a commentary on an illumination of the text this cannot be said of the pictures here while altogether removed from commonplace realism they are yet instinct with life with feeling with humour the tenderness in the loveliest rose of the world in the bond of friendship in  ib and christine and in the wild swans is quite as remarkable as the beautiful detail the decorative qualities in  the marsh kings daughter  the daisy  the goloshes of fortune and  a leaf from heaven to name only a few many words are not needed to express hearty appreciation the whole hundred of them are pictures not merely to admire but to linger over with keen delight the volumes are good specimens of printing indeed mr gaskin is only the chief collaborator in the production of two volumes of rare artistic excellence which have been issued too not as editions de luxe but which are within the reach of at least a very great many who value good work rie loveliest rose in mhe world from i stories and fairy tales by h c andercn  allun the marsh kings daughter from stories and fairy tales by h c andersen g allen  fairy tales fairies may be simple or sophisticated beautiful or hideous friendly or hateful prim and precise or tanglehaired and teasing  but whatever they are their adventures should always be told simply its hopeless to make a fuss about the fairies the fuss aesthetic the fuss of folklore the fuss moralizing the fuss gruesome all of these are ruin for a fairy tale for children the best authors have been guilty at times there are moments when even andersen makes the reader sit up with an indignant  that didnt happen and then with a delicate pop away goes the fairy tale and ones happy credulity the best stories are the old stories told quite simply  they may be in language a little conventional as was the language of mrs freers  old deccan days  and some of the older versions of the  arabian nights but they must have that gravity that respectful manner which show that the author does not regard his work with anything but a serious craftsmans interesthe is neither writing down norworse horror writing up of our ghristmas fairy books this year one is written by a man who has a touch a little beyond talent mr james stephens in irish fairy tales macmillan 15s net has not forgotten that he is writing for children  he keeps his humour and his rather rascally gaiety and the wisdom in his stories of fionn and oisin bran and mongan is quiet and unobtrusive he gives too a definition of fairyland which may serve for the older ones as well as for the children   everything that is here is there but the things that are there are better than those that are here all things that are bright are there brighter there is more gold in the sun and more silver in the moon of that land there is more scent on the flowers more savour in the fruit there is more comeliness in the men and more tenderness in the women mr rackhams pictures are amazing in their grotesque fancy the reptiles the uncanny rocks the ogreish people could not be bettered  but his beautiful people are not of fairyland at all they decorate instead of inspiring carlo lorenzini who wrote as collodi knew how simple a fairy tale might be  he made one out of a piece of wood and many

greatly interfere with the enjoyment of the stories but how rackhams illustrations in snowdrop and hansel and gretel constable 17s 6d net each add to that enjoyment  the artist is here at his best he has no poetry to reckon with only legend and whim and fun and a little shiver and a horro or two he draws gnomes which a rationalist would ache to nurse  his valiant tailor has a spirit a gust which

rather than beauty by abanindranath tagore mr birt writes like this he  evolved a scheme which was to impersonate a ghost by uttering aloud some indistinct nasal noises  or again  uxoriousness was one

only in such versions one gets at once the national differences and the unity which binds all the simple people of the world mrs walton has something which rackham lacksher work is not merely suffused by it is instinct with the character of the tales she is illustrating one experiences not the least change in mood in passing from the text to the picturesa happiness which as a rule comes only when

latin into romance by robert de borron and lucas de gast it is a difficult book to appraise fairly of miss pauls high decorative skill there is no doubt there are initials and borders here which not only derive from the book of kells but could bear looking at beside that splendour some of her crowded swift little pictures have the genuine thrill which the low ceilings and hot atmosphere of rossetti can give there is too a real touch of individuality about the pictures especially about the figures  miss paul is a truer mediaevalist than were the preraphaelite brothers yet there is a slight affectation in the work and a good deal in the text miss paul will not be as simple as she knows how and so misses the reward which she might have miss chaundler has rifled the old legends in  arthur and his knights  nisbet 15s net and has given us a book which can be read aloud the style is a little flat a little infected with the drab emphasis of an unintelligent nurse who always bears

characters of which it is easy to see that the types and representatives have survived that time and the skill with which mr pulszky thus points the present with the moral of the past is such as not in any way to weaken the romance of his story while it gives greatly increased interest to its historical pictures in a word the jacobins in hungary is a remarkably welltold tale which will please all readers by the skill and pathos of its narrative and surprise many by its fairness and impartiality of tone to opinions as well as men rut the majority of intelligent englishmen have not now to learn that the closest parallel for a hungarian rebel of the nineteenth century would be an english rebel of the seventeenth and they will not feel or express astonishment that what alls from mr pulszky on

B4219,['9434342'],  icelandic l g nih collected by jn aroason translated by g e j powell and e magnusson bentley tins is a collection of capital stories the translators have taken its items from the immense gathering made by m arnason the first instalment of which was published in leipzig in 102 under the title of icelandic national stories and tales as they do not propose a wnrk of learning but rather to give a general idea of the traditions of iceland they have exercised their oihee with freedom and judgement in relieving the collection of many things that are cumbrous and of others that are painful to english susceptibilities in general this portion of the work has been well done and keeping the special object of the publication in view we admit that the tales are improved by such treatment although for other ends we do not admire meddling of the kind we wish we could southwest that the illustrations of which though book cont lins many were worthy of the text the contents are divided into1 stories of elves 2 of water monsters 3 of trolls 4 of goblins and ghosts  miscellaneous if the reader is curious to know thc genesis of elves he may learn all that is known abouc it from the first tale which says that when though almighty visited eve and adam he inquired of the former for thc whole of her children now it so happened that she had not finished washing some of them and being ashamed of their dirty condition averred that the clean ones were the whole of her family of course the maker was not to be deceived in this manner so he said what man hides from god god will hide from man these unwashed children became forthwith invisible and took up their abode in mounds and hills and rocks from these the elves descended in stories treated as these have been the reader must not expect to find the uncouthness and picturesque crudity of the versions of scandinavian folklore to be met with in prof b thorpes traditions and tales of scandinavia and north germany but on that account to the general reader the work before us will be more acceptable the selection has generally been made with a purpose not merely philosophical or archaological but to evolve the dramatic elements of the originals and without intrusiveness to emphasise a moral in them it does not need much to render this characteristic of the tales expressive enough indeed it is curious how often the very nerve of some quaint relation vibrates to the ethic charm resolution patience chastity fortitude obedienceare frequent themes of these legends those qualities never tail to get honour and success at the same time there is a sort of placid indifference to clanger and an ignorance of irritability displayed by the heroes that are characteristic of scandinavian legends and give to them a startling and novel effect all readers of the sagas and northern traditions are struck with this imperturbability of the heroes which is curiously different from the impassivity attributed by the greeks to the higher ranks of immortals and not often found in the sustained epics of the nibelungen cycle in the first this imperturbability is far removed from mere stolidity the nonchalance of the frankish heroes arises frequently from concentration of their passions and seems assumed we find in the shepherd of silfninarstadir a curious example of this imperturbability and also of that strange endowing of christian priests with magical powers which is doubtless a relic of paganism such an endowing appears again in  blue face a noteworthy story of white magic in  the bishop and the elves and with great force in the black school and its sequels we forget whether it is prof b thorpe or mr keightlcy who avers that we have in england no wateridves or fairies morgan la fay is an instance to the contraryunless indeed she is held to be not indigenous we cannot say that so far as our knowledge of the tales of such folk extends that thc loss is great for with the exception of undinea story which owes a great deal to its modern costume there are not many we care for even among the outlandish legendsof course after excluding those which have nothing but mere background to associate them with the watery world among the few however that are estimable of the legends of necks mermen mermaids nikke the stromkarl or fossegrimm sec all haunters of diverse sorts of waters and much addicted to music there are several of high poetic order having the aspect of a newworld about them and showing the wondrous insight of their inventors ol seaspirits the number is very small whose acquaintance one desires to retain  but the few have a grandeur apart from mere considerations of vastness we should have liked to find in this book more icelandic stories of fresh coast and ocean waterspirits the shadowy government of which  the ecclesiastical history of iceland by finnus johaniueus tells us that it repeats in every detail the actions of the human natives of the island might one would think supply no end of such stories to this day the people believe that king pharaoh and his army were changed into seals in the shetlands wo have says dr hibbert a submarine nation of sea trows many of the stories in this book are almost identical with some that are to be found in grimm and being so need not have been repeated some partially resemble those of germany but have a fresh spirit in them that adds a charm and often a grand mystery what mystery there lies in such a tale aa  kathis dream and in  the boy who knew not fear is not hard to guess of another sort here is a story for the first good little girl you meet near a certain farm long ago three children were playing on a grass mound a little girl and two boys after they had played for some time the girl who was the youngest of them found a dee hole in the ground so deep that she could not see the bottom of it stooping down bhe thrust her hand into it and shutting her eyes cried out in fun put something in the palm of an old beggar and old beggar shall not see no sooner had she said the words than a large silver button was placed in her hand when the other children saw her good luck they were fit to burst with envy and the eldest of them stooping down thrust his hand into the hole too and said  put something into the hand of an old beggar and old beggar shall not see for he hoped to get something at least as good as the little girl had got if not better indeed but no far from it when he drew his hand out again he only found hd had lost the use of it and what was more never recovered it again for the elf who hated envy more than anything in the world had given it a squeeze the above is similar though superior tojthe breton tale of the korred dance told by villemerque here is an eerie tale of another sort  once on a winter evening it happened that j5n arason bishop of h51ar wanted a book which he had left lying on the altar of the church so called his household folk together and asked which of them would do him the favour of fetching the book for bim they all shuddered at the idea and all drew back except one maidservant who declared herself quite willing to go and not in the least afraid now the bishop having enemies as who has not had made a tunnel from his own house which was called the palace underground tothe church with a view to being able if need should ever be to take sanctuary at a moments notice and unobserved through this tunnel the maid went having procured the keys of the church but when she had taken the book from the altar bhe determined not to go back through the tunnel which she had found dismal and ghostly but rather round the other way so she walked down the church with the keys to the outer door and looking towards the benches where the women were wont to sit she saw there a human skeleton with long yellow hair amazed at this but in no way frightened she went up to the figure and said  who are you v upon which the skeleton said  i am a woman and have long been dead but my mother cursed me so that i can never corrupt and return to the dust whence i sprung now therefore my good girl i entreat you to release me from this ban if it lies in your power  but answered the girl  it does not lie in my power so far as i now know tell me how i can help you then the skeleton replied  you must ask my mother to forgive me my faults and to annul her curse for bhe may very likely do for the living what she refuses to do for the dead it is a rare thing indeed for the living to ask favours of the dead where is your mother then asked the maiden  oh said the other  she ls here there and everywhere now for example she is yonder in the choir then the maiden went through the door into the choir and saw sitting there on one of the benches a wondrous ugly old woman in a red hat to whom she addressed herself asking her to be good enough to forgive her daughter and remove from her the curse after pausing awhile plainly unwilling the old hag answered  well it is not often that you living people ask favours of me so for once i will say to you yea having thanked her for her goodness the maiden went back towards the outer door but when she came to the place where she had seen the skeleton found there only a heap of dust so she went towards the door and as she opened it she heard a voice from the inner part of the church which cried after her  look at my red eyes how red they are and without turning round she answered look at my black back how black it is the bold maiden passed the elfswarming churchyard in spite of screams and yells and safely delivered the book

B8935,['6731465'],  sixty folk tales from exclusively slavonic sources translated with brief introduc tiena and notes by a h wratislaw elliot stock it was the late mr ralston who introduced to the notice of the british public the wealth of slavonic folklore his work w as done in scholarly fashion and to his translations of the origical russian talesfor to these he confined himselfhe added references to variants in other collections the little book of mr j t naake of the british museum entitled slavonic fairy lalee which appeared in 1874 also possessed considerable merit and we believe has long been out of print it has been followed by the interesting collection of mr wratislaw which is the subject of our present notice there is probably a richer field of folklore among the slavs than any other european people and the eastern members of the family show greater abundance than the western mr wratislaw begins his book with the bohemian tales but these are not to be compared in interest with the russian the late karl erben cf prague whose edition forms the basis of mr wratislaws work appears to have treated his folkstories conscientiously such cannot however be siid to have been the case with bozena nemcova the once popular author who almost always improved  upon her originals from her book mr wratislaw gives one specimen mr naake and prof a chozdko have both made use of erbens bookthe latter in his conies des paysans et des patres slaves it has the advantage of a fairly copious vocabulary in which all the wordsand some of those in provincial dialects are rather obscureare fully explained but unfortunately these txplanations are in bohemiana language but little studied in western europe all honour must be given to erbtn for his conscientious treatment of the tales but we do not blame the ingenious author previously alluded to for her tamperings with the original text un fortunately she lived at a time when no one had the courage to print these simple stories as they were received from the mouth of the peasant the comparison made by mr wratislaw p 51 between one of the moravian stories and a tale in the collection of grimm reminds us that chodzko complains with apparent reason that the germans have appropriated many of the slavonic folktales perhaps however we should be nearer the truth in saying that they are the common property of the aryan peoples and indeed of the whole human race certainly many of the magyar stories and national songs look very slavonic just as their national singer till he magyarised himself was called petrovich a name of unmistakable origin we should have preferred the term  slovakian for hungarian slovenes on p 62the adjective is used by miklosich and prevents any confusion with the real slovenes the driving of the great magyar wedge into the midst of the slavonic peoples to which mr wratislaw alludes has formed the subject of a valuable historical monograph by prof k grot of warsaw entitled moravia and the magyars st petersburg 1881 since erben published his book the lusatian talesor sorbish as we should prefer to call themhave been more comprehensively treated by veckenstedtwenosehs sagsn mareken und aberglauhische qebrauche gesammslt und nacherztlhlt gratz 1880 the variant of  little red riding hood  given by mr wratislaw on p 100 is very interesting he remarks with truth that the word nesets for  moon  is masculine how far it is a secondary formation it is difficult to say certainly the old slavonic has the feminine word luna which is also found in russian and slovenish miklosich sees traces in polish and bohemian and connects the word with lukna even the kashubes the humble section of the slavonic family dwelling on the coast of the baltic near danzig contribute their quota of a single tale and that is taken of course from the collection of dr cenova the only literary representative of these poor fisherfolk before the civilised world polish is fairly supplied with folktales as we know from the fine collection edited by oscar kolbcrg but this work appeared long after the compilation of erbens book coming to the obscure dialect of white russian we find some good specimens in mr wratislaws extracts the number of malorussian stories has been greatly increased by the publication of the narodnia tuthnorusshia shazjci of rudchenko erben does not seem to have used this book which appeared two or three years before his death in his introduction to the bulgarian stories p 175 mr wratislaw adopts the views of miklosich on some of the peculiarities of that language we think however that the idea of deriving the postposition of the article from the old thracian language originally spoken in the same localities can be otherwise explained the same tendency to put the demonstrative pronoun at the end of a noun or pronoun is seen in russian and polish thus russian smielosutu disknet  creates boldness or polish s kt6rogoto dkielk from which work some excellent remarks on this suffix are to be found in prof sobolevskis lectures on the history of the russian language nor do we accept the view of mr wratislaw that the old thracian or dacian language conjointly with latin has produced the present roumanian too little is known of thracian to justify these assertions and it would be difficult to point out the thracian words from that language in the roumanian vocabulary unless we are to consider albanian as such the remarks on the bulgarian cases also require modification as in some of the dialects the terminations of the genitive and dative are distinctly found nor again on p 204 can we accept the view that serbian has been modified by thracian influences the tendency to supply the infinitive by a circumlocution with the subjunctive is found in other languages eg low latin mr wratislaw has done excellent work in his versions of these folktales it is only with some of his philological views that we cannot agree thus we are at a loss to see what can justify his statement that the malorussianit is a language and not a dialect is more nearly allied to the bohemian than to the white russian surely its characteristics are sharply enough marked as of a southeastern slavonic language as opposed to bohemian a western mr wratislaws frequent use of the word  dialect is also to be somewhat reprehended thus slovenish cannot be called in anyway a dialect and the views of schafarikan excellent ethnologist but poor philologistare now out of date of the three dialects coordinated on p 204 serbian and croatian are almost identical but slovenish exhibits great variations from both in his work on the slavonic languages and literature published in 1826 schafarik actually grouped bulgarian with serbian these remarks are not made with a view of disparaging that eminent man but to show how slavonic studies have advanced since his time the fact is that a great deal of schafarik8 work is now antiquated the old divisions of the slavonic languages made by him and dobrovsky have been superseded by the classification given by johannes schmidt zur oeschichte des lndooermanischen voealismus part ii p 178 vienna 187175 the early attempts were based on distinctions many of which existed only in imagination as regards slovenish it is a language of great interest on account of the many old forms it contains although it is spoken over a small area and the literature which it contains is comparatively trifling since however the excellent grammar of j suman a pupil of miklosich slovenska slovniea laibach 1881 it is no longer left in

B4874,['8751522'],  the algonquin legends of new england b charles g leland sampson low  co when mr leland offers from the mic mac a tale partly in blank verse as far as form goes and in plot a mixture of the french tale of the bears son and the conclusion of the scotch 4 nicht nocht nothing one feels at first as if things were not all as they should be in mic mac this story is styled  the three strong men  pp 311 323 in the narrative comes a sevenheadti devil one of the beings so familiar in slavonic miirchen then the critic turns back to p 207 where mr leland tells him that  this srheaded son  of hymer in the vafthrudnismal reappears as a demon in the passamaquoddy tale of  the three strong men whatever may be the case in passamaquoddy certainly in mic mac the demon is sevenheaded then rises the question why should the seven  headed or sixheaded in passamaquoddy demon be the sixheaded son of hymer of the  vafthrudnismal why indeed  we cannot answer the question though we feel certain that the mic mac story is a compound of two stories which are european though also found more or less in malagasy mr leland himself admits part of this the story consists of a very old indian legend mingled with a european fairy tale drawn through a french canadian source but what part of the tale is very old indian  the original mr leland says  is from beginning to end a song or poem that is why we presume he has rendered so much of it into blank verse printed as prose in the tale the hero loses his memory and forgets his bride when his hand is licked by a black dog this is the celtic idea of the man who was to let no one kiss him and who lost all memory of the past when  kissed  by a dog we fail to see what is indian in the whole tale except perhaps mention of wigwams and the like now if this tale be so notably european though already converted into a kind of chant by the mic macs and if the norse identifications p 207 be so far from convincing to a moderate scepticism the rest of mr lelands collection is also not likely to be accepted without shyness he is perhaps chiefly interested himself in the resemblances between the tricky lox of passamaquoddy and the tricky loki of scandinavian myth the resemblances are often strong but would be stronger if for example mr leland offered p 271 any proof that  the fellow who played the trick a trick very like one of lokiswas lox he says  we may very easily detect the hand of lox the mischiefmaker in this last incident but lox has never been mentioned or hinted at in the tale mr leland may he right but every one must decide for himself as to the plausibility of the conjecture mr leland thinks that a good deal of eddaic lore has filtered through the eskimo to the algonquins and certainly many curious coincidences in eddaic and indian folklore may be accounted for by that hypothesis though we are not yet convinced of its accuracy perhaps for complete proof other examples of indian institutions dress weapons gear of every kind derived from norsemen might be adduced they would certainly strengthen the hypothesis one story which represents  master rabbit as originally the possessor of a long tail will at once suggest  brer babbit did the negroes borrow this incident from the indians or the indians from the negroes or did both invent it separately or did both derive it from a common source  these are questions which it is all but impossible to answer many of the negro rabbit tales have been brought from africa where they were told about a beast not very unlike a rabbit superficially perhaps others have been borrowed from indian sources on all these points it is hard or rather it ought to be impossibleto dogmatize at present we confess that after reading all mr lelands talesvery good tales very well told  we are slightly inclined not to believe in scandinavian influence on the algonquin legends the evidence and inferences are evenly balanced and perhaps it is only the hardness of the mythological heart that resists in any case mr lelands book though we wish he had avoided blank verse is extremely interesting and valuable both in itself and in its probable effects other american collectors of the red mens legends will be encouraged we hope to publish them as literally as possible this is the great point already we knew from schoolcraft and others that the red mens tales resemble and in fact are variants of the european marchen how much of this likeness is due to scandinavian and more recent french and english influences that is precisely the question which at present it is impossible to answer but which many readers of mr lelands book will reply to by voting for an infiltration of the edda only he himself can state his case at sufficient length and with his own evidence so to algonquin legends we send the mythologist no abstract can or should satisfy him,folklore

we possess in english and one that is of especial value since the tales are not merely translations the word  english however is somewhat misleadingso many of the tales are scotch it would be of interest also to know the actual source of the tales which mr jacobs heard in australia many of the tales are of course familiar to all students of folklore in english forms and i am not sure that mr jacobs versions are always the best occasionally too one seems to miss the genuine ring not of the folktale but of the folktelling and there are certain omissions thatunless mr jacobs is as i hope contemplating a second volumeare difficult to account for but despite small faults of commission and omission faults one only notices because the work is so good thc volume is most welcome only one protest  tom tit tot mr jacobs declares is  superior to any of the continental variants with which he is acquainted it may be that i am prejudiced and that therefore the german variant which delighted me as a child still seems to me the best be this as it may to me at least  rumpelstilzchen  seems more graceful more humorous and more dramatic than tom tit tot but whatever the grownup folk may say the little folk will be of only one opinion concerning these  talesthey will receive them with a chorus of delight and after all are not children the best as they are also the most honest of critics  the admirable illustrations by j d batten are worthy of the tales no wellregulated nursery should be without these old old stories in their charming new dress  tattercoats from more erglish fairy tales more english fairy talfs collected and edited by iosepii jacobs illtistratel by j  batten d nutt mr jacobs has kept some of the best of his tales for this volume adhering to his former plan and stoutly defending it in his preface he has given them for the most part in the racy speech of the people but always keeping in mind that they are meant to be read and liked by children he refuses to draw a line between scottish and english border tales and so  rashincoatie  and  habitrot  are here it is a delightful and at the same time a very amusing collection full of humour and insight into peasant character and customs but none of the tales are here for any such serious reason but simply because they are good to read and listen to nfr batten never entered more thoroughly into the spirit of the tales than he has done in this volume which should be fully as popular as any of mr jacobs former oncs  celtic fain tales solectod and edited bv joseph jacobs editor of folklore illustrated by john d batten nutt tales and lng ends by av carew hazlitt sonnenschein  co mn jacobs tolls us in the preface that his chief difficulty has been that of selecting where there is so much ready to hand his collection consists of twentysix stories representing ireland scotland wales and cornwall but chiefly ireland and scotland in fact though brythons have here onl five storiesfour from wales  the shepherd of myddvai the wooing of olwen the brewery of eggshells and  beth gellort and one from cornwall  the tale of ivan mr jacobs however explains that it is not his fault that little wales is not better represented and hopes that the eisteddfod may do something for welsh folklore by offering prizes for collecting folktales in the principality this has been done to some extent but with no great rosults as yet at least so far as though public is concerned thus the eisteddfod held in london a few years ago awarded a prize to the rev elias owen for work done in this field  but what has becomo of it  we are not awaro that it has ever boon published then as to complete stories of any length we feel pretty certain that there are none such to be found in wales at the present day and this is our idea also as to though time not long ago when that peculiar collector of folklore wirt sikes flourished mr jacobs gives his readers clearly to understand whero ho has found his tales and how he has dealt with them modifying or excising though original translations from celtic hero and there where he found them ovorliteral for his avowed object is not to appeal to english folklorists and scholars but to intorost and please a more youthful class of roaders and wo certainly think that he has boen eminently successful mr batten has also done his part admirably and both he and mr jacobs leave one under the impression that they have not themselves escaped the fascination whereby  though captive celt has enslaved his captor in though realm of imagination though present volume accordingly attempts to begin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years and it may bo trusted to act in some measure as an antidote to the ruthless unreason of the budding golthers of our day by no means the least interesting portion of the volume is that consisting of the thirty pages of notes to the stories these it is neodloss to say are not quite exhaustive but it would be invidious to suggest here a variety of small additions which occur to us as of interest to the specialist all the notes aro decidedly instructive reading and some such as that in which the origin of the beth gelert story of llewelyn and his greyhound is traced break new ground others illustrate accidentally the position of mr jacobs in the folklore world for our readers are doubtless aware that folklorists aro divided in opinion on the question of parallel developments as against borrowing wo may cite the following passage as both explaining what we mean and dealing with a curious feature of folktales it occurs in mr jacobss notes on the story of  hudden and dudden p 248  it is indeed curious to find as m cosquin points out a cunning fellow tied in a sack getting out by crying i wont marry the princess in countries so far apart as ireland sicilyafghanistanand jamaicait is indeed impossible to think these are disconnected and for drolls of this kind a good case has been made out for the borrowing hypotheses by m cosquin and mr clouston who borrowed from whom is another and more difficult question which has to be judged on its merits in each individual case probably in this instance all would agree that there has been borrowing by somebody  but in some cases the other theory namely that of parallel developments in a similarity of circumstances is held by some students of folklore and to these mr jacobs at the recent international folklore congress gave the name of  casualists what is to bo the name of the other partythat to which he himself belongs probably some such name as  niigrationists  would do as well as any other but the difference between the two schools is only one of degree the migrationists being as they themselves think more sensitive to though numerical argument from a calculation of though chances against independent developments in each particular instance before we turn to mr hazlitts book we may bo permitted to express our regret that leisure was not found to revise the printers errols moro carefully for if words which are not english are introduced into an english book pains should be taken to have them spelled in some way recognised in the languages to which the belong  if you must needs speak of  the cymru you should know that it means  the wales and that you have to write  the cymry  if you wish to allude in that way to  the welsh people we have seen more than ono way of spelling the gaelic word for antiquary or storyteller but ve have never before seen it made into theenachie similarly  archroologia britannia and similar slips in the notes look strange and ought to disappear in future editions of which thore will we doubt not be many as the volume cannot fail to become popular and deservedly so it is difficult to know for what class of readers mr hazlitts book is designed not surely for students of folklore for in the preamble to robin hood on his 242nd page mr hazlitt says that  in dealing with this ancient and favourite tradition the editor has for the first time made use of such material only as appeared to him authentic so exactly half the book is valueless for scientific purposes unless as we gather from other parts of it mr hazlitts command of english is not always so complete as to enable him to say what he means students of folklore too require much more precise information than is here afforded and will naturally prefer to go to the fountain head for these interesting but wellknown old stories neither can the book be intended for young persons  or children for various incidents are related with  the masculine frankness of the old time nor yet for lovers of ballad poetry for none such when reading a selection of ballads from the  reliques which have been digested into prose whatever that may mean  would admit that  the probability is that many of the ancient tales here found present themselves for the first time in an intelligible form or that the handling of say for instance the nutbrowne maid is faithful and judicious and has made it capable of yielding to the lover of the ballad and folktale a store at once of entertainment and instruction what possible instruction is to he obtained from a translation which changes 0 lord what is th s worldys blysse tfhat ohangeth as the mone  my somers day in lusty may is derked bel ore the none 1 here you saye

we are not so soon to depart  if the until death us dopart of the marriage service had not been altered into u until death us do part almost every one would havo known that to depart means to part if mr hazlitt knew it he should have completed the work of modernization hy saying  part here to our mind however such treatment of our old ballads is both barbarous and unnecessary never yet have we seen the child of fair intelligence who could not after taking thought read and got pleasure out of  chevy chace  adam bel the  battle of otterburn and many others which have had both poetry and point taken out of them by mr hazlitt for a bit of fine confused writing showing a great deal of appreciation of and contempt for theso ballads and legends we commend our readers to the preface it is

world the fate of the children of lir a second volume would have been justified and the black horse and how cormac macart went to fairy  are two others in this second series that must fascinate all

fearsome pictures by a touch of humour  english fairy tales by joseph jacobs illustrated by j d batten nutt the flyleaf of this book tells us how to get into it the difficulty however will not be how to get into it but how to get out of it for from first to last almost without an exception these stories are delightful there are old friends among them which never can appear too often there are others with which we have hitherto only had a bowing acquaintance and there are one or two which are entirely new we are not quite sure about the whole party being englishone or two seem to have strayed out of grimms  kinder und hausmiirchen and to have been a little weakened on the way some of them judging from the point of view of folklore might certainly have been more appropriately included in a scotch collection mr jacobs explains their appearance thus  i have also included some stories that have only been found in lowland scotch i have felt justified in doing this as of the twentyone folktales contained in chamberss  popular rhymes of scotland no less than sixteen are also to be found in an english form the reasoning here is not strong but the stories are good we can imagine mr jacobs feeling the same pious joy that thrilled the old north  country steward who recounting to his absent lord the depredations caused by a foray made by the scots when  the falsehearted thieving loons  drove away flocks and herds over the border wound up by saying  but thankit be the lord we have outstolen them the more stories of this kind that are  lifted  into books that the public are likely to read the better and as mr jacobs informs his readers that some day he is going  to treat the subject of the english folktale on a larger scale with all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus  his readers may for the present wink at an english fairy tale called the laidly worm which is avowedly patched up out of a ballad by mr lamb of norham  with touches from the more ancient version  kempton  mr jacobs has performed the service of compiling an excellent version of  jack th giantkiller from two old chapbooks itt the british museum it is in all substantial points the same as that of which grimm gives a summary in the notes on english folktales at the end of the  hausmarchen a satisfactory version has long been needed for the chapbooks which told the story well seem to have been altogether superseded by those which told it badly we wonder no one took the trouble to go to the british museum with this object before all the illustrations to this book are good but that which shows jack entering the giants castle wearing the cap which makes him invisible is very good indeed and decidedly original in the preface to the  cauld lad of hilton mr jacobs speaks of him as the contrariest brownie ever known but he was not more contrary than brownies always are or were  they always behaved just as the  cauld lad  did if they found things orderly and clean they at once proceeded to break furniture and crockery to turn everything topsyturvy and play uncomfortable tricks of all kinds if however the servants were dirty and disorderly and went to bed leaving their work undone the brownie immediately began to put all in good order a brownies mission was therefore to demoralise servants by showing them that it was wise policy to leave their work undone the servants who had to do with the cauld lad of hilton castlenot hall by the way as mr jacobs has it must have been good ones or they would have suffered no inconvenience from the nightly visitant the brownie of hilton was however supposed to be the ghost of a poor lad working about the place who had been murdered there which may account for the servants anxiety to get rid of him another part of a brownies mission seems to have been to teach ingratitude for any present of clothes or of anything more substantial than a little milk or food always resulted in depriving the household of his services if a fault can be found with this book it is that we do not always quite like the way in which the stories are told mr jacobs says in his preface generally speaking it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse will speak when she tells fairy tales this being the case the critic can but ask himself two questions has mr jacobs done this satisfactorily  and is it a thing that it is well to do  he has done it very well if he wishes his nurse to be a rather vulgar one of the present day it is not prudent however to adopt this form of narration unless the imaginary nurse be made to use a simple and rather antiquated phraseology as a nurse of a hundred years ago whose style was formed on the bible might have done all the events recorded in fairy tales are supposed to have taken place long ago and seem to demand a somewhat archaic or to say the least oldfashioned form of speech the critics sense of fitness was always a little ruffled ly mr dasents method of telling a tale and the same irritation is felt upon perusing such sentences as these   dartersays she  put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em a little  or  go you and get one o them there pies or  she sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry   or  he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents but that did not btop long or this in  childe rowland  and the thing to do is this  after you have entered the land of fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the burd ellen you must out

number of strangelooking beans  as you are so sharp said he i dont mind doing a swop with youyour cow for these beans  walker  says jack   wouldnt you like it  it is to be hoped that when mr jacobs republishes these stories with the  necessary paraphernalia referred to already he will carefully do away with the only thing that damps the readers pleasure in them by carefully revising the nurses

scenes in fairyland by canon atkinson macmillan  co household tales and fairy stories routledge  sons mr jacobs has put together a good collection of stories some of which were gathered into the fold of literature more than two thousand years ago in the  kathasarit sagara of somadeva while others are the jetsam and flotsam of the present day rescued by miss frere miss stokes major temple c here too are to be found some of the fables of bidpai and the jatakas being interpreted  kathasarit sagara means  ocean of the streams of story did somadevas title mean that all known stories of all known lands had streamed into the ocean of his collection and found a home there and in the country in which it was formed mr jacobs is evidently inclined to hold the contrary opinion and to believe that all other countries derived their fairy tales and fables from india the majority of the tales in this volume he writes  havo been known in the west in some form or other and the problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in farthest west and east surely if as mr jacobs asserts they existed or began to exist at one and the same time in farthest west and east there is no problem to solve for it would be manifest that they were not transmitted from one country to another but that each had its own independent origin some mr jacobs continues aa benfey in germany m cosquin in france and mr clouston in england have declared that india is the home of the fairy tale and that all european fairy tales have been brought from thence by crusaders by mongol missionaries by gipsies by jews by traders by travellers we are happy to find that mr jacobs though he exhibits a strong leaning towards this theory does not go so far as these writers were it true indeed we should have to believe that for more centuries than we dare to contemplate the children of rich and poor alike in europe went supperless to bed so far as food for the imagination was concerned and that the patient peasantry spent the long dark hours when work was impossible unamused and unamusing we do not believe that they waited until the lord of the land brought back a story from the crusades or an argosy of stories put into port from the far east we prefer to believe with the grimmsthe farseeing fathers of all literature of research of this kindthat while the possibility nay in particular instances the probability of a story passing from one people to another and there firmly rooting itself on the foreign soil is not to be denied the property in fairy tales is common to all and that the  selfsame stories crop up again and again in places most widely remote from each other like a spring which forces its way up in spots which lie far apart and just as wherever the eye can pierce we tind domestic animals grain field and kitchen utensils household furniture armsin fact all the things without which social life would be impossibleso do we also rind sagas and stories corresponding with each other in a striking and yet independent manner they are just as much a necessity of existence as these things and only where avarice and the jarring wheels of machinery benumb every other thought can one imagine it possible to live without them this being the case in comparing the stories of various countries it is by no means necessary to attribute a storys origin to the country in which it appears to have been first current we must always remember that the number of rootstories is extremely limited so that a good deal of similarity must naturally be looked for the jatakas or birth stories of

told in three or four pages theo gift tells it in twentynine she ignores chronology and eastern local colour with absolute frankness and courage in one sense to ignore facts of time and space is to catch the very spirit of fairyland in another to talk of perambulators in a tale which was not new when it was committed to writing in the fifth century ad gives a shock to any reader who cares about the fitness of things deserts in theo giftrs stories seem to have a good deal of juicy grass interspersed with the sand  farmyards appear to be very like english farmyards  cows are called buttercup  and buttermilk aud clover seem to be going there is a story indeed which begins once upon a time in the days when the great great greatgrandfathers of our great great greatgrandfathers were just having their first breeches made there lived a farmer with one daughter of whom he was very fond he was a rich farmer and his fields were full of corn and clover and his orchards of apples and plums  and he had plenty of horses and cattle and sheep and poultry and pigs and pigeons and a yarddog and kitchen cat and every one of them was so well fed and cared for that even the geese in the pond said   this is the best place in the whole country to live in and so said the sage and onions too this is a hopelessly lower class nineteenth century presentment a great many more greatgreatgreatgrandfathers are needed to take us back to the time when these stories were  human natures daily food and a great deal more study to imbue us with its spirit and yet in spite of aberrations of this kind the book is often entertaining and well written we must not omit to commend mr oswald von glenns illustrations the ten little stories miss goddard has printed will be welcomed in the nursery and probably all the better liked for bearing a strong family likeness to other stories which have long reigned supreme in that domain if the  beauty  brings down the  beast on the father by asking for a few samples of the great wall of china instead of the conventional rose the story is still pleasant reading and the beast though much less interesting is as placable as the beast of our early affections if the japanese red riding hood becomes a  blue mantle and the wolf turns into the allegory of the nile the story is still a story in addition to these departures from the wellbeaten track we have a scandinavian somewhere close to the north pole jack the giantkilleronly he ought not to have been called jan an egyptian puss in boots which becomes a cat in yellow slippers and a persian jack and the beanstalk in which the beanstalk is turned into a carrot with a bushy top and jack has to descend underground instead of climbing up to dangerous heights this little book is sent forth with no hint of any desire to do more than amuse children from beginning to end there is not a word as to the origin of the stories or any of their incidents we accept it on its own showing the stories are prettily told fairyland appears to be easily entered from the moorland parish over which canon atkinson has for forty and odd years presided and yorkshire scenery and dialect come largely into play in his volume when they do not coin words for themselves the hero and heroine use those in vogue in cleveland they  scuttle people off home and encounter other people who stump about cannily and laugh a ramshackle laugh the fairies too wash their clothes at  the kerd of the country side and bittle them on the big flat stones near by this is pleasant enough but when  miss mary who does lessons is surprised over things and continually expresses her surprise by exclaiming  whatever will nurse say we wish she had done these lessons to more purpose miss mary is disappointing  instead of being witty she is snappish when she opens her mouth it is most frequently to say  psha and in spite of her various experiences in fairyland she cannot be persuaded to believe in fairies a book of this kind makes us hasten to renew our allegiance to the incomparable alice and the sweet unreasonableness of lewis carroll it is unreasonableness which never runs too

nutt mr jacobs though he be editor of oklore looks not to the gay science for spiritual guidaince lie is happily conscious of the literary qiuaslity of the material he handles and remembers that rimitive man had as keen a sense of art as his mental developmnent and the hitter struggle for life would lermit and sol he has selected and edited his celtic airy taes not to illuminate the genesis of the human brain but with the far more laudable object of amusing the young herein he should be successfcal at any rate he has contrived to entertain the old and perhaps the young are not vastly more ritical mr jacobs has thrown his net wide and has gathered in stories from the printed works of campbell kennedy hyde curtin and the rest nor has he shrunk from editing and adapting such work as he elected to reprint indeed his book is completely purged of pedantry his single aim being to amuse he has ingeniously blent the comic and the romantic and has positively published a book without an afterthought a conspicuous triumph in these days of moralities true in his preface he murmurs something about a union of hearts but he obtrudes no  views and one little excursion into the prevailing vice may be condoned the book has its blemishes the story of beth gellert for instance is wholly out of place mr jacobs version is a bald paraphraseworthy of a boardschool boyof the hon w r spencers poem taken from an obviously literary source the narrative chimes neither in diction nor in eftect with the genuine folktale in vain does mr jacobs inform you that the story is an apologue which is met with in every country from india to wales the question may scarce be answered authoritatively and there seems no reason why it should not be a record of actual experience the tidelity of the dog the sudden anger of the master may easily be matched outside the radius of folklore and once you grant the story the moral follows as a matter of course a child of six could hardly hear of elerts death and not take it as a warning against human iinpctulositv but even if it be a recurrence of the old type its sctting is so modern and the atsence of the supernatural and the inconsequent so marked that it were far better away however it serves to suggest to mr jacobs a learned note which we trust no child will be induced to read now and then too the diction generally studied and correct descends into the commonest slang but these are venial errors  and the book in their despite is as pleasant a collection as you could wish to imeet the stories are both quaint and picturesque of

B6905,['8963210'],  science hausa folklore customs proverbs dbe collected and transliterated with english translation and notes by r sutherland rattray with a preface by r r marett 2 vols oxford clarendon press the foundation of this valuable work is a voluminous manuscript prepared at the request of mr rattray by shaihu a malani or learned scribe of the hausa people northern nigeria the liberality of the government of the gold coast in granting a subvention for the present publication has enabled what is virtually a facsimile of a selection from the ms in arabic characters to be given and to this mr rattray has added a transliteration into roman text a translation into english and many critical and grammatical notes the work is divided into five parts  the first a short history purporting to give the origin of the hausa nation and the story of their conversion to the mohammedan religion in which we find as might be expected a mixture of a mythological element with traditions of historical fact tracing the origin of the people of hausa land from the district of bornu bordering on lake chad the second part contains twentyone stories in which people are the heroes and heroines each story begins with the formula   this is a story about people or about a bushburning or an alliance or a certain chief or as the case may be a tale a tale let it go let it come and ends with the formula  off with the rats head which is explained by mr rattray to mean that the story is ended the rats head ls off that is the end of him it sometimes takes the expanded form of 44 the rat will not eat my head rather shall i eat his head the son of a worthless fellow the third part contains nine animal stories as of a hyena whose singing so pleased a lion and leopard that they left off fighting and danced away another hyena who had swallowed a girl and being torn in two by a lion disgorged her a third who was thrown by a lizard when the larger animals had failed to throw him  a hegoat a beetle  a spider and crows some of them point a moral as that evil longing and evil greed are not beautiful in others the moral is left to be inferred as where a beetle and a lion entered into an alliance to procure food   that was the origin of what you do now if you want to get food when you feel hungry for you join with some powerful person first then you get it the fourth part describes the customs and arts of the hausa in marriage an old woman is employed to present gifts from the suitor to the parents of the girl and when they are satisfied the courtship begins the bride is prepared for marriage by putting on henna whereupon she and her sisters weep copiously it is the custom for them to do so  they do  not do so because they want to while the bride proceeds quietly to her husbands house a substitute bride is brought there on horseback the marriage feast is held four days afterwards and completes the ceremony the rubbing with henna is also practised on the bridegroom before the arrival of the bride twelve years is considered to be the proper marriageable age for a girl on the naming of a child a ram is slaughtered and the flesh divided and given as alms circumcision is practised on boys of ten years old and clitoridectomy on girls before the burial of the dead much ceremonial washing and in some cases anointing have to be performed the section relating to the arts contains the description of brasscasting by the cireperdue process which has been already communicated to the anthropological institute from mr rattrays ms by mr henry balfour journal rai xl 525 as taken down from the lips of ali the artist the fifth part which is a collection of 133 proverbs was written by a different hand it defines a proverb not unhappily as  words which are taken and jumbled up that a man may not know their meaning some of them may be cited as specimens  the nose does not know the flavour of the salt    the cat is not at home because of that the mice are playing    terror is a thing of the wilds shame of the abode of men   44 live patiently in the world know that those who hate you are more numerous than they who love you   he who goes surety is the one who has to pay   and the like mostly of a pessimistic type mr rattrays notes are largely grammatical he finds in the ms the use of a definite article though canon robinson in his 4 hausa grammar had said  there is no article in hausa   also of a present participle though another authority had said  there is no present participle in hausa   and in other respects shows how unwise it is to attempt to prove a negative the reader in social anthropology in the university of oxford who is also president of the folklore society contributes a preface in which he expresses approval of the method pursued by mr rattray of obtaining a ms version of the folktales and customs from a competent native a method which is practicable only where the community is so far advanced in civilization as to have an educated and literary class among it he further points out the value of the ms as here reproduced not only to officials who have to deal with native scribes but also to an educated hausa who may wish to learn english collections of hausa folktales have already been published by major tremearne and others and much literature exists on the subject of hausa culture but for the reasons given mr rattrays work has a definite value of its own we must not omit to note the ornamental designs with which the scribe has embellished his manuscript,folklore

we shall select two or three of these irish legends the first is entitled the lrg end of bottlehill come listen to a tale of times of old come listen to me it was in the good days when the little people most impudently called fairies were more frequently seen than they are in these unbelieving times that a farmer named mlick purcell rented a few acres of barren around in the neighbourlhood of the once celebrated preceptory of mourne situated about three miles from mallow and thirteen from  the beautiful city called cork mick had a wife and family they all did what they could and that was but little for the poor mans had no child grown up big enough to help him iii his work and all the poor woman could do was to mind the children and to milk the one cow and to boil the potatoes and carry the eggs to market to mallow but with all they could do twas hard enough on them to pay the rent well they did manacre it for a good while but at last came a bad year and the little grain of oats was all spoiled and the chickens died of the pip and the pi got the measlesshe was sold in m1allow and brought almost nothing and poor miick found that he hadnt enough to half pay his rent and two gales were due why then mlolly says lie  what 11 we do v  wisha then mavournene wlhat would you do but take the cow to the fair of cork and sell her says she and monday is fair day and so you must go tomorrow that the poor beast may be rested agaim the fair and what 11 we do when she s gone says mick sorrowfully  never a know i know lick but sure god wont leave us without him mick and you know bow good he was to us when poor little billy was sick and we had nothingr at all for him to take that good doctor gentlemen at ballydahin come riding and asking for a drink of milk and how he gave us

ascending into the clear blue sky  till its form like a speck in the airinesn blending and thrilling with music was nmelting in light m mick crossed himself listening as he advanced to the sweet song of the lark 1ut thinking notwithstanding all the time of tile little old man when just as he reached tfie summit of the hill and cast his eves over the extensive prospect before and around him he was startled and rejoiced by the same wellknown voice well mick purcell j toll you you would be a rich man  nieed then sure enough 1 was thats no lie for you sir good morning to you but it is not rich i

to brings home the bottlewell he arrived with it safely enough and called out as soon as he saw molly oh  sure ife another bottle   arrah  then have you  why then you re a lucky man amick purcell thats whifat you are  in an instant she put ev ery thing right and alick looking at his bottle exult inglt cried out  bottle do your duty in a twinkling two great stout men with bio cudgels issued from the bottle i do not know how they got room in it and belaboured poor mick and his wife and all his family till they lay on the floor when in they event again mlick as soon as be recovered got up and looked about him he thomudht and thought and at last he took up his wife and his children and leaving them to recover as well as they could he took the bottle under his coat and went to his landlord who had a great company he got a servant to tell him lhe wanted to speak to him and at last he came out to mick v well what do you want now nothing sir only i heave another bottle 01 ho is it as good as the first yes sir and better if you like i will slhow it to you before all the ladies and gentlemen c come along then so saying mick was brought into the great hall where he sat bis old

the landlord nvas tumbled on the floor ladies and gentlemen servants and all were running and roaringr and sprawling and kicking and 5hrieking wine  cups and salvers were knocked about in every direction until the landlord called out  stop those two devils mick purcell or ill have you hanged   they never shall stop said amick till i get my own bottle that i see up there at top of that slhelf 4 give it down to him give it down to hnim before wve are all killed  says the landlord m mick put his bottle in his bosom in iumped the two men into the new bottle and he carried them home i need not lengthen mv story by telling how he got richer than ever how his son married his landlords only daughter how he and his wife died when they were very old and how some of the servants fighting at their wake broke the bottles but still the hill has the name upoil i it ay and so twill be always bottle luill to the end of the world and so it ought for it is a strange story the next legend we shall quote is entitled tihe field of boliauns torn fitzpatrick was the eldest son of a comfortable farmer who lived at ballincollig tom was just turned of nineandtwentywhen he met the following adventure and was as clever clean tight goodlooking a boy as any in the whole county cork one fine day in harvestit was indeed ladyday in harvest that every body knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the yeartom was taking a ramble through the ground and went sauntering along the sunny side of a lhedge thinking in himself where would be the great harin if people instead of idling and going about doing nothing at all were to shake out the hay and bind and stook the oats that was lying on the ledge specially as the weather had been rather broken of late he all of a sudden heard a clacking sort of noise a little before him in the hedge dear me said tom  but isnt it surprising to hear the storieclhatters sinainry so late in the season  so tom stole on going on the tops of his toes to try if he could get a sight of what was making the noise to see if hie was right in his guess the noise stopped but as tom looked sharply through the bushes what should he see in a nook of the hledge but a brown pitcher that might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor and by and by a little wee dinny dony bit of an old man with a little innffy of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his head and a deeshy daushy leather apron hangingbefore him pulled out a little wooden stool and stood up upon it and dipped a ittle piggin into the pitcher and took out the full of it and put it beside the stool and thern sat down under the pitcher and began to work at putting a heelpiece on a bit of a broglue just fitting for himself well by the powers  said tom to himself  i often etad toll of the cluricaune and to tell gods truth i never rightly believed in them but here s one of them in real earnest if i go knowingly to work i in a made man they say a body must never take their eyes off them or they 11 escape  tom now stole on a little farther with his eye fixed on the little man just as a cat does with a mouse or as we read in books the rattlesnake does withl the birds he wants to enchant so when he got up quite close to him  god bless your work neighbour said tom  the little man raised up his head and thank you kindly said he  i wonder youd be working on the holiday  said tom t hats my own business not yours was the reply w jrell may be you d be civil enough to tell us what you ve got in the pitcher there  said torn i  that i will with pleasure said lhe its good beer b eer  said tom  thunder and fire where did you get it  w where lid i oet it is it why i made it and what do you think i made it of  devil a one of me knows said toin but of malt i suppose what else  there you re out i made it of hcath of heath  said tom bursting out laughint sure you dont think me to be such a fool as to believe that  i io as you please said he  but what i tell you is the truth did you never hear tell of the danes   and that i did said tom  werent them the fellows we gave such a licking when they thouglht to take limerick from us  hen  said the little man drily is that all you know about the matter  well but about them danes said tom  why all the about them there is is that when they were here they taught us to make beer out of the heath and the secret s in mny family ever since  twill you give a body a taste of your beer  said tom  ill tell you what it is young manit wouild be fitter for you to be lookiing after your fathiers property thaii to be botherino decent quiet people with your foolish questions there now while you re idling away your time here theres the cows have broke into the oats and are knocking the corni all about  tom was taken so by surprise with this that lhe wvas just on the very point of turnincr round when he recollected himself so afiraid that the like might happen again hie made a grab at the cluricaune and catught him up in his hand but in his hurry hie overset the pitcher and spilled all the beer so that hie could not get a taste of it to tell what sort it was isle then swore what lhe would not do to him if he did not show him where his money wats tom looked so nwicked and so bloodyminded that the little man was quite frightened so says hli 1 conie along n itll j11c a 0o111 le of fields off and ill show vvu a tvtw k jf gold i i i i i so they went and tom held the cluricaune fast in his hand and never took his eves from off him though they had to cross hedges and ditches and a crooked bit of bog for the cluricaune seemed out of pure mischief to pick out the hardest and most con trary way till at last they came to a geat field all full of boliaun buies ragweed and the cluricaune pointed to a big boliaun and says hie  dig under that bohiaun and youll get the vreat crock all full of guineas tom in his hurry had never minded three bringing a spade with him so he thought to run home and fetch one and that hie might know the place again he took off one of h red garters and tied it round the boliaun i suppose said the cluricaune very civilly youve no farther occasion for me no says tom you may go away now if you please and god speed you and may good lick attend you wherever you go well good bye to you tom fitzpatrick said the luricaune and much good may do you with what youll get 6so tom ran for the dear life till hle came home anid got a spade and then away with him as hard as he could go back to the tield of boliauns but when hie got there lo arnd behold not a boliaun in the field but had a red garter the very identical model of his own tied about it and as to diggi g up the wnhole field that was all nonsense for there was more than forty good irish acres in it so tom cane horn again with his spade on h is shoulder a little cooler than he went and inany s the hearty curse lhe grave the cluricaune every time he thoulght of the neat turn he had served him the last we shall quote isthe little sh0e now

B4381,"['6455904', '8914095', '3161555', '8787991', '8953016', '6212927']",  english fairy tales by joseph jacobs d nuttas suredly one of the most delightful collections of fairy tales that we possess in english and one that is of especial value since the tales are not merely translations the word  english however is somewhat misleadingso many of the tales are scotch it would be of interest also to know the actual source of the tales which mr jacobs heard in australia many of the tales are of course familiar to all students of folklore in english forms and i am not sure that mr jacobs versions are always the best occasionally too one seems to miss the genuine ring not of the folktale but of the folktelling and there are certain omissions thatunless mr jacobs is as i hope contemplating a second volumeare difficult to account for but despite small faults of commission and omission faults one only notices because the work is so good thc volume is most welcome only one protest  tom tit tot mr jacobs declares is  superior to any of the continental variants with which he is acquainted it may be that i am prejudiced and that therefore the german variant which delighted me as a child still seems to me the best be this as it may to me at least  rumpelstilzchen  seems more graceful more humorous and more dramatic than tom tit tot but whatever the grownup folk may say the little folk will be of only one opinion concerning these  talesthey will receive them with a chorus of delight and after all are not children the best as they are also the most honest of critics  the admirable illustrations by j d batten are worthy of the tales no wellregulated nursery should be without these old old stories in their charming new dress  celtic fain tales solectod and edited bv joseph jacobs editor of folklore illustrated by john d batten nutt tales and lng ends by av carew hazlitt sonnenschein  co mn jacobs tolls us in the preface that his chief difficulty has been that of selecting where there is so much ready to hand his collection consists of twentysix stories representing ireland scotland wales and cornwall but chiefly ireland and scotland in fact though brythons have here onl five storiesfour from wales  the shepherd of myddvai the wooing of olwen the brewery of eggshells and  beth gellort and one from cornwall  the tale of ivan mr jacobs however explains that it is not his fault that little wales is not better represented and hopes that the eisteddfod may do something for welsh folklore by offering prizes for collecting folktales in the principality this has been done to some extent but with no great rosults as yet at least so far as though public is concerned thus the eisteddfod held in london a few years ago awarded a prize to the rev elias owen for work done in this field  but what has becomo of it  we are not awaro that it has ever boon published then as to complete stories of any length we feel pretty certain that there are none such to be found in wales at the present day and this is our idea also as to though time not long ago when that peculiar collector of folklore wirt sikes flourished mr jacobs gives his readers clearly to understand whero ho has found his tales and how he has dealt with them modifying or excising though original translations from celtic hero and there where he found them ovorliteral for his avowed object is not to appeal to english folklorists and scholars but to intorost and please a more youthful class of roaders and wo certainly think that he has boen eminently successful mr batten has also done his part admirably and both he and mr jacobs leave one under the impression that they have not themselves escaped the fascination whereby  though captive celt has enslaved his captor in though realm of imagination though present volume accordingly attempts to begin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years and it may bo trusted to act in some measure as an antidote to the ruthless unreason of the budding golthers of our day by no means the least interesting portion of the volume is that consisting of the thirty pages of notes to the stories these it is neodloss to say are not quite exhaustive but it would be invidious to suggest here a variety of small additions which occur to us as of interest to the specialist all the notes aro decidedly instructive reading and some such as that in which the origin of the beth gelert story of llewelyn and his greyhound is traced break new ground others illustrate accidentally the position of mr jacobs in the folklore world for our readers are doubtless aware that folklorists aro divided in opinion on the question of parallel developments as against borrowing wo may cite the following passage as both explaining what we mean and dealing with a curious feature of folktales it occurs in mr jacobss notes on the story of  hudden and dudden p 248  it is indeed curious to find as m cosquin points out a cunning fellow tied in a sack getting out by crying i wont marry the princess in countries so far apart as ireland sicilyafghanistanand jamaicait is indeed impossible to think these are disconnected and for drolls of this kind a good case has been made out for the borrowing hypotheses by m cosquin and mr clouston who borrowed from whom is another and more difficult question which has to be judged on its merits in each individual case probably in this instance all would agree that there has been borrowing by somebody  but in some cases the other theory namely that of parallel developments in a similarity of circumstances is held by some students of folklore and to these mr jacobs at the recent international folklore congress gave the name of  casualists what is to bo the name of the other partythat to which he himself belongs probably some such name as  niigrationists  would do as well as any other but the difference between the two schools is only one of degree the migrationists being as they themselves think more sensitive to though numerical argument from a calculation of though chances against independent developments in each particular instance before we turn to mr hazlitts book we may bo permitted to express our regret that leisure was not found to revise the printers errols moro carefully for if words which are not english are introduced into an english book pains should be taken to have them spelled in some way recognised in the languages to which the belong  if you must needs speak of  the cymru you should know that it means  the wales and that you have to write  the cymry  if you wish to allude in that way to  the welsh people we have seen more than ono way of spelling the gaelic word for antiquary or storyteller but ve have never before seen it made into theenachie similarly  archroologia britannia and similar slips in the notes look strange and ought to disappear in future editions of which thore will we doubt not be many as the volume cannot fail to become popular and deservedly so it is difficult to know for what class of readers mr hazlitts book is designed not surely for students of folklore for in the preamble to robin hood on his 242nd page mr hazlitt says that  in dealing with this ancient and favourite tradition the editor has for the first time made use of such material only as appeared to him authentic so exactly half the book is valueless for scientific purposes unless as we gather from other parts of it mr hazlitts command of english is not always so complete as to enable him to say what he means students of folklore too require much more precise information than is here afforded and will naturally prefer to go to the fountain head for these interesting but wellknown old stories neither can the book be intended for young persons  or children for various incidents are related with  the masculine frankness of the old time nor yet for lovers of ballad poetry for none such when reading a selection of ballads from the  reliques which have been digested into prose whatever that may mean  would admit that  the probability is that many of the ancient tales here found present themselves for the first time in an intelligible form or that the handling of say for instance the nutbrowne maid is faithful and judicious and has made it capable of yielding to the lover of the ballad and folktale a store at once of entertainment and instruction what possible instruction is to he obtained from a translation which changes 0 lord what is th s worldys blysse tfhat ohangeth as the mone  my somers day in lusty may is

noon i hear thee say farewell nay nay we are not so soon to depart  if the until death us dopart of the marriage service had not been altered into u until death us do part almost every one would havo known that to depart means to part if mr hazlitt knew it he should have completed the work of modernization hy saying  part here to our mind however such treatment of our old ballads is both barbarous and unnecessary never yet have we seen the child of fair intelligence who could not after taking thought read and got pleasure out of  chevy chace  adam bel the  battle of otterburn and many others which have had both poetry and point taken out of them by mr hazlitt for a bit of fine confused writing showing a great deal of appreciation of and contempt for theso ballads and legends we commend our readers to the preface it is written in the manner of a schoolboy who thinks that a good style can be acquired by the reduplication of nouns verbs and adjectives  more celtic fairy tales ra selected and edited by joseph jacobs illustrated by j d batten nutt mr jacobs first book of  celtic fairy tales did not exhaust the gems in his collection wvere it only to provide a place for one of the most beautiful stories in the world the fate of the children of lir a second volume would have been justified and the black horse and how cormac macart went to fairy  are two others in this second series that must fascinate all with taste for tales of the celtic imagination mr jacobs versions keep the commonsensible rather than the poetical features of the stories in the foreground but that is perhaps no disadvant from  more celtic fairy tales nutt age in a book first meant for children mr batten is as good as ever the illustrations to  powel prince of dyfed and  paddy okelly are capital he knows how to relieve his most fearsome pictures by a touch of humour  english fairy tales by joseph jacobs illustrated by j d batten nutt the flyleaf of this book tells us how to get into it the difficulty however will not be how to get into it but how to get out of it for from first to last almost without an exception these stories are delightful there are old friends among them which never can appear too often there are others with which we have hitherto only had a bowing acquaintance and there are one or two which are entirely new we are not quite sure about the whole party being englishone or two seem to have strayed out of grimms  kinder und hausmiirchen and to have been a little weakened on the way some of them judging from the point of view of folklore might certainly have been more appropriately included in a scotch collection mr jacobs explains their appearance thus  i have also included some stories that have only been found in lowland scotch i have felt justified in doing this as of the twentyone folktales contained in chamberss  popular rhymes of scotland no less than sixteen are also to be found in an english form the reasoning here is not strong but the stories are good we can imagine mr jacobs feeling the same pious joy that thrilled the old north  country steward who recounting to his absent lord the depredations caused by a foray made by the scots when  the falsehearted thieving loons  drove away flocks and herds over the border wound up by saying  but thankit be the lord we have outstolen them the more stories of this kind that are  lifted  into books that the public are likely to read the better and as mr jacobs informs his readers that some day he is going  to treat the subject of the english folktale on a larger scale with all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus  his readers may for the present wink at an english fairy tale called the laidly worm which is avowedly patched up out of a ballad by mr lamb of norham  with touches from the more ancient version  kempton  mr jacobs has performed the service of compiling an excellent version of  jack th giantkiller from two old chapbooks itt the british museum it is in all substantial points the same as that of which grimm gives a summary in the notes on english folktales at the end of the  hausmarchen a satisfactory version has long been needed for the chapbooks which told the story well seem to have been altogether superseded by those which told it badly we wonder no one took the trouble to go to the british museum with this object before all the illustrations to this book are good but that which shows jack entering the giants castle wearing the cap which makes him invisible is very good indeed and decidedly original in the preface to the  cauld lad of hilton mr jacobs speaks of him as the contrariest brownie ever known but he was not more contrary than brownies always are or were  they always behaved just as the  cauld lad  did if they found things orderly and clean they at once proceeded to break furniture and crockery to turn everything topsyturvy and play uncomfortable tricks of all kinds if however the servants were dirty and disorderly and went to bed leaving their work undone the brownie immediately began to put all in good order a brownies mission was therefore to demoralise servants by showing them that it was wise policy to leave their work undone the servants who had to do with the cauld lad of hilton castlenot hall by the way as mr jacobs has it must have been good ones or they would have suffered no inconvenience from the nightly visitant the brownie of hilton was however supposed to be the ghost of a poor lad working about the place who had been murdered there which may account for the servants anxiety to get rid of him another part of a brownies mission seems to have been to teach ingratitude for any present of clothes or of anything more substantial than a little milk or food always resulted in depriving the household of his services if a fault can be found with this book it is that we do not always quite like the way in which the stories are told mr jacobs says in his preface generally speaking it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse will speak when she tells fairy tales this being the case the critic can but ask himself two questions has mr jacobs done this satisfactorily  and is it a thing that it is well to do  he has done it very well if he wishes his nurse to be a rather vulgar one of the present day it is not prudent however to adopt this form of narration unless the imaginary nurse be made to use a simple and rather antiquated phraseology as a nurse of a hundred years ago whose style was formed on the bible might have done all the events recorded in fairy tales are supposed to have taken place long ago and seem to demand a somewhat archaic or to say the least oldfashioned form of speech the critics sense of fitness was always a little ruffled ly mr dasents method of telling a tale and the same irritation is felt upon perusing such sentences as these   dartersays she  put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em a little  or  go you and get one o them there pies or  she sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry   or  he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents but that did not btop long or this in  childe rowland  and the thing to do is this  after you have entered the land of fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the burd ellen you must out with your fathers brand and off with their head or this from  jack and the beanstalk    right you are said the man  and here they are the very beans themselves he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of strangelooking beans  as you are so sharp said he i dont mind doing a swop with youyour cow for these beans  walker  says jack   wouldnt you like it  it is to be hoped that when mr jacobs republishes these stories with the  necessary paraphernalia referred to already he will carefully do away with the only thing that damps the readers pleasure in them by carefully revising the nurses language  literature fairy tales indian fairy tales edited by joseph jacobs nutt fairy tales from the far east by theo gift lawrence  bullen fairy tales in other lands by julia goddard cassell  co scenes in fairyland by canon atkinson macmillan  co household tales and fairy stories routledge  sons mr jacobs has put together a good collection of stories some of which were gathered into the fold of literature more than two thousand years ago in the  kathasarit sagara of somadeva while others are the jetsam and flotsam of the present day rescued by miss frere miss stokes major temple c here too are to be found some of the fables of bidpai and the jatakas being interpreted  kathasarit sagara means  ocean of the streams of story did somadevas title mean that all known stories of all known lands had streamed into the ocean of his collection and found a home there and in the country in which it was formed mr jacobs is evidently inclined to hold the contrary opinion and to believe that all other countries derived their fairy tales and fables from india the majority of the tales in this volume he writes  havo been known in the west in some form or other and the problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in farthest west and east surely if as mr jacobs asserts they existed or began to exist at one and the same time in farthest west and east there is no problem to solve for it would be manifest that they were not transmitted from one country to another but that each had its own independent origin some mr jacobs continues aa benfey in germany m cosquin in france and mr clouston in england have declared that india is the home of the fairy tale and that all european fairy tales have been brought from thence by crusaders by mongol missionaries by gipsies by jews by traders by travellers we are happy to find that mr jacobs though he exhibits a strong leaning towards this theory does not go so far as these writers were it true indeed we should have to believe that for more centuries than we dare to contemplate the children of rich and poor alike in europe went supperless to bed so far as food for the imagination was concerned and that the patient peasantry spent the long dark hours when work was impossible unamused and unamusing we do not believe that they waited until the lord of the land brought back a story from the crusades or an argosy of stories put into port from the far east we prefer to believe with the grimmsthe farseeing fathers of all literature of research of this kindthat while the possibility nay in particular instances the probability of a story passing from one people to another and there firmly rooting itself on the foreign soil is not to be denied the property in fairy tales is common to all and that the  selfsame stories crop up again and again in places most widely remote from each other like a spring which forces its way up in spots which lie far apart and just as wherever the eye can pierce we tind domestic animals grain field and kitchen utensils household furniture armsin fact all the things without which social life would be impossibleso do we also rind sagas and stories corresponding with each other in a striking and yet independent manner they are just as much a necessity of existence as these things and only where avarice and the jarring wheels of machinery benumb every other thought can one imagine it possible to live without them this being the case in comparing the stories of various countries it is by no means necessary to attribute a storys origin to the country in which it appears to have been first current we must always remember that the number of rootstories is extremely limited so that a good deal of similarity must naturally be looked for the jatakas or birth stories of buddha have with the assistance of prof rhysdavids supplied theo gift with nine excellent stories for children nine however would by no means have sufficed had she not lengthened them considerably sometimes pleasantly and judiciously at others we are tempted to ask her to study one of the stories she has selected  the tortoise that could not hold its tongue that story bytheby in the original is told in three or four pages theo gift tells it in twentynine she ignores chronology and eastern local colour with absolute frankness and courage in one sense to ignore facts of time and space is to catch the very spirit of fairyland in another to talk of perambulators in a tale which was not new when it was committed to writing in the fifth century ad gives a shock to any reader who cares about the fitness of things deserts in theo giftrs stories seem to have a good deal of juicy grass interspersed with the sand  farmyards appear to be very like english farmyards  cows are called buttercup  and buttermilk aud clover seem to be going there is a story indeed which begins once upon a time in the days when the great great greatgrandfathers of our great great greatgrandfathers were just having their first breeches made there lived a farmer with one daughter of whom he was very fond he was a rich farmer and his fields were full of corn and clover and his orchards of apples and plums  and he had plenty of horses and cattle and sheep and poultry and pigs and pigeons and a yarddog and kitchen cat and every one of them was so well fed and cared for that even the geese in the pond said   this is the best place in the whole country to live in and so said the sage and onions too this is a hopelessly lower class nineteenth century presentment a great many more greatgreatgreatgrandfathers are needed to take us back to the time when these stories were  human natures daily food and a great deal more study to imbue us with its spirit and yet in spite of aberrations of this kind the book is often entertaining and well written we must not omit to commend mr oswald von glenns illustrations the ten little stories miss goddard has printed will be welcomed in the nursery and probably all the better liked for bearing a strong family likeness to other stories which have long reigned supreme in that domain if the  beauty  brings down the  beast on the father by asking for a few samples of the great wall of china instead of the conventional rose the story is still pleasant reading and the beast though much less interesting is as placable as the beast of our early affections if the japanese red riding hood becomes a  blue mantle and the wolf turns into the allegory of the nile the story is still a story in addition to these departures from

slippers and a persian jack and the beanstalk in which the beanstalk is turned into a carrot with a bushy top and jack has to descend underground instead of climbing up to dangerous heights this little book is sent forth with no hint of any desire to do more than amuse children from beginning to end there is not a word as to the origin of the stories or any of their incidents we accept it on its own showing the stories are prettily told fairyland appears to be easily entered from the moorland parish over which canon atkinson has for forty and odd years presided and yorkshire scenery and dialect come largely into play in his volume when they do not coin words for themselves the hero and heroine use those in vogue in cleveland they  scuttle people off home and encounter other people who stump about cannily and laugh a ramshackle laugh the fairies too wash their clothes at  the kerd of the country side and bittle them on the big flat stones near by this is pleasant enough but when  miss mary who does lessons is surprised over things and continually expresses her surprise by exclaiming  whatever will nurse say we wish she had done these lessons to more purpose miss mary is disappointing  instead of being witty she is snappish when she opens her mouth it is most frequently to say  psha and in spite of her various experiences in fairyland she cannot be persuaded to believe in fairies a book of this kind makes us hasten to renew our allegiance to the incomparable alice and the sweet unreasonableness of lewis carroll it is unreasonableness which never runs too

rimitive man had as keen a sense of art as his mental developmnent and the hitter struggle for life would lermit and sol he has selected and edited his celtic airy taes not to illuminate the genesis of the human brain but with the far more laudable object of amusing the young herein he should be successfcal at any rate he has contrived to entertain the old and perhaps the young are not vastly more ritical mr jacobs has thrown his net wide and has gathered in stories from the printed works of campbell kennedy hyde curtin and the rest nor has he shrunk from editing and adapting such work as he elected to reprint indeed his book is completely purged of pedantry his single aim being to amuse he has ingeniously blent the comic and the romantic and has positively published a book without an afterthought a conspicuous triumph in these days of moralities true in his preface he murmurs something about a union of hearts but he obtrudes no  views and one little excursion into the prevailing vice may be condoned the book has its blemishes the story of beth gellert for instance is wholly out of place mr jacobs version is a bald paraphraseworthy of a boardschool boyof the hon w r spencers poem taken from an obviously literary source the narrative chimes neither in diction nor in eftect with the genuine folktale in vain does mr jacobs inform you that the story is an apologue which is met with in every country from india to wales the question may scarce be answered authoritatively and there seems no reason why it should not be a record of actual experience the tidelity of the dog the sudden anger of the master may easily be matched outside the radius of folklore and once you grant the story the moral follows as a matter of course a child of six could hardly hear of elerts death and not take it as a warning against human iinpctulositv but even if it be a recurrence of the old type its sctting is so modern and the atsence of the supernatural and the inconsequent so marked that it were far better away however it serves to suggest to mr jacobs a learned note which we trust no child will be induced to read now and then too the diction generally studied and correct descends into the commonest slang but these are venial errors  and the book in their despite is as pleasant a collection as you could wish to imeet the stories are both quaint and picturesque of

B7319,['8703674'],  the myth of hiawatha and other oral legends mythologic and allegoric of the north ame rican indians by henry r schoolcraft lld philadelphia lippincott  co london triibner  co prof longfellow in the notes to hiawatha recognises the works of dr schoolcraft as the chief source from which his legends are taken the notoriety thus gained has moved this gentleman to reproduce with additions and in a revised form his algie researches which have been out of print for some years the peculiar opportunities which the author has enjoyed during a lengthened residence among the ojibways on an exploring expedition have not been lost he has collected a large number of the wild tales of the indians and he relates them with a simplicity which creates confidence in the accuracy of the translations made by the author and various friends named in the preface to the algie researches but not mentioned in the present work that there is a want of variety in the legends is not the fault of the author and that history and fiction are blended in them is assuredly not a circumstance peculiar to indian myths nor does it detract from their value their true interest beyond the quaint poetry which is occasionally to be traced in them is the insight which they give of indian character in them the man appears no pompous enunciator of commonplace truthsno cold abstraction of courage and enduranceas he has been represented by some novelists we see him with all his sagacity in small thingshis lack of extended vision and of the art and power of combinationhis suspicions ignorance and superstitions even hiawatha or manabozho in prose is a very different person from that hero in the poem those who have formed his acquaintance when decked in his poetical garb will be shocked to find that he is a notorious liar even among his compatriotsthat he invites his friends the birds and beasts to supper and firings their necks as they march by him at his request with their eyes shut  that he murders his hospitable friend the beaver in cold bloodand in short is hardly more respectable than his mythological brethren of greece old nohomis also in prose is said to have had a paramour in the shape of a beara strange form by the by for a lover however it might have fitly represented a married partner but while we recognise the value of these traditions as illustrations of the character of the indian they by no means possess the charm of the poetical versions during the perusal of some of them we felt to adopt the indian creed that the little servants of the great weeng the spirit of sleep were hammering at our temples in a manner that prevented our keeping our eyes open the indians admit however that these little spirits have no judgment which accounts for the sleep which occasionally overcomes them when floating above a fall or in other positions of danger and which may explain certain phenomena sometimes observed in our own churches while some are dull however others have a certain poetry of conception and strangeness of events that may amuse even after the rela j tion of the same or kindred tales by prof j longfellow but the most generally interesting portion of the book is that denominated  wild notes ofthe pibbigwun which contains some songs and small poems in the simple ideas of which though the metre and treatment are different much of the charm of the poem of hiawatha may be traced a very pretty allegory of niagara we extract an old grey man on a mountain lived he had daughters four and one and a tall bright lodge of the betula bark that glittered in the sun he lived on the very highest top for he was a hunter free where he could spy on the clearest day gleams of the distant sea 41 come out come out cried the youngest one  let us

B5233,['6668584'],  serbian folklore popular tales selected ana translated by madam csedomille mijatovies edited with an introduction by the rev w denton ma author of servia and the servians london  w isbister  co 1874 the servian stories collected by vuk stefanovich karajich and published by him at vienna in 1853 have been rendered so familiar to all students of popular tales by his daughters literal german translation which appeared at berlin in 1854 that there is no occasion to dwell upon the selections from his work which form the first third of the volume now before us of his fifty stories  madam csedomille mijatovies  has translated about a dozen the rest of her book being devoted to about as many specimens of  the  bosniacke narodne pripovijetke collected by the  society of young bosnia the first part of which collection was printed at sissek in croatia in 1870 these stories are not likely to be familiar to our readers and therefore some account of them may prove of interest in the bird girl a prince who cannot find a suitable wife is about to fling himself from the top of a high hill when he hears a voice behind him crying  stop for the sake of the three hundred and sixtyfive which are in the year then there appears an old man who tells him that on a neighbouring hilltop sits  an old woman with golden hair holding a bird in her bosom whoever can seize her by her hair without her having seen him and can take away that bird will become the happiest man in the world but the hill is covered  with the stony forms of princes whom the old woman has petrified while they were striving to gain the bird the prince of course succeeds forcing the hag to breathe  a blue wind towards the men of stone who straightway revive and to transform the bird by a kiss into a beautiful maiden who gratefully presents him with her hand and an allcompelling staff the first part of the story of  sir peppercorn is that of a wondrous child  so extremely small that they christened him  peppercorn who plays the part of our jack the giantkiller a giant has carried off peppercorns sister and killed his three elder brothers  but he rescues her and slays their murderer thc story is one frequently met with but a curious incident in it is the agreement entered into by the giant with each of his visitors that whoever of the two can devour a halfsheep first shall be at liberty to kill the other the elder brothers succumb under this trial but the youngest succeeds  at last peppercorn by trickery managed to get rid of his share of the sheep and according to the arrangement killed the giant the  trickery  is not explained it may have been similar to that which under similar circumstances jack employed towards the welsh giant the second part of the peppercorn story is that in which a demoniacal being successfully overcomes all but one of a party of companions but by that one is itself vanquished and pursued into its subterranean abode the conqueror being left to perish there by his perfidious friends but always escaping generally by means of a friendly bird the european adaptations of the story are generally somewhat commonplace as compared with the striking form it assumes in the calrauck version julgs kalmitkisclie miirchen no 3 and the bosnian variant offers no very remarkable features  bashchalek  is a curious version of the story of a prince whose three sisters are married to as many supernatural personages in this instance the kings of the dragons the falcons and the eaglesand is by them saved from a demon who has carried off his wife the demon is almost always found by the hero in a bluebeards or forbidden chamber and is freed by him in the present story the prince finds within such a room a man fast bound in iron and unable to reach though water which flows before his eyes touched by pity he not only gives the captive three draughts of the water but he also pours some of it over his head whereupon all the chains snap and the freed demon flies away with his liberators wife the story always ends with the discomfiture of the demon whoso life depends upon some external object frequently called his heart which is enclosed in a series of protecting envelopes in bash chaleks case his  strength  is in a bird which is inside the heart of a fox which is within a very high mountainan inferior series to those which figure in many of the numerous variants of the story of which  punchkin  and the giant who had no heart in his body  are the bestknown representatives in most of its features the shepherd and the kings daughter resembles other stories about an impostor who for some time enjoys the reward due to a true man but ono of its incidents is peculiar the hero acting under an old womans advice has bought a cow killed it and filled a pot with its suet this suet has the faculty of turning black people white so he carries it to  though black world where all the people aro black as chimneypots and realises a largo fortune by whitewashing its inhabitants and especially its king who is the blackest of all  one good turn deserves another  is the same story as grimms  eisenhans a supernatural being is imprisoned by a king but freed by the kings son who is consequently banished the grateful being assists the prince in all his undertakings eventually enabling him to win though hand of a fair princess though biter bit is a curious variant of the favourite tale of how a youth  who has fallen into the hands of a wizard or magician is rescued by his father ending as is thc case in many versions of the story with a series of transformations almost identical with that which the narrative of  the second royal mendicant in thc arabian nights has made so familiar bnt the opening is singular a man blessed with a hundred sons goss out in search of wives for them he long wanders fruitlessly but at last he finds a priest who is cursed with a hundred daughters and who therefore is obliged to plough his land without the aid of even so much as a boy a century of matches is arranged between the two families but on his way to the wedding the father of many sons leaves one of them at home and as the hundred brides and the ninetynine bridegrooms and the two hundred brideleaders and the two hundred witnesses and the hundred runners and the three hundred standardbearers and the rest of the party are going over a bridge it contracts and holds them all tight then a black giant appears and demands as a kind of toll that which the father of the bridegrooms has forgotten at home which is of course his overlooked son the sarao story forms the theme of  the trade that no one knows but its opening scene is formed by a valuable variant of the bluebeard story the forbidden chambers are three in number and are in a castle belonging to four giants the hero finds in the first chamber  a golden ass bound to a golden manger in the second  a very beautiful girl dressed all in gold and silver who sat combing her hair and setting in every tress a large diamond   and in the third a collection  of human heads these heads once belonged to young men like himself who having obeyed faithfully and strictly the orders of though giants had been killed by them  the three suitors  relates how three  nobles loved the same princess each having an equal claim on her affections they refer their dispute to the king her father who recommends them to settle it amicably so they all leave their native country and go into a faroff desert to live like hermits  the goldenhaired twins  is the wellknown story of the calumniated queen who is charged with having brought into the world puppies instead of princes in this variant her children are bnried alive and from above their grave spring up two trees bearing golden leaves and golden blossoms these are cut down and a bed is made of their wood the bed is burnt but two sparks fly out into the courtyard and become lambs with  golden horns they are killed but their fleeces glide down a river and turn into a box containing two goldenhaired boys who are eventually recognised as the calumniated queens children in  the dream of the kings son the most interesting feature is the blinding of an old man by vilas his eyesight is restored by means of a herb which a captured vila is forced to produce the vila being peculiar to servia and its neighbourhood all stories relating to that supernatural female are valuable the present story seems to be the original of the bohemian tale of the wicked wood fays see academy june 6 1874 p 628 the three brothers  is a strange and fatiguing medley of scraps of familiar tales but there figure in it two supernatural females of interest the first is a devouring girl who cuts her mothers throat and roasts her corpse saying the while i shall do the same with my three brothers one after the other and then i shall remain alone the mistress of the entire property she then having sharpened her teeth eats up the body of her mother all except the head the other singular female is an old woman who turns into ashes all that she touches with her little finger or the little toe of her left foot the story of ani mais as friends and enemies  is a somewhat clumsy variant of one of the numerous tales in which a hero is assisted by animals whom he has treated well the last story in the volume  the legend of st george is one of the most interesting treating as it does of the heathen people of  the troyan country a fabulous district dear to south slavonic romance on the whole these bosnian stories are not very good specimens of popular tales but they offer several points of interest to students mr denton has prefixed to the volume an introduction which ought to prove of service to the general reader containing references to a great number of authorities on folklore and giving from the writers own experience some interesting information about servian storytellers or rhapsodists we do not know if he or the translator is responsible for the references to  grimm  which figure as footnotes to the stories taken from karajichs collection jacob grimm wrote a preface to the german translation of the servian tales but that is not a sufficient reason for ascribing the book to him no reference is given in the case of  papalluga or the golden slipper  p 58  the stories are not

B2838,"['8663653', '8772463']",  old deccan days or hindoo fairy legends current in southern india collected from oral tradition by m frere with an introduction and notes by sir bartle frere the illustrations by c f frere murray many of those of our countrymen who have spent years in india will be surprised to find that our edd friends the fairies and goblins are as well known in hindu nurseries as in our own it is true that the names are different in the far east from those we give them but their doings are much the same and if we are to be devoured or frightened to death it matters very little whether the horrid monster who is to slay us is called a goblin or a ghid as in persia or a eakshas which is the term in these pages for such fiendish apparitions it must be owned however that if there be any difference in morale between the indian supernatural beings and those duly recognised here it is not in favour of the former the riikbhas seems upon the whole a more hope less and unmitigated fiend than his western brethren to the notorious bad qualities of blunderbore and other gigantic cannibals he adds an excessive filthiness which sinks him to the lowest depths in our estimation not content with chawing up ali the live children princes and princesses that he can meet with he is moreover addicted to tearing the decaying flesh off the bodies of criminals pending from the gallowstree and swallowing it wholesale he is further exceedingly dirty in his person and hence his fingernails are so poisonous that a human being falls down lifeless if scratched by one of them female rakshases present themselves as ugly old women with long claws instead of hands and with natural chignons of dreadfully tangled hair which must on no account ever be combed for excellent reasons to be found in these pages dirtier than the ogre the rakshas is less accommodating than the goblin and would on no account thresh out the corn or in any other way oblige the farmer or any one else like the lubber fiends of the west after these remarks the reader will not expect the rakshas to be a funny character he is simply frightful and disgusting though he sometimes makes a fool of himself by mistaking for instance a donkeys head and an enormous earthenware pot for an apparition of one of his own kin and similar blunders but the rakshas though literally a horrid fool is never amusing the fun of the indian fairy tale is done by the jackal the puck of the hindus one of the best stories in this volume is the jackal the barber and the brahmin in which the jackal plays all sorts of mischievous tricks upon the barber and befriends the brahmin after a comical fashion he induces the barber to join with him in buying a garden and eats up the fruit himself while he makes the barber believe it is not ripe he then marries the brahmins daughter for it turns out that he is in fact a prince who is a great magician and puts on a jackals skin and changes himself into a jackal for a frisk returning to his own shape when he pleases he gives the brahmin a melon which produces fruit full of jewels but the silly brahmin sells them all without looking inside and at last gets taken up on suspicion of theft the jackal then gives him a dish which produces inexhaustible supplies of food but the brahmin cannot keep his own counsel and the magical dish is taken by the rajah foralast present the jackal gives the brahmin a vessel out of which jump a rope and a stick which bind and beat the rajah and the purchaser of the gems until they return to the brahmin what they had taken from him the peris or fairies of these legends are much like other fairies they sleep in pomegranates fly where they please and fall in love with handsome youths ad libitum as a specimen of the tales we will give an extract from the story of surya bai or  the sun lady who is the daughter of a milkwoman and was carried off by eagles when an infant she grows up in the eagles nest which is a very comfortable bungalow indeed at the top of a tall tree the birds having gone a long journey to bring her a diamond ring she just escapes being eaten by a rakshas is rescued by a rajah whom she marries and is pushed into a well by his first wife she is then changed into a sunflower and next into a mango and recovers her human shape but has to grow up from infancy once again   now it came to piss that once when surya bai was taking water from the well for the old milkwoman the rajah rode by and as he saw her walking along he cried  that is my wife and rode after her as fast as possible surya bai hearing a gnat clatter of horses hoofs was frightened and ran home as fast as possible and hid herself and when though rajah reached the place there was only the old milkwoman to be seen standing at the door of her hut then the rajah said to her  give her up old woman you have no right to keep her she is mine she is mine1 but the old woman inswtred are you mad i dont know what you

remained silent wondering much for she knew her mistress bad been drownd in the i tank the old mi ik woman turned to surya i5ai i and said  my child you have lived lng with us j and been a nod daughter to me but i have never  asked you ymir hitory because i thought it must j be a sad  iv but if you do not far to tell it to me now t hnvld like to hear it surya bai  answered  motlier you speak true my story is  sad i beliv my real mother was a poer milk j woman like you and that she took me with her one dy wb n i was ipiite a little baby as she was gong to dl milk in the bazaar rut being tired with the long wuk sh sat down to rest and placed me also on the ground when suddenly a great ka de flew down and carried me away rut all the father and mother i ever knew were the two great eaglesah my child my child cried though milkwoman i was that poor woman the eagks hew away with my eldest girl when she waa only a year old have i found you after these many years  and she ran and called all her children and her husband to tellthemthe wonderful news then was there great rejoicing among them all when they were a little calmer her mother said to surya bai  tell us dear laughter how your life has been spent since first we lost you and surya bai went on the old eagles took me away to their home aud there i lived happily many years they loved to bring mo all the beautiful things they could find and at last one day they both went to fetch me a diamond ring from though red sea but while they were gone the fire went out iu the nest so i went to an old womans hut and got her to give me some fire and next day i dont know how it was as i was opening the outer door of the cage a sharp thing that was sticking in it ran into my hand and i fell down senseless i dont know how long i lay there but wheu i carno to myself i found though eagles must have com back and thought me dead and gone away for the diamond ring was on ray little finger a great many people were watching over me and amongst them was a rajah who asked me to go home with him and be his wife and he brought mo to this place and i was his ranee but his other wife the first ranee hated me for she was jealous and desired to kill me and one day she accomplished her purpose by pushing me into the tank for i was young and foolish and disregarded the warnings of my faithful old attendant who begged me not to go near the place ah  if i had only listened to her word i might have been happy still at these words the old attendant who had been sitting in the background rahed forward and kissed surya kais feet crying ah my lady   my lady have 1 found you at last and without j staying to hear more she ran back t though palace to tell the rajah though glad news then surya bai i told her parents how she had not wholly died in  ihe tank but becanic tv sunflower nnd how the first ranee seeing how feud though rajah was of the i plant had caused it to he thrown away  and then j how she had risen from the ashes of the sunflower in the form of a mango tree and how when the tret blossomed all her spirit wt nt into the little j mango flower and she ended by saying and i when the flower became fruit i know not by what  irresistible impulse i was induced to throw myself j into your milk can mother it was my destiny  and rs soon as you took me into your house i j began to recover my human form j of course the rajah soon finds surya bai  and they live happily for the rest of their days i sir b frere tells us in though introduction i  it is probable that most of the stories were i brought from among the lingaets of southern j india the sect to which annadesouzu tells us i her family belonged before their conversion to i christianity this anna de souza was the i ayah who narrated the stories and from whose lips miss frere avrote them down but the book reminds us very much of the gul i bakawali a tale translated into urdu by nihill chand from the persian of shaikh izz ttulhih there is the same  exuberance of imagination the same mixture of the persian peris and dews with the gods and goddesses of the hindu system such as ganpati parvati and shiva the story at page 19b of this volume of  the brahmin the tiger and the six judges will be found nearly word for word nt page zl of the gul i bakawali apropos of this the word written  buceoulee at page 130 of this book is no doubt bahoxtli though story of singh rajah at page 172 occurs in the hitopadcsa as the ninth fable of the book headed separation of friends this only shows how widely and how long the old hindu stories have circulated we cannot conclude without noticing a curious circumstance mentioned in the introduction it seems that ghosts are received with presented arms in india though they are only challenged here  in the more advanced and populous parts of the country though rakshas seems giving way to the  bhoot which more nearly resembles the mero ghost of modern european superstition but even in this diluted form such beings have an influence over indian imaginations to which it is difficult in these days to find any parallel in europe i found quite lately a traditionary order in existence at government house dapoorie near poona which directed the native sentry on guard  to present arms if a cat or dog jackal or goat entered or left the house or crossed near his beat during certain hours of the night because it was the ghostof a former governor who was still remembered as one of the best and kindest of men more practical matter will be found at page xxiii of the introduction where there are some important remarks on the rise of prices in india in those days houserent did not cost more than half a rupee a month and you could build a very comfortable house for a hundred rupees not such good houses as people now live in but well enough for people like us then a whole family could live as comfortably on six or seven rupees a month as they can now on thirty grain now a rupee a pound was then two annas a pound common sugar then one anna a pound is now worth four annas a pound oil which then sold for six pico a bottle now costs four annas four annaa worth of salt chillies tamarinds onions and garlic would then last a whole family a month  now the same monty would not buy a weeks supply such dungeree as you now pay half a rupee a yard for you could then buy from twenty to forty yards of for the rupee you could not get such good calico then as now but the dungeree did very well beef then was a pice a pound and the vegetables cost a pie a day for half a rupee you could fill the house with wood water also was much cheaper you etdd then get a man to bring you two large skins full morning and evening for a pie now he could not do it under haifa rupee or more if though children came crying for fruit a pie would get them as many guavas as they liked in the bazaar now youd have to pay that for each guava this shows how much more money people need now than they did then in these days when there is a talk of forming a society for though translation of old popular stories miss frere will be admitted to have performed a useful task in recording these curious stories of the hindus the illustrations by c f frere are worthy of all praise and on the whole we cordially recommend the volume of snakeworshipa tempting subject concerning which these pages afford many opportunities to discoursewe shall say nothing at present in expectation of mr fergussous forthcoming work  old deccan days or hindoo fairy legends by m frere with an introduction and notes by sir bartle frere murray a few ancient legends told by an old hindoo woman to her grandchildren and repeated to miss mary frere who has reduced them to readable english are here given the public the family of anna liberata de souza the  narrator were of the lingaet caste and settling near goa when the english held pcesession of that place were soon after converted to christianity the father and grandfather of anna were both in british employ and she became an ayah although the deccan is included in the title of this book it doe not appear that theta stories originated in that district at burr bartle pren tells na in tha introduction that probably moat of them wan brought from among tha lingaete one of the most stronriy marked divisions of the hindoo neat south of the river kistna collections of stories of this kind an especially valuable at throwing a light on the popular nonbnhmmioal superstitions of the lower classes of india in tha neighlxmrhood of poona where brahminism appears to be to prevalent it it found that vithoba the deified sage kundoba the deified shepherd and byroba the terrible one of the remnants of fetish or snakeworship divide the adoration of the lower castes with the regular hindoo deities but the true history of these local divinities is only to be obtained from popular tradition and it thus becomes important to preserve these evanescent remains of the superstition of a former age en they disappear before the progress of civilisation the most prominent superhuman personage of the legends now before us is the  rakshas a demoniacal ogre of enormous sue and possessing terrible teeth like the ghouls of the  arabian nights his greatest pleasure is feasting on dead bodies  other characteristics will remind the reader of the giants of norse and teutonic descent at present the  rakshas is giving way to the bhoot more nearly allied to our modern european ghost but yet possessing an enormous influence over the native imagination in the hilly and desert districts of sind the belief in supernatural beings is generally prevalent but there the rakshas is transformed to the gin  of the arabian nights the gin ofthe mountainous parts of beloochistan is a  dwarfish human being with large eyes and covered with long hair and is apt to breathe with a heavy snoring kind of noise the cobra or deadly hooded snake also frequently occurs as a supernatural being one of the indications left us of the serpentworship once so prevalent in western india it will surprise many to learn that this worship still exists to some extent among the lower classes and that the cobra is supposed to possess supernatural powers the native does not willingly kill him but endeavours by kind treatment to propitiate him and obtain good fortune for the house to which he belongs there is a curious similarity between the incidents in many of these fables and modern european ones especially those of german origin and here also as in all fairy tales there are certain wellmarked features beautiful princes and princesses continually occur and perform the most wonderful exploits the stepmother is always wicked the youngest daughter good and beautiful and the elder ones are depraved and repulsive the giants and ogres are as easily deceived as the cyclopes from whom sinbad escaped or as polyphemus whom the crafty ulysses blinded the jackal takes the place of his european cousin the fox and by his ingenuity and tact generally conquers every difficulty  and proves a bright moral example of the success of wit against brute j forcethe triumph of mind over matter we observe however in the story tit for tat of this collection that the ordinarily stupid camel not only drowns the jackal but has the best of the argument also in the legend of  pnnchkin the wicked magician we trace a great resemblance between him and the wizards of the arabian nights he possesses the same power of changing men and women into stones trees or animals  he can build up a palace by a wave of his wand and create a river or a mountain by his magic arts the romance of brave seventee bai in which a woman shows so much prudence judgment and valour is somewhat remarkable as the production of a country where the fair sex are held in general contempt miss mary frere puts forward the conjecture that some aggrieved old woman might have invented this narrative the following fable might be used to illustrate emersons celebrated essay on compensation liss inequality than ken deem a young rajah once said to his wuzeer  how is it that i am so often ill  i take great care of myself i never go out in the rain i wear wann clothes i eat good food yet i am always catching cold or getting fever in spite of all precautions overmuch care is worse than none at ail answered the wuzeer which i will soon prove to yon so he invited the rajah to accompany him for a walk in the fields before they had gone very far they met a poor shepherd the shepherd wae accustomed to be ont all day long tending his flock he had only a coarse cloak on which served bnt insufficiently to protect him from the rain and the coldfrom the dews by night and the san by day his food was parched corn his drink water and he lived out in the fields in a small hut made of plaited palm branches the wuzeer said to the rajah you know perfectly well what hard lives these poor shepherds lead accost this one and ask him if he often sniffers from the exposure which heis obliged to undergo the rajah did as the wusser told him and asked the shepherd whether he did not often suffer from rheumatism cold and fever the shepherd answered  perhaps it will surprise yon sire to hear that i never suffer from either the one or the other from childhood i have been accustomed to endure the extremes of hest and cold and i eunpoee that is why they never affect me at thie the rajah was very much astonished and he said to the wuxeer  1 own i am surprised bnt doubtless this shepherd is an extraordinarily etrong man whom nothing would ever affect we shall see enid the wusser and he invited the shepherd to the palace there for a long time the shepherd wss taken great care of he was never permitted to go out in the sun or rain he had good food and good clothes and he was not allowed to sit in a draught or get his feet wet at the end of some months the wuseer ssnt for him into a marble courtyard the floor of which he caused to be sprinkled with water the shepherd had been for some time so little need to exposure of say kino that wetting his feet caused him to take cold the place felt to him chilly and damp after thc palace he rapidly became worse aad in a short time in spite of all the doctors care he died  where ie our friend the shepherd   asked the besh a few days afterwards   he surely could not have caught com merely by treadiaf on the nwbu floor yon liad caused to be sprinklad with water  alastn answered the wnaeera the reault wm mow disastrous than i had anticipated the poor shepherd caught cold and is dead having been lately accustomed to overmuch care the sudden change of temperature killed him  yon see now to want dsssers we are exposed from which the poor are exempt it ie thus that nature equalises her best gifts wealth and opulence tend too frequently to destroy health and shorten life though they may give much enjoyment to it whilst it lasts the moral of these fables is generally good in one is celebrated the victory of truth over falsehood in another ingratitude is chastised  and in a third an undutiful child is destroyed by a serpent in  a funny story  we have the terrible punishment of a wicked woman who was ashamed of her mother and illtreated her  and a powerful and sagacious cobra who is the good genius of the virtuous and also in the end the nemesis of evildoers we cannot refrain from quoting no 10 which is a romance of the heavenly bodies and a lesson to all greedy and selfish people now nix sim thb hook um tux

waited alone for her childrens return now both the sun and the wind were greedy and selfish they enjoyed the great feast that had been prepared for them without a thought of saving any of it to take home to their motherbnt the gentle moon did not forget her of every dainty dish that was brought round she placed a small portion under one of her beautiful long fingernails that the star might also have a share in the treat on their return their mother who had kept watch for them all night long with her little bright eye said u well children what have you brought home for me then the sun who was eldest said  i have brought nothing home for you i went out to enjoy myself with my friendsnot to fetch a dinner for my mother and the wind said neither have i brought anything home for you mother yon could hardly expect me to bring a collection of good things for yon when i merely went out for my own pleasure bnt the moon said  mother fetch a j plate see what i have brought you and shaking her

yourself without any thought of your mother at home you shall be cursed henceforth your rays shall be ever hot and scorching and shall burn all that they touch and men shall hate you and cover their

always blow in the hot dry weather and shall parch and shrivel all living things and men shall detest and avoid you from this very time and that is why the wind in the hot weather is still so

with judgement and skill and has made a pleasing selection of original fables and ancient legends the style is simple but effective and very well suited to these tales of the countryside the introduction and notes by sir bartle frere are carefully written and contain much valuable information respecting the ancient traditions usages and mythology of the tribes of southern india the

B810,"['8810960', '3170192', '8941391']",   irish idylls by jane barlow hodder  stoughton the comparison between miss barlow and miss wilkins is a very obvious one for what one is to the humble new englander the other is to the dweller in the bogs of connaught each author reveals to us the life and habit of thought of a class hitherto but little known and eachpossesses the magic of clothing humdrum trifles with interest and charm but as the new englander and the wild irishman differ much from one anothernot only in way of life but in habit of thoughtit follows that the resemblance between the two writers is the result of many differences the new englander is shrewd protestant and struggling the connaught peasant idle dreamy and resigned and as each author has the power of making us live the life of her puppets and enter into their way of thought it follows that anything like imitation is impossible the irish idylls all occur in the desolate hamlet of lisconnel among cottars huddled together on a low hill or knockaun in the bog in a destitution never far removed from actual starvation  the hopes and cares of the inhabitants centre mainly in the little greydyked fields which make a plaid pattern on the hillside and along a meagre belt beneath and this renders it the more regretable that their most prolific and certain crop should be such an unremunerative one stones upon stones scattered broadcast by some malignant hundredhanded and perennially working up through the thin soil in mockery of tenfingered attempts to collect and keep them under those looselybuilt boundary walls which intersect so frequently that the bit of land looks as if a coarselymeshed net had been flung over it fail utterly to exhaust the supply in each diminutive field a great cairn of them is piled up as big sometimes as the tabin to which it belongs and still the husband fri man comes on them at every turn  every he where he can read written large an answer to an

suchlike evils th old place at d home has hitherto shielded him more or less effectually but furthermore it provides him t with a daily return of business and desire a t clue to guide his wanderings through the mazes f of a destiny that at best seems to him sufficiently perplexing and inscrutable for he has 1 as a rule too much imagination and too little  of more material things to keep his mind clear of fateful riddles h is bit o land then is dear to the dweller in lisconnel not mainly  i a bit of land but rather as the fragment of solid tangible fact contact with which keeps i his whole existence from becoming the sport of meaningless mysteries  a meagre fieldfleck and a ramshackle shanty on the hills wan l grey slope or the lip of the blackoozing morass is scarcely an ideal earthly paradise yet it may be at least the site of the only one that can appear possible to him  should a sequel of calamity such as jobs overtake him sweeping away his flocks and herds and children no eventual doubling of his live stock could console him  and as for the ten new sons and daughtersthey would be a failure indeed the working of the irish peasant mind has seldom been indicated more clearly than in this passage and the thoughtful speculative turn of bogland brains reveals itself in a dozen racy conversations which the reader will find only too short though they are too long for quotation in character drawing miss barlow succeeds best with mature women old mrs kilfoyle the widdy mgurk and herself are admirable sketches and mad bell with her face  like a wizened lemon looking shrewdly up at you is a delightful creation but the girls are less living and the menwith perhaps the exception of poor larry sheridanare types rather than individuals like the characters in a modern play but in spite of this defect and of the authors excessive fondness for adjectives the irish idylls are delightful reading and afford a truer insight into irish peasant character and ways of life and thought than any hook that it has been our fortune to read for a long time  irish idylls i imagine that as this book goes the round of the reviews it will become a trite thing to call miss barlow an irish barrie like him she has found her book waiting her in a little and humble place of the earth like him she has the delicate observation that is the harvest of a quiet eye she has his gifts of tenderness of dignity of true and simple pathos of sympathy that comes by love like him she has a fine and beautiful vocabulary and a style that makes pictures to us irish she is more welcome than barrie can be to the scotch we are so long awaiting our real irish novelist while mr barrie comes in the line of succession to great men who have made the world intimate with scotland and scottish folk we have had no such interpreters carleton was too shapeless and too melancholy miss edgeworth despite her genius was oldmaidish and restricted the banims and gryphon did but piecemeal work at best miss lawless in our own day writes of the same sunless country and grey lives that miss barlow treats here but her  grania leaves one an impression of a solitary page of the story a single lonely figure desolate on a low shore amid a waste of waters there is many a lisconnel in ireland at the back of the bogs or  the back of god speed but who else could make of it not a human document but a human book fluttering whose pages we run all the gamut of emotions we have here the human tragedy in such pathetic things as one too many or  herself miss barlow has the gift of tears in verse or prose and as one could scarcely read th old master to take one of her poems without a  irish idylls by jane barlow london hodder and stoughton catch in the throat so it is not easy to be dryeyed over poor larry sheridan and his homely tragedy or over mrs odriscoll and the children going to america but what good honest pathos it is none of the unwholesome things that take you by the throat with a stony horror like those that stalk out of ibsen and the russians irish idylls leaves us more human and kindly when it has wrung our hearts then the humour is truly delightful what a child only we see too little of him is jimmy kilfoyle and what mingled humour and pathos is the warp and woof of all their lives one gets to know them mrs doyne and stacy dear little mrs kilfoyle and mr mcgurk and all the other worthies of lisconnel as if one were going in and out every day among them the humanity is not starved olt of lisconnel it is an innocent little community indeed in which the only thing starved out seems to be vice miss barlow sees not only the primitive lives but the lonely country and the wild skies that seem a part of it she has superb descriptive bits which paint us pictures as finely as any sky painter or painter of moors who works in the legitimate medium i wish i had space to quote the skies that flash into her pictures fixed for us in her nervous and fine english it would not be easy to better this all at once something happened in the western sky it was as if some vast tentrope had suddenly been snapped for the dark riftless cloudcanopy seemed not so much to abruptly rise as to actually recoil back with a swing up from the horizons verge and ere one had realised that it had begun to lift it was flying eastward scudding in festoons and trails and shreds or furled into rumpled bundles in the grip of the careering blasts i believe  irish idylls will be an irish classic i have read every line of it with increasing delight and am glad messrs hodder and stoughton have bound it so substantially not like your mushrooms of a season miss barlow writes a little more from the outside than does barrie this is shown by her occasional slip in the matter of the brogue though she has much mended since  bogland studies another matter in which she does not see far is that in such lives as these religion would be a far more potent element than she makes it katharine tynan  irish ways by jane barlow illus trated by warwick goble allen  sons miss jane barlows reputation as a writer of irish tales or rather irish sketches of character is too high to require any recommendation from us this new instalment has all the merits of her previous volumes but it does not manifest any advance in her art the style is finished and shows evidence of high education and long familiarity with classical and modern literature hence it is remarkable that she should confine herself to so narrow a field where that large learning can show itself only indirectly and where a love of nature and an insight into peasant character form the whole matter of the volume there is but little plot in her stories  the elements of broad farce and of wild tragedy are not there but we find endless quiet humour and deep appreciation of the virtues and foibles of one of the most attractive peasantries of europe the opening chapter  ourselves and our island gives a summary of the complexities of irish character very similar to the larger but not so subtle treatment by mr lynd which we noticed on october 23rd but when we penetrate into the book we find that two or three leading types which other books treat at great length are ignored by miss barlow we say ignored for it is inconceivable that she does not know them the first is the roman catholic priest and indeed the protestant clergyman whose influence on the life of the poor is so great yet so disputed there is occasionally a priest in her backgrounds but as a character she will not tolerate him the same is the case with the local agitator and thirdly there is the gombeen man local moneylender who haunts every village and every market in poorer ireland and gives ample scope to the painter of irish life as for example to william carleton yet though this is the author who has most in common with miss barlow she omits these three types as carefully as the letters upon ireland are omitted from the published correspondence of queen victoria we can offer no clue to this negative feature in miss barlows irish stories but we must say that it limits her field and makes her gallery of local types smaller and more monotonous if she also omits the jackeen and the buckeen the apes of the squireen she would doubtless reply that she writes only about the very poor and only about the country poor who have exceptional manners no one knows better than miss barlow how to bring out this feature in her tales  and she paints the life and feelings of these indigent but refined peasants with a charm that has fascinated the reading public of our day her descriptions of the scenery of bogs and moors and of wild western coasts is often truly poetical indeed she allows herself the licence of french rather than english prose in this respect the beauties of bogland are by no means obvious yet no man who has travelled that sort of country deliberately as for example for sport will hesitate to acknowledge the truth and accuracy of her observation the writing down of dialect is always difficult some eminent irish novelists are very deficient in the power of hearing the sounds and catching the idioms such is not the case with miss barlow though we are not always in agreement with her we make the following suggestions as she surely professes to give the ordinary diction of western peasants and not their occasional use of strange words though the eastern irish speak of an awkward person as a thwart we do not remember the verb  to thwart in their use or with like limitation the verb  to question the irishman does not say  i question whether this is true but i doubt if it is so to be surprised  is also unusual though  surprizin  is common  and the pronunciation  scandeelious  for  scandlous  is new to us the irish know a spruce tree well enough but a spruce lad is a use of the adjective which is surely uncommon  should you suppose is also to be rejected  shall  and  should  being very unusual and replaced by  will  and  would the general impression which the english will draw from the book is that the western irish peasant is not the gay rollicking careless figure of angloirish fiction but rather a patient hardworking creature living in such squalor and gloom as to make his life a prolonged effort against despair miss barlows peasants represent the preceltic population often called firbolgs which was subdued by the invading celts and either exiled to the mountains and bogs of the west or reduced to the condition of churls who tilled the land for the tyrannous and ungrateful celtic swordsmen and their chiefs the hard treatment which the latter received from the english was probably a mere repetition of what had happened ten or fifteen centuries earlier when the celts were the invading conquerors it would be an interesting inquiry to trace the influences of this earlier stratum  probably pre  aryan  on the life of ireland but these are speculations regarding remote and forgotten causes which have drawn us away from the living pictures of today which are the object of this book we need hardly say in conclusion that we commend it

by the rev g f townsend routledge  sons the princess i late a fairy talc saunders otley co mrs s c halls latest publication is a very pretty and rather whimsical story about little peoplewe can hardly call them fairies according to the popular notion which requires something different in description from minute men and women who live in among and under flowers and leaves using them as men employ houses and having the senses limitations and passions of mere men to say this much in respect to the shortcomings of this charming story is but to declare that the author whose work is now before us has failed exactly where ninetynine out of every hundred fairytale writers have done likewise we know no modern fairy story of this kind and having the pretensions of this one which surpasses it either as regards spirit prettiness or piquancy of treatment richness of incident or carefulness in imparting local colour to the book which tells how a noble queen foam of south wales whose tiny people and lazy royal husband were seated near tenby a wateringplace to which mrs hall seems to have taken an overwhelming fancy bad a son prince ivor who being pressed by his imperious mamma to marry a certain beautiful princess of pembrokeshire flatly refused to do anything of the sort and preferred banishment and transformation nay even loss of the privileges of  faery and to incur the defeats of mortality rather than wed the princess gossamer daughter of king bulbul the btory further relates how the prince was banished and trarsformed what were the pranks he played on earth these are rather trivial in the order of their inventionhow he got rid of some of that freakishness which mrs hall in common with all fairytale tellers ascribes to the little peoplehow he fell in love with an earthly damselwhat took place upon the last event the political consequences of which do not appear to have been calculated for by queen foamhow he returned home and what then took place we have all this with a moral of the good sound sort which of course we shall not impart neither relate the termination of the story in the fate of the little prince let the reader learn it for himself and in so doing appreciate at his best the manner of the writer whose ornate fancy revels in  pretty rather than in potent matters whose conception of faery lacks vigour quite as much as it comes short in inventioniwhose ideas savour of the operatic style and whose book is by no means free from affectation the considerate reader who knows not only the rarity of firstrate fairy tales but the immense difficulty which besets their writers will know how well our author has succeeded notwithstanding the shortcomings we are in no unkindly spirit compelled to point out as to the illustrations before us m this volume they are thoroughly in keeping with the text the immemorial hand of mr kenny meadows has contributed a larger number than that of any other artist these suit the story wonderfully of sounder work and better art are several wellexecuted landscapes from drawings by messrs e m wimperis and w s coleman mr w j allen is a very happy contributor of vignettes and tailpieces bright

little pieces of prose both classes of the text are pleasantly perhaps a little too pleasantly written all the boys and girls behave themselves as they should obediently lovingly and with a wonderful show of forbearance the illustrations which are by mr john proctor are good enough for a commonplace purpose but not good enough to be of the better class bounder workmanship or at least more of refinement in execution is desirable for them many are spirited there is nothing to challenge in the book unless indeed it be a recommendation to see general tom thumb lightsome and the little golden lady is a capital childs fairystory with just the slight defect of a rather dull beginning to create such beginning is on the part of the author with mr bennetts aim a great mistake and almost fatal to his hopes of obtaining a hearing from children whose standard is not above that of his book once he gets the little ones by the ear we have no doubt that they will be more than thankful to him the event of the scorpion that attacked skambel whenever he was envious and did bo with a clash as of the tumbling down of ten sets of fireirons and the locking up of fifty streetdoor locks is very much to our minds grim hoddidod the hunter has a family resemblance with which we are not unfamiliar as he supports the reputation of his awful race be is not the worse for that in fact one rather likes to meet him here for the sake of the old days when breathless we came upon the great beanstalk with our brave but surely temerarious friend jack there is some poverty of invention shown in the repetition of the method by which lightsome cuts off the tails of the bulls moreover it is incredible that the same thing should happen more than once the history of the scales that weighed everything into gold which runs through the book is very well told the illustrations are rather heavily drawn but not without spirit they are the work of the author  washed a shore is a tale of the coast and the sea of an old captain who lives in an ancient fortress his son who mixing with smugglers comes to grief and suffers a sort of honourable transportation of a lifeboat adventure with a wreck a storm of two saved from its violence one of these is a dashing midshi pman who tells a young laxlya very young ladythat man friday was notablackwhatever defoe might have written there is also a very good blind pedlar a hardhearted magistrate and abundant adventures with smugglers seamen and such like materials for a boys story that it is a little overlaboured may be no deterring matter for juvenile readers especially as a considerable amount of local colouring is applied to descriptions of southern islands and the manners of their inhabitants the discovery of the longlost son of the old seacaptain who lived in the ancient tower and the narrative of that sons adventures make up jjr a sort of robinson crusoe stry that is well worthy the attention of the readers for whom the book is written three

we not long since reviewed croxaus production is almost universally known in this country and is one of the oldfashioned ornate sort of translations from the classics which obtained favour when the severe simple manner of such originals was little appreciated among us the new translation now before us is decidedly clearer purer in style and infinitely terser than its predecessor it contains also a much greater number of fables than was comprised in the edition to which we have just referred and morewe believe than are to be found in common editions as a literary production the present is creditable to the editor aud traudator it is however rather bald and somewhat deficient in that terse wordpainting which gives life to a literal translation the illustrations which are thu work of mr harrison weir are very unequal in quality some are good as the fawn and his mother the crow and the  pitcher others are not at all commendable see j those which contain human figures the worst of i the book as a whole is that their author has not  the slightest sense of the eopian humour here i as in other respects no one of modern times has i approached the happiness of thomas bewick in his old age the princess ilsee is a fairystory of which the producer of the book before us be she translator or author hus no mean opinion it begius i with an account of the deluge and dryingup of  the earth

serious and highlyrespectable  young lady in a drawingroom this angel is spoken of as male his notions are those of neither one sex nor the other  which is orthodox no doubt although the effect on the reader is rather depressing in short the story is not otherwise describable by us than as nambypamby worse than that is the fact that it is a nambypamby allegory and an example of a style which has our peculiar abhorrence tried by its own standard there is however ample evidence of care and even of delicacy in writing on the authors part she has carried out her intentions with exactness neatness

B4075,"['8776630', '6760511']",  tales and legends from the land of the tzar a collection of russian stories translated from the original russian by edith m 8 hodgetts griffith farran  co tins is a bright little book miss hodgetts not only knows some excellent fairy tales but has an excellent way of telling them her collection will very likely be a great favourite with our young people who will probably not regret the absence of any learned notes on comparative folklore there is a weird power in these russian tales and miss hodgetts says in her preface with good reason that  the perfect recklessness regarding possibility to say nothing of probability lends a special charm to the russian story how graphic too are the details what a vigorous northern picture is that of jack frost morozko on p 57  jack frost jumped from branch to branch coming nearer to her suddenly he sprang from the tree and stood by her side his icecold fingers touching her shoulders he was a handsomelooking old man with a long white beard and curly white locks hanging down his back  he had a kindlooking old face with a goodnatured smile on it this story must have been in the mind of the poet nekrasov when he wrote the following clever stanza in his  red  nosed frostmoroz krasni noz which has been well translated by mr sumner smith of yale college all stiff she is growing has touched her the frostking the weird  a breath in her face he is blowing and on her sharp needles is strowing from out his huge icy grey beard this folktale will also be found in the late mr ralstons work russian folktales 1873 p 219  the snow maiden is a story full of poetical beauty certainly judging by this and others we cannot consider the russian peasant to be wanting in imagination and fancy he sets no limit to either the absolute audacity of his conceptions seems to belong to a certain orientalism of his mind it is the same spirit which animates the  tales of the thousand and one nights adventure follows upon adventure time and space are as nothing and over all there is a fatalism which regards man as the plaything of the divinity as hies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport there is no melancholy in these stories such as we find in the russian novel but a reckless happygolucky sort of existence which makes them unique among european folktales again how thoroughly oriental and luxuriant is the imagery every one is gorgeously apparelled and there is a glory of palaces reminding one of those which tennyson dreamed of at the court of harounalraschid thus the grey wolfs costume was most extraordinary he had a red cap on his head with green feathers in it round his neck he had a blue silk ribbon  he wore a red velvet jacket embroidered with gold lilac gloves with lace ruffles a scarf round his waist on his hind feet he had slippers and on his tail he wore a silver net ornamented with diamonds the feast continued until very late at night but as soon as it was dark the golden cassowary was brought in with its golden cage and hung up on the balcony the whole court shone like lightning imme diately so that no lamps were wanted not even in the streets round about the palace as the cassowary afforded light enough is stasov right after all in his view that these tales are for the most part of comparatively late oriental origin coming into russia by way of the bazaars and caravanserais  many of the tales have already been translated by ralston to those previously mentioned we may add  king vladimir and the skeleton which he has given on p 85 from afanasiev it is the old story of kostchei the deathless there is also  vasilieea the beautiful as we prefer spelling her name which is given by ralston on p 150 it seems to be a slavonic variant of the story of cinderella the three kopecks occurs on p 43 of the same work prince kidskin tsarevichkozlionochek is a good cid russian tale which is to be found in the collection of afanasiev and is by him assigned to the government of voronezh one of the last tales given by miss hodgetts is from a famous buina of course ilya muromets figures in the book in an excellent story we do not like however the transformation of his name into elie muromitch which is hardly accurate and we are surprised that so good a russian scholar as this lady should be contented with it elsewhere we have come upon some rather strange renderings of the names but these are trivial matters the book is well done is decidedly amusing and we wish it all success  tales and legendt from the land of the ttar translated from the original russian by edith m s hodgetts griffith farran  co we have had no book of russian folktales since the meritorious work of the late mr ralston published as long ago as 1873 of this however no second edition has appeared and in some respects the present work by miss hodgetts is better adapted to the general reader especially the younger generation for it does not contain any notes on comparative folklore such as are calculated to interest only a limited class for whom the commentaries of mr ralston will always retain their value stories are most welcome to the ordinary public when given with all their original vivacity and even tautology and contradictions  and it is in a popular manner that miss hodgetts has presented her selection to ns and what tales they are full of the wildest flights of fancy as she truly remarks in her preface in fact the audacity of these folktales is the quality which will first strike the person who reads them they teem witadventures all is direct action and they do not contain any of the sententious moralising which we find in the hitopadesa or the  book of wisdom and falsehood of the georgian sulkhan orbeliani tou are left to draw your own inferences in these tales all probabilities and possibilities are cast to the winds a notable characteristic which they possess is the glorification of physical force with a considerable admixture of cunning as in  reynard the fox the russian does not seem to care for philosophising he is too naive for that and it is just this absence of all attempts at improving the occasion which will make these stories popular among our young friends children do not care for moral tags some of the tales have been previously translated into english in mr ralstons book for instance but with that notable exception russian folkstories have been rather neglected in western literature chodzko in his contes des pay sans et detpatree slaves 1864 almost ignores them and as he affects to adopt the opinions of duchinski about the great russian race he looks for the sources of his tales in any other direction at least two of the pieces given by miss hodgetts are russian bilini or legendary ballads the last of the russian warriors  and the celebrated chant of ilya muromets whose name is somewhat disguised in the form which it assumes in her book this ulina is interesting as giving us a glimpse how vladimir the first christian sovereign presented himself to the popular imagination in russia strange to say we find next to nothing about him in his religious character if we except his contest with the idolater ilya is the most popular hero of the old yolksepos vladimir is holding high court at sacred kiev  elie ilya galloped straight into the princes court jumped off his noble steed and tied bim up to an old oakpost this done he went to the sacred avieuomu bright p palace of the prince to pray and after having offered np thanks for his recovery he made a low bow to the prince and princess now the great prince vladimir was holding a feast there were princes and grand nobles present and many a valiant warrior when lie muromitch lija marorxtets had finished praying a mighty bowl large as a modern pail was handed to him foll of green wine elie ilya took the bowl and raisirg it to bis lips drank off the contents at one draught then up rose the

observed that the wine is green the favourite conventional epithet in thf southeast mini jn the same way it is always the damp earth the  thick  forest and so on in some of the tales we notice that miss hodgetts has adopted a slightly different version from that given by afmasievprince kidskin for instance  but the variations are most conspicuous in the names and no greater proof could exist of their being genuine folktales than these slight discrepancies the very quaint story  ivashko and the witch is identical in its main details with one given in the essays on southern russia zapiski o yuzhnoi rossie by kuli sh it there appears in a malorussian version under the title ivas i viedma but it would be out of pace here to dicuss the various versions and translations of these curious

these storiesand only those familiar with trie works of afanasiev rudclenko kulish eilenvein and others know how many there aremiss hodgetts has translated those which are most representative she

to agree she folklore and folktales of nearly all the eastern and great part of the western hemisphere have now been diligently collected and published and it may be questioned whether there can be much still left for future gleaners that will throw any new light upon the vexed question of the origin and diffusion of popular tales the  solar or  nature  myth theory seems now to be welinigh

most intelligent and industrious collector of folktales current in the  happy valley  and he has improved as a storyteller since he published his dictionary of fishuri proverb8 and saying8perhaps improved rather too much since among other ornamental touches we occasionally meet with in this new book such g p r jameslike expressions as the next morning the king mnight have been seen c which is altogether out of place in a foitale and such as this  the quickly found lovers referring to a king meeting a strange wandering damsel and forthwith taking her to wife he is fond of using native terms when the english equivalents would do quite as well or even better since they would save readers the trouble of looking at the foot of the page or in the glossary for their meaning for instance on p 11 the term woni occurs and on referring to the glossary we learn that it means a shopkeeper moreover his planor want of a regular plan ratherof explaining such words is extremely annoying some being explained in footnotes others in the glossary for no apparent reason and some not at all they should all be explained either in one place only or in both places in the preface mr knowles expresses a hope that his work will be useful to students of comparative folklore from the notes he has appended referring to certain other collections where similar tales are to be found but unfortunately most of these works and they are few after all are also indian storybooks of precisely the same kind as his own comprising tales communicated by word of mouth such as miss freres old deccan days and miss

delighted to tell him and how after leaving college and becoming one of the staff of the indian government archaeological survey capt temples interesting folklore contributions to the indian

dunbar nutt  blackfoot lodge tales the story of a prairie people by g b grinnell same publisher tne pawnee tribe ocaupied the banks of the platte river in nebraska where now stands the flourishing city of kearney about 1875 they found themselves in distress for want of food and obtained permission of the united states government to go south to the indian territory mr grinnells comment on this transaction is that if the full history of it should ever be written there would be disclosed a carefully planned and successful conspiracy to rob this people of their lands another damning and ineffaceable blot on the record of the american people the blackfeet are a tribe of dacotas long hostile to the pawnees and their territory lay north of the yellowstone river aud east of the rocky mountains mr grinnell is equally outspoken in his censure of the conduct of the united states government with respect to these  our people havo disregarded honesty and truth whenever they have come in contact with the indian and he has had no rights because he has never had the power to enforce any within two years i have been present on a reservation where government commissioners by means of threats by bribesgiven to chiefs and by casting fraudulently the votes of absentees succeeded after months of effort in securing votes enough to warrant them in asserting that a tribe of indians entirely wild and totally ignorant of farming had consented to sell their lands and to settle down each upon 100 acres of the most utterly arid and barren land to be found on the north american continent he has spent a considerable time in close association with these two tribesandhas taken down from the mouths of chiefs and others a number of their popular tales and traditions he asserts that he has recorded them faithfully without embellishment and has in fact allowed the indians to tell their own stories in their own fashion the theology of the pawnees is far advanced and shows evident traces of recent development through the influence of european ideas we gravely doubt whether the great spirit himself has not been rather an imported element than an aboriginal indian belief but when we find a prayer addressed to tirawa in these terms  my father it is through you that i am living you are the ruler nothing is impossible to you if you see fit take this away from mea statement that the heaven or sky is the house of tirawa a story of vicarious suffering in the person of pahukatawa with several unmistakable biblical allusionsa narrative of the sacrifice of a son to tirawa and the miraculous preservation of the boys lifeit becomes obvious that the pawnees must have a wonderful faculty for assimilating theological notions they have also a large mythological apparatus in connexion with ghosts dreams and mysterious powers attributed to animals an incident which appears over and over again in their stories is that of the restoration to life of a body which has been cut up into small pieces the theology of the blackfeet is much more primitive the creator of all things is referred to by them under the undignified title of napi  old man ho is understood to have taught them the use of the bow the method of making flint arrows the power of medicinal herbs and so forth he is supposed to have created the sun and all things else though a variant theory identifies him with the sun god in some of their stories however he is represented as malicious foolish or impotent as when he asks a bird to teach him how to cast his eyes out of his head and call them back again the bird tells him he must not do it more than three times a day he does it four times and finds he cannot call them back or when he allows a coyote to overreach him by fraud and steal rabbits that he has boen cooking or when he plucks the fur off a fox and lets him freeze to death incidents of frequent occurrence in these stories are the claim by a pregnant mother animal to be spared in a general massacre and the allowance of such claim for the sake of the perpetuation of her race the hero tales of the pawnees are creditable to them they naturally abound in incidents of savage warfare but they honour a peacemaker in the person of a comanche chief who died so recently as september 9th 1888 they make much of incidents of fidelity and generosity in the career of lone chief and they commemorate several other instances of courage skill and devotion the term blackfoot includes three tribes the blackfeet proper the bloods and the piegans the pi egans are said to have numbered at one time as many as 40000 individuals unlike the pawnees who originally came from the south from louisiana and perhaps from mexico the blackfeet lived till a few generations back to the north of the saskatchewan they have been a fighting race and their stories of adventure indicate a fierce and warlike character one story  how the deer lost his gall and the antelope his dewclaws is common both to the blackfeet and the pawnees which had it first does not appear the blackfoot story of the  origin of the worm pipe is an indian version of the tale of orpheus and eurydice with a happy ending the  origin of the medicine pipe is a story of a man who successfully defied the thunder the end of the story of  scarface is poetic the sun was glad he gave them great age they were never sick when they were very old one morning their children eaid  awake  rise and eat they did not move in the night in sleep without pain their shadows had departed for the sandhills the recent history of these people consists of the more or less successful endeavours of the agents of government to train them into the unaccustomed habits of steady industry and patient thrift which are necessary to transform tribes of savage hunters into successful agriculturists the pawnees have been largely employed as scouts by the united states army in operations against the tribes hostile to the pawnees a use against the indians of their own methods of warfare which one would rather see avoided though mr grinnell highly eulogises their able commander the late major frank north mr grinnells two volumes are full of interest and form a valuable and original addition to our knowledge of the rapidly disappearing tribes of north american indians that relating to the pawnees has

B7109,['8707258'],  russia ti folk ta les saturday june 28 4873 i   lr literature i jj russian folklore by w r s ralston smith elder  co mk ralston has once more made his appearance before the british public in his now familiar character of interpreter of russian folklore and we tender him our cordial thanks for this his latest work mr ralston displays more than ever thoroughness and ease in dealing with the vast and multifarious material at hand wide reading and great industry in the comparative study of folklore he loves his subject and his style and mode of interpretation are not only scholarly but attractive his present book will be as entertaining to the child as it will be interesting to the antiquarian and useful to the student as our knowledge of russian folklore stands at present mr ralstons books are for us english standard works and yet we believe that he has in store for us other volumes of a still more ambitious character hitherto his contributions have been what the germans term vorarbeiten materials stored together and arranged and digested to form the basis of a future work on the whole subject scientifically worked out last year we had his  songs of the russian people now we have the tales and besides several classes or groups of tales which the author has excluded from the present volume we are promised a work on the builinas the epic poems or metrical romances of the russians there is one extremely remarkable though a negative feature about the russian popular tales as compared with those of western europeantheir utter silence with regard to elves and dwarfs the elfin world which in western europe may be said to be the other world so to speak of the popular fancy and has been so fruitful a source of fantastic imaginings to teutons and scandinavians is a world entirely unknown to the russian perhaps the westeuropean literature of elfinanddwarf story owes its origin to a prehistoric struggle between two races of man the one perishing the other settling down on the formers ruin  dwarfs being a highly civilised race possessing knowledge of precious as well as base metals and adepts in mining elves being an agricultural and fishing race having their abodes in earthen holes in hills and knolls and both of them being far too weak to resist the brute force of the invader the existence of dwarfs in scandinavian folklore is anterior to the creation of thc human race that of elves coeval with the gods it is remarkable to observe how owing to the enormous length of time that these stories have been on the lips of the people the beings to which they relate have gradually come to figure as personifications of folly and boorishness alfr in icelandic is now the everyday word for fool and dur jr another form of dvergr invariably means a wrongheaded clownishlooking lout these remarks concerning elves and dwarfs may serve to prepare the way to the russian dur ak or ninny we are inclined to think that durak may be durgr dvergr dwarf but the russian storytellers have no idea of him as a dwarf but know him only as a human goiok an incorrigible blockhead in the story about the durah and the birchtree however the insight into the bowels of the earth which belongs to the genuine dwarf is strikingly illustrated without the sagatellers dreaming of the durah being anything but an ordinary fool born with a silver spoon in his mouth we venture to ask therefore is durah a genuine russian word to begin with and is the durah known in russian storytelling only as a fool and nothing else  for our part we think the durahs temper and ways of dealing with difficulties of life and facing danger have a scandinavian turn about them but then it i3 to be born in mind that stories of this class are remarkably similar in all countries from this negative characteristic which of course opens a large field for inquiry we turn to the more positive qualities of the literature represented in mr ralstons volume in form the shazhas have a peculiar finish  they have a tendency throughout to repeat certain words after the manner of a refrain at certain stages of the story the style is somewhat epigrammatic and the arrangement is strongly marked by a turn for dramatic grouping precision and surprises if these peculiarities of the outer form of the shazha are genuinely inherent in the oral tradition of the russian peasant and folktale teller we are inclined to think the russians surpass all europeans in the form of their folklore the inner mental qualities of the stories are not less attractive a general calm seems to pervade the whole there is little of passion to be traced even in situations where it might be looked for as in the beautiful story of  woe where the poor brother being invited by his wealthy brother sits quiet starving a whole evening while the rich is enjoying with merry guests the contents of his overladen table and then without receiving a morsel the poor man bids his rich brother a loving farewell when the party breaks up a patient spirit of resignation and a quiet hope for better things are perpetually reflected in these tales but beside a delicacy of feeling tenderness of affection and sweetness of temper are exhibited which no other folktales so far as we know express so strikingly the humour too of a russian folktale is russian only and belongs to no other country it is quiet almost stealthy throughout there goes hand in hand with the clear style a clear definition of the events accidents persons or preternatural beings which figure in the tale and constitute its dramatic movement as their poetry so are also the tales of the russians entirely or almost entirely free from any point or climax artistically wrought out in some the point is that they have no climax although the natural turn of the story may seem to require it a peculiarity which detracts in no degree from the interest of the story it is a matter of course that these tales throw a good deal of light upon the daily life of the russian people therein they have however nothing primitive or original about them beyond tales from other countries having thus dealt with the generalities which have struck us the most we now turn to a more minute examination of mr ralstons work in a short preface pp ixii our author gives a brief review of the sources of his present book of which the chief are asanief 8 volumes of over 3000 pages containing no less than 332 distinct tales besides variations in some instances amounting to five of one and the same story of his treatment of these sources mr ralston gives us the following account  the fiftyone stories which i have translated at length i have rendered as literally as possible in the very rare instances in which i have found it necessary to insert any words by way of explanation i have except in case of such additions as  he said or the like enclosed them between brackets in giving summaries also i have kept closely to the text and always translated literally the passages marked as quotations the bulk of the book pp 1378 mr ralston divides into six chapters  i introductory and illustrative of various social tenets and striking manifestations in mans moral and mental life ii mythological exhibiting the principal incarnations of evil such as the snake the stealer of daylight norha a being somewhat similar to the nechen of sweden and norway koshcliei the deathless whose span of life depends on a certain egg being left unbroken the hag dabayaga and the witch iii contains miscellaneous impersonations impersonifications we take to be a printers slip of mythological import which mr ralston illustrates by a story of the oneeyed lihho a mere imitation of the story of polyphemus a story of woe the poor mans companion stories about friday wednesday and sunday about the wooddemon leshy and certain rivers about frost as wooer of maidens and about morfei and oh two supernatural beings we doubt whether any of these stories with perhaps the exception of leahys morfeys and ohs can at all be referred to a mythological category the stories about wednesday friday and sunday are clearly christian compositions in a popular form intended to enforce upon people proper regard for the holiness of those three days of the week the river stories seem to us all to bear quite a modern impress of poetic not mythic personification as does also that about frost a most charming story all the same chapter iv contains stories relating to magic and witchcraft among which we may name stories of the waters of life and death and of strength and weakness  stories about aid given to children by dead parents stories of magic horses fish kc about wizards and witches about a headless princess midnight watches over corpses ive chap v contains ghost stories and chap vi legends of saints and demons the book finishes with a capital index pp 379382 we cannot refrain from devoting a little space to some of the more prominent features of these chapters which are made up on the whole of stories of a remarkably high type so far as construction goes and form a digest of comparative folklore of a valuable kind the following tender story reminds us somewhat of the borderballad of the bad stepmother although it is not the same story and is probably entirely unconnected with the ballad in a certain village a husband and wife lived happily lovingly peaceably all their neighbours envied them the mistress bare a son but directly after it was born she died the poor moujik moaned and wept above all he was in despair about the babe how was he to nourish it now  how to bring it up without its mother  he did what was best and hired an old woman to look after it all day long the babe would take no food and did nothing but cry there was no soothing it but during the greater part of the night one might fancy it was not there at all so silently and peacefully did it sleep  what is the meaning of this 1 thought the old woman  suppose i keep awake tonight maybe i shall find out at midnight she heard some one quietly open the door and go up to the cradle the baby became still just as if it was being suckled the next night the same thing took placo and the third night too then the woman told the nioujik about it he called his kinsfolk together and took counsel with them they determined to keep awake on a certain night and to see who it was that came to suckle the babe so in the evening they all lay down on the floor and beside them they set a lighted taper hidden in an earthen pot at midnight the cottagedoor opened some one stepped up to the cradle the baby became still at that moment one of the kinsfolk suddenly brought out the light they looked and saw the dead mother in the very same clothes in which she had been buried on her knees beside the cradle over which she bent as she suckled the baby at her dead breast the moment the light shone in the cottage she stood up gazed sadly on her little one and then went out of the room without a sound not saying a word to any one all those who saw her stood for a time terrorstruck and when they recovered themselves they found the babe was dead the russian seems never to be at a loss when he wants to point a moral the avarice of the russian clergy is dwelled upon at length the great social vice of russia drunkenness although leniently dealt with in the folklore upon the whole because it affords a sort of soothing selfforgetfulness to a struggling suffering and oppressed race is made the subject of the most formidable moralising in one of the tales before us which is but typical of a large class of stories of a similar kind the punishment inflicted on au incorrigible drunkard is to serve in the abode of the condemned as a draghorse to carry wood and water from the beautiful story of woe we seem almost at liberty to infer that the typical curse of a hapless russian is his helpless fondness for the pothouse and it is evident that the storysteller has a keen sense of the evil although its magnitude seems rather to blunt the edge of his satire but no social vice seems really to rouse russian indignation so much as mean avarice murki the stingy rich merchant is a choice type of the genus miser as marko went along the road close on his heels tramped a poor nioujik they passed a beggar who begged for a copeck the merchant passed him heedlessly but the poor nioujik gave him a copeck marko bethought him returned and begged the moujik to lend him a copeck for the beggar pleading want of change at the moment the debt was to be paid on the morrow but it was the same story over again marko had no change moujik must come another time he came  the result was the same again at the end of a fortnight the debt was to be paid moujik came marko ordered his wife to strip him lay him under the holy pictures and say he died that morning  the kingdom of heaven be his said the moujik if you will allow me mistress in return for my copeck i ll do him the last servicejust give his mortal remains a wash so saying he laid hold of a pot full of boiling water and began pouring its scalding contents over marko the rich marko his brows knit his legs contorted was scarcely able to hold out writhe away or not as you please thought the poor man but pay me my copeck  next marko the rich was put into a coffin and the poor moujik took it to the church where he read psalms over it the darkness of night came on all of a sudden a window opened and a party of lobbers crept through it into the church the nioujik hid himself behind the altar as soon as the robbers had come in they began dividing their booty and after everything else had been shared there remained over and above a golden sabre  each one laid hold of it himself none would give up his claim to it out jumped the poor man crying   what is the good of disputing that way let the sabre belong to him who will cut this corpses head off up jumped marko the rich like a madman the robbers were frightened out of their wits flung away their spoil and scampered off here moujik said marko  lets divide the money they divided it equally between them  each of the shares was a large one  but how about the copeck 1 asked the poor mau  ah brother   replied marko surely you can see i have got no change  and so marko the rich never paid the copeck after all the mythological stories embodied in the present volume are the most genuinely russian mr ralston could find he informs us that the materials are here very large the chief actors in these stories are on the part of man a prince or some other individual who is most hopelessly indolent and by various changes of fortune performs superhuman deeds such is ivan popyalof the wretched youth who spends his early life in the heap of ashes on the hearth among the supernatural beings is the snake a vague and shifty essence now a cloud now a reptile then again blending together the ophidian and human nature and sometimes even resolving into a young galant the terrible norka is another koshchei the deathless a third with a host of other beings male and female among the latter the babayaga is not the least prominent in the story of ivan popyalof a singular parallelism is traceable between the hero and the eddaic slayer of the dragon fafnir sigurd just as sigurd has a sword made for him which fails twice to be of avail for the purpose in view so ivan has a mace made which twice fails to prove suitable for his purpose sigurd slays the dragon and ivan kills the snake in the story again of the monster norka the otterand otter be it not forgotten whom the gods in the edda slew slumbering on a river bank was a brother to the dragon fafnir whom sigurd slewthe hero is most effectually aided by a magic horse just as sigurds wonderworking horse grani stands him best in stead in his exploits there are many parallelisms with northern myths in the mythological talesa fact which rather tempts us to establish a traditional connexion between russian and scandinavian mythology but there ia one consideration against it the points of similarity are all confined to stray incidents but never so far as we can make out extend to the general drift of any story or in other words no scandinavian myth seems to find a repetition in russian mythology in its entirety or even so far as the point of it is concerned incidents which point to this eddaic myth or thatwe confine ourselves to the edda which is the real source of all westeuropean mythologymay be of scandinavian origin or may not we know as yet far too little of the prehistoric migrations of the myth to be able to pronounce positively on the matter all we can say is that there being a variety of identical and similar points in scandinavian and russian mythology that fact enlarges vastly the interest of these tales and of mr ralstons book in the stories about magic and witchcraft the russian people display a great versatility of imagination the witch in russia is no lovelier than elsewhere her hatred of the living seems even more unreasonable than is often the case in witchstories from other lands she is as fiendishly disposed towards him or her with whom she has had no sinister dealings in life as towards those for whom she has contracted a debt of eternal hatred one capital way of getting out of the pursuit of witches in russia is to run backwards the footprints pointing them in a direction opposite to that in which the pursued one is going many of these witchstories are thrilling although of course morbid in the story of the origin of cornbrandy we learn how a poor nioujik who has seven children to find bread for went one day into the fields to plough taking with him the only morsel of crust that was left in the house having toiled a while he was going to eat the bit of bread when he bethought himselfwhy did i not leave this crust for my children  he then put it aside and presently a little demon stole up to him and carried it away after searching in vain for it for a long time the moujik said  god be with him who took it the little demon ran off to the devil and cried  grandfather i have stolen uncle sidors bread well what did he say i  he said god be with him  be off with you says the devil  hire yourself to him for three years for three years the imp served the moujik and taught him to make cornbrandy but at last isidore the moujik fell into a deep drunken sleep from this he was roused by the imp whereupon he exclaimed in a rage  go to the devil and straightway the demon disappeared we must now take leave of this fascinating volume we have no doubt it will be welcome alike in nurseries drawingrooms and libraries,folklore

call them fairies according to the popular notion which requires something different in description from minute men and women who live in among and under flowers and leaves using them as men employ houses and having the senses limitations and passions of mere men to say this much in respect to the shortcomings of this charming story is but to declare that the author whose work is now before us has failed exactly where ninetynine out of every hundred fairytale writers have done likewise we know no modern fairy story of this kind and having the pretensions of this one which surpasses it either as regards spirit prettiness or piquancy of treatment richness of incident or carefulness in imparting local colour to the book which tells how a noble queen foam of south wales whose tiny people and lazy royal husband were seated near tenby a wateringplace to which mrs hall seems to have taken an overwhelming fancy bad a son prince ivor who being pressed by his imperious mamma to marry a certain beautiful princess of pembrokeshire flatly refused to do anything of the sort and preferred banishment and transformation nay even loss of the privileges of  faery and to incur the defeats of mortality rather than wed the princess gossamer daughter of king bulbul the btory further relates how the prince was banished and trarsformed what were the pranks he played on earth these are rather trivial in the order of their inventionhow he got rid of some of that freakishness which mrs hall in common with all fairytale tellers ascribes to the little peoplehow he fell in love with an earthly damselwhat took place upon the last event the political consequences of which do not appear to have been calculated for by queen foamhow he returned home and what then took place we have all this with a moral of the good sound sort which of course we shall not impart neither relate the termination of the story in the fate of the little prince let the reader learn it for himself and in so doing appreciate at his best the manner of the writer whose ornate fancy revels in  pretty rather than in potent matters whose conception of faery lacks vigour quite as much as it comes short in inventioniwhose ideas savour of the operatic style and whose book is by no means free from affectation the considerate reader who knows not only the rarity of firstrate fairy tales but the immense difficulty which besets their writers will know how well our author has succeeded notwithstanding the shortcomings we are in no unkindly spirit compelled to point out as to the illustrations before us m this volume they are thoroughly in keeping with the text the immemorial hand of mr kenny meadows has contributed a larger number than that of any other artist these suit the story wonderfully of

little pieces of prose both classes of the text are pleasantly perhaps a little too pleasantly written all the boys and girls behave themselves as they should obediently lovingly and with a wonderful show of forbearance the illustrations which are by mr john proctor are good enough for a commonplace purpose but not good enough to be of the better class bounder workmanship or at least more of refinement in execution is desirable for them many are spirited there is nothing to challenge in the book unless indeed it be a recommendation to see general tom thumb lightsome and the little golden lady is a capital childs fairystory with just the slight defect of a rather dull beginning to create such beginning is on the part of the author with mr bennetts aim a great mistake and almost fatal

of the method by which lightsome cuts off the tails of the bulls moreover it is incredible that the same thing should happen more than once the history of the scales that weighed everything into gold

hardhearted magistrate and abundant adventures with smugglers seamen and such like materials for a boys story that it is a little overlaboured may be no deterring matter for juvenile readers

we not long since reviewed croxaus production is almost universally known in this country and is one of the oldfashioned ornate sort of translations from the classics which obtained favour when the severe simple manner of such originals was little appreciated among us the new translation now before us is decidedly clearer purer in style and infinitely terser than its predecessor it contains also a much greater number of fables than was comprised in the edition to which we have just referred and morewe believe than are to be found in common editions as a literary production the present is creditable to the editor aud traudator it is however rather bald and somewhat deficient in that terse wordpainting which gives life to a literal translation the illustrations which are thu work of mr

reader is rather depressing in short the story is not otherwise describable by us than as nambypamby worse than that is the fact that it is a nambypamby allegory and an example of a style which has

forner christmas books  tinykins transformations two other less wellknown but most elegant draughts upon the imagination of the late editor of punch with respect to our old friend tinykin we must remind our readers that although the scene of the tale is fairyland still that fairyland lies in tilgate forest a part of sussex with which mr lemon was familiar on account of his lonf residence within a drive of its outskirts we will not give our readers more than just a hint about its contents because we do not wish to anticipate the pleasure with which julia will dilate her large blue eyes and the glee with which little alice will clap her hands when they see titania and her little carpenters sawing in the wood and the guards of the fishbarons castle swimming about in the shape of fairy lobsters and the host of little tilgate fairies dancingaroundtheir beloved queen not less elegant in their way are the elfin horse and the gnomeking towards the end of the tale but best of all perhaps are the vignettes of the banqueting tables and the tiny musicians in the gnome kings palace on pages 1589 and that of tinykin transformed into a mole and pricked in the rear by the sharp points of the lances and swords of the little fairy imps who figure as the gnome police as for tinykin himself like proteus the old man of the sea in the fourth georgic of virgil he omnia transformat seize in miracula rerum but how he became in turn a bird a mole a bat and a fish and how in the end as uluf the son of thomas the verderer of tilgate he fell in love with the fairy daughter of the king and lived happily ever aftenvards we must leave to be told in mr lemons owvn words the scene of the story we should observe is laid in the reign of good king horsa when the fairies may be supposed to have had it nearly all their own way in the forest and woodlands of the west saxons we will only add that a summer day in tilgate forest is a very pleasant thing indeed but we think our young friends in the schoolroom will almost prefer a few hours of the holidays in the company of tinykin and mr markl lemon whose imagi native powers have found mr charles green an admirable interpreter in the chronicles of the three sisters which follow next we have the story of a  noble baron who shows his nobility by squandering away his money and estates and living like a prince and who is profoundly dissatisfied with the domestic management of his wvife and daughters and accordingly getting into all sorts of troubles he sees two of his three daughters married to a bear and an eagle respectively while a huge sea monsterwe can hardly call him a fishruns off with the mniru and tney pass into a state which to say the least is not that of ave rage humanity however the3 are won back to their larents by a younger brother rinaldo who isborn grows up to manhood dons the arms of knighthood and sallies forth upon adventures the end of the story is thus tolda whole year passed away in sports and festivities at last the princes considered that a continuance of these indulgences would enervate the courage and activity of their knights and squires the three sonsinlaw therefore with their ladies took their departure for their respective homes riccaldo the heir of the family never quitted his parents and at last like a pious son closed their eyes albert the bear bought the domain of ascania and founded the city bernberg edgar the eagle retired to switzerlandunder the shadow of the lofty alps and founded eagleton on the banks of a river which had then no name but is now called after the city by which it glides ugo the dolphin undertook an expedition into burgundy conquered part of that kingdom and named it dauphin6 and as the three princes in the names of their cities and states alluded to the circumstance of their enchantment they also took their own enchanted shapes for the devices of their arms thence bernberg carries a bear with a golden crowr eagleton an eagle and dauphine a fish as a device to this day it should be added that for a profusion of graceful illustrations this story is indebted to the pencil of air c h bennett the third story that of the enchanted doll has tow additional claims on our attention firstly it teaches a high moral lesson that of checking all envious feelings an secondly its scene is laid in london partly at  kilboune near the old priory there and partly in the city how the gift of an enchanted doll is made the vehicle of conveying this lesson to a selfish and grasping londoner we will leave mr mark lemon to tell our readers in his own words for fear that his publishers should think that wve have been poaching on his and their manor and preserves we owe them our best thanks for allowving us to transfer to our pages two of the illustrations of this beautiful and really charming volume viz that of the fairies dancing in a ring round their beloved queen  from tinvkins tranformations by mr c green and that of the enchanted doll being shaped into form by a swann of little fairies in the artists workshop it is quite a masterpiece in it way and equal to anything that we have seen ven from the pencil of ar richard doyle the special artist of the fairies and fairyland  fairy tales by hans christian andersen illustrated by e v b london sampson low marston low and searle every one is now more or less acquainted with andersens delightful tales in which the fantastic the poetical and the grotesque are blended with such artistic harmony but few are prepared to see the selection of eight of the prettiest stories in the splendid binding fine text and original illustrations of this truly handsome volume the twelve large chromolithographs are treated in the bright and somewhat crude colouring which has latterly been so much en vogme and seems at this season of the year especially to supersede the quieter woodcuts and engravings of former days the quaintness of this florid style is however peculiarly adapted to the subject it is most conspicuous in the picture of the wicked princess in her garden which is almost weird in its conception so much so indeed that it all but precludes the possibility of its being intended to grace a childs book not so the one of the  children playing in the water which is full of life and grace while the two interiors of the  ugly duckling and the  witch combing gerdas hair have quite a flemish finish of detail on the whole we incline to believe that the  fairy tales is more a drawingfoom album than a volume for little people whose meddlesome fingers should not be allowed to dogear its handsome pages although no doubt a glimpse of its bright beauties would be an exquisite treat as they could not fail to recognise their old friends in their brilliant new christmas garb  faint tales eooks ron childuint by mark lemon with upwards of fifty illustrations by richard doyle and charles h bennett bradbury evans  co mr lemon has already ventured among the fairies and stood on enchanted ground he has made two more journeys in the same direction and to little people of mortal mould gives the fruits of bis experience or of his invention yet not entirely of either for his first story the chronicles of the three sisters is from the german the original author of it was not much of a conjurer if there is any moral in the story which shows how three daughters of a baron came to marry a bear an eagle and a fish and that these turned out to be princes it is that sonsinlaw may not be such beasts as they look the grandest piece of magic in the story is at the service of every individual who may stand in need of it and a knowledge thereof may be profitable to many a person suffering froma baroness indulging in bitterest reproaches the baron had recourse to his invariable practice in all conjugal altercations and observed a profound silence suffer ing the lady to proceed until she was tired mr lemon does not say whether his second story the enchanted doll is original or overset from the german he does however very soon settle a point in fairy chronology for he tells us that the story    happened years ago long before the fairies had left us as we find that tony stubbs one of the characters distinguished for his ability in chasing gold and silver  had gone over the sea as far as florence to study in the workshop of the great benvenuto cellini we learn that the fairies were alive and active at least as late as the middle of the sixteenth century be this as it may the enchanted doll is a better story than  the chronicle of the three sisters and it may teach a good many of us how to get rid of the very black doll which sorely besets some men,folklore

B6083,"['8703040', '6638794']",  slavonic fairy tales collected and translated from the russian polish servian and bohemian slavonic folklore by john t naake of the british museum h s king  co serbian folklore popular tales selected and translated by madame csedomille mijatovies edited with an introduction by the rev w denton ma lsbister co by a strange coincidence two collections of slavonic tales have appeared simultaneously in an english dress as we have already been favoured with a tolerably large assortment of similar stories from russia we may we presume assume that more interest is taken now than formerly in the literatures of the slavonic peoples in german schools it is said russian is at present largely taught france is opening her eyes to the fact that french is no longer the universal tongue it once professed to be and is directing her attention to the difficult speech of the manymillioned russian people in whom she recognises her natural allies even in our insular stronghold on this side of the channel across which foreign tongues have found it so hard to make their way books are beginning to appear which deal with slavonic subjects without displaying either ignorance or contempt perhaps one explanation of this strange phenomenon may be found in the fact that many of them are themselves of slavonic origin thus in the present instance a polish translator introduces a sample of  slavonic fairy tales a servian translator presents us with two selections from  serbian folklore similarly a russian princess has lately made available for english readers a romance by a russian count one advantage of this novel system is that we are secured against the terrible blunders into which the old school of translators used to fall and foreign authors are spared the intense sufferings to which they were too often exposed in dealing with the books now before us we may be certain that they do justice to their originals and therefore we may judge their contents on their own merits mr naake tells us in the preface to his attractive little volume that the bohemian tales perhaps through the genius of the poets who have preserved them have in their original form more art more grace more completeness of outline than the others the natural inference to be drawn from these words is although the writer may not have meant to suggest it that the bohemian ladies and gentlemen who have acted as the amanuenses of the common people have added graces of their own to the simple recitals of uncultured storytellers very poetical for instance is the account of how lidushka finds that every time she lifts one of the reversed jars which stand in the kitchen of the subaqueous frogdemon a little white dove flies out from under it joyfully flutters its wings and disappears these doves are  the souls of the unfortunate people whom the waterdemon had drawn into his power and had cruelly drowned so also when irik in  golden hair seeks the enchanting daughter of the king of the palace of crystal he is told that every morning at the break of day she combs her golden locks its brightness ia reflected on the sea and up among the clouds and again when the mischievous yanechek has fallen into the hands of a waterdemon his mother renders herself invisible to the fiend by fasting for three weeks whereupon we learn that her body dried up and became as thin as a shadow  her mothers love alone kept her alive for that love was her only food and her only comfort the polish tales are said to reflect the passive virtues and genial warmth of the peasants whose lives they illustrate we should rather be inclined to say that the specimens given in the present volume show a morbid taste for horrors and a strong inclination on the part of the polish peasants to refer the miseries of human life to diabolical agencies in them we see a magician hoisted by his own whirlwind and sent flying through space attended by innumerable crowswe watch the terrible procession of the spirit of the pestilencewe hear the village dogs bark furiously as the plague goes by in the guise of a tall woman clothed in white with dishevelled hairand we listen to the screech uttered by an evileyed parent as he plucks from their sockets the illomened orbs which he fears will blast the prospects of his newborn babe the russian stories are characterized we are told by  a greater simplicity amounting even to childishness the servian are in some features unique and may be found the most interesting of the series this remark certainly holds good in the case of the servian legend which accounts for the sole of mans foot being uneven the explanation is as follows when the evil spirits were turned out of heaven they took the sun with them the devil carrying it stuck on a lance across his shoulder the archangel michael was sent to recover it but could not do so for a long time at last however he induced the devil to dive into the sea caused its surface to freeze hard as soon as the fiend had disappeared beneath it and set off at full speed for heaven carrying with him the sun which the devil had been obliged to leave on the shore for fear of drying up the sea if he took it with him up came the devil to the froeen surface summoned by the screams of a magpie he had left in charge burst through the ioy obstacle and gave chase to the flying archangel the good spirit succeeded in getting into heaven with his prize but just as he crossed the threshold the evil one tore a piece of flesh out of the sole of one of his feet by way of consolation  from that day there appeared a small hollow in the sole of mans foot and thus it has remained unto this day this story is the gem of mr naak6s collection which may be recommended as a pleasant and unpretentious little work well arranged and conscientiously translated suitable as a present for children and by no means devoid of attraction for more scholarly readers of its four illustrations if regarded from a slavonic point of view the less said the better madame csedomille mijatovies qu mijatovics serbian folklore is a more bulky work than mr naakes some of the tales running to considerable length to such length indeed that they become tedious it is preceded by an excellent preface contributed by mr denton a wellknown authority on servian affairs who in it treats the vexed questions of the origin and the meaning of folk tales with much discretion and judgment from it we gather some interesting information about the servian storytellers during the summer evenings the young girls in servian villages gather in groups beneath some widespreading tree and occupy themselves in spinning while some older woman tells stories for their benefit such stories are always in prose but when men take up thc wondrous tale they throw it into verse and accompany it by the monotonous sounds of the gusle at times somewhat unromantic incidents supply a theme to these rustic minstrels mr denton tells us that long tedious debates in the national parliament of 1870 on the right of opening shops in villages as distinguished from towns were treated by these homely bards the whole discussion was thrown into the shape of a lengthy song and recited in the open air before village assemblies and so as mr denton observes the servian practice of the present day forms an excellent instance of the manner in which  a servian homer would naturally have communicated to his countrymen all the details of meetings at the councilboard and skirmishes in the plain which diversified the history of a siege in the fortunes of which their interest was enlisted the stories in the present collection show no trace of ever having had a metrical form so it may be supposed if mr denton s statement is correct that they are due to female narrators about half of them are taken from the collection rendered familiar to western readers by the excellent german translation published in 1854 at berlin the rest are taken from a bosniac collection made by young theological students members of the college at dyakovo in croatia they form a valuable contribution to the stockintrade of storiologists who will do well to add these new volumes to their already groaning shelves  slavonic fairy tales i    collected and traine latect from the rusgian polish servian and bohemian by john t naak6 of the british museum with four illustrations london henry s king  co 1874 the westslavonian folktales still remain to be properly edited in russia great pains have been taken to place upon record the legendary lore which in many parts of the country is fawt dying out of the memo ries of the people servia was fortunate enough early to produce an enthnsiastic collector of its songs and stories vuk stefanovich karajich and bosnia has quite recently put forth a collection of its popular tales made by the bosnian theological students at the college of dyakovo in croatia but the tales of poland bohemia and moravia and those specially belonging to the wends of lusatia have as yet attracted little scientific attention various collections have been made it is true but they have never been methodical they have not always been trustworthy to many of the polish and bohemian legends an artificial splendour has now and then been added by means of literary gilding the raw material supplied by rustic hands has been sometimes sub mitted by culture to a culinary process for which earnest storycomparers are by no means grateful still many genuine stories have been brought together in various col lections for a knowledge of which most scholars have hitherto been indebted mainly to wenzigs excellent westelawischer mar chenschatz english readers now have an opportunity of becoming acquainted with eleven polish and eight bohemian stories as well as with eight russian and thirteen servian in mr naakes modest but serviceable collection of slavonic fairy taleo its contents are as a general rule well chosen and they are translated with a fidelity which deserves cordial praise the russian stories contained in the present volume are not very good specimens of their class the  snowchild is not a folktale but a literary mans or womans imitation of one in genuine folktales it is not uncommon to find a babe developed for the solace of childless parents out of a pea or a twig or an egg or the like but a child made of snow whose eyes looked like two forgetmenots and who eventually  melted away and changed in an instant into a beautiful white cloud rose up and disappeared in the sky for ever belongs not to the peasants hut but to the ro mancers study the  story of gol voyansky  is a chapbook  version of the wellknown tale in which a killer of flies first pretends to be a hero and then performs or at least appears to perform heroic feats the gallant warriors who keep him company belong to the band of heroes who figure in the russian builita8 or metrical romances on which the compilers of the russian equivalents for our chapbooks have freely drawn one of them eraslan lazarevich has been clearly iden tified with the persian rustem the story of vasilisa with the golden tress who is saved from an abducting dragon by her brother ivan the pea is a better specimen but its chapbook origin is clearly proved by the factamong othersthat the double operation requisite for the resuscitation of a dead hero is slurred over in it whereas great stress is always laid upon its twofold nature in the genuine folktales the same test may be safely applied to the story of little simpleton which like that of ivan krachina is a medley of various episodes taken from a number of independent tales the  book of magic  is in all pro bability a western story of witchcraft which has made its way into russia and then become turned into a  soldier story the legends of  spirit treasures  are curious if they can be relied upon but the similarity between the cat which  crumbled into gold pieces or the spectre which crumbled into old copper money and the wellknown gold men of buddhist moral fiction is too close to be free from suspicion some of the polish stories bear manifest signs of literary handicraft a belief in the malignity of an  evil eye  may exist in poland though it certainly does not flourish in any slavonic land as it does in the south of europe but it could never have given rise in a peasants mind to such a piling up of horrors as is exhibited by wojeickis story of which a transtion has been given by mr naak there exists it may be remarked a german translation of lewestam of wojcickis collection but it is rare and little known according to the story in question a polish gentleman had such evil eyes that all was blighted at which he looked and so he was obliged to pas most of his time in regarding a bundle of peastrawthat product of nature being comparatively insensible to bad looks at last however he fell in love and married after a time his wife begia to wither under his too ardent gaze in vain did he request her to extract his eyes so he determined that he would by his own hands deprive himself of the power of blighting his ex pected babe soon afterwards two cries unlike in their sound were heard in the house the onethe joyful cry of a newborn infant as it first saw the light the otherthe agonised cry of a man the infants father as he parted with sight for ever his eyes glittering like two diamonds lay on the ground by the side of a bloodstained knife after this his life was everything he could wish but an in quisitive servant who knew what had taken place one day unfortunately for bimself dug up his masters eyes  suddenly they glared upon him like two live coals as soon as their baneful light shone upon his wrinkled face the old man shivered fell down and died this sort of romancing is quite in the ca8tle of otranto vein and may please some minds more than the cruder monstrosities which occur in unmanipulated folktales another of the polish stories that of the  hares heart is founded upon a genuine superstition but it has been manifestly elaborated the notion that a mans courage is subtly connected with his material heart is common to many peoples among some of whom it is or was a common practice for a warrior to fortify or encourage himself by feeding upon the heart of a conquered bear or foemn in the polish story a converse operation is performed a brave mans heart is extracted and a hares put in its place from that time forward he was far worse than chiekenhearted so timid did he become that when one day a swallow which was flying past struck him on the head with ibs wing the blow was fatal the poor knight fell down as if struck by lightning and soon afterwards died the polish stories of  carried away by the wind the demons dance the plague omen the  plage the  plague and the peasant and venwolves are all closely in keeping with the superstition though theyr are not told in the language of the people there is always a tendency in uncultured minds towards personifying an epidemic in times of plague and pestilence the destroying force readily takes a human shape to anxious and unenlightened eyes there is something mysteriously grand in these pictures due to the popular fancy of the onward sweep of the ghastly form of the destroyer accompanied by its terrible train the word homen which occurs in a story called by a strange coincidence  the plague omen is intended to express the noisy movement of this pestilenceprocession being akin to gain or gain a confused noise whence oome gomit to brawl and a number of kindred words expressive of loud but inarticulate sound the story of madey is the well known mediaeval legend of the criminal who is told by a dignitary of the church that his sins will not be forgiven until a dead stick has become a living tree even tually the stick does become a tree and bears fruit and the criminal is forgiven in the polish story as the criminal confesses his crimes the apples on a tree beside which he kneels turn into snowwhite doves and fly awaythe last being  the soul of madeys father whom he had murdered for some time the sinner cannot bring himself to confess his greatest sin at last however he does so the ultimate fruit flies away as a dove and the pardoned penitent crumbles into dust in this version the essential idea that of the dead stick taking life has been forgotten whereas due prominence will be found given to it in the lithuanian story schleicher no 26 which it in many respects closely resembles in a little russian version given by afanasief legenz dui p 178 the tree bears a number of silver apples and two of gold the fruits answer to the robbers crimes the golden apples signifying his sins of patricide and matricide he confesses to all but the last two and so he dies while the golden a ples still hang on the boughs and  worse han all other sinners is he tortured in the lower world afanasief in commenting on the polish story refers the appletree in cident to old heatheu ideas about the soul some critics may be inclined to refer it rather to the imagination of the literary reciter the bohemian stories in mr naak6s collection are specially interesting inasmuch as they contain a good deal of genuine folk4ore respecting hobgoblins and watersprites to this day slavonic rustics firmly believe that spirits almost invariably of a malicious character haunt pools and streams and therefore those of their stories which deal with such beings are of a more original natutre than those tales of eastern origin which refer to sevenheaded snakes and other asiatic monsters in which they do not believe in the story of  lidushka and the water demons wife a peasant woman consents to become godmother to a frogs child and descends into the sub aqueous world in the palace of the frog demon who answers to the russian waterking she finds a room in which stand rows of little jars she lifts them one after another and out of each flies a white dove these doves  were the souls of the unfortunate people whom the water demon had drawn into his power and had cruelly drowned each soul had been kept in a separate dark prison in the shape of a little jar lidushka was the deliverer of them al this is exceedingly picturesque but as in the case of the applebirds the white doves have a suspicious air the idea has been worked out by mr keightley in his fairy mythology in the story of the soul cages  jack discovers that his friend coomara the merrow is in the habit of imprisoning in lobsterpots the souls of drowned sailors so he secretly opens the soulcages and releases their invisible inmates to a subsequent edition of this oftenquoted story mr keightley ap pended the following note  we must here make an honest confession this story had no foundation but the german legend in p 259 all that is not to be found there is our own pure invention we should like to see a conscientious edition of west slavonic and many other storieswith notes in the story of lidushka as well as in that of yanechek the water demon often takes the shape of  a beautiful red waterplant floating on the top of the water in both stories the souls of the drowned are imprisoned by the watersprite on the tricksy spirit who has inurned the bad boy yanechek that boys mother lays her hands and ties him up in her cottage with a ninefold rope of bast when yane chek has been released from his prisonhouse he treacherously endeavours to kill the bound demon but in his awkwardness merely cuts his bonds the demon upsets a jug containing a few drops of water which become a strong flood like a summer torrent among the mountains and drown the wicked yanechek and his weak minded indulgent mother whose souls are immediately potted by the water demon no one can complain that the bohemian tales are devoid of moral teaching the wicked wood fays is a good story in itself but it sounds much more like a servian than a bohemian tale in servia the vilas really do in popular belief tear out the eyes of unwary mortals it seems to be doubtful whether in bohemia they ever behaved in a fashion so much more savage and unmeaning than that which characterises their sister spirits in other western and northern slavonic lands it is difficult to believe that in the land of the czqkhs there ever existed a cave where there was a large heap of eyes great and small black red blue and green even although some of them may have belonged to owls and others to fish its locality may really have been farther east where the milder traditions of the slavs became influenced by the fierce superstitions of the turkish and finnish races of the servian tales contained in mr naak6s collection we will not speak at present but before taking leave of his   prettily got up volume we ought to mention that its contents fully come up to the promise held out in its preface the flowers plucked not for their scientific interest but for the wild fresh perfume that clings about them will justly give pleasure to many admirers who have not sufficiently cultivated their literary perceptions to be able to distinguish between the perfumes of the library and the field to children in particular the book may be confidently recommended the stories it contains are all the more suited for them in that theywith the exception perhaps of those from serviahave been trimmed and pruned by able editors but not by mr naak6 who has worked quite honestly before being exhibited to the public to them also the illustrations which they may recognise if they are well up in the periodical publications of the day may prove quite as attractive as if they had been in the

B334,['6660140'],  the folklore of rome collecte by waord of i mouth fro the people by r h busi author of  patralias   sagas from the far east c london longmans  co 1874 miss blsk deserves great credit for the perseverance with which she has collected her extensive store of roman folktales and for the pains she has taken in grouping and marshalling them in almost every respect her present book is far superior to the other volumes of a similar nature which she has compiled and we may fairly look forward to receiving from her if she unflaggingly continues her studies such work as may be praised without reservation at present although her method bas decidedly improved there is still room in it for further improvement for instance a collector who takes down tales from the mouths of the common people ought if professing to work in the cause of science to give the names and address of every storyteller otherwise the world has no guarantee fbr the authenticity of the transcript this duty miss busk has entirely ignored and consequently we have no means of testing the accuracy of her impressions this is the more to be lamented inasmuch as these roman folktales are often told in language unlike that in which their sister stories are narrated elsewhere we may take as an example the passage in filagranata p 9 which depicts one of those wellknown scenes in which a prince having kissed a relative in spite of his wifes warning not to do so forgets that wife and prepares to take to himself another we have seen the kissing incident described a hundred times but never in such a style as this then all in the palace went to their sleepingchambers but the prince as it had been his wont from his childhood upwards went into his mothers room to kiss her after she wats asleep and when he saw her placid brow on the pillow with the soft white hair parted on either side of it and the eyes which were wont to gaze or him with so much love resting in sleep he could not forbear from pressinf his lips on her forehead and giving the wonted kiss as miss busk holds forth a promise of a second series let us hope that she will follow the good example set by mr campbell in his tales of the west highlands in which the name and address of the narrator of each story are conscientiously recorded as well as the date and place of its narration in that second series we would suggest also that as a general rule not more than one version of the same story shculd be given at length the repetition of all but identical incidents soon becomes wearisome on the other hand variants such as those which miss busk has given in small print are always valuable to comparers though they are apt to prove tedious to ordinary readers miss busk does not appear to be well acquainted with what has already been done in italy or is nfow being done to illustrate the folklore of its various provinces it seems that she  had heard it so often positively asserted that modern italy had no popular mythology and no contribution of special versions to offer to the worlds store of traditionary tales that she long refrained from attempting to discover any current italian folktales at last she took to hunting through the bookshops new and old to find any sort of collection of traditionary tales ready made but only with the effect of establishing the fact that no italian grimm had yet arisen to collect and organise them and put them into available shape it is true that she has heard of professor de gubernatis but she did not see his book on zooloyical iytlhology academt vol iv p 221 till after her ms was in the printers hands moreover she tells us the comparatively recent collection of sicilian tales by laura gonzenbach it was published in 1870 we may as well observe mentioned by irot ssor de 4ubernatis i did not know of and have not been able to see now to send information from london to a student of italian folklore residing in the capital of italy might seem to be equivalent to sending owls to athens or coals to newcastle it may be of use however to other explorers of the field to which miss busk has devoted herself if we give a few references to some of the books which have already appeared or are now in preparation upon the subject of the italian folktale as it happens two of the best edited collections of popular tales which we possess come from italythe volksmndirchen aus venctien von g widter a wolf und r koliler published in 1866 in the jahrbuch fir ronianische und engliscue literatur and the sivllianiscle miirejen see academy vol i p 171 published by signora laura gonzeubach with reinhold kolilers inva luable annotations in 1870 for several yeari dr giuseppe pitre of palermo has been collecting the materials for an extensive work on sicilian folktales which is now passing through the press and of which he has alieady printed several specimens under the titles of sagygo di fiabe e novelle popv lar i siedia northeast palermo 1873 nuovo sagypo c imola 1873 and otto fiabe c bologna 1873 academy vol iv 441 from venice we have also the fiats polpulari vencziane raccolte da d g bcrinmi venezia 1873 besides these there are the noevelliue di s stefnon collected by angelo de gubernatis in 1869 and the novelloja fiare a tin a and the norellaja milanese both edited by vittorio imbriani the former at naples in 1871 and the latter at bologna in 1872 in all parts of italy indeed at the present moment the tales current among the peasantry are being diligently collected and sedulously compared before long the italian folktale will be better represented than almost any other member of the widelyspread family to which it belongs it is of course unnecessary to say that there is very little that is absolutely novel in the rounan folktales the fiarole which occupy the first third of miss busks colleoc tion are variants of the old familiar  fairytales  to which we have so often listenedtales which if we are not mistaken have passed from the pens of professional eastern storytellers to the lips of the roman peasantry some of the details are curious thus in  the dark king a variant of the cupid and psyche story or that of  beauty and the beast combined with  blue beard the girl who opens the door of the forbidden chamber finds within it  a num ber of beautiful maidens weaving glittering raiment and  a goldsmith and all his men  making ornaments all of whom state that they are preparing the wedding apparel of the dark kings bride but beyond them is 4a little old hunchback sitting crosslegged and patching an old torn coat with a heap of other wornout clothes lying about him and he says he is mending the rags for the girl to go away in who was to have been the bride of the dark king and soon afterwards she has to retire in rags and disgrace after having driven a knife into the breast of her sleeping and unsuspecting lord in a variant of the story the deccan punchkin the russian koshchei the norse  giant who had no heart in his body the external object with which the demoniacal personages life is mysteriously connected is a stonewhich is lodged inside the head of a bird which lives inside the head of a leveret which resides inside the central head of a sevenheaded hydra when this stone is placed under the pillow of the demoniacal being who is represented as a wizard or magician he gives three terrible yells turning himself round and round three times and falls dead the incident has been interpolated in a version evidently derived from a literary source of the story of  aladdins lamp in a roman version apparently borrowed from modern greece of the strange myth of the king who insists upon marrying his daughter because her foot is exactly fitted by her dead mothers shoe the princess escapes from her father inside  a figure of an old woman just like life fitted with all sorts of springs to make it move and walk when one gets inside it just like a real woman in  the two hunchbacked brothers  we have an unsatisfactory version of a fairy story well known in coltic lands a hunchback is surrounded on a wide moor by a whole host of little hunchbacks who dance around him chanting plaintivelysaldbbto domouica many times at last he chimes in with the word  lunedi   whereupon both he and i they lose their humps his equally hunchbacked brother having tried the same ecepriment and having added the line  martei   to the song of  a tribe of hunchbacks which ransabbato domoenica lunedi   receives from them a drubbing and an added hump the story is unintelligible and unreasonable in its roman dress in the form in which it appears in the siddui kmir it is perfectly intelligible and certain premises being granted completely reasonable more   over the celtic tale is fraught with but a small amount of moral teaching while the italian tale can boast of none at all but their mongolian elder sister is absolutely replete with edifying doctrine after the favole in miss busks collection follow a number of  legendary tales ghost and treasure stories ciarpe c the ghost stories are disappointing and the jooular tales have unavoidably suf fered greatly in transit still there is much that is interesting to be discovered among them and they will doubtless be appreciated by many readers to whom the sicilianische marcehen and the volksmdrchen aus tmenetien are sealed books w r s

B11,"['8634064', '8521913', '6759661']",  popular tales from the norse by g webbe dasent dcl with an introductory essay on the origin and diffusion of popular tales edinburgh edmonston  douglas these quaint stories are translations from the norske folkeerentyr collected by mm asbjbrnsen and moe and have been the preface says the occasional work of dr dasent for fifteen years which is more than the period of patience that horace required of an author the translator has gone upon the sound principle of omitting stories unfit for modern eyes but has wisely refused to soften blunt rude tales the value of which to the philologist and ethnologist consists in the faithfulness and truth of their rendering it was a severe rebuke to the pedant of a former age to find from grimm that latin and greek were not the foundations of all language that great scholar proved not only that teutonic laws were codes as valuable as those of justinian that though german minnesingers were not inferior to the occasional versewriters of though anthologia but also that our old norse mythology had been a source of poetry and fable as prolific as the old greek the discovery of the harmony existing between the language and creeds of the east and west began with the jesuits studies and thc researches of anquetil de perron at the end of the last century nursery tales became henceforward the study of the scholar so that the child laughed in the nursery over what was racking the scholar in his library it was as when the antiquary finds his child playing with a golden daric of a special rarity nursery stories were discovered to bo small pompeiis of ancient manners fossiled strata of bygone arabian icelandic or persian antiquities they led us back to wonderful theories of the alliances and conquests and descent of the nations who wrote them languagedoctors learned to take uri these fables point to their roots and explain to us as with vegetables the manner and time of their growth many of the stories were found existing in five or six different nations and in different ages and different degrees of civilizationwilliam tell for instance and his daring shot it is told in saxo grammaticus in the twelfth century of king harold gormsons thane in the willana saga of wayland smiths younger brother in the saga of king olof of eindredi the heathen chief it is told again of king harold sigurdarson who died 1066 in the fourteenth century the malleus maleficorum refers it to puncher a magician of the upper rhine in england william of cloudsle in the old north country ballad performs the same featit is common to the turks mongolians and samoyeds it is evident that though it may have happened to tell and that geslers cruelty may have been stimulated to inventiveness by the old legend the fable is of great antiquity and common to all archer nations it proves on the greek principle of the origin of myth that in certain ages stories have ft tendency to gravitate towardb a favourite national hero eventually to crystallise round his memory and become incorporated with hi fame it is the same with the loose wit of an age which comes down to the next generation as the jests of erskine or of sheridan half a wit says is forgotten half he is supposed to say is invented for him he is both better and worse than tradition allows one of the stories in dr dasents book called the master thief is we believe in the gesta bomanorum certainly in the sanscrit hitopadesa in herodotus and in german italian and flemish popular tales it is the same with the welsh story of gellert that the guide tells you as you stand wrapped in white clouds on the peak of snowdon the story is of the faithful dog who saved his master s child from a wolf and is slain by mistake as its supposed murderer this is a sanscrit and arabic storythe monks knew it pilpay records it and there is an old english version of it it is like  the dog of montargis which is told by plutarch and is an old french story also of the days of charlemagne sindbad and aladdin hassan and noureddin are of a common family with jack the giantkiller and puss in boots gentlemen all of unquestionable descent and whose genealogical tree is no mere walkingstick sapling iesop himself 13 not a bit superior to old pilpay nor is meagre phsedrus to be compared to the great german beastepic reynard the fox it is true that these wide analogies set us thinking but do not lead us very far on our way back to babel and eden we come however at last to the two great primaeval distinctions totheshemsand japhetsthe doers and thinkers the conquerors of europe and of india who now meet again after their long wanderings to quarrel once more for the empire of hindostan these two people of central asia were those of iran the tillers and those of iwran or the horsemenwanderersthe indoeuropean and the mongolian the author traces very ingeniously the corruption of the frost giants whose skulls thor had such a habit of splitting like walnuts to the meaner lubberly trolls whom jack always got the better of he shows us how in myths from the foes of the gods these giants became the largeheaded weaklegged dolts of our pantomimes and nursery stories as for odin he turned into the wild huntsman just as heathen wells became the founts of churcheschristianity putting its broad arrow on all the old pagan goods and chattels the monkish stories made the saints wander about and have adventures just as odin did who used to stroll into the forges of village smiths and get his heavenly horse newly shod frigga odins wife the goddess of industry and plenty is still worshipped under the name of the virgin of the fabulous golden agean old pagan tradition annexed and christened by the monksdr dasent tells us a very strange and epical legend that we cannot for the heart of us forbear copying the remembrance of the bountiful frodi echoed in the songs of german poets long after the story which made him so bountiful had been forgotten  but the norse skalds could tell not only the story of fredis wealth and bounty but also of his downfall and ruin in frodis house were two maidens of that old giant race fenja and menja these daughters of the giant he had bought as slaves and he made them grind his quern or handnull grotti out of which he used to grind peace and gold even in that golden age one sees there were slaves and frodi however bountiful to his thanes and people was a hard taskmaster to his giant handmaidens he kept them to the mill nor gave them longer rest than the cuckoos note lasted or they could sing a song but that quern was such that it ground anything that the grinder chose though until then it had ground nothing but gold and peace so the maidens ground and ground and one sang their piteous tale in a strain worthy of eschylus as the other restedthey prayed for rest and pity but frodi was deaf then they turned in giant mood and ground no longer peace and plenty but fire and war then the quern went fast and furious and that very night came mysing the searover and slew frodi and all his men and carried off the quern and so frodis peace ended the maidens the searover took with him and when he got on the high seas he bade them grind salt so they ground and at midnight they asked him if he had not salt enough but he bade them still grind on so they ground till the ship was full and sank mysing maids and mill and all and thats why the sea is salt perhaps of all the tales in this volume none could be selected as better proving the toughness of a traditional belief than no ii which tells why the sea is salt the norse had no idea of that devil whom the monks magiclanterned till he grew so large as to be all but omnipresent and omniscient as for hel she was the goddess who kept the nine keys of the place of death where all went who were unlucky enough not to die laughing on the field of battle waning for odin in some of these stories of our philologist the heathen clement and antiquity is singularly perceptible as in  the master smith where the hero thinks he has done a silly thing in quarrelling with the deviland in not a pin to choose between them where peter the husband of the silly goody goes about begging for alms from door to door in paradise the transformations of men into beasts are numerousas in the greek and roman stories which perhaps are of scythian origin the werewolf or manwolf is a frequent character in the old legends but the favourite beast for norse transformation is the bearwhose strength and sagacity made him an object of wonder and respect with the sturdy woodmen of norway who even now think the finns and lapps can assume the shape of animals the lapps disowning this magical power still call the bear grandfather look on him with awe beg his pardon as they cut his throat bring him back to their tent with apologetic ceremonies declaring that  grandfather whom they have killed had the strength of ten men and the wit of twelve greylegs wolf is a kindlygrateful beast in the old storiesand the horses save their masters out of peril and bear them to fortune the dog makes no great figurebut the goat occasionally being sacred to thor appears in force and with supernatural attributes the trolls seem to have been more pucklike and malignant than the giants they were weaker and therefore more malicious they seem to have devoted their lives to injure man and mans works sometimes they are represented as thieves and cannibals they dwell in the spins of the fells in the dried pineforest in dens to which they carry off the children of men helpless lads and beautiful maidens they guard the riches and sit in clefts of the rocks surrounded by threadneedle streets full of gold and silver they haunt the dark forest by day and feast by night to see the sun was fatal to themif once it looked them full in the face they burst in sheer spite fear horror and disgust about all these storiescrystalsided and sparkling with fancies rare and fantastic as the shapes that icicles assume  there is a bluff honesty refreshing as the rough wind that chills one minute and the next sends the warm blood in a red gush to the buffeted cheek hindu stories are tropically overlaid with imagery the arabs are keen and bright as their sabres and damascened with tropes and episodes the german are simple hearty and full of kindly humour the swedish are stiffer and more matteroffact but the norse are full of birdmusic and have a fragrance about them of wild flowers and the aromatic pineforest the men they paint are norsedaring fellows who die making the best of it fighting with the last inch of sword and after thattill the hand is lopped off they speak bluntly but never pervert morality or deny the true principles of right and wrong they delight to sketch the neglected and snubbed genius the younger brother who is what the norse call the coalbiter who broods over the firethinking but doing nothingwho is the drudge and fag of the familywho basks in the quiet selfconsciousness of hidden strength and who at last uprises like david to slay the philistine or rather to tame the magic horse ride up the slippery glass hill and win the princess though good the brave and the true are always praised this shows the just moral standard of though norse writer as for the women they are not very strongly drawn  but then they are generally bright good tender and helpfulforgetting themselves in their eagerness to help others as dr dasent says of the heroine justly   when she goes down thc well after the unequal match against her stepsister in spinning bristles against bax she steps tenderly over the hedge milks the cow shears the sheep reueves the boughs of the appletreeall out of the natural goodness of her heart when she is sent to fetch water from the well she washes and brushes and even kisses the loathsome head she bebeves what her enemies say even to her own wrong and injury she sacrifices all that she holds most dear and at last even herself because she is made to believe that it is her brothers wish and so on her too the good powers smile she can understand and profit by what the little birds say she knows how to choose the right casket and at last after many trials all at once the scene changes and she receives a glorious reward while the wicked stepmother and her ugly daughter meet with a just fate nor is another female character less tenderly drawn in bacon grizzlebeard no v where we bee the proud haughty princess subdued and tamed by natural affection into a faithful loving wife we sympathise with her more than with the patient grizzel of the poets who is in reality too good for her story has no relief while in bacon grizzlebeard we begin by being angry at the princesss pride we are glad at the retribution which overtakes her but we are gradually melted at her sufferings and hardships when she gives up all for the beggar and follows him we burst into tears with her when she exclaims  oh the beggar and the babe and the cabin and we rejoice with her when the prince says  here is the beggar and there is the babe and so let the cabin burn away there is something in very truth inimitable about these storiesas for instance the yankee vein of lying in the boots who made the princess say  thats a storywhich is a narrative of a witty younger son who is promised the hand of an exaggerating princess if he can make her express her wonder at his yarns about others as the gutnt who had no heart in his body there is an inexhaustible vein of imagination which even the  arabian nights though fuller of colour cannot rival in this as in so many of the norse stories there is a younger son who from natural kindness of heart on his way to other adventures helps neglected animals who in their turn aid him in moments of emergencya kindly moral not unuseful in its way he feeds a halfstarved raven slopes a salmon stranded on a shallow into deeper waterand gives his old horse to feed a wolf who in gratitude leads him to the giants house at this cannibals house he finds a princess who promises to aid him in killing the giant her masterbut the difficulty is that he does not carry his heart life about with him and keeps it a secret where it is hidden the faithful couple look everywhere for the giants heartunder the doorsill in the cupboardeverywhere but in vain like samson he will not betray his secret to dalilah till after much treacherous wheedling and pressing at last the very foolish monster confesses that far away in a lake lies an island on that island stands a church in that church is a well in that well swims a duck in that duck there is an egg and in that egg his heart like the house that jack built these stories run round this sort of wheel and back again off goes boots the coalbiter the wolf carries him to the island the raven flies to the tower for the churchkeys the salmon fetches the egg from the well where the guardianduck had dropped it he squeezes it the giant screams and begs for mercy 500 miles off boots treacherously makes him under a tacit promise turn six brothers of his back from stone to fleshthen breaks the egg and the giant dies of course the story ends with a wedding and with the usual quip which has drawn down thousands of peals of laughter if they have not done feasting why they are still at it  popular tabs

the children are likely to give this book a very hearty welcome it consists of a series of the most delightful fairy tales from norway that land where the supernatural still lingers some of course are very old friends and have been read in the pages of hans anderssen grimm and ferrault but even they have a flavour of the north as if the author had gathered the variants from the lips of his neighbours and the translator deserves congratulation on the success with which his work is done he does not always attain the same level but more than once his rendering is divinely felicitous we might take  the lad with the beer keg  as an example and but for its length would quote it in justification of praise that may seem extravagant the subject itself is a singular mixture of the gruesome the humorous and the fantastical but the story is related as all fairy tales should be in the matteroffact unconcerned supremely natural style that pays no heed to the auditors reflection any more than to the credibility of the story god the devil and death come after the beer in the intimate and familiar yet not irreverent manner in which we can imagine they used to figure in an easter play or a christmas mumming and the racy colloquialism is maintained without recourse to slang or its equivalent the english is very pure as well as being simple and familiar we have alluded only to one story but dozens might be quoted in many the usages of modern life are introduced into the stories in a manner that seems to show that the norwegians believe as sincerely in trolls and fairies as ever they did nor would it be fair to omit from mention the very clever illustrations they are the original pictures made by three norwegian artistse werenskiold t kittelsen and 0 sinding it might perhaps be objected that they are too clever and original for children but the book is likely to be often referred to and a picture is none the worse for being able to bear a third or a fourth scrutiny nor does it after all demand a very mature judgement to recognise the character that beams from the three troll faces on p 15 or the brightness and humour in nearly every cut the book deserves the very highest

farran 1877 ligecldes et ricits populaisres due pays basque par m cerquand parts iii paris leon ribaut 18756 about the language and literature of the basques trustworthy information has never been overabundant but about their po pular tales scarcely any has until quite recently been vouchsafed we ought therefore to be grateful to mr webster and to al cerquand for the conscientious works on the subject now before us what they have made known will serve as a fair sample of the basque contribution to comparative  storiologry as al cerquand has given the basque texts as wvell as french translations his work wvill be the more valuable of the two to linguistic students but on our side of the channel mr websters is lihely to be far the more widely read there is very little in these basque stories which is specially characteristic except the names of the supernatural beings who figure in them it is quite impossible for even the most imaginative reader to construct out of them the faintest picture of basque life as distinguished from that led by ordinary spanish or french or even german or italian peasants nor can they serve to convey any idea of the peculiarities of basque thought or feeling their moral and physical views are utterly destitute of local colour nor do these stories differ in aught but their supernatural nomencla ture froin the tales current in almost all parts of europe among this nonaryan people just the same stories circulate as are familiar to the aryan europeans we find no new tales of any length nothing of importance wvhtich has not been repeated un numbered timnel by german scandinavian and slavonic lips as with the hungariain so is it with the basques speaking a tongue alien to the aryan family of speech thse tell stories wvhich have been

and magyar specimens being included have been inde pendently evolved from mythological germs common to the human race before there was any difference between aryans and nonaryans the other explanation of the like ness between the basque and the rest of the european folktales seems at least simpler if spaniards and frenchmen borrowed their folktales of any length from the east of course the basques were likely to do the same there is not a single story of any length in the collections now before us for which either prof licbrecht or dr k61hler would be unable to quote close parallels from all parts of europe mr webster has been partly conscious of this and out of 218 pp 82 are devoted to  tales like the keltic and 33 more to  fairy stories derived directly from the french but if he had more often consulted what germans have written about popular tales lie would have seen that the tales of the west high lands and other similar stories from scotland ireland and brittany are not peculiar to kelts but are spread all over europe only once p 2 does he refer to a german book so we may infer that the special source of information on folktales has not been used by hiim and never does lie allude to any serious book on slavonic myih ology except m chodzkos now it is too much to expect that all comparative mythologists should be acquainted with slavonic tongues and it seems to be even too much to expect that they should be conscious of 1what has been done in the way of translations from the slavonic but unless a critic has studied what germany has taught his opinions on the mytlho logy of popular tales are apt to seenm less valuable to others than to hinmself he may be invaluable as a local collector or as an editor or translator of what others have gathered but he will act wisely if he keeps in reserve his ideas about the origin or the meaning of the stories he introduces to the world m cerquand observes a pleasing moderation in favouring us with his ideas about the solar myth but they obtrude them selves provokingly now and then thus in speaking i 34 of a being of the ogre or troll type who not unnaturally walks fast by dlay and sleeps by night in caverns lie

a flight of fancy as the following in one of the cinderella stories it seems the storyteller represented the bride and bridegroom as dressing each other on the wedding day  could any thing asks mr webster tell more quaintly of the marriage of the sun and dawn  the sun decking the morning clouds with his light and beauty and they again robing him in their soft and tender colouring  p xii in another place p 2 while speaking of the cyclops myth mr webster must needs suggest not only that the monsters single eve is that of the setting sun but that  the redhot stake is the ruddy mountain peak or the tall fir  trunk seen against the western horizon and illumined by his descending rays on the next page while speaking of those heroic fools who are not as he supposes them to be by any means peculiar to the basques lhe enquires can it be that the power which put out the suns fiery eye was looked upon as a beneficent being in a burning tropic land while as the legend travelled northward the act seemed more like that of madness or of senseless stupidity if anyone admires this sort of interpretation lhe will find at p 130 a specimen of it which covers more than a page a  suggested explanation  of an example of what may be called atmospherical or climatological myths but we will dwell no longer on what seems to us the one drawbiack to mr websters book we would not have alluded to it at all so grateful do we feel for what he has done aright were it not necessary to take every opportunity of warning collectors of local tales against attempting to explain them unless they have fitted themselves by special study for that arduous task much better is it to keep to facts than to venture on fancies all the trust worthy information which can be given about themythological drainatis personae of the basque tales will be gratefully received by specialists who can explain them more or less for themselves but who never before had any number of genuine basque tales to work upon we have already said that the stories or at least the longer ones have nothing new about them so far as their incidents are concerned but their supernatural agents are interesting the ogre or troll is represented by the  basa jaun  or w wild man and the ogress by the  bass andre or  wild wvoman the latter greatly resembling the russiaii baba yaga closely allied with the fairies

language appended to mr websters book says prince ll bonaparte has discovered that in the basque dialect of roncal the moon is called  goicoa jaungoicoa is the word for god in basque and would mean  the lord moon or rather our lord the moon wsdo shall decide when basquisaits disagree of matters which are novel in the basque tales the following may be noted from m1 cerquand we gather that the basques imagine that supernatural beings appear to fasting persons more readily than to others when the basa jaun appears to the fasting man in the story of  le chandelier de saintsauveur i 22 the man mechanically chews the four seeds which he finds in his hair while scratching his head to stimulate his wits whereupon the demon disappears thenceforth the man never left his house without having previously eaten this explains a novel incident in the otherwise familiar story webster p 109 of the en chanted princess who tries in vain to wake her sleeping lover finding she cannot do so she cries  he has eaten something tell him that i will return but tell tell him i beg you to eat nothing in ordinary versions of the tale the hero is sent to sleep by a malicious magician but in the basque story the mere act of eating appears to pro duce upon him an effect not altogether unknown among ourselves another strange idea is that of the basques that no work ought to be done by nightout of doorsfor pay one evening it seems a young girl was tempted by the promise of five sns to go out for a rake which had been left in a barn she brought it back but was carried up in the air by an invisible hand and left dead at a chapel door cerquand i 29 in historical legends the basques do not seem to be rich but poland retains among them his historic character and in the savage men or

tle serpent of isabit  webster p 21 but as regards the latter we may confess to being somewhat sceptical it reads like a literary not a popular production especially as mr webster does not vouch for

children sent from the under ground world by their supernatural parents who wanted their race to be gradually spread across the face of the earth and to gain thereon knowledge and repute worthy of remark also is mr websters statement p 53 that basque lamifak always say exactly the contrary to what they mean suffer in fact from chronic aphasia of real value if the facts are correctly stated is his note to page 70 with regard to a story of a man who tries to imitate a witch but makes a blunder in the spell he uses saying  over the clouds and under the hedges instead of  under the clouds and over the hedges whereby he comes to grief here if the statement be founded on fact and not on a mere guess we get one of the linguistic tests for tracing a story which are so valuable but so rare of the nature of the vair and verre confusion in the cinderellas slipper story the blunder says mr webster is confounding desgus over and deqoous  under this shows that the tale is originally french or at least the witchs part of it for this punning mistake could not be made in basque the two words are not in the least similar in sound gaihetik and axpetik are the words here used the basque folktales says m cerquand are fast dying out they cannot hold their own against the  stories from beyond the seas told in cabarets by  americans that is to say by basques who return from america after

B5379,['3242814'],  myths and legends of the bantu by alice werner 15s harrap the anthropological journalist who wishes to present the result of his researches in the form which used to be known as  suitable for household reading is confronted with very great difficulties one cannot blame him for confining his reports to the scientific journals when the penalty for venturing outside their covers is to be listed in the booksellers catalogues under  curious if he is not a good story teller or if he is a stickler for exactitude he had better confine himself to the journal but if he is skilful enough to tell a story well within the prescribed limits then he must be encouraged to come out and tell it to us because a good story is always worth while the tragedy is that robbed of so much it will remain nothing more than a story where formerly it had held an importance amounting to an article of religion and its recital even an exposition of faith however the collector of these stories is a woman and she can tell them exceedingly well and her book strictly speaking does not pretend to be an anthropological study in answer to the question  who are the bantu  it may be instructive to quote dr werners reply that bantu is now the generally accepted name for those natives of south africa the great majority who are neither hottentots nor bushmenthat is to say mainly the zabus xosas thafins basuto and bechuanato whom may be added the thongas shangaans of the delagoa bay region and the people of southern rhodesia commonly though incorrectly called mashaud it will be seen that this list covers a great variety of racial types the tall stronglymade zulu differing vastly from the short and sturdy pokomo canoeman and the overtall and toothin men of the hereros from the small active and wiry anyanja of nyasaland so it is misleading to speak of a bantu race the remarkable and binding feature about these peoples is that their language possesses almost identically the same grammar differing no more than french does from spanish or english from danish where it originally came from and how it spread no one knows although conjecture has it that it came from somewhere in the region of the great lakes and spread towards the south and east about two or three thousand years ago the mass of the stories are what one may term ghost stories that is they concern themselves mwith the spirits of the dead this is not unnatural when the main feature of the religion consists of a cult of the dead and the belief in a high god if not entirely forgotten has become very vague the dead may return in the form of animals so animal stories are in a preponderance too among these we find the original characters of the  uncle remus  stories only it was not until the negroes reached the american slave plantations that brer rabbit took the place of the hare of an africa that knows no rabbit south of the sahara perhaps the strangest case of diffusion although dr werner generally disagrees with the diffusionist theory of fairystories is the case of sops fables the thirtyfirst chapter of the koran is called the chapter of lokmaan a great fabulist among the arabs and a man reputed to have known david he was a black manan ethiopian and it is supposed that he is no other than the 2esop of the greeks today he circulates again in the country of his origin translated back again into the vernacular along with the recent introductions of grimms fairy tales,folklore
B248,"['4973077', '8467653']",  wzctzon idanish fairy legends and tales by hans christian andersen london 1846 pickering sonie time since these tales were noticed amid the foreign literature of the critic that notice attracted to them considerable attention and translations were immediately commenced in various quarters the first that has made its appearance is now before us exquisitely printed at the aldine press and tastefully bound so as to form a birthday gift or school prize as attractive in external appearance as it will prove in its contents which are precisely such as youth most loves to read appealing at once to the imagination aud the heart conveying the morality of poetry and the poetry of morality an dersen has succeeded beyond all modern writers in catching the spirit as wvell as the manner of the legendary lore of his country it may be that he has only remodelled fables already current among the peasantry of denmark but even if he be not the inventor he is entitled to much applause for the skill with which he has put them into presentable shape without divesting them of the simplicity of language and the air of childlike faith in their literal truth which are essential to the storyteller and in which in fact lies the differ i encebetween the real and the false legend making the latter however cleverly constructed dull and uninteresting when compared with the former andersen writes as if he thoroughly believed that there was a time when beasts and birds talked like christian men  when i fairies danced anl mermaids sung in this lies the  charm of his legends and tales anrd for this and be 1 cause they invariably carry a wholesome moral without thrusting it offinsively forward teaching it rather by the example than by precept do we heartily recommend this volume to young persons and to the regards of all who are looking for an acceptable present for their young friends the translator who wve understand is a lady has performed her task with a hearty appreciation of the characteristics of the author which she has carefully preserved by rendering the simple language of the original into a pure and simple english so well fitted to convey legends and tales such as these and always so charming because so intelligible to children as specimens both of author and translator anl as in themselves worthy of perusal we extract some of these legends what poetry there is in the daisy listen to my story  in the country close by the road 4 side there stands a summerhouseyou must certainly have i seen it in front is a little garden full of flowers enclosed by i white palings with green knobs and on a bank outside the i palings there grew amidst the freshest of grass a little daisy i the sun shone as brightly and warmly upon the daisy as upon i the splendid large flowers within the garden and therefore it grew hourly so that one morning it stood fully open with its delicate white gleaming leaves which like rays surrounded the t little yellow sun in their centre it never occurred to the 1 little flower that no one saw her hidden as she was among i the grass she was quite contented  she turned towards the i warm sun looked at it and listened to the lark who wasf singing in the air the daisy was as happy as if it were they day of some high festival and yet it was only monday the c children were at school  and whilst they sat upon their forms hi and learned their lessons the little flower upon her green stalk n learned from the warm sun and every thing around her how 1 good god is meanwhile the little lark expressed clearly and 0 beautifully all she felt in silence and the flower looked up a with a sort of reverence to the happy bird who could fly and d sing it did not distress her that she could not do the same a  i can see and listen thought she  the sun shines on mne h and the wind kisses me oh how richly am i blessed 94 there stood within the palings several grand stifflooking t flowers the less fragrance they had the more airs they gave fl themselves the peonies puffed themselves out in order to ai make themselves larger than the roses the tulips had the b gayest colours of all they were perfectly aware of it and held ti themselves as straight as a candle that they might be the better 01 seen they took no notice at all of the little flower outside c the palings but she looked all the more upon them thinking y4 how rich and beautiful they are yes that noble bird will st surely fly down and visit them how happy am 1 who live al so near them and see their beauty  just at that moment vi ji quirrevit the lark did fly down but he came not to the peonies nor the tulips no he flew down to the poor little ac daisay in the grass who was almost frightened from pure joy in and knew not what to think she was so surprised the little to bird hopped about and sang  oh how soft is this grasm rtand what a sweet little flower blooms here with its golden of heart and silver garment  for the yellow centre of the daisy rn looked just like gold and the little petals around gleamed silver n white ihow happy the little daisy was  no one can imagine of how happy the bird kissed her with his beak sang to her le and then flew up again into the blue sky it was a full quarhe ter of an hour ere the flower recovered herself half ashamed n and yet completely happy she looked at the flowers in the th garden they must certainly be aware of the honour and haput piness that had been conferred upon herthey must know tir j how delighted she was but the tulips held themselves twice al as stiff as before and their faces grew quite red with anger as i to the peonies they were so thickheadedit was indeed well he that they could not speak or the little daisy would have heard something not very pleasant the poor little flower could see  well that they were in an illhumour and she was much vexed at it soon after a girl came into the garden with a knife i sharp and bright she went up to the tulips and cut off one after another  oh  that is horrible sighed the daisy  it  is now all over with them the girl then went away with the i tulips how glad was the daisy that she grew in the grass lit outside the palings and was a despised little flower  she felt e really thankful and when the sun set she folded her leaves is went to sleep and dreamed all night of the sun and the beaul tiful bird the next morning when our little flower fresh ir and cheerful again spread out all her white leaves in the sunshine and clear blue air she heard the voice of the bird but he is sung so mournfully alas  the poor lark had good reason for e sorrow he had been caught and put into a cage close by the ly open window lie sang of the joys of a free and unrestrained i flightlie sang of the young green corn in the tields and of the pleasure of being born up by his wings in the open air the poor bird was certainly very unhappyhe sat a prisoner in his narrow cage  the little daisy would so of illingiv have  helped him but how could she  ah that she knew not she squite forgot how beautiful all around her was how warmly the sun shone how pretty and white her leaves were alas  she could only think of the imprisoned bird for whom it was not in her power to do anything all at once two little boys 1 came out of the garden one of them had a knife in his hand e as large and as sharp as that with which the girl had cut the y tulips they went straight up to the little daisy who could e not imagine what they wanted  here we can cut a nice r piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys and he began n to cut deep all round the daisy leaving her in the centre it i tear out the flower said the other boy and the little s 1 daisy trembled all over for fear for she knew that if she were e torn out she would die and she wished so much to live as she e was to be put into the cage with the imprisoned lark  no g leave it alone  said the first  it looks so pretty  and so e it was left alone and was put into the larks cage but the s poor bird loudly lamented the loss of its freedom and beat e its wings against the iron bars of its cage and the little flower e could not speak could not say a single word of comfort to ihim much as she wished to do so thus passed the whole imorning  there is no water here said the imprisoned vlark they have all gone out and forgotten me not a drop 1 of water to drink  my throat is dry and burning there is fire and ice within me and the air is so heavy  alas  i must i die i must leave the warm sunshine the fresh green trees and all the beautiful things which god has created  and then he pierced his beak into the cool grass in order to refresh him self a little and his eye fell upon the daisy and the bird bowed to her and said  thou too wilt wither here thou poor little flower  they have given me thee and the piece of green iaround thee instead of the whole world which i possessed before  every little blade of grass is to be to me a green i treethy every white petal a fragrant flower alas  thou only remindest me of what i have lost  oh that i could comfort him  thought the daisy but she could not move yet the fragrance which came from her delicate blossom was stronger than is usual with this flower the bird noticed it and although panting with thirst he tore the green blades in very anguish he did not touch the flower it was evening and yet no one came to bring the poor bird a drop of water he stretched out his slender wings and shook them convulsivelyhis song was a mournful  pipi his little head bent towards the flower and the birds heart broke from thirst and desire the flower could not now as on the preceding evening fold together her leaves and sleep she bent down sad and sick to the ground the boys did not come till the next morning and when they saw the bird was dead they wept bitterly they dug a pretty grave which they adorned with flower petals the birds corpse was put into a pretty red box royally was the poor bird buried whilst he yet lived and song they forgot himleft him suffering in his cage and now he was highly honoured and bitterly bewailed but the piece of turf with the daisy in it was thrown out into the street no one thought of her who had felt pnost for the little bird and who had so much wished to comfort him what a moral in the buckwheat if after a tempest you chance to walk through a field where buckwheat is growing you may observe that it is burnt as black as though a flame of fire had passed over it and should i you ask the reason the peasant will tell you that the lightning has done it but how is it that the lightning has i done it  i will tell you what the sparrow told me and the sparrow heard the story from an old willowtree which grew and still grows close to a field of buckwheat this willowtree is tall and highly respectable but at the same time old and wrinkled its trunk had been riven asunder from top to bottom grass and brambles grow out of the gap the tree bends forward and the branches hang down almost to the ground looking like long green hair there were different kinds of corn growing in the fields around the willowrye wheat and oatsthe beautiful oats whose ears when they are ripe look like a number of little yellow canarybirds sitting upon one branch the cornears were richly blessed and the fuller they were the lower they bowed their heads in pious humility but there was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willowtree the buckwheat bowed not like the rest of the cornhe stood stiff and proud  i am quite as rich as the wheat said he i and besides i am so i much more handsome my flowers are as beautiful as the i blossoms of the appletree it is delightful to look at me and l my companions do you know anything more beautiful than l we are you old willowtree  and the willowtree bent his l head as much as to say  yes indeed i do  but the f buckwheat was puffed up with pride and said  the stupid  tree he is so old that grass is growing out of his body  c now ctnne a dreadful storm all the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads whilst it passed over them 1 the buckwheat lowever in his pride still stood erect t  bow thv head as we do  said the flowers  i have no c need said the buckwheat  bow thy head as we do said  i the corn  the angel of storms comes flying hitherward hei h has win s which reach from the clouds to the earth he will it strike thee down before thou hast time to entreat for mercy n  no i will not bow said the buckwheat close thy i p flowers and fold thy leaves said the old willowtree look a not into the flash when the cloud breaks even men dare not n do that for in the flash one looks into gods heaven and that t sight can dazzle even human eves  what then would it prove tl to mere vegetables like us if we should dare to do so we al who are so inferior to men  so inferior indeed  said the ir buckwheat now then i vid look right into gods nr heaven and in his pride and haughtiness he did gaze upon c the lightning without shrinking such was the flash that it southeast seemed as if the whole world was in flames when the tem southeast pest was over flowers and corn greatly refreshed by the rain re once more breathed pure air but the buckwheat had been ta burnit as black as a coal by the lightning it stood on the field e a dead useless plant and the old willowtree waved its branrelse to and fro in the wind  and large drops of water th fell from the green leaves as though the tree wept and the of svarrows asksd  winv weepest thou  it is so beautiful here  to see howvthe sun shines  how the clo uds pass ever the clear i sky  hvw sweet is the fragrance of the flowers 1whv then a eellest thou old willowtree  ard the willow tree told of 11 ti iuek wleat s prise anl hao zhl iil e and of the crux lisol law a ei1 full hal i  re  a is lorv liar ir orthe sparrowsthey told it to me one evening when i asked ul them for a tale endt what sly satire in n the emperors new clothes iad many years ago there was an emperor who was so exces mst sively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress pt he did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor ith did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase except for iv the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new ud clothes he had a different suit for each hour of the day and nd as of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he  he is sitting in council it was always said of him  the he emperor is sitting in his wardrobe time passed away tie merrily in the large town which was his capital strangers arrived every day at the court one day two rogues calling themselves weavers made their appearance they gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colours and elaborate patterns the clothes manufactured from re which should have the wonderful property of remaining in as visible to every one who was unfit for the office he held or id who was extraordinarily simple in character  these must he indeed be splendid clothes  thought the emperor  had i as i such a suit i might at once find out what men in my realms he are unfit for their office and also be able to distinguish the v wise from the foolish  this stuff must be woven for me im r mediately and he caused large sums to be given to both id the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly to so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected be to work very busily though in reality they did nothing at all ie they asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold it thread put both into their own knapsacks and then con e tinned their pretended work at the empty looms until late at e night  i should like to know how the weavers are getting g on with my cloth said the emperor to himself after some ie little time had elapsed he was however rather embarrassed is when he remembered that a simpleton or one unfit for his goffice would be unable to see the manufacture  to be sure ht lie thought i he had nothing to risk in his own person but n yet he would prefer sending somebody else to bring him in 0 telligence about the weavers and their work before he e troubled himself in the affair all the people throughout d the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to n possess and all were anxious to learn how wise or how ignos rant their neighbours might prove to be  i will send my e faithful old minister to the weavers said the emperor at last i after some deliberation  he will be best able to see how the cloth looks for he is a man of sense and no one can be more i suitable for his office than he is so the faithful old minister went into the hall where the knaves were working with all their might at their empty looms v what can be the meaning of this  thought the old man opening his eyes very wide d i cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms however he did not express his thoughts aloud the impos1 tors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms and then asked him whether the design pleased him and whether the colours were not very beautiful at the same time pointing to the empty frames the poor old minister looked and looked he could not discover any thing on the looms for a very good reason viz there was nothing there  what  thought he again is it possible that i am a simpleton  i have never thought so myself and no one must know it now if i am so can it be that i am unfit for my office no that must not be said either i will never confess that i could not see thestuff 1 well sirminister said one of the knaves still pretending to work  you do not say whether the stuff plleases you  oh it is excellent  replied the old minister loking at the loom through his spec tacles  this pattern and the coloursyes i will tell the emperor without delay how very beautiful i think them w e shall be much obliged to you said the impostors and then they named the different colours and described the pattern of the pretended stuff the old minister listened attentively to their words in order that he might repeat them to the eimtperor and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold saving that was neeesary to complete what they had begun llowcvcr they put all that was given them into their knapi s9c1 mnld c tinued to work vwith as much aippmrent diligence kfjrc t iir cq1ty looms the enpietor now rent au other officer of his court to see how the men were getting on i and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready it t was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister he i surveyed the looms on all sides but could see nothing at all  but the empty frames does not the stuff appear as beautiful l to you as it did to my lord the minister  asked the imposx tors of the emperors second ambassador at the same time  making the same gestures as before and talking of the design i and colours which were not there  i certainly am not stupid i thought the messenger  it must be that i am not fit for i my good profitable office that is very odd however no l one shall know any thing about it and accordingly he i praised the stuff he could not see and declared that lie was i delighted with both colours and patterns  indeed please your imperial majesty said he to his sovereign when he returned  the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent the whole city was talking of the 4 splendid cloth which the emperor had ordered to he woven at his own expense and now the emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture whilst it was still on the loom accompanied by a select number of officers of the court among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth he went to the crafty impostors who as soon as they were aware of the emperors approach went on working more diligently than ever although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms is not the work absolutely magnificent   said the two officers of the crown already mentioned if your majesty will only be pleased to look at it what al splendid design what glorious colours and at the samz l time they pointed to the empty frames for they imagined that i every one else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship  how is this  said the emperor to himself  i can see nothing  this is indeed a terrible affair  am i a simpleton or am i unfit to be an emperor  that would be the worst thing that could happenoh the cloth is charming said he aloud  it has my complete approbation and he smiled most graciously and looked closely at the empty looms for on no account would lie say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much all his retinue now strained their eyes hoping to discover something on the looms but they could see no more than the others nevertheless they all exclaimed  oli how beautiful  and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material for the approaching procession magnificent charming  excellent  resounded on all sides and every one was uncommonly gay the euperor shared in the general satisfaction and presented the impostors with the ribbon of an order of knighthood to be worn in their buttonholes and the title of  gentlemen weavers the rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place and had sixteen lights burning so that every one might see how anxious they were to finish the emperors new suit they pretended to roll the cloth off the looms cut the air with their scissors  and sewed with needles without any thread in them 1 see  cried they at last  the emperors new clothes are ready  and now the emperor with all the grandees of his court came to the weavers  andl the rogues raised their arms as if in the act of holding something up sayings  here are your majestys trowsers here is the scarf here is the mantle  the whole suit is as light as a cobweb one might fancy one has nothing at all on when dressed in it that however is the great virtue of this delicate cloth  yes indeed  said all the courtiers although not one of them could see any thing of this exquisite manufacture  if your imperial majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes we will fit on the new suit in front of the lookingglass the emperor was accordingly undressed and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit the emperor turning round from side to side before the lookingglass h how splendid his majesty looks in his new clothes and how well they fit  every one cried out  what a design what colours  these are indeed royal robes   the canopy which is to be born over your majesty in the procession is waiting announced the chief master of the ceremonies  i am quite ready answered the emperor 1 do my new clothes fit well  asked he turning himself round again before the lookingglass in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit the lords of the bedchamber who were to carry his majestys train felt about ou the ground as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle and pretended to be carrying something for they would by no means betray anything like simplicity or unfitness for their office so now the emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession through the streets of his capital and all the people standing by and those at the windows cried out  oh how beautiful are our emperors new clothes  what a magnificent train there is to the mantle and how gracefully the scarf hangs  in short no one would allow that he could not see these muchadmired clothes because in doing so he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office certainly none of the emperors various suits had ever made so great an impression as these invisible ones but the emperor has nothing at all on  said a little child  listen to the voice of innocence  exclaimed his father and what the child had said was whispered from one to another  but he has nothing at all on  at last cried out all the people the emperor was vexed for he knew that the people were right but he thought the processionx must go on now and the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever to appear holding up a train although in reality there was no train to hold  the literary examiner danish fairy legends and tales by hans chris tian andersen pickering this is a charming little book of fairy tales and excellently well translated but why the tales should he called danish we do not perceive  except inasmuch as a dane is the author there is an occasional northern colouring but only so far as it could not be helped all the rest is so free from everything national or exclusive that we do not remember to have met with any production so given up to a sense of the variety of being that exists in the universe at times it is even painfully so we have so strong a sense given us of the feelings of ducks and ducklings  of swans and storks  of mermen and mermaidens  of nightingales flowers and daisies  even of slugs and cuttlefish  aud of what all sorts of animated creatures round about us think do and might say if they could speak that ones consciousness as a human being almost becomes lost in the crowd we begin to feel as mrs gulliver did when her husband returned from houynhnm land  and think we might as well take to being of a different species we need not say that it implies a rare and surprising art to convey such impressions as these when johnson laughed at goldsmith for thinking of writing a story in which u little fish should be the actors the author of animateil xetture very properly told him that it was not so easy a matter as he thought it  and that if he johnson were to write such a story he would make his little fish talk like  great whales there is no such confusion of ideas in mr hans christian andersen his whales and his little fish all talk in character we are not sure that we ourselves after reading his book could not have talked at pleasure like sharks minnows mermaids bulls ducks or green teas for his vegetables have as much conversational character as his ducks and geese nay his very pegtops and balls are full of individuality there is a pathetic daisy in his story of that name who is quite a  sweet creature for the pastoral beauty of her tongue

stork would know  the touches of tnis kind are innumerable the fault of the book if we must find one is that all the stories have too much meaning  that they overflow with intention and moral not always obviously sometimes obscurely but still with incessant intelligence you desire occasionally something more childish and less clever and some of the stories nre too long but the genius and refinement are undeniable we must give an extract and are somewhat at a loss so many of the teles nave such strone chums but with all the fairy fancy of the volume in general perhaps the beet story

office and fatso be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish i this stuff must be woven for me immediately and he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly  so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected to work very busily though iu reality they did nothing ait all they asked for the most delicate ails and the purest gold thread  put both into their own knapsacks  and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until lau aat aaight   i should like to know how the weavers are getting on with nay

B3260,"['8683145', '2741323', '2737319']",  wonderful stories from northern lands by julia goddard with an introduction by the rev george w cox ma longmans  co this is not a xeya 3ixov and so far not a fjeya kolkov it is a volume consisting of xxivf208 pages large clear print and containing thirteen stories nine of which are eddaic the rest with the exception of the romance of frithiof and ingibjorg purely legendary miss goddard informs us that no use has yet been made of the materials of the eddas and sagas of northern europe for the amusement and the instruction of the young a statement which if it is meant to have the sense the words convey does not speak very highly of miss goddards knowledge of the history of english literature  in the belief therefore that these materials may be presented in a form as delightful as that of the old stories with which all are familiar we do not know what old stories she alludes tomiss goddard  has clothed a few of the edda and other narratives in language which she trusts  the youngest child may understand with ease and from which even they who have left childhood behind them may derive some enjoyment this the  author  considers to be the object of her work and a sufficiently insignificant object it ia to be sure if eddaic lore is meant to pass through a process of worddilution in order that the verbiage thereof may be suited to the intellect and the capacities of the nursery we really think the old book had better be left alone the beauties of its contents do not consist in words nor will any clothing of them into language which the youngest child may understand make any difference as to their actual import but before we argue this point further it is neces sary to take mr coxs introduction into consideration to mr cox most things are solarmyths and every tale which happens to have some one point in common with another tale is forthwith declared to be identical with it we do not understand how in the misty region of legend and fancy all things can be fused together into a sort of living organism on the score of common external similarities unless these resemblances are ascertained to be something more at all events than purely accidental the everlasting recurrence of kindred ideas in a similar dress does not in our opinion constitute any inner kinship beyond this that the impressions of similar external circumstances will act upon the intellectual faculties of man in such a way as to bring about similar evolutions and expressions a sunset inspired the heart of a greek and that of a hyperborean most probably with similar sentiments both might possibly give vent to them in similar language the symbols and similes made use of by either might be of striking resemblance but what is the nature of the relationship between both 1 what right have we on the strength of their external appearance to declare them to be one and the same tale none they are two different expressions of a universal human feeling the true similarity between this tale and that is only found in the radical and originative elements of both not in the often accidentally similar accessories of their outward form when outward points of resemblance are taken as infallible criteria of the identity not only of myths but also of mythic heroes and gods we do not wonder to find baldr the fair identified with 7r6cas ukvs axtaacis by mr cox on the ground that both are  vulnerable only in one part a theory which becomes sufficiently preposterous when we take into consideration that the common point of resemblance alleged has no existence at all in the case of baldr this one instance may serve as a specimen of mr coxs introduction which in reality is nothing but an index of tales which he considers similar to or identical with those contained in the present volume that baldr means the sun and that the myths about him are pure solarmyths seems to be a settled matter among students of myths but we believe that mr cox stands alone in the identification of the northern god with achilles and with all possible deference for mr coxs opinion on the subject we venture to doubt that the two have anything in common at all perfectly possible and probable as it is that the myth of baldr is a solarmyth we cannot withhold here the observation that it may also with full justice be considered as a myth of life as well all myths are poems the deeper the poem the wider its relation is the more profound its philosophy the more clear its application for genius is allsided it is not to be supposed that the ideal and creative faculty of humanity in ancient ages was unfit for any poetical productions but solarmyths pure and simple or that man was merely endowed with a faculty of gazing at the sun and personifying him in all manner of conceivable and inconceivable adventures and yet was unable to penetrate into the mysteries of the human heart the myth of baldr seems to us to be quite as much a poem of blighted hopes as of the sun being slain by the darkness of winter the mistletoe a parasitic sapling the most trifling of causes becomes in the hand of a blind and unmeaning agency an element of destruction whereby the most cherished aspirations in lifethe very delight of gods and men is buried in the dark night of sorrow and the light of hope love and affection is engulfed in despair even at a moment when every one had given himself up to the fullest enjoyment of it in the fond belief that their watchful care has been rewarded by the full security and safety of the object of their admiration and love on the other hand it is a lesson the victory won by the gods has rendered them listless in continuing their watch and regardless of a trifle which at a glance seems by its very insignificance to preclude the possibility of any hurtful element being inherent in its nature this disregard of the possibility of danger arising from even the slightest causesthis want of an allsided heed and unsparing selfresearch bears in itself the germ of its own revenge let innocence and virtue rear ever so strong a defence against temptation and passionlet it be proof against any open forces of the dangers which beset its path there always must remain unguarded some byway or other offering an access no matter how narrow  for absolute perfection is unattainable this weak point the tempter is sure to find out he awaits the moment when he can turn it to his best advantage and the sunbright innocence is stung to the heart and faints away into the arms of death and darkness and a cry of lamentation goes through the whole of nature and the universe is changed into a fountain of tears this interpretation without at all precluding the solar theory will force itself upon any one who has carefully examined the mode in which antiquity regarded life and nature in their everlasting reciprocity of impression and reacting emotion the more we try to master the ancient philosophy and poetry of the north the more we shall become convinced that their range is far wider than a deified personification of the changing seasons of the year they who give themselves up te the confident belief that all ancient myths are solarmythr pure and simple will find themselves in the end we fear much in the case of baldr and be wounded by the mistletoe of onesidedness hurled from the nevermissing hand of the blind hbftr what we have said already may we think suffice to convince our readers that the eddaic lore is essentially unsuited for the nursery so long as nothing more is done towards revealing its spirit and meaning than clothing several of its tales in nursery speech we therefore strongly object to the venerable book being taken in vain as our author has done merely that children may have a thoughtless glance at this tale or that and then throw the book away not a whit wiser than they were on receiving it to render the tales of edda into a fancy language without one hint at the deeper meaning of the subjects treated is fruitless labour are not the stories of edda parables or allegories are children not expected to comprehend the lessons of the parables of the gospel 1 are the former so much more difficult to explain than the latter as to render the task unfeasible  by no means the obvious points in a parable no matter what its nature is suggest themselves to any intellect almost and if children cannot understand eddaic lore when its deeper sense and import is explained to them is it to be supposed that they can find any desirable enjoyment or instruction in that very lore when left totally unexplained 1 but people will answer what good would that do to children  and our only reply is the counterquestion what good is the tale itself to children unless their thought is awakened by teaching them what they cannot understand by themselves we have seen in mr freemans old english history for children that the nursery is really not too humble a hovel for science to visit we do not see why mythology should lag behind the first step to making eddaic tales acceptable to children would be to translate the names of them the local no less than the personal ones this our author has not even tried to do  but what she has attempted is to form such monstrosities as asi nominative plural of ass instead of jesir the northern gods hela for hell gyall for gjoll or gjallar bru the yell or yellbridge c why our author should presume to improve upon edda in the narrative of thors journey to utgartsaloki and let the old hag with whom the god of thunder has to fight be death instead of elli or eld old age one of the most poetical points in the whole of that late concoction of illusions we confess we are unable to understand if it were not for the venerable source whence the stories in the present volume are drawn and the manner in which they are done which it is quite desirable should not be imitated in future we should not have found this item of the english literature of 1871 worthy of notice  iflontvefu stories from arorhern zands  by juiia goddard longmans 2nd edition 1871 whatever miss julia goddard takes in hand whether it be a tale or a poem for a magazine or an essay on a more solid and serious subject she is apt to execute with so much of good sense and taste and in such a simple easy style that we are apparently saying very little in her praise when we assert that among all the writers of the day there is no one who stands before her as a masteror mistressof the art of writing for children accordingly we were quite prepared on seeing wonderfful stories on the table before us to find in its pages the old norse tales which for ages have delighted so idndy boys and girls in homes in other northern nations retold in such a way as ought to make them near and dear friends in english nurseries and schoolrooms we are quite awareas miss goddard in fact reminds usthat these stories are lot new for the  household stories of grimm and dr daserits popular tales from the norse have long since introduced a very large proportion of the ancient german legends to their cars but then it is equally true that little or no use as yet has been madie in england of the materials of the eddas and sagas of northern europe  these however miss goddard now unseals to the gaze of our young people and in a style so simple so charming and so captivating that we feel sure they will never wish to have them edited by another hand it is almost needless to specify which of the contents of this volume are original and which are not but we may of course assume that our readers are none of them unacquainted with balder or thor and his hammer or iduna sips golden hair or volund they will however recognise new acquaintances in  king olaf  frithiof  christins trouble  thorwalds bridal to the volume is prefixed an admirable introduction by the rev g iv cox showing what relation these prose balladsfor such they arebear to the legends of the early greeks romans and of the natives of the indian leninsttla  or to express ourselves in his words we have thus in our hands thz clue whichn may guide uts through the mazes of folklore stories to fountains of delight which can never be drained dry it may be impossible perhaps to bring back the precise feeling which these stories may severally have inspired in those who knew but few of them but even young readers at the present day will probably have devoured not only the household stories of grimm and the norse tales of dasent but the whest highland legends of campbei the deccan tales of aliss frere the icelandic legends of powell and magniisson and many more that all these stories exhibit the same elements he must soon discover it is well that lhe should learn to draw pleasure from sources which will never fail hiim and withal grow wiser as he recognises old friends under new forms in the legends of greeks and hindus of norwegians germans spaniards and englishnen of miss godlards charming style the following passage from  king olaf may bc taken as a specimenout came running the little elves for the sudden rising of the floods had disturbed him  vho art thou bo0l mariner who sailest over our homes  behold the mountains shake with fury fell us what is thy name  quiet ye quiet ye little people answered king olaf i am saint olaf turn ye into stones until i come this way again so the little elves turned into stones and rolled down the mountain sides and the good ship went on her way she had not gone far before out came an old carline and said saint olaf i know you with your beard shining like red gold wherefore do you bring with you the waters to mock us in our dwellings your ship has burst through the wall of my chamber evil luck be with you  then saint olaf for lhe was a saint as wvell as a king fixed his glance witheringly upon the old carline  be thou turned into a flint rock said he  and so remain for ever and ever and the carline was turned into a rock and saint olaf and his crew sailed on and on so fleetly flew the good ship ox that anyone must have had good eyes to see her as she flashed past for so she sped on that if saint olaf drew his bowv and shot an arrow forward it fell far behind in the wake of the vessel this was fast sailing indeed and with such speed it is not wonderful that thoulglh harald haardradc had had the start of his brother yet saint olaf reached home three days before him  harald haardrade was wild with rage when he came those three days later and found saint olaf king of norroway and lie raged and raged until at length be became a dragon and this is the last that we hear of harald haardrade  now as saint olaf had prayed for the blessing of heaven before hie set out on his voyage it was natural that his first act upon landing should be to go to the nearest church to return thanks for having so mightily prospered  and as he walked up the crowded nave a golden glory beamed from his fair hair and the people of norroway learned a great lesson from the faith of king olaf the saint it only remains to add that the book is adorned with six exquisite illustrations by mr iv j weigand  wonderful stories from northern lands by julia goddard author of  the boy and the constellations  karl and the six little dwarfs c with an introduction by the rev g w cox ma and six illustrations london longmans green and co i871 nothing can be too refined or beautiful for the early and familiar use of the young the standard given them in literature as in morals cannot be too high elevation need not be obscure any imore than purity need be dull the taste for creative art latent in every child who scribbles on his slate or builds his toy model cannot be too early cultivated or too soon directed to graceful and lofty forms but the growth must be gradual or it will not be permanent and the appreciation will be imitative rather than intelligent the eddas and sagas of the north with their weird yet stately mournfulness recording the anxious yearnings of humanity for reunion with its beloved after the dividing sleep of death and for an embodied divinity whose fiat would shift some of the burden of responsibility from mortal hearts too weak to bear it are sources unfit to be drawn upon for nursery amusement true the clayfooted idols wor shipped by the rude northern races were like unto themselves stern rugged often vindictive but the legends of their lives though alwayss wild sometimes grotesque are none the less sorrowful allegones of life and nature which cannot and ought not to be understood by the very young the paring and condensing and simplifying necessary to suit them to childish comprehensions narrows their purpose and obscures their meaning miss goddard has done her best with the selection before us but she was mistaken in endeavouring to adapt it to the use of the youngest child had she bestowed equal taste and care on a version for older readers her task would have been a more repaying one mr cox in his introductory essay tries to reconcile us to this utilisation of the eddas and sagas by a clever and comprehensive comparison of the legends of all countries bringing into strong relief their points of assimilation and tracing a family likeness which at the first glance seems ludicrous between the greek psyche and our homely  beauty and the beast he cites in support of his theory of unity max mullers exhaustive study of  comparative mythology yet even allowing for the sake of argument that his point is proved it does not follow that every branch of this wide family of fable affords equally appropriate material for childrens stories the disguise in wvhich thor recovers his magic hammer and slays his enemies the neglected trifle which causes the death of balder the hopeless conflict with thought and death old age in the original to which utgarda loki tempts his unwary guests have neither symmetry nor purpose when they cease to be treated as symbols the mere narrative outlines of the sagas denuded of their soul of poetry and grief are bald and colourless the result is the more to be deprecated as we are made to feel it to be so far beneath mliss goddards powers we give an instance of how picturesquely she can wrte hlien spared the diluting process to which we object desolate is the cold dark north wvith its icewalls

bleached bones show to them the fate of those wvho have gone before the elivfigi issuing from dreary nitlheim have thrown up their wvaters in rising spray which has frozen into fantistic sh apes and

of beauty and to die for the sungod fights for the fairer lands and the iceclad army with their hail slings and their frosted spears fades away as his great flaming sword leaps from its scabbard so they perish but they have seen before they die the soul entrancing beauty which they dreamed in their dreams the six illustrations are very quaint and satisfactorily realise the strange scenes and

B6449,['8961549'],  hero tales and leaends of the serbian by woislav m petrovitch harrap  co 10 6d net during the late balkan wars servia surprised her friends and foes alike by her military exploits today she is surprising them still further and the gallant fight she is making against austriahungary has won for her many new friends and admirers in this country the publication of mr petrovitchs book comes therefore at an opportune moment it is pleasant to be able to add that it is well worth attention for its own sake the first part is given up to tales of the national heroes who flourished before the coming of the turk or at least before he had planted his foot firmly on the country  kralyevitch marko or prince marko of prilip tsar doushan tsar lazar banovitch strahinya and others these tales have been selected from the third edition of vouk stephanovitch karadgitchs great collection of the national ballads and translated by the author and though he more than once laments his inability to set them before us in metrical form they are even in their present dress decidedly attractive indeed comparing mr petrovitchs translations with the metrical versions of sir john bowlingof which three specimens are includedwe must confess to a preference for the former a score of representative folktales follow the tales of the heroes and finally we have some servian popular anecdotes which show here and there a pretty wit the folktales are for the greater part strongly reminiscent of those of a similar class in other countries but they are by no means lacking in interest moreover we find in them striking traces of contact with the turk and through him with the arab yet it must not be thought that they have no originality or character of their own there is about them a sturdy morality which characterises the hero tales also that is certainly not oriental and here and there they strike a note of tragedy that is rare in our own tales of a similar class amongst the heroes kralyevitch marko naturally takes first place he is something more than the national hero servians regard him as the personification of the national character if we adopt that view we must certainly esteem the national character for marko with all his faults was a gallant knight indeed it is interesting to learn that helike several other national heroes and saints is not dead but sleeping with his great sword plunged to the hilt in the rock beside him ready to serve his country when necessary4fc to reestablish the mediaeval empire lost at the battle of kossovo a footnote tells us how he actually did appear during the late war and led the servian troops to victory against the turks the information necessary to a proper enjoyment of the tales is given in the introduction and the first three chapters these contain a brief history of the servians since they emigrated from galicia and many particulars of national customs and superstitions  and readers may well find this the most interesting part of the book especially at the present time here is the authors estimate of his countrymen  44 the average serbian has a rather lively temperament he is highly sensitive and very emotional his enthusiasm is quickly roused but mast emotions with him are as a rule of short duration however he is extremely active and sometimes persistent truly patriotic he is always ready to sacrifice his life and property for national interests which he understands particularly well thanks to his intimate knowledge of the ancient history of his people transmitted to him from generation to generation through the pleasing medium of popular epic poetry composed in von simple decasyllabic verseentirely serbian in its origin ho is extremely courageous and always ready for war although patriarchal and conservative in everything national he is ready and willing to accept new ideas very submissive in his zadrooga and obedient to his superiors he is often despotic when elevated to power the history of all the southern slavs pictures a series of violations depositions political upheavals achieved sometimes by the most cruel means and acts of treachery  all mainly due to the innate and hitherto inexpugnable faults characteristic of the race such as jealousy and an inordinate desire for power such frankness wins our respect when mr petrovitch tells us boldly that 44 the worship of naturehas not even to our day vanished from the popular creed of the balkans we feel safe in trusting ourselves to his guidance the balkans are generally so extremely anxious to prove themselves quite abreast of if not a little ahead of the times that they are apt to become tiresome there is no reason why they should seek to ape the west in all things or why they should be ashamed to confess that all their old beliefs and 44 superstitions  are not dead yet the belief in vampires seems to have originated in this part of europe unfortunately mr petrovitch tells us little about them we should like to know more how for instance does  the black horse without blemish help to discover the grave in which the vampire is  as to our old friend the dragon the servians know that the form in which he was always depicted for us and is actually depicted by one of mr petrovitchs illustrators is 44 merely used as a misleading mask   44 in his true character a dragon is a handsome youth possessing superhuman strength and courage and ho is usually represented as in love with some beautiful princess or empress evidently he is a refined monster it may be noted indeed that these servian stories tales of the peasants though they be commonly showa refinement and delicacy of feeling that are surprising in this respect they resemble the turkish tales but not of course the arab another pleasing feature is the real love of animals which they reveal marko himself shares his glory as he regularly shared his red wine with 44 sharatz his marvellous piebald charger banovitch strahinya owes his life to his faithful greyhound caraman  and instances of birds and beasts befriending human beings are numerous the reese the servian nymphs are not nearly so attractive as our own queen mab and her followers 44 they believed in god and st john and abhorred the turk but 4 they could be very cruel   they had an unpleasant way of foretelling the death of heroes and others  and they were given to destroying buildingsor rather to preventing their completion unless the builders offered up a human sacrifice it would be interesting by the way to learn where the superstition about offering up a human sacrifice to ensure the stability of a building had its origin and at what period of the worlds history it was clearly widespread for tales founded upon it are current in many parts of the near and middle east the authors descriptions of servian customs and ceremonies observed on various festivals and feast days are noteworthy and his comments are apt many of the customs are as picturesque as they are quaint and it is to be hoped that they will not entirely disappear mr petrovitch is perhaps inclined to be unfair to the turk at times as for instance when he talks of the monks  inviolable within the sacred walls of their monasteries being the only scribes and authors left under the 4 blighting domination of the turk   and forgets that the very existence of the monks and their  sacred walls  argues tolerance on the part of the turk the illustrations are for the most part good and the book is well printed though mistakes in spelling are rather numerous we are glad to see a useful map and index,folklore

B15,"['8467653', '4973077']",  the literary examiner danish fairy legends and tales by hans chris tian andersen pickering this is a charming little book of fairy tales and excellently well translated but why the tales should he called danish we do not perceive  except inasmuch as a dane is the author there is an occasional northern colouring but only so far as it could not be helped all the rest is so free from everything national or exclusive that we do not remember to have met with any production so given up to a sense of the variety of being that exists in the universe at times it is even painfully so we have so strong a sense given us of the feelings of ducks and ducklings  of swans and storks  of mermen and mermaidens  of nightingales flowers and daisies  even of slugs and cuttlefish  aud of what all sorts of animated creatures round about us think do and might say if they could speak that ones consciousness as a human being almost becomes lost in the crowd we begin to feel as mrs gulliver did when her husband returned from houynhnm land  and think we might as well take to being of a different species we need not say that it implies a rare and surprising art to convey such impressions as these when johnson laughed at goldsmith for thinking of writing a story in which u little fish should be the actors the author of animateil xetture very properly told him that it was not so easy a matter as he thought it  and that if he johnson were to write such a story he would make his little fish talk like  great whales there is no such confusion of ideas in mr hans christian andersen his whales and his little fish all talk in character we are not sure that we ourselves after reading his book could not have talked at pleasure like sharks minnows mermaids bulls ducks or green teas for his vegetables have as much conversational character as his ducks and geese nay his very pegtops and balls are full of individuality there is a pathetic daisy in his story of that name who is quite a  sweet creature for the pastoral beauty of her tongue  and in another story there is a leatter ball of so aristocratical a character that when proposals are made to her by a pegtop because they happen to have been companions in the same drawer she indignantly asks him whether he is aware that her father and mother were morocco slipjiers and that she has  cork in her body we are here however it may be said confusing the specific and the superinduced character mr andersen keeps all clear he has so just a sense of the necessity of adhering to verisimilitude and of the forgetfulness of it on the part of writers in general that he introduces one of his stories with a remark that ought to become proverbial  in china the emperor is chinese esome of his descriptive touches recall the wonderful observation and exquisitely graphic felicity of mr dickens there is a wretched little hut in the tale of the ugly duclding  so wretched that it knew not on which side to fall and therefore remained standing admirable is the picture of the stork parading about on his long red legs discoursingin egyptian which language he had learned from his mother who does not feel that egyptian ls the very language that by way of accomplishment a stork would know  the touches of tnis kind are innumerable the fault of the book if we must find one is that all the stories have too much meaning  that they overflow with intention and moral not always obviously sometimes obscurely but still with incessant intelligence you desire occasionally something more childish and less clever and some of the stories nre too long but the genius and refinement are undeniable we must give an extract and are somewhat at a loss so many of the teles nave such strone chums but with all the fairy

the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly  so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected to work very busily though iu reality they did nothing ait all they asked for

literature of the critic that notice attracted to them considerable attention and translations were immediately commenced in various quarters the first that has made its appearance is now before us exquisitely printed at the aldine press and tastefully bound so as to form a birthday gift or school prize as attractive in external appearance as it will prove in its contents which are precisely such as youth most loves to read appealing at once to the imagination aud the heart conveying the morality of poetry and the poetry of morality an dersen has succeeded beyond all modern writers in catching the spirit as wvell as the manner of the legendary lore of his country it may be that he has only remodelled fables already current among the peasantry of denmark but even if he be not the inventor he is entitled to much applause for the skill with which he has put them into presentable shape without divesting them of the simplicity of language and the air of childlike faith in their literal truth which are essential to the storyteller and in which in fact lies the differ i encebetween the real and the false legend making the latter however cleverly constructed dull and uninteresting when compared with the former andersen writes as if he thoroughly believed that there was a time when beasts and birds talked like christian men  when i fairies danced anl mermaids sung in this lies the  charm of his legends and tales anrd for this and be 1 cause they invariably carry a wholesome moral without thrusting it offinsively forward teaching it rather by the example than by precept do we heartily recommend this volume to young persons and to the regards of all who are looking for an acceptable present for their young friends the translator who wve understand is a lady has performed her task with a hearty appreciation of the characteristics of the author which she has carefully preserved by rendering the simple language of the original into a pure and simple english so well fitted to convey legends and tales such as these and always so charming because so intelligible to children as specimens both of author and translator anl as in themselves worthy of perusal we extract some of these legends what poetry there is in the daisy listen to my story  in the country close by the road 4 side there stands a summerhouseyou must certainly have i seen it in front is a little garden full of flowers enclosed by i white palings with green knobs and on a bank outside the i palings there grew amidst the freshest of grass a little daisy i the sun shone as brightly and warmly upon the daisy as upon i the splendid large flowers within the garden and therefore it grew hourly so that one morning it stood fully open with its delicate white gleaming leaves which like rays surrounded the t little yellow sun in their centre it never occurred to the 1 little flower that no one saw her hidden as she was among i the grass she was quite contented  she turned towards the i warm sun looked at it and listened to the lark who wasf singing in the air the daisy was as happy as if it were they day of some high festival and yet it was only monday the c children were at school  and whilst they sat upon their forms hi and learned their lessons the little flower upon her green stalk n learned from the warm sun and every thing around her how 1 good god is meanwhile the little lark expressed clearly and 0 beautifully all she felt in silence and the flower looked up a with a sort of reverence to the happy bird who could fly and d sing it did not distress her that she could not do the same a  i can see and listen thought she  the sun shines on mne h and the wind kisses me oh how richly am i blessed 94 there stood within the palings several grand stifflooking t flowers the less fragrance they had the more airs they gave fl themselves the peonies puffed themselves out in order to ai make themselves larger than the roses the tulips had the b gayest colours of all they were perfectly aware of it and held ti themselves as straight as a candle that they might be the better 01 seen they took no notice at all of the little flower outside c the palings but she looked all the more upon them thinking y4 how rich and beautiful they are yes that noble bird will st surely fly down and visit them how happy am 1 who live al so near them and see their beauty  just at that moment vi ji quirrevit the lark did fly down but he came not to the peonies nor the tulips no he flew down to the poor little ac daisay in the grass who was almost frightened from pure joy in and knew not what to think she was so surprised the little to bird hopped about and sang  oh how soft is this grasm rtand what a sweet little flower blooms here with its golden of heart and silver garment  for the yellow centre of the daisy rn looked just like gold and the little petals around gleamed silver n white ihow happy the little daisy was  no one can imagine of how happy the bird kissed her with his beak sang to her le and then flew up again into the blue sky it was a full quarhe ter of an hour ere the flower recovered herself half ashamed n and yet completely happy she looked at the flowers in the th garden they must certainly be aware of the honour and haput piness that had been conferred upon herthey must know tir j how delighted she was but the tulips held themselves twice al as stiff as before and their faces grew quite red with anger as i to the peonies they were so thickheadedit was indeed well he that they could not speak or the little daisy would have heard something not very pleasant the poor little flower could see  well that they were in an illhumour and she was much vexed at it soon after a girl came into the garden with a knife i sharp and bright she went up to the tulips and cut off one after another  oh  that is horrible sighed the daisy  it  is now all over with them the girl then went away with the i tulips how glad was the daisy that she grew in the grass lit outside the palings and was a despised little flower  she felt e really thankful and when the sun set she folded her leaves is went to sleep and dreamed all night of the sun and the beaul tiful bird the next morning when our little flower fresh ir and cheerful again spread out all her white leaves in the sunshine and clear blue air she heard the voice of the bird but he is sung so mournfully alas  the poor lark had good reason for e sorrow he had been caught and put into a cage close by the ly open window lie sang of the joys of a free and unrestrained i flightlie sang of the young green corn in the tields and of the pleasure of being born up by his wings in the open air the poor bird was certainly very unhappyhe sat a prisoner in his narrow cage  the little daisy would so of illingiv have  helped him but how could she  ah that she knew not she squite forgot how beautiful all around her was how warmly the sun shone how pretty and white her leaves were alas  she could only think of the imprisoned bird for whom it was not in her power to do anything all at once two little boys 1 came out of the garden one of them had a knife in his hand e as large and as sharp as that with which the girl had cut the y tulips they went straight up to the little daisy who could e not imagine what they wanted  here we can cut a nice r piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys and he began n to cut deep all round the daisy leaving her in the centre it i tear out the flower said the other boy and the little s 1 daisy trembled all over for fear for she knew that if she were e torn out she would die and she wished so much to live as she e was to be put into the cage with the imprisoned lark  no g leave it alone  said the first  it looks so pretty  and so e it was left alone and was put into the larks cage but the s poor bird loudly lamented the loss of its freedom and beat e its wings against the iron bars of its cage and the little flower e could not speak could not say a single word of comfort to ihim much as she wished to do so thus passed the whole imorning  there is no water here said the imprisoned vlark they have all gone out and forgotten me not a drop 1 of water to drink  my throat is dry and burning there is fire and ice within me and the air is so heavy  alas  i must i die i must leave the warm sunshine the fresh green trees and all the beautiful things which god has created  and then he pierced his beak into the cool grass in order to refresh him self a little and his eye fell upon the daisy and the bird bowed to her and said  thou too wilt wither here thou poor little flower  they have given me thee and the piece of green iaround thee instead of the whole world which i possessed before  every little blade of grass is to be to me a green i treethy every white petal a fragrant flower alas  thou only remindest me of what i have lost  oh that i could comfort him  thought the daisy but she could not move yet the fragrance which came from her delicate blossom was stronger than is usual with this flower the bird noticed it and although panting with thirst he tore the green blades in very anguish he did not touch the flower it was evening and yet no one came to bring the poor bird a drop of water he stretched out his slender wings and shook them convulsivelyhis song was a mournful  pipi his little head bent towards the flower and the birds heart broke from thirst and desire the flower could not now as on the preceding evening fold together her leaves and sleep she bent down sad and sick to the ground the boys did not come till the next morning and when they saw the bird was dead they wept bitterly they dug a pretty grave which they adorned with flower petals the birds corpse was put into a pretty red box royally was the poor bird buried whilst he yet lived and song they forgot himleft him suffering in his cage and now he was highly honoured and bitterly bewailed but the piece of turf with the daisy in it was thrown out into the street no one thought of her who had felt pnost for the little bird and who had so much wished to comfort him what a moral in the buckwheat if after a tempest you chance to walk through a field where buckwheat is growing you may observe that it is burnt as black as though a flame of fire had passed over it and should i you ask the reason the peasant will tell you that the lightning has done it but how is it that the lightning has i done it  i will tell you what the sparrow told me and the sparrow heard the story from an old willowtree which grew and still grows close to a field of buckwheat this willowtree is tall and highly respectable but at the same time old and wrinkled its trunk had been riven asunder from top to bottom grass and brambles grow out of the gap the tree bends forward and the branches hang down almost to the ground looking like long green hair there were different kinds of corn growing in the fields around the willowrye wheat and oatsthe beautiful oats whose ears when they are ripe look like a number of little yellow canarybirds sitting upon one branch the cornears were richly blessed and the fuller they were the lower they bowed their heads in pious humility but there was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willowtree the buckwheat bowed not like the rest of the cornhe stood stiff and proud  i am quite as rich as the wheat said he i and besides i am so i much more handsome my flowers are as beautiful as the i blossoms of the appletree it is delightful to look at me and l my companions do you know anything more beautiful than l we are you old willowtree  and the willowtree bent his l head as much as to say  yes indeed i do  but the f buckwheat was puffed up with pride and said  the stupid  tree he is so old that grass is growing out of his body  c now ctnne a dreadful storm all the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads whilst it passed over them 1 the buckwheat lowever in his pride still stood erect t  bow thv head as we do  said the flowers  i have no c need said the buckwheat  bow thy head as we do said  i the corn  the angel of storms comes flying hitherward hei h has win s which reach from the clouds to the earth he will it strike thee down before thou hast time to entreat for mercy n  no i will not bow said the buckwheat close thy i p flowers and fold thy leaves said the old willowtree look a not into the flash when the cloud breaks even men dare not n do that for in the flash one looks into gods heaven and that t sight can dazzle even human eves  what then would it prove tl to mere vegetables like us if we should dare to do so we al who are so inferior to men  so inferior indeed  said the ir buckwheat now then i vid look right into gods nr heaven and in his pride and haughtiness he did gaze upon c the lightning without shrinking such was the flash that it southeast seemed as if the whole world was in flames when the tem southeast pest was over flowers and corn greatly refreshed by the rain re once more breathed pure air but the buckwheat had been ta burnit as black as a coal by the lightning it stood on the field e a

willow tree told of 11 ti iuek wleat s prise anl hao zhl iil e and of the crux lisol law a ei1 full hal i  re  a is lorv liar ir orthe sparrowsthey told it to me one evening when i asked ul them for a tale endt what sly satire in n the emperors new clothes iad many years ago there was an emperor who was so exces mst sively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress pt he did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor ith did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase except for iv the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new ud clothes he had a different suit for each hour of the day and nd as of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he  he is sitting in council it was always said of him  the he emperor is sitting in his wardrobe time passed away tie merrily in the large town which was his capital strangers arrived every day at the court one day two rogues calling themselves weavers made their appearance they gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colours and elaborate patterns the clothes manufactured from re which should have the wonderful property of remaining in as visible to every one who was unfit for the office he held or id who was extraordinarily simple in character  these must he indeed be splendid clothes  thought the emperor  had i as i such a suit i might at once find out what men in my realms he are unfit for their office and also be able to distinguish the v wise from the foolish  this stuff must be woven for me im r mediately and he caused large sums to be given to both id the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly to so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected be to work very busily though in reality they did nothing at all ie they asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold it thread put both into their own knapsacks and then con e tinned their pretended work at the empty looms until late at e night  i should like to know how the weavers are getting g on with my cloth said the emperor to himself after some ie little time had elapsed he was however rather embarrassed is when he remembered that a simpleton or one unfit for his goffice would be unable to see the manufacture  to be sure ht lie thought i he had nothing to risk in his own person but n yet he would prefer sending somebody else to bring him in 0 telligence about the weavers and their work before he e troubled himself in the affair all the people throughout d the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to n possess and all were anxious to learn how wise or how ignos rant their neighbours might prove to be  i will send my e faithful old minister to the weavers said the emperor at last i after some deliberation  he will be best able to see how the cloth looks for he is a man of sense and no one can be more i suitable for his office than he is so the faithful old minister went into the hall where the knaves were working with all their might at their empty looms v what can be the meaning of this  thought the old man opening his eyes very wide d i cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms however he did not express his thoughts aloud the impos1 tors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms and then asked him whether the design pleased him and whether the colours were not very beautiful at the same time pointing to the empty frames the poor old minister looked and looked he could not discover any thing on the looms for a very good reason viz there was nothing there  what  thought he again is it possible that i am a simpleton  i have never thought so myself and no one must know it now if i am so can it be that i am unfit for my office no that must not be said either i will never confess that i could not see thestuff 1 well sirminister said one of the knaves still pretending to work  you do not say whether the stuff plleases you  oh it is excellent  replied the old minister loking at the loom through his spec tacles  this pattern and the coloursyes i will tell the emperor without delay how very beautiful i think them w e shall be much obliged to you said the impostors and then they named the different colours and described the pattern of the pretended stuff the old minister listened attentively to their words in order that he might repeat them to the eimtperor and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold saving that was neeesary to complete what they had begun llowcvcr they put all that was given them into their knapi s9c1 mnld c tinued to work vwith as much aippmrent diligence kfjrc t iir cq1ty looms the enpietor now rent au other officer of his court to see how the men were getting on i and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready it t was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister he i surveyed the looms on all sides but could see nothing at all  but the empty frames does not the stuff appear as beautiful l to you as it did to my lord the minister  asked the imposx tors of the emperors second ambassador at the same time  making the same gestures as before and talking of the design i and colours which were not there  i certainly am not stupid i thought the messenger  it must be that i am not fit for i my good profitable office that is very odd however no l one shall know any thing about it and accordingly he i praised the stuff he could not see and declared that lie was i delighted with both colours and patterns  indeed please your imperial majesty said he to his sovereign when he returned  the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent the whole city was talking of the 4 splendid cloth which the emperor had ordered to he woven at his own expense and now the emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture whilst it was still on the loom accompanied by a select number of officers of the court among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth he went to the crafty impostors who as soon as they were aware of the emperors approach went on working more diligently than ever although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms is not the work absolutely magnificent   said the two officers of the crown already mentioned if your majesty will only be pleased to look at it what al splendid design what glorious colours and at the samz l time they pointed to the empty frames for they imagined that i every one else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship  how is this  said the emperor to himself  i can see nothing  this is indeed a terrible affair  am i a simpleton or am i unfit to be an emperor  that would be the worst thing that could happenoh the cloth is charming said he aloud  it has my complete approbation and he smiled most graciously and looked closely at the empty looms for on no account would lie say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much all his retinue now strained their eyes hoping to discover something on the looms but they could see no more than the others nevertheless they all exclaimed  oli how beautiful  and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material for the approaching procession magnificent charming  excellent  resounded on all sides and every one was uncommonly gay the euperor shared in the general satisfaction and presented the impostors with the ribbon of an order of knighthood to be worn in their buttonholes and the title of  gentlemen weavers the rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place and had sixteen lights burning so that every one might see how anxious they were to finish the emperors new suit they pretended to roll the cloth off the looms cut the air with their scissors  and sewed with needles without any thread in them 1 see  cried they at last  the emperors new clothes are ready  and now the emperor with all the grandees of his court came to the weavers  andl the rogues raised their arms as if in the act of holding something up sayings  here are your majestys trowsers here is the scarf here is the mantle  the whole suit is as light as a cobweb one might fancy one has nothing at all on when dressed in it that however is the great virtue of this delicate cloth  yes indeed  said all the courtiers although not one of them could see any thing of this exquisite manufacture  if your imperial majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes we will fit on the new suit in front of the lookingglass the emperor was accordingly undressed and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit the emperor turning round from side to side before the lookingglass h how splendid his majesty looks in his new clothes and how well they fit  every one cried out  what a design what colours  these are indeed royal robes   the canopy which is to be born over your majesty in the procession is waiting announced the chief master of the ceremonies  i am quite ready answered the emperor 1 do my new clothes fit well  asked he turning himself round again before the lookingglass in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit the lords of the bedchamber who were to carry his majestys train felt about ou the ground as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle and pretended to be carrying something for they would by no means betray anything like simplicity or unfitness for their office so now the emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession through the streets of his capital and all the people standing by and those at the windows cried out  oh how beautiful are our emperors new clothes  what a magnificent train there is to the mantle and how gracefully the scarf hangs  in short no one would allow that he could not see these muchadmired clothes because in doing so he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office certainly none of the emperors various suits had ever made so great an impression as these invisible ones but the emperor has nothing at all on  said a little child  listen to the voice of innocence  exclaimed his father and what the child had said was whispered from one to another  but he has nothing at all on  at last cried out all the people the emperor was vexed for he knew that the people were right but he thought the processionx must go on now and the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever to appear holding up a train although in reality there was no train to hold,folklore

we possess in english and one that is of especial value since the tales are not merely translations the word  english however is somewhat misleadingso many of the tales are scotch it would be of interest also to know the actual source of the tales which mr jacobs heard in australia many of the tales are of course familiar to all students of folklore in english forms and i am not sure that mr jacobs versions are always the best occasionally too one seems to miss the genuine ring not of the folktale but of the folktelling and there are certain omissions thatunless mr jacobs is as i hope contemplating a second volumeare difficult to account for but despite small faults of commission and omission faults one only notices because the work is so good thc volume is most welcome only one protest  tom tit tot mr jacobs declares is  superior to any of the continental variants with which he is acquainted it may be that i am prejudiced and that therefore the german variant which delighted me as a child still seems to me the best be this as it may to me at least  rumpelstilzchen  seems more graceful more humorous and more dramatic than tom tit tot but whatever the grownup folk may say the little folk will be of only one opinion concerning these  talesthey will receive them with a chorus of delight and after all are not children the best as they are also the most honest of critics  the admirable illustrations by j d batten are worthy of the tales no wellregulated nursery should be without these old old stories in their charming new dress  tattercoats from more erglish fairy tales more english fairy talfs collected and edited by iosepii jacobs illtistratel by j  batten d nutt mr jacobs has kept some of the best of his tales for this volume adhering to his former plan and stoutly defending it in his preface he has given them for the most part in the racy speech of the people but always keeping in mind that they are meant to be read and liked by children he refuses to draw a line between scottish and english border tales and so  rashincoatie  and  habitrot  are here it is a delightful and at the same time a very amusing collection full of humour and insight into peasant character and customs but none of the tales are here for any such serious reason but simply because they are good to read and listen to nfr batten never entered more thoroughly into the spirit of the tales than he has done in this volume which should be fully as popular as any of mr jacobs former oncs  celtic fain tales solectod and edited bv joseph jacobs editor of folklore illustrated by john d batten nutt tales and lng ends by av carew hazlitt sonnenschein  co mn jacobs tolls us in the preface that his chief difficulty has been that of selecting where there is so much ready to hand his collection consists of twentysix stories representing ireland scotland wales and cornwall but chiefly ireland and scotland in fact though brythons have here onl five storiesfour from wales  the shepherd of myddvai the wooing of olwen the brewery of eggshells and  beth gellort and one from cornwall  the tale of ivan mr jacobs however explains that it is not his fault that little wales is not better represented and hopes that the eisteddfod may do something for welsh folklore by offering prizes for collecting folktales in the principality this has been done to some extent but with no great rosults as yet at least so far as though public is concerned thus the eisteddfod held in london a few years ago awarded a prize to the rev elias owen for work done in this field  but what has becomo of it  we are not awaro that it has ever boon published then as to complete stories of any length we feel pretty certain that there are none such to be found in wales at the present day and this is our idea also as to though time not long ago when that peculiar collector of folklore wirt sikes flourished mr jacobs gives his readers clearly to understand whero ho has found his tales and how he has dealt with them modifying or excising though original translations from celtic hero and there where he found them ovorliteral for his avowed object is not to appeal to english folklorists and scholars but to intorost and please a more youthful class of roaders and wo certainly think that he has boen eminently successful mr batten has also done his part admirably and both he and mr jacobs leave one under the impression that they have not themselves escaped the fascination whereby  though captive celt has enslaved his captor in though realm of imagination though present volume accordingly attempts to begin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years and it may bo trusted to act in some measure as an antidote to the ruthless unreason of the budding golthers of our day by no means the least interesting portion of the volume is that consisting of the thirty pages of notes to the stories these it is neodloss to say are not quite exhaustive but it would be invidious to suggest here a variety of small additions which occur to us as of interest to the specialist all the notes aro decidedly instructive reading and some such as that in which the origin of the beth gelert story of llewelyn and his greyhound is traced break new ground others illustrate accidentally the position of mr jacobs in the folklore world for our readers are doubtless aware that folklorists aro divided in opinion on the question of parallel developments as against borrowing wo may cite the following passage as both explaining what we mean and dealing with a curious feature of folktales it occurs in mr jacobss notes on the story of  hudden and dudden p 248  it is indeed curious to find as m cosquin points out a cunning fellow tied in a sack getting out by crying i wont marry the princess in countries so far apart as ireland sicilyafghanistanand jamaicait is indeed impossible to think these are disconnected and for drolls of this kind a good case has been made out for the borrowing hypotheses by m cosquin and mr clouston who borrowed from whom is another and more difficult question which has to be judged on its merits in each individual case probably in this instance all would agree that there has been borrowing by somebody  but in some cases the other theory namely that of parallel developments in a similarity of circumstances is held by some students of folklore and to these mr jacobs at the recent international folklore congress gave the name of  casualists what is to bo the name of the other partythat to which he himself belongs probably some such name as  niigrationists  would do as well as any other but the difference between the two schools is only one of degree the migrationists being as they themselves think more sensitive to though numerical argument from a calculation of though chances against independent developments in each particular instance before we turn to mr hazlitts book we may bo permitted to express our regret that leisure was not found to revise the printers errols moro carefully for if words which are not english are introduced into an english book pains should be taken to have them spelled in some way recognised in the languages to which the belong  if you must needs speak of  the cymru you should know that it means  the wales and that you have to write  the cymry  if you wish to allude in that way to  the welsh people we have seen more than ono way of spelling the gaelic word for antiquary or storyteller but ve have never before seen it made into theenachie similarly  archroologia britannia and similar slips in the notes look strange and ought to disappear in future editions of which thore will we doubt not be many as the volume cannot fail to become popular and deservedly so it is difficult to know for what class of readers mr hazlitts book is designed not surely for students of folklore for in the preamble to robin hood on his 242nd page mr hazlitt says that  in dealing with this ancient and favourite tradition the editor has for the first time made use of such material only as appeared to him authentic so exactly half the book is valueless for scientific purposes unless as we gather from other parts of it mr hazlitts command of english is not always so complete as to enable him to say what he means students of folklore too require much more precise information than is here afforded and will naturally prefer to go to the fountain head for these interesting but wellknown old stories neither can the book be intended for young persons  or children for various incidents are related with  the masculine frankness of the old time nor yet for lovers of ballad poetry for none such when reading a selection of ballads from the  reliques which have been digested into prose whatever that may mean  would admit that  the probability is that many of the ancient tales here found present themselves for the first time in an intelligible form or that the handling of say for instance the nutbrowne maid is faithful and judicious and has made it capable of yielding to the lover of the ballad and folktale a store at once of entertainment and instruction what possible instruction is to he obtained from a translation which changes 0 lord what is th s worldys blysse tfhat ohangeth as the mone  my somers day in lusty may is derked bel ore the none 1 here you saye

we are not so soon to depart  if the until death us dopart of the marriage service had not been altered into u until death us do part almost every one would havo known that to depart means to part if mr hazlitt knew it he should have completed the work of modernization hy saying  part here to our mind however such treatment of our old ballads is both barbarous and unnecessary never yet have we seen the child of fair intelligence who could not after taking thought read and got pleasure out of  chevy chace  adam bel the  battle of otterburn and many others which have had both poetry and point taken out of them by mr hazlitt for a bit of fine confused writing showing a great deal of appreciation of and contempt for theso ballads and legends we commend our readers to the preface it is

world the fate of the children of lir a second volume would have been justified and the black horse and how cormac macart went to fairy  are two others in this second series that must fascinate all

celtic fairy tales nutt age in a book first meant for children mr batten is as good as ever the illustrations to  powel prince of dyfed and  paddy okelly are capital he knows how to relieve his most fearsome pictures by a touch of humour  english fairy tales by joseph jacobs illustrated by j d batten nutt the flyleaf of this book tells us how to get into it the difficulty however will not be how to get into it but how to get out of it for from first to last almost without an exception these stories are delightful there are old friends among them which never can appear too often there are others with which we have hitherto only had a bowing acquaintance and there are one or two which are entirely new we are not quite sure about the whole party being englishone or two seem to have strayed out of grimms  kinder und hausmiirchen and to have been a little weakened on the way some of them judging from the point of view of folklore might certainly have been more appropriately included in a scotch collection mr jacobs explains their appearance thus  i have also included some stories that have only been found in lowland scotch i have felt justified in doing this as of the twentyone folktales contained in chamberss  popular rhymes of scotland no less than sixteen are also to be found in an english form the reasoning here is not strong but the stories are good we can imagine mr jacobs feeling the same pious joy that thrilled the old north  country steward who recounting to his absent lord the depredations caused by a foray made by the scots when  the falsehearted thieving loons  drove away flocks and herds over the border wound up by saying  but thankit be the lord we have outstolen them the more stories of this kind that are  lifted  into books that the public are likely to read the better and as mr jacobs informs his readers that some day he is going  to treat the subject of the english folktale on a larger scale with all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus  his readers may for the present wink at an english fairy tale called the laidly worm which is avowedly patched up out of a ballad by mr lamb of norham  with touches from the more ancient version  kempton  mr jacobs has performed the service of compiling an excellent version of  jack th giantkiller from two old chapbooks itt the british museum it is in all substantial points the same as that of which grimm gives a summary in the notes on english folktales at the end of the  hausmarchen a satisfactory version has long been needed for the chapbooks which told the story well seem to have been altogether superseded by those which told it badly we wonder no one took the trouble to go to the british museum with this object before all the illustrations to this book are good but that which shows jack entering the giants castle wearing the cap which makes him invisible is very good indeed and decidedly original in the preface to the  cauld lad of hilton mr jacobs speaks of him as the contrariest brownie ever known but he was not more contrary than brownies always are or were  they always behaved just as the  cauld lad  did if they found things orderly and clean they at once proceeded to break furniture and crockery to turn everything topsyturvy and play uncomfortable tricks of all kinds if however the servants were dirty and disorderly and went to bed leaving their work undone the brownie immediately began to put all in good order a brownies mission was therefore to demoralise servants by showing them that it was wise policy to leave their work undone the servants who had to do with the cauld lad of hilton castlenot hall by the way as mr jacobs has it must have been good ones or they would have suffered no inconvenience from the nightly visitant the brownie of hilton was however supposed to be the ghost of a poor lad working about the place who had been murdered there which may account for the servants anxiety to get rid of him another part of a brownies mission seems to have been to teach ingratitude for any present of clothes or of anything more substantial than a little milk or food always resulted in depriving the household of his services if a fault can be found with this book it is that we do not always quite like the way in which the stories are told mr jacobs says in his preface generally speaking it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse will speak when she tells fairy tales this being the case the critic can but ask himself two questions has mr jacobs done this satisfactorily  and is it a thing that it is well to do  he has done it very well if he wishes his nurse to be a rather vulgar one of the present day it is not prudent however to adopt this form of narration unless the imaginary nurse be made to use a simple and rather antiquated phraseology as a nurse of a hundred years ago whose style was formed on the bible might have done all the events recorded in fairy tales are supposed to have taken place long ago and seem to demand a somewhat archaic or to say the least oldfashioned form of speech the critics sense of fitness was always a little ruffled ly mr dasents method of telling a tale and the same irritation is felt upon perusing such sentences as these   dartersays she  put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em a little  or  go you and get one o them there pies or  she sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry   or  he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents but that did not btop long or this in  childe rowland  and the thing to do is this  after you have entered the land of fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the burd ellen you must out with your fathers brand and off with their head or this from  jack and the beanstalk    right you are said the man  and here they are the very beans themselves he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of strangelooking beans  as you are so sharp said he i dont mind doing a swop with youyour cow for these beans  walker  says jack   wouldnt you like it  it is to be hoped that when mr jacobs republishes these stories with the  necessary paraphernalia referred to already he will carefully do away with the only thing that damps the readers pleasure in them by carefully revising the nurses language  literature fairy tales indian fairy tales edited by joseph jacobs nutt fairy tales from the far east by theo gift lawrence  bullen fairy tales in other lands by julia goddard cassell  co scenes in fairyland by canon atkinson macmillan  co household tales and fairy stories routledge  sons mr jacobs has put together a good collection of stories some of which were gathered into the fold of literature more than two thousand years ago in the  kathasarit sagara of somadeva while others are the jetsam and flotsam of the present day rescued by miss frere miss stokes major temple c here too are to be found some of the fables of bidpai and the jatakas being interpreted  kathasarit sagara means  ocean of the streams of story did somadevas title mean that all known stories of all known lands had streamed into the ocean of his collection and found a home there and in the country in which it was formed mr jacobs is evidently inclined to hold the contrary opinion and to believe that all other countries derived their fairy tales and fables from india the majority of the tales in this volume he writes  havo been known in the west in some form or other and the problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in farthest west and east surely if as mr jacobs asserts they existed or began to exist at one and the same time in farthest west and east there is no problem to solve for it would be manifest that they were not transmitted from one country to another but that each had its own independent origin some mr jacobs continues aa benfey in germany m cosquin in france and mr clouston in england have declared that india is the home of the fairy tale and that all european fairy tales have been brought from thence by crusaders by mongol missionaries by gipsies by jews by traders by travellers we are happy to find that mr jacobs though he exhibits a strong leaning towards this theory does not go so far as these writers were it true indeed we should have to believe that for more centuries than we dare to contemplate the children of rich and poor alike in europe went supperless to bed so far as food for the imagination was concerned and that the patient peasantry spent the long dark hours when work was impossible unamused and unamusing we do not believe that they waited until the lord of the land brought back a story from the crusades or an argosy of stories put into port from the far east we prefer to believe with the grimmsthe farseeing fathers of all literature of research of this kindthat while the possibility nay in particular instances the probability of a story passing from one people to another and there firmly rooting itself on the foreign soil is not to be denied the property in fairy tales is common to all and that the  selfsame stories crop up again and again in places most widely remote from each other like a spring which forces its way up in spots which lie far apart and just as wherever the eye can pierce we tind domestic animals grain field and kitchen utensils household furniture armsin fact all the things without which social life would be impossibleso do we also rind sagas and stories corresponding with each other in a striking and yet independent manner they are just as much a necessity of existence as these things and only where avarice and the jarring wheels of machinery benumb every other thought can one imagine it possible to live without them this being the case in comparing the stories of various countries it is by no means necessary to attribute a storys origin to the country in which it appears to have been first current we must always remember that the number of rootstories is extremely limited so that a good deal of similarity must naturally be looked for the jatakas or birth stories of buddha have with the assistance of prof rhysdavids supplied theo gift with nine excellent stories for children nine however would by no means have sufficed had she not lengthened them considerably sometimes pleasantly and judiciously at others we are tempted to ask her to study one of the stories she has selected  the tortoise that could not hold its tongue that story bytheby in the original is told in three or four pages theo gift tells it in twentynine she ignores chronology and eastern local colour with absolute frankness and courage in one sense to ignore facts of time and space is to catch the very spirit of fairyland in another to talk of perambulators in a tale which was not new when it was committed to writing in the fifth century ad gives a shock to any reader who cares about the fitness of things deserts in theo giftrs stories seem to have a good deal of juicy grass interspersed with the sand  farmyards appear to be very like english farmyards  cows are called buttercup  and buttermilk aud clover seem to be going there is a story indeed which begins once upon a time in the days when the great great greatgrandfathers of our great great greatgrandfathers were just having their first breeches made there lived a farmer with one daughter of whom he was very fond he was a rich farmer and his fields were full of corn and clover and his orchards of apples and plums  and he had plenty of horses and cattle and sheep and poultry and pigs and pigeons and a yarddog and kitchen cat and every one of them was so well fed and cared for that even the geese in the pond said   this is the best place in the whole country to live in and so said the sage and onions too this is a hopelessly lower class nineteenth century presentment a great many more greatgreatgreatgrandfathers are needed to take us back to the time when these stories were  human natures daily food and a great deal more study to imbue us with its spirit and yet in spite of aberrations of this kind the book is often entertaining and well written we must not omit to commend mr oswald von glenns illustrations the ten little stories miss goddard has printed will be welcomed in the nursery and probably all the better liked for bearing a strong family likeness to other stories which have long reigned supreme in that domain if the  beauty  brings down the  beast on the father by asking for a few samples of the great wall of china instead of the conventional rose the story is still pleasant reading and the beast though much less interesting is as placable as the beast of our early affections if the japanese red riding hood becomes a  blue mantle and the wolf turns into the allegory of the nile the story is still a story in addition to these departures from the wellbeaten track we have a scandinavian somewhere close to the north pole jack the giantkilleronly he ought not to have been called jan an egyptian puss in boots which becomes a cat in yellow slippers and a persian jack and the beanstalk in which the beanstalk is turned into a carrot with a bushy top and jack has to descend underground instead of climbing up to dangerous heights this little book is sent forth with no hint of any desire to do more than amuse children from beginning to end there is not a word as to the origin of the stories or any of their incidents we accept it on its own showing the stories are prettily told fairyland appears to be easily entered from the moorland parish over which canon atkinson has for forty and odd years presided and yorkshire scenery and dialect come largely into play in his volume when they do not coin words for themselves the hero and heroine use those in vogue in cleveland they  scuttle people off home and encounter other people who stump about cannily and laugh a ramshackle laugh the fairies too wash their clothes at  the kerd of the country side and bittle them on the big flat stones near by this is pleasant enough but when  miss mary who does lessons is surprised over things and continually expresses her surprise by exclaiming  whatever will nurse say we wish she had done these lessons to more purpose miss mary is disappointing  instead of being witty she is snappish when she opens her mouth it is most frequently to say  psha and in spite of her various experiences in fairyland she cannot be persuaded to believe in fairies a book of this kind makes us hasten to renew our allegiance to the incomparable alice and the sweet unreasonableness of lewis carroll it is unreasonableness which never runs too long in the same groove but for ever surprises us with some unexpected change of venue while alices good manners and politeness under trying circumstances are unfailing 4 scenes in fairyland shows a considerable amount of invention and fancy were it reduced to onethird of its present length it would be infinitely better this is a description of an ingenious variation of ball playing  then came gamea with ballsnot tennis or bowls or croquet or anything so  mortal as tehat but it was a game played in the air where the different balls chased each other as the players desired and the balls were all lustrous azure and golden and rosy and lovely green  and they wound in and out and up and down aud over and under  and when after the most amusing and intricate pursuings one players caught

nutt mr jacobs though he be editor of oklore looks not to the gay science for spiritual guidaince lie is happily conscious of the literary qiuaslity of the material he handles and remembers that rimitive man had as keen a sense of art as his mental developmnent and the hitter struggle for life would lermit and sol he has selected and edited his celtic airy taes not to illuminate the genesis of the human brain but with the far more laudable object of amusing the young herein he should be successfcal at any rate he has contrived to entertain the old and perhaps the young are not vastly more ritical mr jacobs has thrown his net wide and has gathered in stories from the printed works of campbell kennedy hyde curtin and the rest nor has he shrunk from editing and adapting such work as he elected to reprint indeed his book is completely purged of pedantry his single aim being to amuse he has ingeniously blent the comic and the romantic and has positively published a book without an afterthought a conspicuous triumph in these days of moralities true in his preface he murmurs something about a union of hearts but he obtrudes no  views and one little excursion into the prevailing vice may be condoned the book has its blemishes the story of beth gellert for instance is wholly out of place mr jacobs version is a bald paraphraseworthy of a boardschool boyof the hon w r spencers poem taken from an obviously literary source the narrative chimes neither in diction nor in eftect with the genuine folktale in vain does mr jacobs inform you that the story is an apologue which is met with in every country from india to wales the question may scarce be answered authoritatively and there seems no reason why it should not be a record of actual experience the tidelity of the dog the sudden anger of the master may easily be matched outside the radius of folklore and once you grant the story the moral follows as a matter of course a child of six could hardly hear of elerts death and not take it as a warning against human iinpctulositv but even if it be a recurrence of the old type its sctting is so modern and the atsence of the supernatural and the inconsequent so marked that it were far better away however it serves to suggest to mr jacobs a learned note which we trust no child will be induced to read now and then too the diction generally studied and correct descends into the commonest slang but these are venial errors  and the book in their despite is as pleasant a collection as you could wish to imeet the stories are both quaint and picturesque of

B4515,"['6731552', '3162037']",  the jungle book ti by rudyard kipling misc millans hitherto we have been accustomed to find inequality in mr kiplings work he has never yet given us a book entirely good each collection of his stories is a mixture of suooess and failure naturally this peculiarity has always stirred some annoyance and perplexity in his critics for at his best he is not easily surpassed while at his worst he is almost puerile there is a popular superstition not without an element of truth in it that equality and mediocrity are interchangeable terms but though no author however gifted can always be at his best the inequalities of mr kiplings work offer too startling a contrast his frequent falls from the heights to the deeps his dazzling leaps from the mire to tne mountain top cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by any theory however respectable so we are unable to take up a new volume of his without knowing our hopes are dogged by a most uncomfortable fear faith in his ultimate suooess is founded tpon the fact that the more di cult his task seems though greater though certainty that he will be successful consequently if he wishes to sustain his reputation he must refuse resolutely to write on subjects commonplace or indifferent the jungle book has been cordially welcomed and it is only just to confess at once that it is more carefully designed than anything he has yet given to us there are no serious blemishes in the style and grammar as a pieoe of technique it is quite blameless but a serious doubt arises as to whether the matter of the book is at all worthy of the labour bestowed on it again it is certain that thoso flashes of genius that used to dazlo us seldom illumine its pages in them mr kiplings finest qualities are to seek we prefer to hear his men and women talk as only mulvaney or mrs hawkesby can talk be bagheora and baloo never so ingenious it is impossible to rid oneself of the conviction that any author rather more clever than the average could have contrived though greater part of th jungle book there are indeed a few pages that no one but the creator of soldiers three could have written and one new friendship is cemented for whioh we are grateful rikki tikki though only a mongoose fights his way stuantly enough into the list of mr iplings immortals the history of his war with the cobras is entirely delightful and refuses to be forgotten there are times when plain speaking is necessary and then the most ardent admirer of an author must if he be honest say the truth though truth is that the jungle book had it been written by a person unknown might have stirred a languid interest and a cor ta in reasonable hope of better things to come as the work of a man of recognised genius it compels disappointment it is generally true that to gain a worthy success a writer must toil hard must choose his words with discrimination but there is no rule without an exception and in this case mr kipling would seem to be that exception his best work achieves itself apparently spontaneously it is a startling nay dangerous thing to say of a man that he places failure far from him only when he is most careless but mr kipling may at any rate be advisedadapting a remark of mr henleys not to concern himself again with words and phrases but with the greater truths of destiny and emotion his last bcok prompts this reflection few authors know the human heart so well as he let him forsake thereforo mowglis and mules and monkeys and remember that his vital phrases have ever been born not made percy addleshaw  the jungle book  the jungle book is made up of story and song both of them rich in vitality and imagination but every time a verse occurs as the heading of a chapter one is inclined to think that mr kipling should write nothing else so instinctive is his power over vigorous rhythm and so vivid are his ballad pictures this  nightsong in the jungle  is only meant to tune

not be  not for nothing are ye called the free people ye fought for freedom and it is yours eat it o wolves there is something sternly grand about all the mowgli stories imaginative children whether or not they follow the narrative with perfect comprehension will be impressed and even awestruck by the solemnity and dignity of jungle life as mr kipling paints it of the habits of the animals of the scenes amidst which they live he has a marvellous knowledge it is this picturesqe knowledge joined to a vigorous interpretation of not their own character but the ideal nature he has constructed for them a nature at once remote and familiar to us that makes the success and the fascination of the stories man without his intellectual power but with his natural faculties of sight and hearing infinitely intensified and without the enfeeblement the deceit the pettiness that are the fruits of his civilisation would be something like this conception of the beast that obeys the jungle law we are grotesquely reminded here and there of the ideals of rousseau and the natural state idealists their primitive man they would have desired to be like mr kiplings loyal beasts there are stories in the book where he is not at his highest point of vigour  the white seal  comes near to being a failure and so does  servants of the queen the adventures of rikkitikkitavi the mongoose that fought with nag the cobra and nagaina his wife are too deadly to be amusing and the glamour of imagination does not play round them to turn the terror into fascination the temperature of ones admiration having been reduced by these we find several other things to wonder at not all admiringly mr kipling cannot resist opportunities of political allusion indeed invents them and his love for playing the schoolmaster grows on him it is this quality that is at the bottom of the imperfect sympathy which runs parallel in many readers minds with a warm admiration for him the pedagogue in him hides under free and vigorous and unconventional speech but he is mostly there were he to fall asleep a bit oftener and let some careless lawless fellow take his place if even only for a few minutes mr kiplings range of understanding of human nature would be greatly widened but grumbling at mr kiplings temperament is not very relevant here it does not greatly offend in  the jungle book more to the purpose is it to point to the feats of imagination in these beast stories next to the three mowgli tales for great qualities comes  toomai of the elephants toomai is a little boy who saw what few be lieved in and none had seen the great  dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the garo hills he was on the back of the tame elephant kala nag that he tended and when kala nag got the signal for the dance the boy was born away up the wooded hill through the thick underwood through the bed of a river to a space of three or four acres where the grass was trampled and hard the assembling elephants crashed through the trees and entered the danceplace and rolled their eyes and tossed their trunks and clicked their tusks and flicked their great tails  then an elephant trumpeted and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds the dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs and a dull booming noise began not very loud at first and little toornai could not tell what it was but it grew and grew and kala nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other and brought them down on the ground onetwo onetwo as steadily as tripbammers the elephants were stamping altogether now and it sounded like a wardrum beaten at the mouth of a cave the dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall and the booming went on and the ground rocked and shivered and little toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound but it was all one gigantic jar that ran through hinmthis stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth    the morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills and the booming stopped with the first ray as though the light had been an order it is a magnificent sight that toomai saw that night when the favour of the elephantfolk and of the gods of the jungle was with him mr kipling has some splendid visions for all his love of discipline and order it is when his spirit gets away into the wilder

fourteenth cup of weak tea  sister what a great deal of water you make mo drink in order to get a little tea  was his answer and it comes to our mind while reading this collection of stories it has mr leland says in the preface not been  made on the grimm principle of  pleasing tales for the nursery it is startling to hear that the brothers grimm had the nursery in their minds when they set the stone of collecting folktales rolling but it is manifest that miss owen cannot have had it in hers for except in an american not to say a missourinursery her book will be almost unintelligible some words are obscure even to grownup people and it is hard to have to toil through so much negroenglish before we can enjoy the items of true folklore earnest clear and welldefined that are promised by mr leland the promise is fulfilled there is a great deal of valuable folklore in the stories but it is injured not only by the uncouth dialect but by being laboriously introduced into the conversation of five negresses and one child who draws thenout one negress is from ole feginney another was bornded in tennisee but mosly brung up in mizzoury  a third has a french father a fourth a fox indian

mary alicia owen fisher unwin this quaint volume is from the pen of the southern lady whose paper on  missourinegro folklore was one of the good things at the folklore congress of 1891 she now appears in the guise of the flaxenhaired listener irreverently dubbed towhead for whose benefit a remarkable group of black women pour out their treasures of ancient fable the form and method of the book recall of course uncle pe mus but the likeness stops there considered as humorous literature old rabbit cannot perhaps rank with the masterpiece of  joel chandler harris   but from the point of view of the folklorist it has a far higher value both are collections of  animal myths founded on widespread and immemorial traditions with many modern glosses derived from misunderstood phenomena and adorned with detail varying with the different races by whom they have been handed down but whereas uncle remus is saturated with the modern plantation nigger in miss owens book the bed indian medicine man is predominant and there is also a considerable tincture of the aboriginal african witchdoctor the stories here set down for us come from the missouri border where there is a large black population of mixed indian and negro blood a blend which not only has an individual flavour of its own but seems to have preserved certain voodoo elements not generally met with in the states about voodooism we know comparatively little but no doubt as mr leland tells us in his preface it is distinguished from aryan and also from red indian magic by its reliance not so much on penance and invocation as  on daring what is horrible and repulsive the discrimination of these different elements in miss owens stories is an engaging task for the reader who will also notice the considerable literary skill she shows both in the telling of the stories and in the portraits of those who tell them a the voodoo king if a slightly revolting and simian personage is typical and the black sibyls who foregather in the cottage of granny are admirably distinct in character speech and appearance chief of them is granny herself devoted to  the folks at the house whose slave she once was who claims to be a descendant of   them injuns dat hilt de kyentry fo de white folks come dar  a pedigree generally admitted notwithstanding her crisp white wool and pronounced negro appearance next is big angy or mrs boogarry whose fulldress name is madame angelique bougareau a double cross of indian negro and creolea fervent catholio and firm believer in heathen witchcraft with the nose of an eagle the eye of a hawk the mouth of a cat and hair like the tail of a black horse she swears in french and allows her worthless husband to gamble away her small earnings explaining her want of thrift by saying  me

and oily black ringlets  and aunt my mee the nurse  the only pureblooded african and the only coppercoloured person in the party the child of a guinea sorceress she would fain have her friends believe that she had the devil for a father and was so far successful that not one of them ever went to bed without pouring a cup of seeds on the doorstep and hearth lest in the night mymee should arrive by the threshold or the chimney and ride on their chests tie their hair in knots or perform somo of the other pleasantries for which your witch in all countries is famous a pleasing foil to these old negresses is tow head herself the little white girl whom they combine to spoil and petpositive and perverse and a passionate lover of the witch story some of her own sayings are in the happiest vein as when after hearing though nigger version of aesops fox who through his braggart humour fell a victim to the hounds  all except de bresh she bursts out with 441 hate a story that kills somebody and i know how foxies lations felt for some hunters came by here you know and their dogs killed my kitten i cried awfully and heard grandma say to mamma that i seemed to feel that i had lost a lation i didnt really for i have so many lations and only had just that one sweet kitty there is a whole series of rabbit stories usually funny though containing nothing quite equal to the tarbaby episode in which uncle remuss chartered libertine so nearly gets his  comeuppence we would call particular attention to this among other new and delightful words by which the blacks vocabulary is richer than the whites the rabbit with miss owen is much more of a magician much less an incarnation of the nigger than with  joel chandler harris  and a similar distinction is noticeable between the bird and reptile personages in the two collections chief among the birds is of course the woodpecker who was a very early bird at magical work for did not picus martius take romulus and remus from the month the umbrian augurs knew him well and in the eugubine tables we find the directions parfa kurnase dersua peiqu peica merstu by interpretation of prof donaldson  parram cornicem dextras picum picam simistros and it is noticeable that it is about these same birds that miss owens clients have most to tell us her woodpecker is however a far greater personage than the classical picus the king turned into a bird because he declined to serve a witchs sensual phantasy he is lord of the woods the greatest of all the magicians he makes the bat out of a mouse and a goatsucker and gives the redbird his gay plumage and endows his friends with all the good fortune and all the moral excellences that pallas and hera offered to paris perhaps this redheaded bird with his weird laughing cry the peculiar mimicry of his plumage and his curious exploratory methods of feeding is to be identified with the redcap goblins found all over europe but there is a vast difference between the treasureseeking folletto coila beretta of europe and the great sorcerer of the american continent perhaps the most curious passage in old rabbit is that in which the authoress describes the manufacture of a luckball price one dollar for the benefit of mr leland himself it is compounded of red clover substituted for the hair of the propositus dust white yarn sewing silk and tinfoil the whole tied in innumerable

B8152,['8837662'],  kaffir folklore or a selection from the traditional tales current among the people living on the eastern border of the cape colony by george mccall theal son nenschein  co the stories which mr theal has collected during a residence of twenty years among the kaffirs are very curious and interesting and the information ho gives in his introduction and notes about these wild people among whom he has exercised many functions including those of a mission teacher and a border magistrateis most valuable the word kaffir he remarks is often used to signify any black native who is not the descendant of an imported slave but it is applied on the eastern frontier of the cape colony only to a member of the amaxosa tribe from these amaxosa the tales in mr theals volume were obtained the kaffir of the coast region ia described as  a model of a wellformed man possessing reasoning powers  quite equal to those of a white man it appears that for anything approaching frivolity he has a supreme contempt and therefore it is to be feared that any distinguished representative of his race who may visit london will carry away an unfavourable impression as regards fashionable society the language of the amaxosa is  rich in words and is musical in expression and it contains three clicks which are now represented in writing by the superfluous letters c q and x it is at first encouraging to be told that they are easily sounded separately by europeans  the c by withdrawing the tongue sharply from the front teeth the q by doing the same from the roof of the mouth and the x by drawing the breath in a peculiar way between the tongue and the side teeth but mr theal afterwards saddens his readers by the information that these clicks generally prove an insurmountable difficulty to an adult who wishes to learn to speak the language the language of the women varies a good deal from that of the men on account of  the custom called ukuhlonipa which prohibits females from pronouncing the names of any of their husbands male relatives in the ascending line or any words whatever in which the principal syllables of such names occur of many other curious customs mr theal supplies an interesting account especially as regards marriage death and witchcraft he gives a couple of curious instances of their superstitions which came under his own notice in 1875 a kaffir girl was drowned while bathing her companions ran away home and declared that she had been lured away into a dark hole by a spirit and that she cried out just before sinking for the last time  go and tell my father and mother that it took me her father immediately collected his cattle drove them into the water and implored the spirit  to take the choicest of them and restore his daughter he spoke in vain but  the failure to get the exchange effected is still attributed by the relatives of the drowned girl to the absence of one skilful to work with medicines in july 1881 a kaffir woman sorrowfully sought mr theals assistance the  witch  finder of the village had pointed her out as the person who had caused the death of a neighbours child the result of her being thus smelt out was that no one would so much as speak to her and even her own children avoided her such treatment was unendurable and mr theal interfered on her behalf the witchfinder was sent for and a large number of kaffirs appeared to judge the case it is pleasant to know that the witchfinder failed to satisfy the judges when the ordinary tests were put to him and when he was compelled to admit that he had never held converse with the people under the water he was convicted of imposition and his victim was acquitted of the terrible charge he had brought against her one of the most unreasonable of the ideas indulged in by kaffirs is that in consequence of which they use no kinds of fish as an article of diet and call them all snakes without distinction but they do not intend by so doing to insult the fishy race for  the snake is treated with great respect by the kaffirs if one is found in a hut the people will move out and wait patiently until it leaves the owner will say that it is perhaps the spirit of one of his ancestors who has come to visit him in this form the kaffir stories are for the most part wild and all but unintelligible a few of them appear to show traces of foreign influence and may possibly have adapted to south african uses certain incidents properly belonging to asiatic tales this may account for the resemblance between part of the story of the girl and the mbulu and the numberless asiatic and european variants of the tale which it has been proposed to call the substituted bride in the kaffir story the girl is induced to bathe and the mbulua fabulous being which can assume the human form but cannot part with its tailputs on her clothes and assumes her place passing itself off as a chiefs daughter and making the girl act as its servant the girl lightens her cares by song and sings the tale of her woes the neighbours who hear her test the truth of her metrical assertions satisfy themselves that the substituted bride for a wedding has taken place  has a mbulus tail and put the interloper to death the deceived bridegroom then marries the girl whose place the mbulu had usurped the story ends after a fashion which may be said to be original  she had a child and one day when it was playing a square pumpkin came out of the ground where the mbulu was buried and tried to kill the infant but the people chopped the pumpkin into pieces and burned it they afterwards threw the ashes into a river so that nothing more could come of that mbulu  though story of five heads also is one which resembles to a suspicious extent the numerous popular tales which tell how a foolish or haughty maiden turns a deaf ear to the good advice which is given to her while she is on her way to the dwelling of a demon or witch and suffers in consequence and how her wise or humble sister listens to similar counsel and is rewarded the demoniacal being in the kaffir tale is  a big snake with five heads and large eyes a creature of a foreign aspect closely akin to the sevenheaded snakes which are part of the stockintrade of russian and other storytellers one of the beings about whom a piece of advice is given to the kaffir damsel differs from those we are accustomed to hear of in european tales she is told that she will meet a man  whose head is under his armand she is advised not to take water from him she meets  a man carrying his head under his arm and takes water to drink from him in consequence the snake eventually kills her with his tail being discontented with the bread she has made for him the opening of  the story of the girl who disregarded the custom of ntonjane in which a snake comes out of a pool wherein a number of girls are bathing and takes possession of the clothes they have left on the bank is very like that of the russian story of  the watersnake which again is closely akin to a burmese tale of a waterspirit who marries a mortal maiden but the incidents which follow are entirely different there are several kaffir stories also which describe the apparent destruction of men and beasts by some monster and their ultimate rescue uninjured from its inside just as in the norse tale of  the devouring cat or the indian story of  the voracious frog in one of the kaffir variants of what seems to be a naturemyth which has dwindled into a grotesque story for children a monster called an inabulele swallows a young hero who finds inside it  his father and his mother and many people and cattle he pierces his living prison with his assagai and the captives escape in another tale two boys kill a glutton and their mother opens it whereupon people came out and cattle and dogs in a third the devouring creature is a monstrous cannibal  the men went and skinned the cannibal when a great number of people came from him one of though most thoroughgoing parallels with alien folktales is afforded by  the story of sikulume that hero wins the heart of the daughter of a demoniacal being named mangangezulu and flies with her from her fathers house the bereaved parent pursues but the girl throws down successively  an egg a milksack a pot and a smooth stone the demon is for a time baffled by the mist into which the egg turns the sheet of water which comes out of the milksack and the thick darkness due to the flinging down of the pot but he is not completely foiled until the smooth stone is thrown it became a rock a big rock with one side steep as a wall he could not climb up that rock and so he returned to his own village in european folktales a brush and a comb are the objects most often relied upon by similar fugitives very quaint though not absolutely novel is the story of the  big ugly cannibal with only one leg who took home a bag into which he had inserted a very nice girl and called all the other cannibals to come to a feast and they came expecting to get something nice but when the bag was opened it was found to contain  only snakes and toads for the girls father had effected an unwelcome substitution the other cannibals were so angry when they saw this that they killed him and made their feast off him quaint also is the  person with only one arm one side and one leg who kindly cries to magodas runaway children  see the cannibal has eaten the rest of me take care of yourselves the opening of the story of the cannibal who calls to demazana pretending to be her brother demana is singularly like that of the german story of  the wolf and the seven kids the kaffir girl replies  go away you cannibal your voice is hoarse you are not my brother he consults with another cannibal who advises him to burn his throat with a hot iron  he did so and then no longer spoke hoarse the girl admits him into the cave in which she lives and he carries her off in the german story grimm no 5 the wolf detected by the gruffness of its voice  went to a shop and bought a great piece of chalk which it ate and by that means rendered its voice more gentle by way of conclusion we may mention as an original story and one which is in accordance with the already mentioned kaffir idea about drowning  the story of tangalimlibo that lady who made it a rule never to go out in the daytime and was therefore known as the walker by moonlight was drawn under water one day when she had broken her rule in deference to her fatherinlaws repeated requests for water in vain did her fatherinlaw offer the riverspirit an ox in exchange for her she remained unseen all day when the night came her child cried so bitterly that its nurse carried it down to the river  then the mother of the child came out of the river and sang a sad song and afterwards took her child and put it to her breast to suck the story ends more happily than the russian tale of the dead mother who used to suckle her wasting child by night for a fat ox having been offered to the riverspirit by  a woman skilful in the use of medicines the demon was appeased  there was a great shaking and a rising up of the river and tangalimlibo came out there was great joy among those people when they took her home to her husband we trust that we have quoted enough from mr theals book to prove that it is one which may be cordially recommended,folklore

B7628,['8944055'],  science the prowlers by f st m1ars nisbet  co a romance of animal life must needs be founded on fact if it is to carry conviction this is far from saying that nothing is to be left to the imagination of the chronicler it suffices that no behaviour incompatible with ascertained habits no incident beyond the range of probability should be introduced and that the local colour should be true that mr st mars has actually been an eyewitness of all the strange scenes he depicts is extremely unlikely but there is no question that he knows what he is talking about and that his knowledge has been acquired in the right school equally important for the narrative is his exceptional power of expression his language is virile and strenuous never slipshod and he is a master of terse and graphic description it would perhaps be ungrateful and certainly uncharacteristic of the spirit of the age to suggest that the eyes sometimes al e apt to ache with so much movement and might welcome an occasional lull battle and murder and sudden death there are on every page here are two paragraphs selected almost at haphazard after that there was a jet of flame and a report that seemed to knock the natural tranquillity of the place to little pieces it seemed also to have literally burst pigeons upwards out of the wood and to hurl them into space it scattered finches out of the hedges as dew is scattered from a bough that is shaken at early morn and it conjiured up an eruption of bronze bodies from the spots where the pheasants gathered thick and sent them into apparent hysterics again in description of the sudden vengeance of the peregrine falcon upon a usurping kite a steelcoloured flash a burst of feathers a wild hurtling feathered mass shooting earthwards at appalling speed thena division of the mass into two parts the peregrine wings  threshing furiously tail outspread body thrown back checking her miad career the kite blasted from life a smashed and crumpled heap turning over and over as it fell and finally vanishing crashing into the upper branches among the oaks this is undeniably vivid on the other hand the candid critic may here and there see traces of incipient mannerisms and twists of languagewhich effective enough in themselves tend to become inept by repetition we presently detect the juggler in words who is too prone to repeat his tricks to take one example only there must be a score of sentences beginning thus followed an infernal chattering  followed a leap a thud a dry rustle of feathers a squawk   followed a swirl a hissing bubbling boiling rush andchaos followed a sudden chaos and a miniature whirligig i is there not something amiss with mr st marss title  there is perhaps no reason to apply the name  prowlers exclusively to fourfooted animals but we were a little surprised to find that about half of the dramatis per8ona in the book were birds the marauders is the title of one of the tales and would be appropriate enough for the whole collection it is entirely a matter of individual taste which of these thirteen stories should be awarded the palm for excellenceany one has just as strong claims as another while it would be a still more invidious task to determine which should be excluded if their number had to be reduced to twelve some of them have been previously published in magazines and it is curious that in their present arrangement the first appears to be properly a sequel to the seventh in three only does mr st mars resort to dialogue one being that which tells of the thrilling and unsuccessful attempt of a family of stoats to stop a  flitting  of rats and how the desperate siege in a woodpeckers hole was raised by the white owls incidentally we may note that among all the  prowlers  the author seems to show a partiality for any of the weasel tribe whereas he has not a good word to sav of the rats he endorses the stoats estimate of them as garbageeating carrionhunting flatfooted goblineared ullagesmelling cannibalistic offal and again  nakedtailed nakedfooted scum and the part they play is indeed revolting though the scene of these adventures is laid in england mr st mars has boldly declined to be handicapped by the limits of our fauna and has introduced such characters as the covote the american crow and a pair of minkseach in the guise of an escaped desperado the great grey shrike too is hardly a typical british paterfamilias but we are not disposed to quarrel on that score with the telling of his fascinating career which among other things reveals the origin of his curious name the  sentinel of special interest is the remarkable account of a fighting rabbit which became a terror even to the dreaded ferret a note by the author tells us that the facts as observed by himself have been independently confirmed by two of his correspondents the outcast tells the more or less familiar story of a rook who is a pariah among his fellows and his pathetic struggle against long odds we have no space even to hint at the startling experiences of the fox the otter the hedgehog the pomatorhine skua and the sparrowhawk mr st mars pauses now and again to emphasise certain features of animal existence that are not always appreciated he shows that the reason why the raiders habitually prey on animals so greatly their inferiors and avoid combat with their equals or superiors is in no way due to cowardice but simply that they see no fun in getting mangled without a cause the lot of a wounded creature being a pitiless one he points i i out too why a bird is so voracious it is simply  to balance the enormous expenditure of energy  it must gorge to fly and must fly to live the fullest enjoyment can perhaps be derived from this remarkable book by reading it once for the story at the authors pace which is anything but slow and then at leisure for a proper appreciation of the writing in this respect it will be worth more to the reader of mature judgement than to a juvenile but at the same time it can hardly fail to touch the enthusiasm of the young,folklore

B4212,['6739247'],  japanese fairy tales i green willow and other japanese fairy tales by grace james with forty illustrations in colour by warwick goble macmillan and co lbs net japan is a country that has borrowed much in the way of fairy tales from china and india it is not however a crude borrowing and nothing more a mere change of the names of places and people japanese fairy tales have a distinct charm of their own and they are as remote from our  little riding hood  or the pomp and ciri cumstance of the  arabian nights  as can possibly be imagined many fairy tales of nippon owe their origin to a fanciful love of nature the willow with its drooping shower of delicate leaves becomes a beautiful woman living only so long as the willow tree lives the wind in the pine trees becomes the happy murmur of lovers voices such tales are essentially japanese though akin to the naturecumfairyland stories of other countries it is a gentle and easy transition from the obvious to the fanciful in which for example the deep red of azaleas becomes the fire of the gods or the white snow about the summit of fuji the discarded garments of the heavenly ones in sharp contrast to such poetical ideas we have stories of the weird and the horrible stories of amorous foxwomen who must be exorcised by holy priests then there are tales of rollicking humour in which a kettle performs on the tightrope talks and laughs or the more subtle merriment in the tale of a rat who offers his daughter in marriage first of all to the sun and then to the wind cloud wall and discovers in the end that the best thing to do with his daughter is to marry her to another rat the excellent idea had not occurred to him before this story is a delightful parody on matchmaking generally on those people who must needs plot and scheme for marriage in impossible and undesirable quarters and last of all there is that element which is common to fairy stories the world over the element of high adventure and deeds of extraordinary daring centring in japan in the beloved momotaro and the fortyseven ronin we have had many volumes of japanese fairy tales mitford hearn ozaki griffis and chamberlain have given us the very cream of this fascinating subject and now just in time for christmas miss grace james has joined the goodly company of her predecessors in the field miss jamiess book would have been a little superfluous were it not that she has presented her collection of old favourites such as  urashima  the moon maiden and  the star loivers with a number of very charming coloured illustrations by mr warwick goble the artists work is for the most part extremely clever he has in his treatment of sea followed hokusais wellknown method of portraying wave and foam his most pleasing production is that illustrating  reflections though we doubt in another picture depicting a sevenheaded serpent if the great monster could possibly drink from the very diminutive jars so temptingly displayed beneath him author and artist are not in agreement in the story entitled  the black bowl the maiden of the story wears a black bowl in which we are at first told that all the beauty of her face is concealed later we are informed that tears  rolled down her cheeks and reached her white chin they looked so charming that a strolling player on seeing them improvised a song for the occasion the artist no doubt troubled with such inconsistencies decides to go his own way and paint a bowl very much resembling our scuttle hat under which we see contrary to the original japanese story the whole of the maids very charming face the bowl was quite unmovable by natural means several of the bowl maidens friends tried to remove it with the result that they merely succeeded in giving the unfortunate wearer a very bad headache only when the maiden drank the three times three with her future husband did the bowl break asunder and obligingly scattered around a shower of gold and precious stones we are afraid mr gobles bowl would have been blown away by a little puff of wind miss jamess manner of treating these stories is not all that could be desired she has not followed the recognised originals very closely and sometimes the use of such a word as  petticoat  obviously strikes a wrong note  give me my best brocade gown and i will get up for i feel a good deal better is rather a tame ending to the droll story of a monkey who preferred to keep his liver rather than to offer it as a medicine to the sick dragon queen but there is room for licence in the telling of a fairy tale and apart from a certain laxity here and there we are glad to welcome these stories again the volume is most tastefully produced and though we may look in vain for snow at christmas time those of us who still preserve something of the heart of a child will thrill at the presence of the snow lady who was white and dazzling to look upon and yet pressed her icy lips to human beings and sucked their blood vampirefashion we have read variations of  the peony lantern  a good many times but miss jamess rendering must take a high place in the manner of telling she has told this story with admirable skill and it is as beautiful and charming as mr gobles picture of the weaving maiden clad in blue and green holding a lighted lantern in her hand and stepping over a bridge of magpies that flutter their black and white wings amid a great gathering of silverpointed stars,folklore

B169,"['8634064', '8521913', '6759661']",  popular tales from the norse by g webbe dasent dcl with an introductory essay on the origin and diffusion of popular tales edinburgh edmonston  douglas these quaint stories are translations from the norske folkeerentyr collected by mm asbjbrnsen and moe and have been the preface says the occasional work of dr dasent for fifteen years which is more than the period of patience that horace required of an author the translator has gone upon the sound principle of omitting stories unfit for modern eyes but has wisely refused to soften blunt rude tales the value of which to the philologist and ethnologist consists in the faithfulness and truth of their rendering it was a severe rebuke to the pedant of a former age to find from grimm that latin and greek were not the foundations of all language that great scholar proved not only that teutonic laws were codes as valuable as those of justinian that though german minnesingers were not inferior to the occasional versewriters of though anthologia but also that our old norse mythology had been a source of poetry and fable as prolific as the old greek the discovery of the harmony existing between the language and creeds of the east and west began with the jesuits studies and thc researches of anquetil de perron at the end of the last century nursery tales became henceforward the study of the scholar so that the child laughed in the nursery over what was racking the scholar in his library it was as when the antiquary finds his child playing with a golden daric of a special rarity nursery stories were discovered to bo small pompeiis of ancient manners fossiled strata of bygone arabian icelandic or persian antiquities they led us back to wonderful theories of the alliances and conquests and descent of the nations who wrote them languagedoctors learned to take uri these fables point to their roots and explain to us as with vegetables the manner and time of their growth many of the stories were found existing in five or six different nations and in different ages and different degrees of civilizationwilliam tell for instance and his daring shot it is told in saxo grammaticus in the twelfth century of king harold gormsons thane in the willana saga of wayland smiths younger brother in the saga of king olof of eindredi the heathen chief it is told again of king harold sigurdarson who died 1066 in the fourteenth century the malleus maleficorum refers it to puncher a magician of the upper rhine in england william of cloudsle in the old north country ballad performs the same featit is common to the turks mongolians and samoyeds it is evident that though it may have happened to tell and that geslers cruelty may have been stimulated to inventiveness by the old legend the fable is of great antiquity and common to all archer nations it proves on the greek principle of the origin of myth that in certain ages stories have ft tendency to gravitate towardb a favourite national hero eventually to crystallise round his memory and become incorporated with hi fame it is the same with the loose wit of an age which comes down to the next generation as the jests of erskine or of sheridan half a wit says is forgotten half he is supposed to say is invented for him he is both better and worse than tradition allows one of the stories in dr dasents book called the master thief is we believe in the gesta bomanorum certainly in the sanscrit hitopadesa in herodotus and in german italian and flemish popular tales it is the same with the welsh story of gellert that the guide tells you as you stand wrapped in white clouds on the peak of snowdon the story is of the faithful dog who saved his master s child from a wolf and is slain by mistake as its supposed murderer this is a sanscrit and arabic storythe monks knew it pilpay records it and there is an old english version of it it is like  the dog of montargis which is told by plutarch and is an old french story also of the days of charlemagne sindbad and aladdin hassan and noureddin are of a common family with jack the giantkiller and puss in boots gentlemen all of unquestionable descent and whose genealogical tree is no mere walkingstick sapling iesop himself 13 not a bit superior to old pilpay nor is meagre phsedrus to be compared to the great german beastepic reynard the fox it is true that these wide analogies set us thinking but do not lead us very far on our way back to babel and eden we come however at last to the two great primaeval distinctions totheshemsand japhetsthe doers and thinkers the conquerors of europe and of india who now meet again after their long wanderings to quarrel once more for the empire of hindostan these two people of central asia were those of iran the tillers and those of iwran or the horsemenwanderersthe indoeuropean and the mongolian the author traces very ingeniously the corruption of the frost giants whose skulls thor had such a habit of splitting like walnuts to the meaner lubberly trolls whom jack always got the better of he shows us how in myths from the foes of the gods these giants became the largeheaded weaklegged dolts of our pantomimes and nursery stories as for odin he turned into the wild huntsman just as heathen wells became the founts of churcheschristianity putting its broad arrow on all the old pagan goods and chattels the monkish stories made the saints wander about and have adventures just as odin did who used to stroll into the forges of village smiths and get his heavenly horse newly shod frigga odins wife the goddess of industry and plenty is still worshipped under the name of the virgin of the fabulous golden agean old pagan tradition annexed and christened by the monksdr dasent tells us a very strange and epical legend that we cannot for the heart of us forbear copying the remembrance of the bountiful frodi echoed in the songs of german poets long after the story which made him so bountiful had been forgotten  but the norse skalds could tell not only the story of fredis wealth and bounty but also of his downfall and ruin in frodis house were two maidens of that old giant race fenja and menja these daughters of the giant he had bought as slaves and he made them grind his quern or handnull grotti out of which he used to grind peace and gold even in that golden age one sees there were slaves and frodi however bountiful to his thanes and people was a hard taskmaster to his giant handmaidens he kept them to the mill nor gave them longer rest than the cuckoos note lasted or they could sing a song but that quern was such that it ground anything that the grinder chose though until then it had ground nothing but gold and peace so the maidens ground and ground and one sang their piteous tale in a strain worthy of eschylus as the other restedthey prayed for rest and pity but frodi was deaf then they turned in giant mood and ground no longer peace and plenty but fire and war then the quern went fast and furious and that very night came mysing the searover and slew frodi and all his men and carried off the quern and so frodis peace ended the maidens the searover took with him and when he got on the high seas he bade them grind salt so they ground and at midnight they asked him if he had not salt enough but he bade them still grind on so they ground till the ship was full and sank mysing maids and mill and all and thats why the sea is salt perhaps of all the tales in this volume none could be selected as better proving the toughness of a traditional belief than no ii which tells why the sea is salt the norse had no idea of that devil whom the monks magiclanterned till he grew so large as to be all but omnipresent and omniscient as for hel she was the goddess who kept the nine keys of the place of death where all went who were unlucky enough not to die laughing on the field of battle waning for odin in some of these stories of our philologist the heathen clement and antiquity is singularly perceptible as in  the master smith where the hero thinks he has done a silly thing in quarrelling with the deviland in not a pin to choose between them where peter the husband of the silly goody goes about begging for alms from door to door in paradise the transformations of men into beasts are numerousas in the greek and roman stories which perhaps are of scythian origin the werewolf or manwolf is a frequent character in the old legends but the favourite beast for norse transformation is the bearwhose strength and sagacity made him an object of wonder and respect with the sturdy woodmen of norway who even now think the finns and lapps can assume the shape of animals the lapps disowning this magical power still call the bear grandfather look on him with awe beg his pardon as they cut his throat bring him back to their tent with apologetic ceremonies declaring that  grandfather whom they have killed had the strength of ten men and the wit of twelve greylegs wolf is a kindlygrateful beast in the old storiesand the horses save their masters out of peril and bear them to fortune the dog makes no great figurebut the goat occasionally being sacred to thor appears in force and with supernatural attributes the trolls seem to have been more pucklike and malignant than the giants they were weaker and therefore more malicious they seem to have devoted their lives to injure man and mans works sometimes they are represented as thieves and cannibals they dwell in the spins of the fells in the dried pineforest in dens to which they carry off the children of men helpless lads and beautiful maidens they guard the riches and sit in clefts of the rocks surrounded by threadneedle streets full of gold and silver they haunt the dark forest by day and feast by night to see the sun was fatal to themif once it looked them full in the face they burst in sheer spite fear horror and disgust about all these storiescrystalsided and sparkling with fancies rare and fantastic as the shapes that icicles assume  there is a bluff honesty refreshing as the rough wind that chills one minute and the next sends the warm blood in a red gush to the buffeted cheek hindu stories are tropically overlaid with imagery the arabs are keen and bright as their sabres and damascened with tropes and episodes the german are simple hearty and full of kindly humour the swedish are stiffer and more matteroffact but the norse are full of birdmusic and have a fragrance about them of wild flowers and the aromatic pineforest the men they paint are norsedaring fellows who die making the best of it fighting with the last inch of sword and after thattill the hand is lopped off they speak bluntly but never pervert morality or deny the true principles of right and wrong they delight to sketch the neglected and snubbed genius the younger brother who is what the norse call the coalbiter who broods over the firethinking but doing nothingwho is the drudge and fag of the familywho basks in the quiet selfconsciousness of hidden strength and who at last uprises like david to slay the philistine or rather to tame the magic horse ride up the slippery glass hill and win the princess though good the brave and the true are always praised this shows the just moral standard of though norse writer as for the women they are not very strongly drawn  but then they are generally bright good tender and helpfulforgetting themselves in their eagerness to help others as dr dasent says of the heroine justly   when she goes down thc well after the unequal match against her stepsister in spinning bristles against bax she steps tenderly over the hedge milks the cow shears the sheep reueves the boughs of the appletreeall out of the natural goodness of her heart when she is sent to fetch water from the well she washes and brushes and even kisses the loathsome head she bebeves what her enemies say even to her own wrong and injury she sacrifices all that she holds most dear and at last even herself because she is made to believe that it is her brothers wish and so on her too the good powers smile she can understand and profit by what the little birds say she knows how to choose the right casket and at last after many trials all at once the scene changes and she receives a glorious reward while the wicked stepmother and her ugly daughter meet with a just fate nor is another female character less tenderly drawn in bacon grizzlebeard no v where we bee the proud haughty princess subdued and tamed by natural affection into a faithful loving wife we sympathise with her more than with the patient grizzel of the poets who is in reality too good for her story has no relief while in bacon grizzlebeard we begin by being angry at the princesss pride we are glad at the retribution which overtakes her but we are gradually melted at her sufferings and hardships when she gives up all for the beggar and follows him we burst into tears with her when she exclaims  oh the beggar and the babe and the cabin and we rejoice with her when the prince says  here is the beggar and there is the babe and so let the cabin burn away there is something in very truth inimitable about these storiesas for instance the yankee vein of lying in the boots who made the princess say  thats a storywhich is a narrative of a witty younger son who is promised the hand of an exaggerating princess if he can make her express her wonder at his yarns about others as the gutnt who had no heart in his body there is an inexhaustible vein of imagination which even the  arabian nights though fuller of colour cannot rival in this as in so many of the norse stories there is a younger son who from natural kindness of heart on his way to other adventures helps neglected animals who in their turn aid him in moments of emergencya kindly moral not unuseful in its way he feeds a halfstarved raven slopes a salmon stranded on a shallow into deeper waterand gives his old horse to feed a wolf who in gratitude leads him to the giants house at this cannibals house he finds a princess who promises to aid him in killing the giant her masterbut the difficulty is that he does not carry his heart life about with him and keeps it a secret where it is hidden the faithful couple look everywhere for the giants heartunder the doorsill in the cupboardeverywhere but in vain like samson he will not betray his secret to dalilah till after much treacherous wheedling and pressing at last the very foolish monster confesses that far away in a lake lies an island on that island stands a church in that church is a well in that well swims a duck in that duck there is an egg and in that egg his heart like the house that jack built these stories run round this sort of wheel and back again off goes boots the coalbiter the wolf carries him to the island the raven flies to the tower for the churchkeys the salmon fetches the egg from the well where the guardianduck had dropped it he squeezes it the giant screams and begs for mercy 500 miles off boots treacherously makes him under a tacit promise turn six brothers of his back from stone to fleshthen breaks the egg and the giant dies of course the story ends with a wedding and with the usual quip which has drawn down thousands of peals of laughter if they have not done feasting why they are still at it  popular tabs

the children are likely to give this book a very hearty welcome it consists of a series of the most delightful fairy tales from norway that land where the supernatural still lingers some of course are very old friends and have been read in the pages of hans anderssen grimm and ferrault but even they have a flavour of the north as if the author had gathered the variants from the lips of his neighbours and the translator deserves congratulation on the success with which his work is done he does not always attain the same level but more than once his rendering is divinely felicitous we might take  the lad with the beer keg  as an example and but for its length would quote it in justification of praise that may seem extravagant the subject itself is a singular mixture of the gruesome the humorous and the fantastical but the story is related as all fairy tales should be in the matteroffact unconcerned supremely natural style that pays no heed to the auditors reflection any more than to the credibility of the story god the devil and death come after the beer in the intimate and familiar yet not irreverent manner in which we can imagine they used to figure in an easter play or a christmas mumming and the racy colloquialism is maintained without recourse to slang or its equivalent the english is very pure as well as being simple and familiar we have alluded only to one story but dozens might be quoted in many the usages of modern life are introduced into the stories in a manner that seems to show that the norwegians believe as sincerely in trolls and fairies as ever they did nor would it be fair to omit from mention the very clever illustrations they are the original pictures made by three norwegian artistse werenskiold t kittelsen and 0 sinding it might perhaps be objected that they are too clever and original for children but the book is likely to be often referred to and a picture is none the worse for being able to bear a third or a fourth scrutiny nor does it after all demand a very mature judgement to recognise the character that beams from the three troll faces on p 15 or the brightness and humour in nearly every cut the book deserves the very highest

her arm and stretched out her lingers that she might catch it that the ball fell upon the ground by the side of her and rolled staightxvays into the xvater the princess xvas frightened and looked after it but the ball kept sinking and the brook xvas so deep that she could not see the bottom of it and xvhen it had entirely disappeared then began the maiden to weep and lament bitterly saying  oh had i but my beautiful golden ball 1 xvould gixe every thing else for it my clothes my jewels my pearls nay even my golden crown itself scarcely had she thus spoken before a frog put its thick head out of the xvater and said  princess xvhy mournest thou so pitifully   ah said she  hoxv can you help me you ugly frog  aly golden hall has fallen into the brook the frog continued k thy clothes thy

in thu water with its own kind perhaps however it may be able to get me my ball again thus thinking she said  well bo it so only give me my golden hall again and it shall bo as you wish and when she had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch platsch  plitsch platsch  up the marble steps and when it got to the top of them it knocked at the door and cried out  princess dear open the door  she immediately ran to the door to see who was there and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my golden ball out of the water for me and in return i promised him that he should be my companion  for i never thought that he could leave the water but now he is out of it and will come in here to nie just at this minute the frog knocked a second time and cried  princess dear pray oxii thc door and think ot what you promised mc when yesterday i did restore  the pretty solden ball to thee princes dear pray open the door then said the king  if thou didst so promise him thou must keep thy promise and open the door so she went and opened the door and in hopped the frog close to her feet until it reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep bitterly for she was afraid of the cold frog for she could not bear the thoughts of touching it and now it was to sleep in her nice clean little bed but the king gave her an angry look and said  what thou hast promised thou art bound to perform and the frog must be thy associate so there was no help for it whether she liked it or not she was obliged to take the frog with her but in her heart she was very maliciously disposed against him  so she took iiim betwixt her two lingers and carried him up and when she laid herself down ia bed instead of lifting tue frog into bed she threw it xvith all

that we really begrudge mr thoms the space that he occupies with his very erudite comparisons and analogies between the various fairy tales of all nations the more especially as these fictions must be nearly alike modified of course by the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to compare he would not miss an unconscious imitation of some half dozen already extant in as many communities indeed so ample is fairy lore that you cannot lie out of it any more than a man can swear

B7324,['6853911'],  the myths of the north american indians redskin tales by louis spence frai illustrated george g harrap and co 7s 6d net a collection of stories told by north american indians is here presented mr spence does not inform us how he became possessed of them but one is inclined to think that they have been gathered by him from the books which appear in the bibliography at the end of the present volume these sources differ very much in their value as evidence s e they range from the uncritical histories and travels of writers like adair and the bartrams in the eighteenth century through the interminable works of bancroft and catlin in the next down to the modern and more scientific collections of brinton curtin and boas and the acta of the smithsonian institute and of the many transatlantic anthropological societies the tales are here brought together without references to their origin or mode of selection save that they are arranged under the names of the various tribes or nations such as algonquins iroquois sioux and pawnees the stories thus chosen do not give us a very high idea of the red indian imagination hardly any of them are myths in the sense in which max muller used the word although in the case of hiawatha to which mr spence devotes a page or two he follows mr horatio hale in declaring that the whole story has grown up by disease of language round the history ot a real chief whose name happened to signify  he who seeks the wampum belt most of them are totem tales plainly invented ex post facto to explain why different tribes families or individuals came to be called by the names of animals a very few rise a little above this level as in the socalled cherokee tale of the origin of medicine where the animals once the friends of mankind grow angry at being hunted for food and call down diverse diseases on man who is only saved by the plants overhearing the plot and agreeing that each of them shall furnish a remedy for one of the diseases named the great majority however are merely wondertales in which magic power is ascribed to man and the lower animals alike and which mainly differ from the fairytales of our infancy by their pointlessness and incoherence a fair instance of this is the iroquois story of the stone giantess who settled herself in the wigwam of a hunter so as to escape from her cruel husband after a time the stone giant came in search of her when the hunter by her instructions struck him first on the arms and then on the nape of the neck killing him when the time comes for the hunter to return to his village the stone giantess also returns to her own people with the remark that now she has nothing to fear one would feel greater interest in these stories if one could be convinced of their originality so far is this from being the case that many of them seem to owe a good deal to wellknown european asiatic or african sources the sioux story of the beloved son who cannot return from the submarine land of the shades because he has eaten of food there is too strongly reminiscent of persephone and the pomegranate seed for the change of sex and locality to throw us off the scent so too in another sioux tale the exalting of the rabbit into an animal of extreme intelligence and cunning seems to smack of the negro stories enshrined in uncle remus and another attributed to the same tribe of a horse who warns his master of his brotherinlaws plot against his life is quite as near to the egyptian tale of two brothers as that of joseph and potiphars wife which most biblical critics now assign to that source the swanmaidens whose feather dresses are stolen by the hero are found here as in the norse literature and the arabian nights as is the lohengrin legend of the magic bark drawn by swans some of these parallels seem to have struck mr spence himself as when he draws the readers attention to the harrying of hades read harrowing of hell and declares that the algonquin tale of the crowwoman and the wolf bears a striking resemblance to spensers una and the lion if the tales given in this book have any connecting or distinctive thread it is the belief which appears in most of them in a land above the sky inhabited by spirits or supernatural beings resembling men who take an interest not always benevolent in the affairs of their mortal counterparts here again one would like to know if there is any trace of such a belief existing before the visit of the christian missionaries mr spences book is prettily illustrated by coloured plates of considerable artistic merit and is equipped with an introduction in which he deals with the origin of the north american indians he is we fancy right in implying that man is not indigenous to the american continent but came there from asia by a landbridge now submerged his identification of the modern esquimaux first with the earliest inhabitants and then with the skraelings of the norse sagas is more open to question but may pass muster we can hardly agree with him however when he tells us ex cathedra and without authority quoted that the fetish is in short a mascota luckbringer and that the mythologies of the red man are infinitely more rich in creative read creation and deluge myths than those of any other race in the two hemispheres we wonder whether he has ever heard of the sumerian cosmogonies whence perhaps all later ones have sprung,folklore

perhaps not much new matter to be gathered from this amusing compilation it is no slight acquisition however to county literature to have such biographical curiosities collected within the compass of two handy volumes and new interest is imparted to the subject by though literary skill displayed by mr baringgould in handling his materials he is very happy too in his attempts to reproduce on pajier the dialect of that part of the west riding with which he seems best acquainted among the less widelyknown characters whose history has been unearthed by mr baringgould is dr john hildrop rector of wath near ripon about the middle of last century he was a man of obscure birth who had worked himself up in the world by his talents aud great conversational powers the story of his presentation to the living is well worth repeating lord ailesbury the patron surprised hildrop with the offer of it at a time when he was regarding himself as utterly hopeless helpless and friendless amazed at such generosity he waited upon his lordship to express all decent and grateful acknowledgments but was roughly though goodnaturedly cut short with  sir pray spare your speeches and keep your compliments to yourself you arc under no manner of obligation to me for had i known a moro deserving man in england than yourself you should not have had it dr hildrop published anonymously many volumes and detached essays little known at the present time though some of them were clever and witty enough in their own day to be attributed to swift some very good anecdotes of this gifted man are told in these pages memoirs of remarkable clergymen indeed fill up no inconsiderable space in this enumeration of yorkshire oddities the living of leaseholme in the north riding was held by three successive generations of the wikeses for upwards of a century all of them men of great literary talents popular preachers eccentric in character and much given to the bottle the first of the family who held the living was presented to it by charles h not for any theological attainments which he possessed but as a reward to an old soldier of his father for wikes when a captain in the army of charles i had received a wound in his leg which incapacitated him from further active service and no more economical method of pensioning him could bo suggested another instance of rewarding bravery in arms by promotion in the church we have met with in the case of samuel drake vicar of pontefract after the restoration whose chief qualifications for though dignity of doctor of divinity appeared to bo judging by the certificates of his acquaintances his having served in the marching army or the garrisons of newark and pontefract throughout the whole civil war one of though most amusing portions of though book is the account of jemmy hirst a native of rawcliffe who used to wear a broadbrimmed hat of lambskin fully nine feet in circumference a waistcoat and breeches of many colours and yellow boots instead of pictures he would hang the walls of his room with bits of old iron and coils of rope in one place an old fryingpan in another a rusty sword a piece of a chair or a jug the eccentricities of this man having reached the ears of george the third the king desired to have an interview with him  the following report of the conversation which passed has been preserved his majesty  asked jemmy how he liked london  i like it weel enow answered the oddity   but i hadnt any idea afore yesterday and today there were sae niony fools in it   indeed  said the king  you pay us a very poor compliment mr hirst i did not know that we were so badly olf for wisdom in london perhaps that is an article in such demand in yorkshire that thero is none to spare for cockneys   why ill tell thee how it were said jemmy  when i come into t toun yesterday and to thy house today the streets were full o crowds of folks gathered as thick as owt to see me just a cause i happd to ho dressed different frae other folk  and as i were waiting out yonder i t forechamber there were one o thy sarvants burst out laughing at me but i reckon i spoiled his ruined shirt for him and punished his impertinence one o thy sarvants was a noble duke in attendance whose loss of gravity hirst had insisted upon treating as a fit of convulsions by dashing water in his face pulling his nose and using other pretended endeavours to bring him round again strict historical accuracy even in the humble matter of dates is hardly to be looked for in such a work  unless indeed we are to accept some of these characters as greater natural oddities than mr baringgould seems to bc awtare of himself among facts related of  nancy nicholson the termagant it is hard to believe that she was born in 1718 and died in 1854 aged sixtynine that she wrote a certain letter when seventyfour years old and that important events in her career happened on february 29 1845 an eminent pedestrian we are informed walked from canterbury to london

passage capt r c temple who is himself doing good work in northern india as a collector of native folklore wrote to the author suggesting that he should make a collection of  those unwritten stories which old women in india recite to little children in the evenings the result is the present volume which forms m worthy supplement to the old deccan days and the indian fairy talest those two admirable collections of similar stories for which we are indebted to miss mary frere and miss maive stokes some of the twoandtwenty tales which it comprises or at least certain of their episodes will be recognised as old friends by readers who are conversant with indian popular fiction but there are others which will be generally considered as novel while all of them offer many features of interest as a specimen of the stories of the first class may be taken that of phakir chand the most interesting part of this evidently composite narrative is that which tells how a faithful retainer saved his lord from various dangers was turned into an image of stone when he explained why he had done so and was ultimately restored to life thanks to the sacrifice of the grateful lords child the story is that of  faithful john grimm no 6 der getreue johannes of rama and luxman  old deccan days no 5 and of zo ouorvo basiles pentamerone no 39 in the variant related to miss frere the sacrifice of the child at the end has been singularly modified the infant is not put to death it accidentally touches the petrified retainer who immediately comes to life the idea is pretty and poetic but not the least in accordance withthe sentiment of the story in its original form in basiles adaptation the sacrifice is preserved a grateful king killing his two children in order to bring to life the marble statue which had been his trusty brother the innocent victims are then resuscitated by the kings fatherirlaw who is a conjuror in the folktales of bengal the child in question is  cut into two and the marble image is besmeared with its blood the faithful retainer comes to life but the death of the child weighs upon his mind at length it occurs to him to ask his wife to intercede with the goddess kali on the infants behalf she does so and the prayer is granted the story of  the indigent brahman  is one of the tales which has become as familiar in europe as in asia it is told here of a brahman who was very poor his gains were considerable when marriages were celebrated or funeral ceremonies were performed but as his parishioners did not marry every day neither did they die every day he found it difficult to make the two ends meet he was a zealous worshipper of durga the consort of siva and  on no day did he either drink water or taste food till he had written in red ink the name of durga at least one hundred and eight times at last the grateful goddess presented him with a magic pipkin from which sweetmeats flowed when it was stolen from him durga gave him another from which hostile demons issued who compelled the thief to give back what he had abstracted in this story we have an intelligible reason given for the presentation of the supernatural utensil the counterpart of whioha magic wallet or knapsack or the likeis often somewhat capriciously bestowed on the heroes of similar european folktales the story of prince sobur no 8 contains two incidents which have been rendered familiar to the west by the tales of  beauty and the beast and  the blue bird a merchant sailing to a foreign port found that his ship remained motionless until he complied with the whim of his youngest daughter who had ordered him to bring back for her from foreign parts a mysterious substance named sobur this turned out to be a magical fan with a lookingglass in it when the fan was shaken by the girl a prince appeared whom she married her sisters became envious so u they broke several bottlesjreduced the broken pieces into fine powder and scattered it profusely on the bed the prince suspecting no danger laid himself down in the bed but he had scarcely been there two minutes when he felt acute pain through his whole system for the fine bottlepowder had gone through every pore of his body in european variants of the story the fairy prince is usually wounded by knives or razors set in the window through which he was wont to wing his way the story is almost identical with that of  the fan prince the twentyfifth of miss stokess indian fairy tales it is interesting to compare the story of the evil eye of sani no 6 with such western tales about bad luck as the sicilian story of sfurtuna pitre no 86 sani the god of bad luck once had a dispute with lakshmi the goddess of good luck as to which was the higher in rank the question was referred to a man named sribatsa who decided it in favour of lakshmi thereupon sani persecuted sribatsa for the space of three years in no 21  the field of bones the excellent ttory told so well in the vetala tales of the four young men learned but not vise who brought to life a tiger which proceeded to devour its imprudent resuscitators is narrated at considerable length but in such a manner as to render it pointless in no ll which records the adventures of two thieves there is an incident closely resembling part of the russian story of the miser who objected to repaying a kopeck which he had borrowed and who pretended to be dead in order to escape from his creditor the similarity is too great to be accounted for as an accidental coincidence no 9 which describes the origin of opium appears to be an imitation of a story well known in europe about  the origin of wine and the opening is copied from another familiar tale a sage transformed a rat several times until it became a queen named postomani or the poppyseed lady the queen eventually tumbled into a well and was drowned from her remains sprang a tree called after her pesto that is the poppy tree and from it opium was subsequently made those persons who partake of opium share the natures of the various beings into which the animal which finally became a queen was successively transformed becoming  mischievous like a rat fond of milk like a cat quarrelsome like a dog filthy like an ape savage like a boar and hightempered like a queen among the stories of a less familiar aspect may be mentioned some of those about ghosts no 14 may be taken as a specimen close to the house of a married brahman stood a tree  on the boughs of which lived a ghost of the kind called sankchinni this ghost one night seized the brahmans wife thrust her into a hole in the tree put on her clothes and took her place in the brahmans house for some time the substitution was not found out but one day the brahmans mother requested her supposed daughterinlaw to bring a vessel from some distance and the ghost unconsciously stretched her hand to several yards distance and brought it in a trice for indian ghosts it seems  can lengthen or shorten any limb of their bodies on another occasion the old lady on visiting the kitchen  found that her daughterinlaw was not using any fuel for cooking but had thrust into the oven her foot which was blazing brightly so an exorcist was sent for who lighted a piece of turmeric under the nose of the suspected wife now this was an infallible test as no ghost whether male or female can put up with the smell of burnt turmeric the result was that the ghost screamed aloud and fled the exorcist followed and began to belabour her with his slippers  then the ghost said with a strong nasal accentfor all ghosts speak through the nosethat she was a sankchinni and in fact confessed all her misdeeds the real wife was restored to her home and the ghost after having promised to do no more harm to the brahman or his family  was again shoebeaten and then dismissed no 15 contains the narrative of a ghost who behaved better an utterly indigent brahman induced by the promise of a large reward ventured to visit by night a tree which was the abode of a number of very irritable ghosts they were on the point of tearing him to pieoes when he was saved by the interference of a brahraadaitya the ghost of a brahman who had died unmarried moved by the brahmadaityas expostulations the other ghosts placed themselves at the service of the brahman and soon rendered him a rich man when his corn was ripe they

grounds indeplently of the mythological and philological interest attached to the dear existence of these stones this collection is valuable for another reason in it is preserved authentic remnants of pure scotch gaelic in the spoken lic as it flow exists there are three elements the irish gaelic of the chi bithe printed religious gaelic of later times which dates after he f  anntion ad the pure scotch gaelic of the morven and tine weurchan districts of ar leshire and of the western islands which b lenained uncorrupted by the english idioms that exist in perthshire d the lrishisns elsewhere the pure vernacular language is more perfectly werved in legendary tales and in poetry orally handed down than in written rw into which foreign idioms must gradually creep hence the value of p cl pupular ales as these and of such poetry as that of the uncultivated d3 published recently in the book of the dean of lismore it is another qesti how far it is desirable to foster the gaelic language or to let it die vttif it is to be preserved there can be no doubt on this point that it ought tobe preserved as far as possible in its original purity in these ballads nd stories handed down from generation to generation by oral tradition perfection of the original dialect is a necessary ingredient mir campbell beu collected these tales from the mouths of the speakers and thus he has done good service in preserving his favourite language pure and uncorrupted on these various grounds there can be but one verdict upon the three first lous of mr campbells book every one must thank him for his work and congratulite him upon the result of his undertaking it is a disagreeable task to find fault with what has given us so much pleasure but it is the duty of the reviewer to state his conviction honestly and it is more satisfactory for the author to see such a conviction expressed h toreadso many lines of undiscriminating laudation miscalled criticism the publication of the fourth volume is to be regretted twothirds of this rolume are occupied by the resuscitation of the ossianic controversy most people considered that it was buried and left to the oblivion of its grave it was not beautiful in its life in its resurrection it is not more imposing mr campbell raises the dead body but he fails to galvanise it into existence not one man in a hundred who will read his book can now feel the smallest interest in that exhausted controversy and if any interest was excited it would not be satisfied with the manner in which mr campbell reopens the discussion he is indeed an easy and agreeable controversialist neither flippant nor sarcastic but pleasant bantering and on this subject sensible but he is unsatisfactory he does not grasp the question thoroughly or handle it vigorously he is sadly inconsequent and inconsistent he begins with clearness and logical precision but soon falls away into digression and rambling desultory writing the reader is left much where he was he closes th book and has learned nothing similar accusations must be brought against mir campbells mythological fragments and his plea for gaelic there is throughout both these portions of his book a want of scholarlike thoroughness the argumentation is feeble sometimes frivolous and the whole discussion is pervaded by a superficiality that is the reverse of satisfactorv the following passage will show that this accusation is well founded if it was important for the interests of the state to found a chair of sanscrit which nobody speaks surely there ought to be some means of learning gaelic devised for england where a large section of the people speak the language sti this is unworthy of mr campbell on the same principle he would abolish all the chairs of latin and greek in the different universities and would establish in their place professorships of the language of the japanese and the maories it is of a piece with these two passages which at best are trifling and superficial iny one who knows gaelic can easily put a meaning on numbers of italian ames for example monte soracte monadh sorachan mountain peak or hi1lo is a small peaked mountain standing alone near rome monte afppennino mlonadh na beinne the mountain tract of the hill country is at last as descriptive in gaelic as italian and the sounds are very like still  english is a  bar to the advancement of proprietors if they cannot speak those who pay their rents and it is the want of english not the pos ion of gaelic which retards the advance of those who seek employment ere english is spoken so highland proprietors should learn gaelic and teach rlish gaelic is no bar to advancement it did not clog the steps of the lord ricegeneral or his brother the ambassador or of the vicechancellor or of us of other men of mark whose learning included gaelic it has not ighed in my slower race through life and it gave me a stock of sounds which in other languages and which an english tongue can rarely pronounce wt do not fec fn controvert the position advanced in this last passage fallacy implied in the use of the word  advancement  must be plain to r campbell himself when a man of mr campbells ability allows hims to write on a great question in this very inefficient manner his best iise is that his celtic proclivities at times get the better of his reason in pa for gaelic and in his idealisation of the highland costume on which etio we lo not propose to enter his celticism becomes ungovernable otally forg ets his acceptation and assertion of the aryan theory of lan and instead of looking upon gaelic as an offshoot of aryan he appears consider aryan as an offshoot of gaelic he gets upon his hobby and it away with hiii it is as uncontrollable as jains niare to whom the sea landare all one it gives its front to the sea and its back to the  and son carries him beyond his depth and leaves him hopelessly at it i a pity that this volume has been published in it mr campbell up then questions which he ought either to have left untouched or to worked out with much more thorough elaboration any one who has the masterly dissertation on subjects similar to those here treated at the ecftcent of the dean of lismores book by mnr w f skene will rle the difference between the vigorous writing and forcible reoning e ane and the colloquial ineffectivenems of the other  popular tales of the west hiejhlands orally collected with a translation bv j f campbell vols iii and iv edmonston  douglas we have two more volumes of mr campbells contributions to the existing mass of celtic literature they will be perused perhaps with some disappointment by those who received with alacrity and pleasure his former two volumes and readily appreciated the hearty nationality and good humour of the collector it is however in the nature of things that a second gleaning should not offer such rich results as the first the first of these new volumes contains mythological tales fables and ossianic ballads and the last is a volume of dissertations by mr campbell on the ossianic controversy gaelic poetry british traditions highland dress ornaments and mythology of the ossianic portion a good deal of the interest has been forestalled by the recent publication of the dean of lismores book and other ossianic publications nevertheless such versions as mr campbell has collected will be of use to the celtic scholar the compiler however entertains the ambition of setting the ossianic controversy at rest once and for ever but in this he mistakes his capabilities  as a collector he has done good service but he has too little of the critical faculty to render his opinions of much value most highland gentlemen imagine that nobody but a highlander is competent to pass judgement on their literature or on the genuineness of a certain portion of it but this ian entire mistake the mere possession of a knowledge of highland gaelic is of little moment for the purpose in view with whatever facility a man may speak gaelic that in itself is no evidence of his capacity to pass judgement on the genuineness of a single ossianic poem this will be apparent to any one who considers how few englishmen well read in english literature would be competent to pronounce a verdict on any newlydiscovered poem said to be by gower or chaucer how many englishmen who have not made such things their study are there at the present day who would discover rowleys poems to be forgeries from a mere inspection of their diction  indeed the general critic unacquainted with gaelic who has compared the poetic evolutions of thought and sentiment in other languages ii far more likely to come to a right conclusion i such matters than the mere speaker of gaelic but the critic av ho is now required to take th matter in hand is the scientific philologist who shall be neither a scotchman an irishman a welshman nor a breton at least in feeling and prejudice but a celt one who shall take up th whole of the literature of the celtic races and edit their legendary and traditional relics with true impartiality philosophic insight scrupu lous comparison and broadness of view suojb an investigation

day capable of embracing the whole range of celtic literature and marshalling the literary treasures of its various dialects in due order and showing the affinities which subsist between the different

peasant of myvyr who unassisted by patronage devoted his life to the preservation of the literature of his country he came up t london a poor boy engaged as a clerk in somecity establishment and after forty years f selfdenial with the accumulations of his hard won scanty earnings published the myvyrian archaeology at his own cost in 1801 and 1807 and it is from this repertory that sharon turner was enabled to draw his welsh legends and bardic poems in the first volume of his history where they first attracted the attention of m villemarque it was a work which might havebeen done by a king an institution or a society ofthe noble and the learned but it was accomplished and scrupulously accomplished by a poor welsh peasant nor must we forget the great service rendered to the literature of her country by lady charlotte guest whose three splendid volumes of the mabinogion with their fine paper type and steel engravings form a direct contrast in costliness of production tethe three modest and closelyprinted quartos cf poor owen jones the mabinogion is however also an invaluable treasure and there are the favourite topics of the most celebrated troubadours of mediaeval europe to be found in all their primitive beauty and simplicity for the stories of arthur aud guinevere of geraint nnd the rest of the knights of the round table of the famous  parceval le gallois of the  chevalier au lionall these are pure welsh li breton ont fait les lats says a poetess of the thirteenth century andy without any disparagement to sir thomas mallory or mr tennyson few can have any notiaia of the primitive beauty of these old tales till they read them in  the mabinogion it is curious however that the mabinogion clas of story seems to have no points of contact with taliesin and the bardic literature yet the welsh popular tales have certain undoubted analogies with the gaelic legends arthur and guinevere for example have a certain likeness to finn or fion and grainne his wife and lancelot and diarmaid have a resemblance for in both canes the beautiful warrior is the cause of the infidelity of the queen and in both eases he is more tempted than tempting a resemblance has also been attempted to be traced between oisein or ossian and taliesin hut on this as on many other points criticism will suspend its opinion till philology has done it work with more scrupulous severity  the literary iaier popular tales of the west highlands orally collected i with a translation by j f campbell two volumes edinburgh edmonston and douglas a better book of its kind than this no country possesses dr dasents norse tales are of high value and the relation of scandinavian mythology or legend to our own folk lore as well as to the traditions of the east is very close but gaelic of the british islands interests us even more than the traditions of the norse and mr campbell while he takes in his work as a collector all the interest of a philologist and shows a complete sense of the value of literal accuracy in placing the old popular tales of the west highland gaels within reach of all students of literature proves himself by the manner of his introduction to be not only a scholar but a man of genius his vi porous and graphic english and his curious felicity of illustration are of a sort very seldom to be met with in asciation with the scholarly exactitude for which these tolumes are conspicuous it is a very great addition to the value of the work that not only are the stories taken in gaelic from the lips of west highlanders collated compared and when proved by the form of their frequent occurrence to be true traditions of the gael set down in the closest of translations all the closer for being also nervous english but the gaelic itself has been taken down and printed hector urquhart gamekeeper at ardkinglas on loch fyne and hector maclean schoolmaster at ballygrant in islay have been mr campbells chief helpers in this part of his work a body of gaelic literature is thus taken from the lips of the people and fixed before the ministers and schoolmasters shall have silenced the last reciters of tradition that has lived through generation after generation the old days of telling tales or sgeulachd by the highland fireside are even now passing away as hector urquhart depoes i knew an old tailor who used to ted a new tale every night during his stay in the village and another an old shoemaker who with ilis large stock of stories about ghosts and fairies used to frighten us so much that we scarcely dared pass the neighbouring churchyard on our way home it was also the custom when an aodia or stranger cele brated for his store of tales came on a visit to the village for us young and old to make a rush to the house where he passed the night and choom our seats some on beds some on forms and others on three iokestd i 5insulto gh now ta  ju u i ha o whn a rfaed acor ca om to persan in the gtheave the goodman 1 th e uually

riddles in the solving of which all zn the hoos had to tax their ingenuity if one of the party put a riddle which asnot osved thatnight he went home with the title of king of riddles besides this there was usually in such gatherings a discussion about the fei which comes from fantamdh giant the fantaibh were a body of men who volunteered to defend their country from the invasions and inroads of the danes and norwegians or loclusia fiu who was always called king of the fein was the strongest man amongst them and no person was admitted into the company who was les in height than he however much taller i remember the old black shoemaker telling us one night that fiunk had a tooth which he consulted as an oracle upon all important occasions he had but to touch this tooth and whatever he wanted to know was at once revealed to him the above is all i can at present readily call to mind of the way in which the evenings were spent in the highlands thirty or forty years ago the minister came to the village in 1830 and the schoolmaster 1 soon followed who put a stop in our village to such gatherings and in their place we were supplied with heavier tasks than listening to the old shoemakers fairy tales from that period till i collected the few in this collection i have not heard a tale recited on going to visit my friends last summer i expected that i would get some old tales among them but i found that the most of the old men who used to relate them in my young days had died and the few who were then alive of them were so old that they bad lost their memories so that i only got but a trifle to what i expected it was doing no small service to literature to save these tales from perishing giving them to the english student in his own language to the gael and the student of gaelic in the exact words of the teller with the tellers name and habitat assigned to every one as precisely as a botanist would name the habitat of any plant in his collection mr ijrquhart in the letter we have quoted speaks of tales of the fein or fenii the first of our volunteers the irish and scotch gaels have many of these legends in common for all tradition bears witness to the close association in old timesin the third century if we may accept the date commonly assigned to fionnbetween ireland and the western isles of scotland and that mainland of alban the alpland or highland from which we have derived the name of albion the fein were the first of british volunteers sworn say the irish legends to defend their shores against invasion and each bound to fight nine men of any other nation who should challenge them their marvellous qualifications have been often told oisin ossian the son of fionn commanded the more ambitious of the two clans into which it split and he according to the book of hoath was sole survivor from the battle of gabhra in the year 296 he could live therefore to have his dialogue with st patrick and to be unwillingly converted by the saint quite apart from the extinct controversy about macphersons ossianie work which is now generally admitted to have been a sentimental rendering of gaelic traditions into a form suited to the english humour of his day all that can now be collected of traditions of the fein has a strong interest three years ago a weak effort was made by mr j h simpson in poems of oiain bard of erin to present to the public these traditions from the irish side his book included six or eight fenian traditions orally collected from among the mayo peasantry and incomplete and unsatisfactory as it was it has in the absence of a better certain literary value we trust that mr campbells example will now stimulate some irish scholar to do for the gaels of his own island what has been done so thoroughly for those of the western highlands giving as mr campbell has given precise authority for all that he prints and the gaelic of the storyteller as well as his own translation mr campbell himself with curiosity strongly excited and much baulked during a visit to the isle of man asks for a manx man who will fix also the legends of the manx gaels before in these days of schoolmasters who consider it their duty to discountenance all oldwives tales the oral literature that he compares aptly to the driftwood floated from a faroff world shall have been utterly destroyed we may question the speculation that can find analogies between the fairies and the lapps that will trace celtic fairy legends back to the supposed tatar tribes thinly spread over europe before the days of the great halfl historical invasions of cimmerians and goths those tribes that according to professor worsaae left their traces in the coast barrows containing only tools and weapons of shaped stone pass for the aborigines of europe who are represented in the south by the basques and in the north by the finns esths and lapps but there is ground even for that speculation which appears so fanciful and it is not so hostile as at first sight it may appear to another speculation that connects the fairy with the peri however that may be it is on this earliest period of european history that we may expect light to be thrown by an extended study of the popular traditions of all nations there can be no doubt also that this is the right time of year for a profound speculation on the fairies mr campbell who has himself spoken gaelic from his childhood went systematically upon storyhunting tours as other men engaged by other sciences set out upon botanical or geological excursions his specimens were of a kind to be got only by the skilful thus we are told how he went at easter to a highland district near the lowlands where a gamekeeper bad marked down a lot of taletellers and i was soon convinced that there was plenty of game though bard to get the difficulty may be worth some explanation for it exists elsewhere and bears on the collectior of tales everywhere highland peasants and fishermen especially those dwelling near the lowlands are shy and proud and even more peculiarly sensitive to ridicule than peasts elsewhere mauy bawc a lurking belief in the truth of the sioies whi they tell man a 3 eated castlatom tha wi ym with a better educaon will la1g at the bliet northwest the stay an the nu raw and his landuage f he should bwei enough to ventin on english and betroa his knowledge of seultachd and his creed e cannot im n that any on out of his owf clan am possibly be amused by his fivolous p sim no one ever has hitherto he sees every year a summer flood of tourists of all a ou ring through his loa sandglens but he knows as little of them as they know of him the shoal of herrings that enter loch syne know as much of the dundoer on the hialssde a londoners and highland peasants know of each other each gets an occaioial peep at the other as the deer may see the herrings capering on the locheach affeeb the other slowly but surely as the herrings do drive away the wild deer by attracting men to catch them but the want of a common language here as elsewhere keeps highlands and lowlands celt and saxon as clearly eparate as oil and water in the ame glass the first step then towards the acquisition of a story is to establish confidence it may be that the wouldbe collector sees before him a strapping lad dressed in the garb of a west country fishermana rough blue bonnet jacket and trousers he steps out and ranges up alongside the highlander glances from under his busby eyebrows and sees with his sharp grey eyes that the new comer is a stranger he looks rather like a saxon highland curiosity is strong and he longs to ask whence he comes but politeness is stronger and it would be uncivil to begin questioning at once so with a nervous kick of one foot and a quick shy glance the fisherman jerks out  its a fine day  tha n latha briagh  the day is fine replies the stranger and as he speaks the whole face and manner of his companion change as if by magic doubt and hesitation suspicion and curiosity become simple wonder his eyes and his heart open wide at the sound of his native tongue and he exclaims you have gaelic  you will take my excuse by your leave but what part of the gaeldom are you from  and then having found out all that is to be discovered the ice being broken and confidence established it oozes out gradually that the fisherman knows a story and after much persuasion he tells it while he rows the gentleman who can talk gaelic across a high land loch at parting he adds that he has only told it to please a  gael and that he would not have said one word to a gall stranger but the man who is fluent in his boat is shy and awkward when set down to repeat his story for transcribing and it is only when set with one of his neighbours whom he knows that his story is got on paper or it may be an old dame in a tall white mutch with a broad black silk band a red cloak and clean white apron she is seventy and can walk ten miles she has known all the neighbouring families for generations if you can claim cousinship with any she is your friend but she will praise the ancestors and tell of the adventures of bob roy the gregoracl the last of the freebooters but mary can you say murachag and mionachag huch my dear that is an ursgeul that is nonsense the good being bless you i knew your grandmother etc etc so one must rest contented with the fact that old mary knows one tale and probably many more which a weeks persuasion might perhaps extract and so forth the tales when got are often rude but sometimes excellent even to the spoilt modem taste the riddles in which celts delighted as much as the early anglosaxons are singularly pointless but some of the fables are as neat as man can wish nothing for example can be better than the fable of the fox who sat on his tail for a gossip with the cock in the farmyard and asked him how many tricks did your  mother teach you    three he said  how many have you been taughttwo or three thousand i know one that is capital i can shut my left eye and scream so as to wake a parish i can do that said the cock so he shut his left eye and began to crow with all his might the fox on the blind side of him snapped him up and was running away when the farmers wife looking out of doors cried iheigh fox stop that is  my cock tell herthe cocks yours whispered the victim so the fox opening his mouth cried to the dame the cock is mine  then it was his no longer out of a tolerably thorough study of the folk lore of all nations that has based on works like this but to which few so good as this are likely to contribute a most interesting and important book has to be written we have in these tales variations upon bluebeard and upon known stories of almost every land thus the incident in the battle of the birds of the giants beautiful daughter hid in a tree top over a well we read last with all its details as an incident in one of jacob ayrers plays a german translation of the english play from which shakespeare may have taken the first notion of the tempest  popular tales of the west highlasdst  the northwestern perts of scotland says an old dutch geographer are inhabited by irishmen the southeastern parts by englishmen this distinction one of the highest importance when these words were written is now of little practical value and is hence often overlooked intercourse between the two races to which he refrrs having almost obliterated the differences between them it must be clearly apprehended however by any one who would understand aright the history of scotland or the subjects discussed in the learned and able introduction to these volumes the scottish lowlands densely peopled by an english population were at all times permeable to the influences acting upon the civilised countries of europe every new continental school of philosophy or literature sent a wave of thought or feeling over this island which only broke when it reached the welldefined frontier of the highlands the old scottish knights who threw off the yoke of the english kings were closely connected with france and through france with all the latin countries of southern europe some of them indeed had been educated in the schools of paxis need we feel surprised then to hear that robert brace when he osted weary and travelstained by loch lomond side under the birch and the rowan trees with his mailclad followers withthomas randolph and hugh de ia hay and good sir david de berkelay read to cheer their spirits and wile away the time tales of gallantry and prowess from the pages of an old french romance a generation later and the first great poem in the english tongue recorded the exploits of the good king and his companions and told by its references to the nitingale and its use of the commonplaces of romance how much the literature of scotland had been influenced by the troveres and the troubadours the reformation burst forth in germany and forthwith appeared the evidence of a close intercourse between scotland and the low countries before the storm had reached the frontier of france the northern parliament had passed an act to prohibit  skippers  from introducing heretical books from the continent and friars were denouncing from the market places as familiar namesmartin luther that saw loon black bullinger and melanctoon a ery different state of things prevailed in the highlands there the people spoke a language unintelligible to the english of the lowlands their flinty hills attracted no foreign priesthood their old celtic institutions repelled feudalism no norman aristocracy introduced into the land the study of southern romance no highland students rose to fame at pari or padua the irishry or selvages of the highlands lived apart altogether from the traditions of the great continental world with ireland however the connexion of the highlands was intimate just as the english dialects of the people melt into each other between london and aberdeen the dialects of the erse pass gradually into each other between cork and inverness the people of the highlands ireland and the isle of man formed indeed one people the early history of the erse race is ill undertood six centuries before christ they are supposed to have reached the british islands already occupied by the welsh or british races and to have settled in ireland and northern scotland their oldest traditions throw little light however on this event they record the exploits of the brave tribes of the feene and more especially of fin mac coul thegreat hero of the race it is frm one of his epithets  miledh the warrior that the monkish chroniclers devised the story of milesius the word seene being after a similar fashion perverted into phamician the poems which record the exploits of the seene bore in some respects the same relation to the erse people that the homeric poems bore to the greeks many ments of them are yet preserved by oral tradition some have been committed to writing the gaelic poems of ossian which were formed of passae from poems of the feene have been proved to be authentic and he who now calls their genninenes in question

the persons from whom they have been gathered are housemaids nurses and old women drovers fishermen blind fiddlers and tinkers tailors and shoemak are however the principal tribuators the reason is

gatherings the sgeulachd have been set down just as they were told by mr campbell he well remarking that it would be as absurd to tamper with such relics as to gild an old copper coin or to paint the fossil bones of an ichthyosaurus one of the most striking and characteristic of these highland tales is that of i the southeast maiden told by an old fishean in the hebrides it is a tale to be found in all the european langaages it resembles an irish  fenian story taken from a very old ms there is something much akin to it in sanscrit it is a version of shortshaiks in the norse tales of dasent grimms german tales contain it its incidents appear in the classical stories of  perseus and an dromeda and hercules and hesione it is in the italian of strapanola as fortunio and in the french of the6 cabinet des fees it is in every lan guage in europe as st george and the dragon it is the story of sheep shanks  in a ms collection of lowland scotch tales made by mr peter buchan in 1847

to say he hag  set down stories told him by the egyptian priests which reappear in the high land tales k in the introduction to which we have already referred mr campbell endeavours to ascertain the date of the tales he has recorded and to ascertain whether his countrymen have derived them from other european nations or have inherited i them from old primaeval times to some it may be difficult at first eight to under stand how this is possiblean illustration may serve to explain it when an old wall was disinterred some years ago in paris a dispute arose as to its age some said it was roman others that it was medkeval  let us pull down one square ard of it said an antiquary  and i will be bound to say that you will find precise evidence of its date the wall was dragged down and in the very heart of it there was found an onamnt of the renaissance the building was proved to belong to a late period in modern history mr campbell has subjected these tales to a somewhat similar testcomparbng them with other stories to ascertain if they contain incidents which indicate the source by which they have head this island examined in this way he thinks that they have not been rived through the same channels as the old fairy tales but like the breton irman and norse tales recently published in truth ae directly derived from people in a very primitive stage of civilization here are a few of the consi rations which lead to this conclusion the hero often saves many maidens and weds them all this implies a state society at the period of their importation among the irish people

popular tales that combs were but those who have travelled among halfcivilized people understand what is meant when the knight lays his head on the ladys knee and she dresses his hair the giants may

part of the harm though of course it is an extrinsic one in the stories whlicih mr camnphell has collected for tile first time lies in thle fiamiliarity ever and anon of the incidents and characters

unlettered and unreading speaking anl hearing only its native ralic sometimes mr campbell has to seek a parallel in a novel of boccaccio or in an episode of a sanscrit epic for a passage in the narrative which he has gleaned from the lips of the blind fiddler of islav or the septuagenarian cottier of south uist it is another proof ailded to the many already existing ot the common origin of

B8739,['6731465'],  sixty folk tales from exclusively slavonic sources translated with brief introduc tiena and notes by a h wratislaw elliot stock it was the late mr ralston who introduced to the notice of the british public the wealth of slavonic folklore his work w as done in scholarly fashion and to his translations of the origical russian talesfor to these he confined himselfhe added references to variants in other collections the little book of mr j t naake of the british museum entitled slavonic fairy lalee which appeared in 1874 also possessed considerable merit and we believe has long been out of print it has been followed by the interesting collection of mr wratislaw which is the subject of our present notice there is probably a richer field of folklore among the slavs than any other european people and the eastern members of the family show greater abundance than the western mr wratislaw begins his book with the bohemian tales but these are not to be compared in interest with the russian the late karl erben cf prague whose edition forms the basis of mr wratislaws work appears to have treated his folkstories conscientiously such cannot however be siid to have been the case with bozena nemcova the once popular author who almost always improved  upon her originals from her book mr wratislaw gives one specimen mr naake and prof a chozdko have both made use of erbens bookthe latter in his conies des paysans et des patres slaves it has the advantage of a fairly copious vocabulary in which all the wordsand some of those in provincial dialects are rather obscureare fully explained but unfortunately these txplanations are in bohemiana language but little studied in western europe all honour must be given to erbtn for his conscientious treatment of the tales but we do not blame the ingenious author previously alluded to for her tamperings with the original text un fortunately she lived at a time when no one had the courage to print these simple stories as they were received from the mouth of the peasant the comparison made by mr wratislaw p 51 between one of the moravian stories and a tale in the collection of grimm reminds us that chodzko complains with apparent reason that the germans have appropriated many of the slavonic folktales perhaps however we should be nearer the truth in saying that they are the common property of the aryan peoples and indeed of the whole human race certainly many of the magyar stories and national songs look very slavonic just as their national singer till he magyarised himself was called petrovich a name of unmistakable origin we should have preferred the term  slovakian for hungarian slovenes on p 62the adjective is used by miklosich and prevents any confusion with the real slovenes the driving of the great magyar wedge into the midst of the slavonic peoples to which mr wratislaw alludes has formed the subject of a valuable historical monograph by prof k grot of warsaw entitled moravia and the magyars st petersburg 1881 since erben published his book the lusatian talesor sorbish as we should prefer to call themhave been more comprehensively treated by veckenstedtwenosehs sagsn mareken und aberglauhische qebrauche gesammslt und nacherztlhlt gratz 1880 the variant of  little red riding hood  given by mr wratislaw on p 100 is very interesting he remarks with truth that the word nesets for  moon  is masculine how far it is a secondary formation it is difficult to say certainly the old slavonic has the feminine word luna which is also found in russian and slovenish miklosich sees traces in polish and bohemian and connects the word with lukna even the kashubes the humble section of the slavonic family dwelling on the coast of the baltic near danzig contribute their quota of a single tale and that is taken of course from the collection of dr cenova the only literary representative of these poor fisherfolk before the civilised world polish is fairly supplied with folktales as we know from the fine collection edited by oscar kolbcrg but this work appeared long after the compilation of erbens book coming to the obscure dialect of white russian we find some good specimens in mr wratislaws extracts the number of malorussian stories has been greatly increased by the publication of the narodnia tuthnorusshia shazjci of rudchenko erben does not seem to have used this book which appeared two or three years before his death in his introduction to the bulgarian stories p 175 mr wratislaw adopts the views of miklosich on some of the peculiarities of that language we think however that the idea of deriving the postposition of the article from the old thracian language originally spoken in the same localities can be otherwise explained the same tendency to put the demonstrative pronoun at the end of a noun or pronoun is seen in russian and polish thus russian smielosutu disknet  creates boldness or polish s kt6rogoto dkielk from which work some excellent remarks on this suffix are to be found in prof sobolevskis lectures on the history of the russian language nor do we accept the view of mr wratislaw that the old thracian or dacian language conjointly with latin has produced the present roumanian too little is known of thracian to justify these assertions and it would be difficult to point out the thracian words from that language in the roumanian vocabulary unless we are to consider albanian as such the remarks on the bulgarian cases also require modification as in some of the dialects the terminations of the genitive and dative are distinctly found nor again on p 204 can we accept the view that serbian has been modified by thracian influences the tendency to supply the infinitive by a circumlocution with the subjunctive is found in other languages eg low latin mr wratislaw has done excellent work in his versions of these folktales it is only with some of his philological views that we cannot agree thus we are at a loss to see what can justify his statement that the malorussianit is a language and not a dialect is more nearly allied to the bohemian than to the white russian surely its characteristics are sharply enough marked as of a southeastern slavonic language as opposed to bohemian a western mr wratislaws frequent use of the word  dialect is also to be somewhat reprehended thus slovenish cannot be called in anyway a dialect and the views of schafarikan excellent ethnologist but poor philologistare now out of date of the three dialects coordinated on p 204 serbian and croatian are almost identical but slovenish exhibits great variations from both in his work on the slavonic languages and literature published in 1826 schafarik actually grouped bulgarian with serbian these remarks are not made with a view of disparaging that eminent man but to show how slavonic studies have advanced since his time the fact is that a great deal of schafarik8 work is now antiquated the old divisions of the slavonic languages made by him and dobrovsky have been superseded by the classification given by johannes schmidt zur oeschichte des lndooermanischen voealismus part ii p 178 vienna 187175 the early attempts were based on distinctions many of which existed only in imagination as regards slovenish it is a language of great interest on account of the many old forms it contains although it is spoken over a small area and the literature which it contains is comparatively trifling since however the excellent grammar of j suman a pupil of miklosich slovenska slovniea laibach 1881 it is no longer left in

had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch

and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my

reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep bitterly for she was afraid of the cold frog for she could not bear the thoughts of touching it and now it was to sleep in her nice clean little bed but the king gave her an angry look and said  what thou hast promised thou art bound to perform and the frog must be thy associate so there was no help for it whether she liked it or not she was obliged to take the frog with her but in her heart she was very maliciously disposed against him  so she took iiim betwixt her two lingers and carried him up and when she laid herself down ia bed instead of lifting tue frog into bed she threw it xvith all

that we really begrudge mr thoms the space that he occupies with his very erudite comparisons and analogies between the various fairy tales of all nations the more especially as these fictions must be nearly alike modified of course by the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to

B3500,"['8776630', '6760511']",  tales and legends from the land of the tzar a collection of russian stories translated from the original russian by edith m 8 hodgetts griffith farran  co tins is a bright little book miss hodgetts not only knows some excellent fairy tales but has an excellent way of telling them her collection will very likely be a great favourite with our young people who will probably not regret the absence of any learned notes on comparative folklore there is a weird power in these russian tales and miss hodgetts says in her preface with good reason that  the perfect recklessness regarding possibility to say nothing of probability lends a special charm to the russian story how graphic too are the details what a vigorous northern picture is that of jack frost morozko on p 57  jack frost jumped from branch to branch coming nearer to her suddenly he sprang from the tree and stood by her side his icecold fingers touching her shoulders he was a handsomelooking old man with a long white beard and curly white locks hanging down his back  he had a kindlooking old face with a goodnatured smile on it this story must have been in the mind of the poet nekrasov when he wrote the following clever stanza in his  red  nosed frostmoroz krasni noz which has been well translated by mr sumner smith of yale college all stiff she is growing has touched her the frostking the weird  a breath in her face he is blowing and on her sharp needles is strowing from out his huge icy grey beard this folktale will also be found in the late mr ralstons work russian folktales 1873 p 219  the snow maiden is a story full of poetical beauty certainly judging by this and others we cannot consider the russian peasant to be wanting in imagination and fancy he sets no limit to either the absolute audacity of his conceptions seems to belong to a certain orientalism of his mind it is the same spirit which animates the  tales of the thousand and one nights adventure follows upon adventure time and space are as nothing and over all there is a fatalism which regards man as the plaything of the divinity as hies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport there is no melancholy in these stories such as we find in the russian novel but a reckless happygolucky sort of existence which makes them unique among european folktales again how thoroughly oriental and luxuriant is the imagery every one is gorgeously apparelled and there is a glory of palaces reminding one of those which tennyson dreamed of at the court of harounalraschid thus the grey wolfs costume was most extraordinary he had a red cap on his head with green feathers in it round his neck he had a blue silk ribbon  he wore a red velvet jacket embroidered with gold lilac gloves with lace ruffles a scarf round his waist on his hind feet he had slippers and on his tail he wore a silver net ornamented with diamonds the feast continued until very late at night but as soon as it was dark the golden cassowary was brought in with its golden cage and hung up on the balcony the whole court shone like lightning imme diately so that no lamps were wanted not even in the streets round about the palace as the cassowary afforded light enough is stasov right after all in his view that these tales are for the most part of comparatively late oriental origin coming into russia by way of the bazaars and caravanserais  many of the tales have already been translated by ralston to those previously mentioned we may add  king vladimir and the skeleton which he has given on p 85 from afanasiev it is the old story of kostchei the deathless there is also  vasilieea the beautiful as we prefer spelling her name which is given by ralston on p 150 it seems to be a slavonic variant of the story of cinderella the three kopecks occurs on p 43 of the same work prince kidskin tsarevichkozlionochek is a good cid russian tale which is to be found in the collection of afanasiev and is by him assigned to the government of voronezh one of the last tales given by miss hodgetts is from a famous buina of course ilya muromets figures in the book in an excellent story we do not like however the transformation of his name into elie muromitch which is hardly accurate and we are surprised that so good a russian scholar as this lady should be contented with it elsewhere we have come upon some rather strange renderings of the names but these are trivial matters the book is well done is decidedly amusing and we wish it all success  tales and legendt from the land of the ttar translated from the original russian by edith m s hodgetts griffith farran  co we have had no book of russian folktales since the meritorious work of the late mr ralston published as long ago as 1873 of this however no second edition has appeared and in some respects the present work by miss hodgetts is better adapted to the general reader especially the younger generation for it does not contain any notes on comparative folklore such as are calculated to interest only a limited class for whom the commentaries of mr ralston will always retain their value stories are most welcome to the ordinary public when given with all their original vivacity and even tautology and contradictions  and it is in a popular manner that miss hodgetts has presented her selection to ns and what tales they are full of the wildest flights of fancy as she truly remarks in her preface in fact the audacity of these folktales is the quality which will first strike the person who reads them they teem witadventures all is direct action and they do not contain any of the sententious moralising which we find in the hitopadesa or the  book of wisdom and falsehood of the georgian sulkhan orbeliani tou are left to draw your own inferences in these tales all probabilities and possibilities are cast to the winds a notable characteristic which they possess is the glorification of physical force with a considerable admixture of cunning as in  reynard the fox the russian does not seem to care for philosophising he is too naive for that and it is just this absence of all attempts at improving the occasion which will make these stories popular among our young friends children do not care for moral tags some of the tales have been previously translated into english in mr ralstons book for instance but with that notable exception russian folkstories have been rather neglected in western literature chodzko in his contes des pay sans et detpatree slaves 1864 almost ignores them and as he

observed that the wine is green the favourite conventional epithet in thf southeast mini jn the same way it is always the damp earth the  thick  forest and so on in some of the tales we notice that miss hodgetts has adopted a slightly different version from that given by afmasievprince kidskin for instance  but the variations are most conspicuous in the names and no greater proof could exist of their being genuine folktales than these slight discrepancies the very quaint story  ivashko and the witch is identical in its main details with one given in the essays on southern russia zapiski o yuzhnoi rossie by kuli sh it there appears in a malorussian version under the title ivas i viedma but it would be out of pace here to dicuss the various versions and translations of these curious

B7085,['8304846'],  traditions of lancashire second series by j roby mral 2 vols 8vo rich indeed in legendary lore is the county of lancashire and well for her traditions is it that they have fallen into such able hands as those of mr roby to a thorough knowledge of antiquarian learning he unites a brilliant imagination and is thus enabled to throw over the pile of hoar antiquity the light which renders the ruin so beautiful and attractive with the wand of the magician he stays the rapidly departing shadows  more than this he imparts a new substance and reality to them and gives relief and prominence to things but dimly seen  he rescues  the relics of the past from the oblivion to which they were hastening and by a rare union of the antique and the modern he illustrates manners and customs now obsolete by tales that however bearing upon tradition have still a distinct and separate interest to recommend them if his imagination is tempted to overstep her limits the severity of the antiquary restrains her flight and thus the keeping is perfect the style of the work is another of its excellencieswhether of humour or of pathoswhether of love or terrorwhether in the whirlwind of passion or in ladys bower in the conflict of the elements or in the placid lakenature in her summer beauty or the howling of the winters stormmr roby has appropriate language for each and all nor is it the least of his merits that in every tale there is a fine moral tone and a moral purpose while the impress of a pious mind is visibly stamped upon the whole it is true that we are constantly reminded of sir walter scott and this has been supposed to detract from the originality of mr robys work we do not think so for it is not in parallel passages or in characters for which we could find a prototype in the author of waverley  but we find ourselves perpetually saying  this is in scotts manner meaning that if scott had chosen the subject he would thus have treated it and this we consider as very high praise having thus briefly offered our opinion of the general merits of mr robys volumes we proceed to give extacts which will justify our praise premising that in tales none of which are of any length it is difficult to discover passages which can afford a fair specimen of mr robys manner the following describes the person of that young pretender to the crown of england in the reign of henry the seventh by some historians said to be lambert simnel and by others the unfortunate earl of warwick it was at the peel or castle of fouldrey that his mimic and motley court was first held before a long narrow table near the bed and on a highbacked oaken chair sat the young pretender he was dressed in a richly embroidered gown the sleeves wide and hanging down from the wrists like lappets on his head was a low cap surmounted by long waving feathers and his manners and appearance were not devoid of grace and gentility he displayed considerable selfpossession and wore his kingly honours with great assurance he was of a fair and sanguine complexion pale rather than clear and his hair clustered in heavy ringlets on his shoulders a rapid and somewhat uncertain motion of the eye and his mouth not weil closed showed that although he might have been schooled to the exhibition and could wear the outward show of firmness and decision yet in the hour of emergency and in the day of trial his fortitude would in all likelihood forsake him then we have portraits of his followers  at his right hand eat the priest in a white cassock and scapulary a black hood thrown back upon his shoulders exhibited the form and dismsition of his head to great advantage his features were large expressive and commanding the fire of a brilliant grey eye was scarcely tempered by his overhanging brows though at times the spirit seemed to retire behind their grim shadows to survey more securely and unobservedly the aspect and appearances without  swartz the flemish general a blunt military chieftain was at his side a black bushy beard some inches in advance of his honest goodhumoured face was placed in strong contrast with the wary pale and somewhat dubious aspect of the priest  kildare the irish deputy and lovel with several of the senior officers and captains were assembled round the table  the room was lofty lighted by a small pointed window and contained the luxury of a fireplace in which lay some blazing embers  a grateful and refreshing sight in that chill and ungenial atmosphere by the artifices of margaret duchess of burgundy a mysterious personage of gigantic stature appears and directs the councils of the rebels and is by them supposed to be supernatural this fact comes to the knowledge of the abbot of furness a loyal adherent of henryby dispatches intercepted by a halfwitted fellow dick empson and an attempt is made to turn this information to account and to induce tiie rebels to quit the castle of mr robys talent for the ludicrous not unmixed with the terrible we could not mention a better specimen than the tale entitled  the dule upo dun but we must refer our readers to the volumes where they will find much that is curious and all entertaining we will not repeat our praise of the work  we hope soon to find mr roby employed with equal talent on the traditions of other counties assured that so diligent a reaper will gather an abundant harvest wherever he shall put in his sickle his defence of tradition against the charges of the historian in the introduction to this series is a learned and clever dissertation,folklore

those that are here all things that are bright are there brighter there is more gold in the sun and more silver in the moon of that land there is more scent on the flowers more savour in the fruit there is more comeliness in the men and more tenderness in the women mr rackhams pictures are amazing in their grotesque fancy the reptiles the uncanny rocks the ogreish people could not be bettered

that mr gaskin for all his merits may not run away with all the praise a good many of mr gaskins drawings for the book will have been seen at the arts and crafts exhibition where they had an honoured place and no wonder the school of draughtmanship to which outwardly he belongs has prodiiced a great deal of work beautiful regarded as mere decorati n but which set to illustrate tales of real moving

B538,['6662006'],  general literature and art traditions and hearthside stories of west cornwall by w bottrell penzance  w cornish london  trubner ever since the brothers grimm published the german popular stories of the rhineland under the title of kinderwid haustndrchen nursery tales and popular fiction of all ages have been looked on in a new light it was soon seen that much of early mythology was embodied in them the  sleeping beauty for instance can be traced back to the early myth which symbolises spring being awakened by the suns touch doing away the sleep of winter the process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls of the ionian chieftains did no otherwise in any case these stories illustrate the social life of our own immediate ancestors in the time when reading had not taken the place of recitation and public interests were not so absorbing as personal talk and home side stones c w boase,folklore

in thu water with its own kind perhaps however it may be able to get me my ball again thus thinking she said  well bo it so only give me my golden hall again and it shall bo as you wish and when she had thus spoken the frog dived its head under the water again went to the bottom and after a little while came to the top again with the ball in its mouth and threw it upon the grass oh how glad the princess was when she found the pretty plaything once more safe inlier hands thefrog cried  wait now princess and take me with you but that was spoken to the wind she heard not a word of it but ran home with her golden ball and thought no more of the frog on thu next day when she sat at table with the king and his courtiers and ate from her little golden dish something came creeping plitsch platsch  plitsch platsch  up the marble steps and when it got to the top of them it knocked at the door and cried out  princess dear open the door  she immediately ran to the door to see who was there and when she opened it what should be sitting there but the frog so she shut thc door quickly to and seated herself again in great alarm at the table the king saw how violently her heart kept beating and said  what is it that frightened you so  is there u giant at the door who wants to carry you away alas no  said the princess  it is no giant but an ugly frog who yesterday in the wood got my golden ball out of the water for me and in return i promised him that he should be my companion  for i never thought that he could leave the water but now he is out of it and will come in here to nie just at this minute the frog knocked a second time and cried  princess dear pray oxii thc door and think ot what you promised mc when yesterday i did restore  the pretty solden ball to thee princes dear pray open the door then said the king  if thou didst so promise him thou must keep thy promise and open the door so she went and opened the door and in hopped the frog close to her feet until it reached her stool there it sat itself and cried  lift me up to you but she would not do so until the king commanded her but the frog now that it was seated on a stool by her side said to her  put thy little golden dish nearer to me that we may eat together full ol indignation she did this likewise and the frog seemed to relish the meal very much but every morsel she took stuck in her throat presently it said to her  now i have eaten as much as i want and 1 am weary so carry me up to thy chamber and make ready thy little silken bed that i may sleep in it at this thc princess began to weep

nearly alike modified of course by the national habits in all countries we pronounce it as an indubitable fact that if a person never having read or heard a fairy tale in his life were to sit down to compare he would not miss an unconscious imitation of some half dozen already extant in as many communities indeed so ample is fairy lore that you cannot lie out of it any more than a man can swear

london triibner we are indebted to mrs steel and capt temple for a charming volume of stories admirably fitted for the entertainment of children and at though same time containing much valuable information for students its contents naturally resemble those of the collections previously made by miss frere miss stokes the rev lal behan day and mr damant but its authors justly claim for it the merit of special genuineness inasmuch as it has been mostly procured at firsthand from the lips of purely village children who have never been inside a school and  whose complete freedom from any european influence is beyond all question the fortythree tales now presented in purely literary form have for the most part been already published in the indian antiquary the calcutta review and the legends of the panjdb where they appeared in a literal version to which reference can be made by those scholars who insist upon a strict translation however uncouth to english ears but for all ordinary purposes the present volume will suffice by itself being provided with thirtyfour pages of excellent notes an analysis of the tales on the plan adopted by the folklore society of england occupying thirtyseven pages and fifty pages devoted to  a survey of the incidents in modern indian folktales all testifying to the wide knowledge and painstaking industry of their author capt temple during the working hours of the day says mrs steel no tales are to be heard in a panjabi village but after sunset comes  storytelling time the heat is still too great for sleep the darkness of night is relieved but slightly inside the mudbuilt cottages by the dim smoky flame of an oilfed wick so there is nothing for the children to do but to tell stories by way of passing the time they have worked hard all daythe boys half hidden in clouds of dust tending the herds the girls  kneading drying and stacking the fuelcakes so necessary in that i woodless country now has come their time for rest and amusement so after their scanty supper is over the bairns drag their woodenlegged stringwoven bedsteads into the open and settle themselves down like young birds in a nost three or four to a bed while others coil up on mats upon though grouud and some stealing in for an hour from distant alleys beg a place here or there though stars twinkle overhead the mosquito sings through the hot air the village dogs bark at imaginary foes and from one crowded nest after another rises a childish voice telling some tale old yet ever newtales that wero told in the sunrise of the world and will be told in its sunset the most novel of the stories contained in the present collection is that of little anklebone no 14 it appears to be unique among indian folktales says capt temple who compares it with grimms  singing bone a boy is eaten by a wolf which at his request hangs his anklebone by a thread to a tree though bone maintains an  independent existence and without changing its form acts like a human being piping to beasts and obtaining milk from tigresses and shewolves another unfamiliar tale apparently of literary origin is  the lord of death no 27 a certain road had the reputation of being fatal to all who travelled that way an old man who was walking along it sat down to rest and perceived near him a scorpion which turned into a snake he followed it and saw it kill many persons then it turned into a buffalo and afterwards into an ox still continuing its homicidal practices afterwards it became a beautiful girl whose charms produced a fatal rivalry between two brothers finally it assumed the form of a whitebearded man him though traveller who had never ceased to follow close upon the destroyer accosted and learned from him that he was called  the lord of death because he went about bringing death to the world hearing this the old traveller begged for death but was told that his appointed time was not yet come no 42 is a remarkable story about a mother and daughter who worshipped the sun  giving everything they earned to it except two meal cakes on which they lived one day the daughter who was alone in the house had eaten her share of this food when a beggar came asking for aid not liking to refuse she gave him in the name of the sun half of her mothers cake the mother returning hungry to dinner found only half a cake to eat and was so annoyed that she drove her daughter from her house but the sun protected the outcast who became the bride of a prince her mother found out where she was and presented herself in her rags to the princess intending to put her to shame but the sun continued its protection to the daughter and turned the mother into a golden stool no 40 describes a singular form of selfsacrifice on thc part of a king who was accustomed to give away a hundredweight of gold in charity every morning before breakfast in order to obtain the necessary amount of the precious metal he allowed himself to be fried and eaten every day by a faqir who after the operation restored him to life no 22 is a curious specimen of the stories in which women figure who are snakes in disguise the snakewoman in this story was called in the original a zamia  said in kashmir to bc a snake two hundred years old and to possess the power of becoming a woman a malignant being the nature of which has been discussed in the indian antiquary vol xi pp 23035 and in the folklore societys edition of comparettis researches into the book of sindibdd no 26 is one of the many forms of the tale which tells how a man becomes rich by the help of some wonderworking object but has it stolen from him by an envious neighbour who is eventually punished for the theft in the present instance the miracles are due to a conch which requires to be blown in a particular manner the thief not understanding how to use it is obliged to surrender it to its original owner but stipulates that he is to get a double share of whatever that owner obtains from it the rightful proprietor of the conch from a feeling similar to that which made the hero of another wellknown tale ask for stripes as his reward spitefully prays for the loss of an eye he straightway becomes oneeyed but the thief in consequence of his too grasping stipulation loses both eyes falls into a well and is drowned nos 3139 give in a readable form a number of the stories about raja rasalu

form she chose and liow his clever bride slipped out of his enchanted castle and rejoined her mortal lover on a juicy turnip turned into a horse while the poor gnome king with his attention distracted by love was making at her desire an exact calculation of the number of turnips in a certain field because said the lady she would have them all for bridesmaids he had to count three times before he

fairy hero and what fantastic tales are told of him we may now read in mr lemons english storybook the genial play of invention in these and like stories seems to be very difficult of attainment in this country it is wonderful to think how few good fairy tales have been produced in england as a branch of our literature they are almost unrecognized and when they are invented for the benefit of children the inventions are too commonly confections of crude wouldbe childishness with no fairylike delicacy of conception no swift ingenious imaginative turns to which the writer has for the time given heart and soul producing them with as good faith and as pure enjoyment as the poet ffeels in exercise of his own higher but not more spiritual tform of creative power our few english attempts at a ttairy tale are usually written with a visible sense of coming down to some theoretical point vulgarly supposed in this country to be the capacity of children every natural child reads under

eastern fables and legends may prove a cause of offence to some hypercritical readers but if not strictly accurate its employment in the present instance is highly suggestive the dreamy pathetic spirit of oriental storyland is thus shown in contrast with the rough and vigorous genius of the north and without establishing invidious comparisons or hinting disparagement of the prowess of viking or berserker we cannot but feel that the tender reverence for life and the pervading pity which throbs through the humour and pathos of the east beam out in sweeter brighter relief like a star against a stormy sky scenes of reckless valour and slaughter of broadbreasted chieftains wrestling naked cleaving each others skulls with mighty axestrokes robbing quarrelling wreaking vengeancethe whole shown in a flow of heroic sunlight may well fascinate those who can find nothing in their own day to call forth strength or struggle but the man to whom participation in the woes and trials of a living world makes it difficult to regard pain and bloodshed from the ideal standpoint and who accordingly will find more to repulse than delight him in the glad and ruthless temper of scandinavian lore may welcome the music of the gentler bishi as a wholly soothing power let him consent to the influence and it will lure him forth into a wild fantastic country illumined by the tender radiance of a starlit night where under flowery trees and amid rich scents and sights a hundred quaint innocent beings will exchange confidences with him whilst around them the scene shifts and changes like firepictures or landscapes wrought of cloud nor is there in this fanciful extravagance anything grotesque or discordant it is the parable of the oneness of life of the brotherhood of all nature repeated in evervarying toneslistening to which from time to time has benefits for the heart and imagination beyond the lifting of cares and responsibilities though no stronger charm could be devised

transplantation to a less ardent soil by the help of german translators and chiefly of professor julg the author of  patranas desires we are informed in the preface to give these stories an english form as readable and at the same time as literal as circumstances will allow on the latter score some too palpable slips and flaws have handed over our hapless author to the tender mercies of outraged dryasdusts but notwithstanding such enormities as putting a hegoat where a ram should be and mistaking a lark for a swallow we would suggest that these heinous sins against the letter may to some extent be compensated by the delicate appreciation of the spirit of the original and that to have maintained the quaint simplicity humour and gentleness which characterise oriental thought is after all more valuable than a closely accurate translation lacking as by the way such productions almost invariably do these essential attributes beaders acquainted with captain burtons charming version  vikram and the vampire  will find the plan of the story of  the wellandwisewalking khan familiar and no doubt both legends have one and the same origin but besides that they serve as introductions to a distinctly different series of narratives there are some conspicuous dissimilarities in the kalmuck rendering of the tale like vikram the wellandwisewalking khan is charged to bring a peculiarly animated and ingenious bogy from one spot to another without exchanging a word with him by the way in both instances the crafty prisoner offers to enliven the journey by telling stories and thus the captors irresistible love of moralising is repeatedly made to betray him into expressing either indignation or approval when of course his charge escapes him and he has to recommence his journeyings but in the present case the siddhikur is a vastly more desirable acquisition than vikrams vampire   from his waist upwards he is of gold from his waist downwards of emerald his head is of motherofpearl decked with a shining crown also the incidents which cause this task to be imposed upon the khans son are different pursued by seven magicians he has taken refuge in the cavern of the

excusing himself on the plea that this one life being his own was naturally exceptionally precious to him notwithstanding professes himself willing to discharge any penitential labour nagarguna may deem fitting accordingly he is sent to fetch the siddhikiir on his road rise up before him the dim shapes of the giant dead the pigmy dead the child dead all of whom he quiets by magic passwords finally he discovers the siddhikur as he has been warned in a cool grove and the creature catching sight of him scampers off and clambers up a mangotree then as directed the khan threatens to cut down the tree  but the siddhikir has an extraordinary fondness for his mango fell not the mangotree rather will i come down to thee which he accordingly does and is tied up in the khans sack and shouldered until such time as his companions irrepressible sententiousness gives him a chance of escape when with diabolic glee he exclaims  forgetting his health the wellandwisewalking khan hath opened his lips and with the cry  to escape out of this world is good he speeds him through the air swift out of sight among the stories by which this crafty imp manages to beguile the way are many which possess interest for the comparative mythologist as for instance in how the widow saved her sons life where we have king midas and his asss ears with scarcely any alteration and again in the story of  the white bird and his wife which is virtually the myth of  psyche and eros the same idea reappearing in the tale of the goldspitting prince of the second collection of legends entitled by our author the saga of ardschibordschi and vikramaditjas throne the vikramaditjas more properly vihramadityas alluded to is the same vikram of the hindi legend he being a personage of as great importance in indian traditions as king arthur in our own and having as many and as marvellous feats ascribed to him as a fair specimen of these stories and of the present writers treatment of them we may cite the beautiful fable of who invented woman  the wonderful deeds of vikramaditjas are being related to ardschibordsehi so as to make him diffident of mounting the throne of one so illustrious ifc is told him how the magnanimous king amongst other triumphs once succeeded in arousing a certain beautiful princess narandakini from the silent contemplation in which she appeared hopelessly sunk vikramaditjas goes to visit the silent haughty one in her lonely cavern taking with him four ministers whom he transforms respectively into the altar the lamp the vessel for burning incense and the rosary he holds in his nandi then according to the usual plan he proceeds to tell narandakini a story long ages ago there went forth daily into one place four youths to mind their flocks and when their flocks left them leisure they amused themselves with pastimes together now it came to pass that one day one of them rising earlier than the rest and finding himself at the place alone said within himself  how is the time weary being here all alone  and he took wood and sculptured it with loving care until he had fashioned a form like to his own and yet not alike and when he saw how brave a form he had fashioned he cared no more to sport with the other shepherd lads but went his way and the next morning the second of the youths rose earlier than the rest and said  how is the time weary being here all alone  and he found the form the first youth had fashioned and finding it exceeding brave he painted it over with the five colours and when he saw how fair a form he had painted he cared no more to sport with the other shepherd youths but went his way and the next morning the third of the youths came to the place and said  how is the time weary being here all alone  and he cast about him for some pastime  thus he discovered the form which the first youth had fashioned and the second had painted and he said  this figure is beautiful in form and colour but it has no understanding so he infused into it wit and understanding and when he saw how clever was the form he had endowed with wit and understanding he cared no more to sport with the shepherd lads but went his way the fourth morning the fourth youth finding himself all alone said  how is the time weary being here all alone and casting about for some pastime he discovered the fair form which the first youth had fashioned and the second painted and the third youth had made so clever and he said  behold the figure is beautiful in form and colour and admirable for wit and understanding but what skills all this when it has not life   and he put his lips to the lips of the figure and breathed softly into them  and behold it had a soul that could be loved and was woman  but when the other youths saw that they came back all the three and demanded possession of her by right of invention and when they found that none prevailed against the rest they brought the matter before the king to decide say now o narandakini in favour of which of these four was the king bound to decide that he had invented woman   and as the king left off from speaking he looked towards narandakini but the silent haughty one sat immersed kin deep contemplation speaking never a word but the altar the lamp and the vessel for incense forthwith taking upon themselves to reply and of course one and all making a wrong selection swiftly exasperate narandakini into setting them right with a sound rating to boot on the ground that  unsouled objects such as they should presume thus to pronounce upon the question lt is to be regretted that the author of patranas  should have burdened the present graceful and poetic work with elaborate notes for the most part wholly irrelevant and whilst containing no fresh information for students of oriental literature calculated rather to mislead than instruct those entirely unacquainted with the subject the root of the mischief lies in injudicious zeal for christianity and jealousy for the priority of its claims in the doctrines of the incarnation and the trinity thus at the close of a lengthy account of takyamunis career we are informed that  an unenlightened admiration for the story of our divine redeemers life on earth may be supposed to have induced the ascribing of his supernatural manifestations to another being already accepted as divine  which is an ingenious method of escaping the difficulty but unfortunately it does not explain away the records of identical beliefs having prevailed at a period when christian influence was impossible for example so wellknown a work as fergussons  tree and serpent worship might have informed our author vide plate 33 that the incarnation of buddha is clearly depicted on the northern gateway of the sanchi tope the date of the erection of this gateway being ad 20 ie before the passion of christ and hence infallibly before the spread of his doctrine it is indeed admitted that certain appearances of vishnu and siva upon earth are alluded to as early as 300 bc but it is added the dogma is not fully developed  the heroes of the early epic poems still maintain their individualities they are actuated and indwelt by vishnu but they are not him this it will be seen is very different from the christian dogma of the incarnation we confess we do not see it one last position anl one only still remains possible for adherents to the old faith in the face of the researches of the philologist and comparative mythologistlet them renounce as silently as may be the theory of a special covenant with a privileged race to hold fast by mr gladstones convenient doctrine of a primaeval tradition common to all people here in this their last stronghold let them await the hour when the synthesis of the religious idea completed the temple of the supernatural must fall to give place to the more majestic edifice founded not upon sand but on the rock of natural and mental laws against which waves may wash and winds beat and tempests storm in vam fe  1 saras from thc far east or kalmouk and j mongolian traditionary tales with his torical preface and explanatory notes by the author of patraiias griffith tfc farran the first sight of this book afforded us an agreeable surprise neither in the collection of spanish stories entitled  patraiias nor in that of tyrlese tales labelled as from  the land of hofer were there many traces of anything like scholarly work but the volume now before us although purporting to be by the author of those compilations is so far as part of it is concerned immeasurably superior to them for it contains in its notes a considerable amount of solid information industriously collected from a very wide field of research they are gathered not only from the wellknown works of the chief authorities on oriental subjects but also from the transactions of learned societies and other scientific periodicals familiarity with which is rare except among professed scholars to some of them prof j digs name is appended but the author of  patraiias appears to claim the rest as his own to our eye however they seem to be decidedly of german rather than of english extraction take for instance the following note on page 401  the wolfnurtured prince hag a prominent place in mongolian chronicles their dynasty was founded by biirtetshinoathe wolf in winter clothing see i j schmidts  die volker mittelasiens vorziiglich die mongolen und tibeter st petersburg 1824 pp 1118 33 et seq 7075 and ssanang ssetsen 6fj and 372 in spite of its grammatical obscurity we felt convinced that this note came from a german workshop and at page 128 of julgs  mongolische miirchen we found it minus the obscurity  es spielt aben der wolf auch in den stammsagen der mongolen eine bedeutungsvolle rolle indem sie ihre furstenreihe beginnen mit biirte tschinoa c in this instance jiilgs name has undoubtedly been omitted through inadvertence for our author has usually recognised all obligations to him some of the notes however are evidently of home manufacturethe following for example  as an instance of the migration of myths i may mention here that i met in spain with a ballad which i am torry i have mislaid and cannot therefore quote the verse in which the lovelorn swain in singiag the praises of hui mistress among other charms enumerates that the flowers spring from the stones as she treads her way through the streets stephanos  delicate monster  did not speak in more contrasted tones than make themselves heard in these two notes thus much for the commentary the text itself containing the  kalmouk and mongolian traditionary tales of the siddhi aur and the  history of ardshi bordshi khan appears to have been translated from the german versions of those works  of these versions i have availed myself says the translator in a preface which is not as clear as it might be with respect to the authorities on which the present work is based the stories now  for the first time put into english have as is well known been transferred from india to central asia from the  twentyfive tales of a vetala and the  adventures of vikrama and other like sources to the abovenamed calmuck and mongolian collections on their way they have naturally undergone some transformations but these only render them the more interesting to students of comparative mythology they have already been rendered familiar by prof jiilgs handy and in every way excelleut translation as well as by other versions notably the russian paraphrase made by au erudite lama but to the general reader they will offer all the charm of novelty among thc most interesting of these tales is a version of the story found in so many lands of though husband who sometimes appears in the form of a man and sometimes in that of one of the lower animals until at last his wife destroys the magic skin or slough on which his transformation depends its most familiar forms are probably those of  the little ass grimm km no 144 and east o the sun and west o the moon dasent no 4 the well known  frogprinco grimm no 1 also belongs to the same group but it has lost its most important incident in the first story it is an asa that the heroine marries in the second a bear in the third a frog in the calmuck story no 7 it is a bird two sisters successively wander in search of a lost ox and each of them enters a palace in which is a great white bird perched upon a golden throne to each sister the bird fruitlessly proffers marriage but their younger sister when she in her turn enters the palace accepts the bird and is married to it this bird is an enchanted man who sometimes assumes his human shape during his absence one day his wife acting on the advice of an old woman burns his cage according to julgs version his featherdress or birdlike husk according to gomboief s when he returns home and finds out what she has done he tells her that what she has burnt was his  soul and that now he will probably be carried off by demons his only chance of escape depends upon her being able to continue waving a stick which he gives her for seven whole days and nights during which time he will be engaged in contest with his ghostly enemies she does her best but on the seventh night in spite of her having propped up her eyelids with feathergrass she closes her eyes for a moment and her husband is carried off by the evil spirits the calmuck psyche wanders disconsolate in search of her lost cupid and at last finds him sitting at the foot of a hill he tells her that the demons have made him their watercarrier and he begs her to go home and make another cage and woo back his soul into it then he is swept away by the demons but she returns home and does what he has requested and suddenly from behind the wall a bird flew in and that bird was her husband such is an outline of this calmuck paraphrase of an indian tale according to prof di gubernatis the bird is the sun and  the aurora or dawn is the aviary made of flames of this divine bird when the aviary is burned at morn the aurora and the sun separate they meet again in the evening when the aviary is reconstructed by way of another specimen of these sagas we will take the mongolian story no 14 it is a variant of the wellknown tale of the goodnatured hunchback from whom his hump is taken off by the grateful fairies whose song he improves and of his illnatured companion in deformity on whom the enraged fairies confer an additional hump in punishment for his not having sufficiently amplified their song or having spoilt it by an unwelcome addition a special favourite with the celtic peoples it is also familiar to the japanese to whom it probably came through buddhistic channels similar to those which conveyed it to the tibetian mongols the story in the siddhi kiir relates how a poor man whom a rich brother has not invited to a feast rushes out into the forest with the intention of killing himself but as he goes along he sees a number of the spirits called dakinis disporting themselves and perceives that they have a wondrous bag from which when it is struck by an equally miraculous hammer all things desirable flow abundantly so when they have departed he steals the bag and hammer and returns home reconciled to existence his rich brother hearing of his sudden prosperity calls on him extracts his secret by means of unbrotherly threats and starts at once in search of the haunt of the dakinis arriving there he is seized by those spirits who take him for the thief who has stolen their sack and hammer at first they talk of killing him but at last they determine to stretch his nose to an immoderate length and tie nine knots in it when this has been done they disappear and their victim slinks sadly home after a time he hears that his brothers magic hammer can loose the knots so he sends for him and agrees to reward him richly if he will perform the cure when the hammer is applied to the sufferers nose knot after knot vanishes but when only one remains the patients wife dismisses the operator hoping thereby to avoid having to pay the stipulated reward then she steals the magic hammer and tries to cure the last knot herself but not knowing how to use the miraculous weapon she hits her husband so violent a blow with it that his head cracks asunder and his brains run out whereupon he dies and his brother inherits his wealth from these two samples an idea may easily be formed of the worth and interest of the collection as regards the merits of the translation it is difficult to know what to say we have stated that we were agreeably surprised by the first sight of the volume now before us it opened at the notes and we were delighted at finding in them traces of exact and apparently conscientious labour but when we read the translations of the tales we became not a little bewildered if these stories were intended for children and unlearned persons only why were such elaborate notes appended to them if they were meant for students also why were they not translated as closely as propriety would permit 1 the translator says that he has  made it an undeviating rule to let such alterations as occur be as few and as slight as the case admitted but he seems to have broken his rule on numerous occasions if we turn for instance to the story of the  two brogers of which we have given a summary we find that the english version differs considerably from that given by prof jiilg in his  mongolische marchen when the avaricious brother falls into the hands of the spirits and one of them suggests that he be put to death we are told that  the dakinis were thoroughly out of temper and did not want any urging the words were no sooner uttered than like a flock of birds they all flew round him and seized him  how shall we kill him asked one as she held him tight by the hair of his head till every single hair seemed as if forced out by the roots  fly with him up to the top of the rock and then dash him down  cried some  drop him in the middle of the bea cried others  cut him in pieces and give him to the dogs cried others again the whole of this passage appears to be an expansion of the simple words which prof jiilg has rendered as follows so verabredeten sie unter einander in ihrer erbitterung of course in a mere christmas storybook such expansions would be venial but the learned notes which adorn the present volume give it a claim to be considered as belonging to a different department of literature,folklore
B3076,['8916587'],  polynesian mythology and ancient traditional history of the new zealand race as fur nished by their priests and chiefs london saturday march 10 1855 reviews by sir george grey late governorinchief of new zealand murray when the author of this curious volume arrived among the strange people whom it was his mission to govern and protect he found himself helpless and was wise enough to avow it he was governor of a land where the indomitable british lion had tougher work of it than that wonderful animal ever expected to rind governor grey was anxious to do his duty impartially by all his great difficulty lay in this that he could not communicate satisfactorily with the natives there was indeed no lack of interpreters to make intercourse easy between him and the petitioning or remonstrant aboriginals but the interpreters themselves were frequently at fault there was a language and there were legends and poetical fragments employed in the addresses of some of those who came to seek redress from the governor of which the most skilful interpreters could no more make sense than mr hamilton could of some of the greek choruses the talk about rights and wrongs land labour settlement and occupation was constantly perplexed by grave allusions to mythic periods of new zealand history by quotations of perfectly unintelligible proverbs and by snatches of poetical citations for the conclusions of which whereby alone sense could be made of the first half the governor had to seek among the people of the aptyawt ditrict though compilers who built up the  iliad and  odyssey out of the fragments sung by the rhapsodists had no such laborious task a9 that which governor grey undertook and achieved in mastering their difficult language nnd in gathering up the fragments of their ancient lore having subdued the rugged difficulties which lay in the way of his mastering the language the energetic governor made acquaintance with if we may so speak the aboriginal clerical gentlemen of the locality he did not as cardinal ximenes with the moorish hooks in spain wish to destroy all traces and history of the heathen paston the contrary he wished to preserve and draw profit from them he had not the feeling of dr cumming who in his finger of god so complacently congratulates the world on the destruction of the great alexandrian library if the first archbishop of mexico instead of burning all the pictorial records of anahuac had preserved them for future scholars to read and digest he perhaps would have given to the world some truths sacred and important and have thrown a light upon aztec paths along which the old messengers of truth may once nave walked we are then the more disposed to be grateful to governor grey for the arduous labour undergone it has by no means been without results of usefulness and amusement he has sat at the feet of tatooed gamaliels and learned a world of inconceivable nonsensebut nonsense in which there are such singular indications that it is but the corruption of the one and immutable truth as to at once give it importance and dignity from the lips of new zealand priests and cunning men he has gathered all the lore stored up in such garners the traditionary history of the land that  shall be great hereafter is stupendously absurd but as we have said there are indications wildly distorted that at some very remote period there was a better instruction than the natives have enjoyed until very recently when we read for instance of the fratricide tumatauenga we are reminded of him who first slew his brother the fact that it was god who first taught and enjoined prayer to man is also here confessed and when we learn of what wickedness  the disappearance of a great part of the dry land was the resultand how during the contest of opposing men  a great part of mother earth was submergedwe are reminded that even among these islanders the record of the dread visitation has not been altogether lost that with the preservation of the record a spirit of poetry has not been also lost the following passage will amply demonstrate  up to this time the vast heaven has still ever remained separated from his spouse the eurth yet their mutual love still continuesthe soft warm sighs of her loving bosom still ever rise up to him ascending from the woody mountains and valleys and men call these mists and the vast heaven as he mourns through the long nights his separation from his beloved drops frequent tears upon her bosom and men seeing these term them dewdrops governor greys book proves that scripture history is at the foundation of that of new zealand this is sometimes hard to discover but the fact appears not the less certain the details are dissimilar but the leading point of the stories is not to be mistakenas in the tale of the jealousy of the brothers of mauitikitikiotaranga wherein we recognise the muchenduring joseph the beauty of this lengthilynamed hero is described according to the prevailing taste of the locality and maidens are admiringly told of him thai the skin on his hips looked mottled and beautiful as that of a mackerel from the tatoomarks cut on it by the chisel of uetonga in these traditionary stories the old truth is perverted in more ways than one and not only are the deeds of old distorted in the telling but the acts of many are heaped upon one individual thus it is said of maui the joseph of the last story that but for a certain matter recounted in a very long and very prosy legend no more human beings would have died but death itself would have been destroyed but the story of joseph is more easily traceable in the legend of tawhaki of whom not his brothers indeed but his brothersinlaw were jealous and by these he was half slain and cast into a pit only to rise to more exalted greatness than ever in like manner we have the story of sarah and hagar in that of the jealousy of the wives of tinirau against the young stranger whom he took to himself as an additional wife few if any of the touching episodes of holy writ are traceable in these wild legends and though some of them describe characters that are not void of good qualities yet we do not find among them such men as isaac and ishmael who though foes and of opposite religious faiths yet became reconciled over the dead body of a father the traces of classical and romantic stories are equally to be discovered amid the debris of this legendary history we see the god and the bayadere with a difference in the story of tawhaki and the divine girl tangotango one of the labours of hercules is traditionally preserved in the cleaning of the courtyard of rehua by the indefatigable rupe we know how classical tradition tells us that the milky way is but the stain from the fallen bowl when hebe lay a lapse of loveliness along the skies so here we find a certain kaitangata bleeding  and his blood running about over part of the heavens stained them and formed what we now call a ruddiness in the sky when therefore a red and ruddy tinge is seen in the heavens men say ah kaitangata stained the heavens with his blood if lesbos had its arion who rode the dolphin as skilfully as mr waterton did the cayman so does new zealand boast of its magician kae who stemmed the waves on the back of the gentlest of whales we may notice that in the distortion of stories which we believe ourselves to have more carefully preserved the parts and persons are often exchanged in our edition of hero and leander it was the lover who from before him put the parting waves and it was hy though window a sweet maiden sat grave with glad thoughts the antipodean minstrels tell the tale the other way and it is the fair girl hinemoa who dashes into the waves and crosses the boisterous strait as soon as her ear is struck by the soft measures from the horn of tutanekai hinemoa too has a way about her that strongly reminds us of that galatea whom dryden by the way has converted into a phyllis who pelted damaetas with apples and then hid herself among the willows with a strong desire of being found out  and hinemoa knew the voice that the sound of it was that of the beloved of her heart and she hid herself under the overhanging rocks of the hotspring but her hiding was hardly a real hiding but rather a bashful concealing of herself from tutanekai that he might not find her at once but only after trouble and careful searching for her so he went feeling about along the banks of the hotspring searching everywhere whilst she lay coyly hid under the ledges of the rock peeping out wondering when she would be found at last he caught hold of a hand and cried out hollo whos this  and hinemoa answered  its i tutanekai and he said but who are you whos i then she spoke louder and said  its i tis hinemoa and he said  ho  ho ho can such in very truth be the case  let us two go then to my house and she answered yes and she rose up in the water as beautiful as the wild white hawk and stepped upon the edge of the bath as graceful as the shy white crane and he threw garments over her and took her and they proceeded to his house ami reposed there and thenceforth according to the ancient laws of the maori they were man and wile anadyomene rising from the sea hardly looks more graceful than hinemoa the shy white crane upon the brink of the bath the galateas of the new zealand pastorals have it should be noticed their minerva to teach them the handiwork most useful to them thus kahukura learned the art of netting from the fairies but the pupil was not so proud as arachuc the dyers daughter of colopher who thought herself more nimble at the needle than the very goddess of the art there are no really comic legends among the traditionary stories of our new zealand brethren there is one piece of wit however at which they have never done laughing and they cannot hear it too often it consists of hearing a chief spoken of as being mistaken for a slave and asked to carry wood or perform other servile offices when this incident occurs then do they represent laughter holding both his sides their risibility at such an idea is inextinguishable diggory did not laugh half so willingly for twenty years at mr hardcastles daily story of old grouse in the gunroom as the new zealanders do at the bare and ticklish idea of a chief being asked to work or being spoken of as so employed the fact is as much out of the common order of things e with them as would be with us the sight of a prince consort posting bills in the strand or acting as conductor to an omnibus we conclude with a citation which will serve to 9how of what soft material and pleasant complexions fairies are composed in new zealand it is only necessary to premise that the hero and his friends had unconsciously intruded upon hallowed ground  te kanawa a chief of waikato was the man who fell in with a troop of fairies upon the top of pukemore a high hill in the waikato district this chief happened one day to go out to catch kiwis wih his dogs and when night came on he found himself right at the top of pukemore so his party made a tyre to give them light for it was very dark they had chosen a tree to sleep under a very large tree the only one tit for their purpose that they could timi  in fact it was a very convenient sleepingplace for the tree had immense routs sticking up high above the ground they slept beuveen these roots and made the fire beyond them as soon as it was dark they heard loud voices like the voices of people coming that way there were the voices of men ot women and of childien as if a very larc party of people were coming along tiley looked for a long time but could see nothing  till at last te kanawa knew the j noise must proceed from fail iej his people were all dreadfully frightened and would ha vu run away j if they could  hut where could they run to for they  were in the midst of a forest on the top of a lonely mountain and it was dark night for a long time the voices grew louder and more distinct as the fairies  drew nearer and nearer until they came quite close to the fire  te kanawa and his patty were half dead with fright at at tlu fairies approached to look at te kanawa who was a very handsome fellow to do this they kept peeping slily over the large rools of the tree under which the hunters were wing and kept constantly looking at te kanawa whilst his companions were quite insensible from fear whenever the lire blazed up brightly off went the fairies ard hid themselves peeping out from behind stumps and trees  and when it burnt low back they came close to it merrily singing as they moved hero you come dimbiir over mount tirang to vitit the handsome chief of ngupuhi whom we have done with a sudden thought struck te kanawa that he might induce them to go away if he gave them all the jewels he had about him  so he took off a beautiful little figure carved in green jasper which he wore as a neck ornament and a precious carved jasper eardrop from his ear ah te kanawa was only trying to amuse and please them to save his life but all the time he was nearly frightened to death however the fairies did not rush on the men to attack them but only came quite close to look at them as soon as te kanawa had taken off his neck ornament and pulled out his jasper earring and his other earring made of a tooth of the tigershark he spread them out before the fairies and offered them to the multitude who were sitting all round about the place  and thinking it better the fairies should not touch him he took a stick and fixing it into the ground hung his neck ornament and earrings upon it as soon as the fairies had ended their song they took the shadows of the earrings and handed them about from one to the other until they had passed through the whole party which then suddenly disappeared and nothing more was seen of them the fairies carried ott with them the shadows of all the jewels of te kanawa but they let behind them his jasper neck ornament and his earrings so that he took them back again the hearts of the fairies being quite contented at getting the shadows alone they saw also that te kanawa was an honest welldispositioned fellow however the next morning as soon as it was light he got down the mountain as fast as he could without stopping to hunt longer for kiwis this is a real connaught legend and we cite it as one more proof of a common origin of traditionary story and therewith we commit governor greys book to the public,folklore
