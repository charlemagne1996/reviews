B5141,['3326408'],  stories from the bible the first impression is what good value for money is this stout and well printed volume and by such an author  the next feeling is one of uneasy apprehension how  stories from the bible  the book is obviously not an anthology of extracts has mr de la mare been bold enough to rewrite the prose which is inwoven with the memories of childish years for so many of us  one opens the volume at random at the story of the plagues of egypt and starts reading a paragraph so it continued for seven days and when the seven days were at an end moses came again into the presence of pharaoh is ones fear allayed by that  or this for now the river not only continued to flow bloodred but the fish in it perished or this  the river stank and not the river alone   partly the prejudiced inclination for the already familiar has made us ready to be irritated on any provocation but still there is something not quite right about such things as these it seems somehow neither the bible nor the walter de la mare whose prose we admire so wonderingly we turn to the pleasant  introduction and find quickly that no man can be more convinced of the dangers that beset his task than the author himself for he says  ords in their influence are subtle and delicate beyond all things known to man and the least change in them when the are in company or the least addition to that company cannot but entail a change of meaning a change that is in their complete effect on the mind and spirit of the reader then to illustrate this truth mr de la mlare quotes parallel passages in the book of ruth from different versions the  wycliffe  i382 the  wycliffe  revised by john purvey 1386 the miles coverdale version 1536 the geneva bible 1560 the douai bible 16o9 the authorised version 161 i it is a most instructive lesson and just the kind which would leave a treasure in the mind for ever and there comes the reflection how happy a mortal is that child who discovers the  story  of c come hither  for himself and then reads what mr nahums grownup disciple has done in these renderings of old testament stories made  to put that remembrance of what the bible meant to him as a child  as completely as i can into words for doubts and fears depart with a straightforward reading it is no compliment to mr de la mare to pretend against ones better judgement that there are no flaws at all in the prose anywhere no flaws that is of a kind avoidable by such a writer as mr de la mare there are a few uneasy and inept touches when perhaps the wish to enliven the manner was not accompanied by his generally exquisite sense of rhythm and style but as a whole these renderings show that literary style and the simple beauty which should be but is too rarely made the test of suitability for childrens reading are not incompatible but necessary one to the other that alone is a triumph it is to be expected that in recording his imaginative experience of the old stories mr de la mare should sometimes abandon the bald directness of the bible narrative e  stories from the bible by walter de la mare 7s 6d faber  faber and though the change involves often a real sacrifice it is not difficult to be reconciled to the new beauty of detail introduced such detail and such atmosphere must surely give to a young reader visions which the old narrative alone could not even the sophisticated reader will find himself constantly thanking the author for enriched understanding fresh perceptions this is especially true where the setting allows scope for the characteristic prose of mr de la mare to say that the reader of  the riddle and other stories  will not be disappointed with this book is perhaps the aptest praise possible but this is to speak of the mere writing which if it is less free from the  defects and shortcomings  referred to by the author in his introduction is nevertheless the fruit of a task far more difficult accomplished as perhaps no other living english writer could have accomplished it consider the field covered by this volume divided into nine main sections headed  the garden of eden   the flood joseph   moses  the wilderness  samson samuel   saul david think of the dreadful pitfalls awaiting anybody who would rewrite the bible stories under these headings  is it not then a triumph to have enriched future generations of readers with so little offence to the most unprepared and irritable  there are uninteresting irrelevances and ugly barbarities in the old testament a child may come to such a book as this losing hardly anything of worth except an occasional marvel of directness but gaining contact with the ancient word and also with the rare mind of a poet writing in his own language r l megroz,juvenile

with equal pleasure we heartily recommend the little volume as a work very suitable for a present to young people al d that our readers may see the grounds on which we cordially praise it we proceed to furnish them with a short resume of its contents during seven months of the year the lofty mountain chain of switzerland known as the jura is covered with a mantle of snow and ice which prevents all access to it by travellers but during the other five months from may until october the scene changes then the snow disappears the forests are clad in all their verdant livery and excellent pastures are furnished by the rich grass allured by the latter attraction the swiss drive forth their herds to browse upon the mountain peaks of jura on these occasions the shepherds remain with their flocks until the hard winter again sets in residing during their absence from home in rude chalets formed of stone and occupying their intervals of leisure with the manufacture of the grweere cheeses so well known in the list of epicura delicacies the scene of the narrative of  three months under the snow which by the way is founded to 1 a very great extent upon facts is laid among the spots just described and commences at a time when the shepherds had driven back their flocks from the mountains of the jura one of these i shepherds frangoisthe father of pierre lopraz the little hero of the bookdoes not as was expected return with the others alarm is in consequence excited and pierre accompanied by louis his t fadther determines to proceed in eat of his mssing parent in the course of ascent up the mountain pierre has the  thee ontihe under the snow the journal of a yon inhabitant of the jun tranuated fro the french of oldpomowha rigiu tact society curosity to go near the edge of a dangerous ravine when his grandfather in his anxiety to warn him against the danger stumbles and sprains his foot no particular notice of the aeci dent is taken at the moment but it turns out to i be the pivot on which the whole plot turns on arriving at the pasture ground pierre finds his father well and intending to return the following day the illness of some of his cows having prevented him from leaving the mountain at the time when the other shepherds took their departure the whole party goes to sleep that evening in a rude chalet in which the father has resided during the summer but next day a new difficulty arises the old mans foot has so much swollen that he cannot walk and as there is not assistance enough to carry him back to the village it is arranged that pierre shall remain with him at the cottage while his father drives down the flock and brings back directly the needful aid from home the father departs accordingly although all parties have ominous misgivings the father trembles lest the snow should set in and bury them alive before his return while pierie and his grandfather are apprehensive that if the snowstorm actually comes on it will not only be fatal to them but will overwhelm franjois before he reaches the village meanwhile the mountains have begun to be tinged with snow and a loud wind is whistling past the cabin when suddenly it is recollected that there is another tenant of the cottagone indeed who turns out in the issue to be a most important one our wooden clock says the young hero in a diar which records the incidents of each dayhad scarcely struck threeat this moment i called my grandfathers attention to the bleating of the goat   poor blanchette said he  her milk is troublesome and she is calling us light the lamp we will go and milk her and then have our supper  the wind roared violently it rushed among the shingles which shook with its force so that we had some fear that the roof of the chalet would have been carried away i lifted my head several times fear nothing said my grandfather this house has sustained many similar assaults the shingles are loaded with large stones and the roof being nearly flat gives very little hold to the wind he then made me a sign to go before him and we entered the stable when the goat saw us she redoubled her bleatings she seemed ready to break her halter by the efforts she made to get to us how greedily she ate the handful of salt that i gave her her tongue licked my hand over and over again that she might not lose a grain she gave us a good pailful of milk such is our introduction to blanchette before the reader has done with her ho will find that she rises in importance until he is as much interested about her as he is about the other inmates of the snow prison on the regularity indeed with which she yields her milk the lives of the prisoners are found in a great measure to depend up to this time although the wind iwa been roaring around the mountain cottage there had been nothing to indicate that positive danger had set in on the following morning however when i i pierre awoke he was surprised to find himself in complete darkness at first he thought that his sleep had left him at an earlier hour than usual  grandfather he cried  you are up before daylight  my dear boy replied the old man  if we were to wait the light of day we should remain long enough in bed i fear the snow is above thewindow the terrible truth at last flashed on the mind they were entombed in the snow which had fallen thickly and heavily during the night they knew too from experience that there was little or no prospect of obtaining relief until the spring returned it is at this point that the peculiar value of the book as teaching presence of mind in danger and cheerful confidence in providence appears the old man who is pious takes a hopeful view of things and like mariners on a raft after the wreck of their vessel the little party begins to scrutinise the stores that are left to enable them to accomplish their arctic voyage pierre seeing that a glimmering of the sun appears down the chimney through a part which the snow has not choked up manages to emerge to the roof of the chalet  i but as nothing but bleak desolation meets his gaze he speedily comes down again a fire is lighted but in the midst of their confusion the little hut itself gets nearly burned down by the kindling of  some straw still their hearts do not fail to guard against similar emergencies they fill a tub with snow and place it beside the fireplace ready to extinguish any future conflagration their situation too is not found so cheerless as might have been imagined happily their wooden clock keeps correct time so that they do not lose their reckoning there is plenty of hay also for blanchette on whose life theirs now depend a limited stock of potatoes is also discovered while a bottle or two of swiss wine and some three loaves of hard mountain bread with a few other trifles turn up pierre likewise in the course of his researches finds an axe some straw to plait into hats and what proves a greater treasure still an old work of devotion which supplies them with admirable counsel in their difficulties leading them to earnest prayer to god for his protection and for the improvement of the trials which he has sent to them blanchette moreover is brought from the stable to the hut and proves pleasant company for them a month or more passes in this was pierre takes another journey to the roof and watching carefully the mode in which the snow lies conceives it possible to digg away some of the superincumbent portions of it so as to open the door and admit light to the window the brave and noble boy at the risk of much inconvenience and peril accomplishes his obect and once more the light of day refracted from piles of glittering snow and ice breaks in upon them they have not time however to enjoy this very much before another snowstorm sets in blocking the cottage doors and windows and covering the roof with a heavier load than before the old mans piety comes again to his aid and he encourages his nephew not to despond but to believe that this disappointment is ordered b7 providence for wise purposesa conclusion which is proved by the event but we must take the narration of this incident from the work itself december 13thwe had a dreadful alarm yesterday today even i can scarcely collect my thoughts enough to write down what has passed alas we are not yet sure that we have escaped all danger i was busy milking the goat while my grandfather was lighting the fire suddenly she pricked up her ears as if she heard some extraordinary noise and began to tremble all over swhat is the matter poor blanchette  i said caressing her but immediately we heard the most dreadful howlings as if it were over our heads  wolves i exclaimed silence my boy caress blanehette said my grandfather and he approached her himself and gave her some salt she continued to tremble and the howlings continued also well louis said he in a low voice  what would have become of us had you opened a passage to the window who knows if even the chimney might not have afforded a passage to those ravenous beasts   and do you think we are safe even as we are p i  i hope sobut speak low and do not cease to caress blanchetteher bleating might betray us one would have thought that she had the same fears for she did not make the slighitest noise my grandfather came and sat down by me i held the goat in my arms he had his hand laid upon my shoulder and i needed all the encouragement of his calm and serene countenance to keep me from shrieking aloud with fright au that i had previously experienced in the chalet could not be compared to the agony of yesterday throughout the whole day we passed it by the side of blanchette and at several intervals we heard the howlings of the wolves at one time it was so loud that i thought my last hour was come they are digging through the snow i cried clasping my grandfather in my arms they will i get in and devour us  the grandfather calms him however and the danger passes away the wolves it is conjectured had not scented the rich prize below but had brought the carcass of some animal and made the outcry which alarmed the inmates of the cottage by their quarling as they devoured their prey as the winter advanced a more serious trouble arose to daunt the heart of poor pierre for his grandfather unable to stand the severe cold gradually drooped and finally died what followed is well calculated to teach young people the value of calmness selfpossession and moral courage most boys under similar circumstances would have been iin danger of losing their reason but pierre encouraged by the excellent advice which his grandfather had given him before his death bears up even under his new trial the scene in which he is represented as digging a grave for his grandfather and interring him is not only admirably painted but divested of all repulsive features our youang hero was now lft alonea solitary hermit on the top of the jurawith nothing but his goat blanchette to keep him company and iyet he was not quit alone either for as mungo p ark was cheered in the african desert by seeing a flower so pierre was reminded of the omnipresence of the great creator by another equally striking incident a piece of rubbish had fallen down his chimney the noise attracted his attention and as apprehensive of the soot having taken fire he looked up an iron tube which sewved as an escape for the smoke a star passed over its orifice crossing it slowly at its greatest breadth the appearance lasted but a moment yet it affected pierre greatly reminding him that even in his forlorn condition apparently forgotten by every human being there was one to whom he could make known by prayer his wants and difficulties he had indeed poor fellow need of all the comfort he could get for one morning he heard around him what sounded like the final cruh of naturethe ceiling cracked pieces of plaster fell and a portion of the wall of the cottage lost its perpendicular after the uproar had ceased he began to fear that an avalanche had fallen in his neighbourhood covering for aught he knew the chalet with its fragments however the shock roused him from a state of dejection to face a new and perhaps more perplexing difficulty blanchette the goat began to cease giving her milka dreadful discovery for it threatens to reduce him to the cruel alternative of starvation or of killing the poor animal which has cheered by its company his solitary hours from day to day the condition of blanchette is recorded in pierres diary and we read with deep interest the accounts which show the allimportant milk to be continually diminishing  january 27the milk decreases and the goat fattens in proportion  february 2she has given even less milk than the day before and i have gained nothing

stoop she gave me a look of defiance as if she were standing on her guard against any further attempt i threw away my pail i sat down near the poor beast embraced her and wept bitterly what is the poor fellow to do now  it breaks his heart to think of killing the affectionate animal ah happily his trials are well nigh over on the 24th of february he lighted his fire scarcely had he done so when the smoke began to ascend and he heard a great noise without at first he thought it was the wolves which had returned but human voices are heard hailing him quicker and quicker come the strokes of the

stories which mr theal has collected during a residence of twenty years among the kaffirs are very curious and interesting and the information ho gives in his introduction and notes about these wild people among whom he has exercised many functions including those of a mission teacher and a border magistrateis most valuable the word kaffir he remarks is often used to signify any black native who is not the descendant of an imported slave but it is applied on the eastern frontier of the cape colony only to a member of the amaxosa tribe from these amaxosa the tales in mr theals volume were obtained the kaffir of the coast region ia described as  a model of a wellformed man possessing reasoning powers  quite equal to those of a white man it appears that for anything approaching frivolity he has a supreme contempt and therefore it is to be feared that any distinguished representative of his race who may visit london will carry away an unfavourable impression as regards fashionable society the language of the amaxosa is  rich in words and is musical in expression and it contains three clicks which are now represented in writing by the superfluous letters c q and x it is at first encouraging to be told that they are easily sounded separately by europeans  the c by withdrawing the tongue sharply from the front teeth the q by doing the same from the roof of the mouth and the x by drawing the breath in a peculiar way between the tongue and the side teeth but mr theal afterwards saddens his readers by the information that these clicks generally prove an insurmountable difficulty to an adult who wishes to learn to speak the language the language of the women varies a good deal from that of the men on account of  the custom called ukuhlonipa which prohibits females from pronouncing the names of any of their husbands male relatives in the ascending line or any words whatever in which the principal syllables of such names occur of many other curious customs mr theal supplies an interesting account especially as regards marriage death and witchcraft he gives a couple of curious instances of their superstitions which came under his own notice in 1875 a kaffir girl was drowned while bathing her companions ran away home and declared that she had been lured away into a dark hole by a spirit and that she cried out just before sinking for the last time  go and tell my father and mother that it took me her father immediately collected his cattle drove them into the water and implored the spirit  to take the choicest of them and restore his daughter he spoke in vain but  the failure to get the exchange effected is still attributed by the relatives of the drowned girl to the absence of one skilful to work with medicines in july 1881 a kaffir woman sorrowfully sought mr theals assistance the  witch  finder of the village had pointed her out as the person who had caused the death of a neighbours child the result of her being thus smelt out was that no one would so much as speak to her and even her own children avoided her such treatment was unendurable and mr theal interfered on her behalf the witchfinder was sent for and a large number of kaffirs appeared to judge the case it is pleasant to know that the witchfinder failed to satisfy the judges when the ordinary tests were put to him and when he was compelled to admit that he had never held converse with the people under the water he was convicted of imposition and his victim was acquitted of the terrible charge he had brought against her one of the most unreasonable of the ideas indulged in by kaffirs is that in consequence of which they use no kinds of fish as an article of diet and call them all snakes without distinction but they do not intend by so doing to insult the fishy race for  the snake is treated with great respect by the kaffirs if one is found in a hut the people will move out and wait patiently until it leaves the owner will say that it is perhaps the spirit of one of his ancestors who has come to visit him in this form the kaffir stories are for the most part wild and all but unintelligible a few of them appear to show traces of foreign influence and may possibly have adapted to south african uses certain incidents properly belonging to asiatic tales this may account for the resemblance between part of the story of the girl and the mbulu and the numberless asiatic and european variants of the tale which it has been proposed to call the substituted bride in the kaffir story the girl is induced to bathe and the mbulua fabulous being which can assume the human form but cannot part with its tailputs on her clothes and assumes her place passing itself off as a chiefs daughter and making the girl act as its servant the girl lightens her cares by song and sings the tale of her woes the neighbours who hear her test the truth of her metrical assertions satisfy themselves that the substituted bride for a wedding has taken place  has a mbulus tail and put the interloper to death the deceived bridegroom then marries the girl whose place the mbulu had usurped the story ends after a fashion which may be said to be original  she had a child and one day when it was playing a square pumpkin came out of the ground where the mbulu was buried and tried to kill the infant but the people chopped the pumpkin into pieces and burned it they afterwards threw the ashes into a river so that nothing more could come of that mbulu  though story of five heads also is one which resembles to a suspicious extent the numerous popular tales which tell how a foolish or haughty maiden turns a deaf ear to the good advice which is given to her while she is on her way to the dwelling of a demon or witch and suffers in consequence and how her wise or humble sister listens to similar counsel and is rewarded the demoniacal being in the kaffir tale is  a big snake with five heads and large eyes a creature of a foreign aspect closely akin to the sevenheaded snakes which are part of the stockintrade of russian and other storytellers one of the beings about whom a piece of advice is given to the kaffir damsel differs from those we are accustomed to hear of in european tales she is told that she will meet a man  whose head is under his armand she is advised not to take water from him she meets  a man carrying his head under his arm and takes water to drink from him in consequence the snake eventually kills her with his tail being discontented with the bread she has made for him the opening of  the story of the girl who disregarded the custom of ntonjane in which a snake comes out of a pool wherein a number of girls are bathing and takes possession of the clothes they have left on the bank is very like that of the russian story of  the watersnake which again is closely akin to a burmese tale of a waterspirit who marries a mortal maiden but the incidents which follow are entirely different there are several kaffir stories also which describe the apparent destruction of men and beasts by some monster and their ultimate rescue uninjured from its inside just as in the norse tale of  the devouring cat or the indian story of  the voracious frog in one of the kaffir variants of what seems to be a naturemyth which has dwindled into a grotesque story for children a monster called an inabulele swallows a young hero who finds inside it  his father and his mother and many people and cattle he pierces his living prison with his assagai and the captives escape in another tale two boys kill a glutton and their mother opens it whereupon people came out and cattle and dogs in a third the devouring creature is a monstrous cannibal  the men went and skinned the cannibal when a great number of people came from him one of though most thoroughgoing parallels with alien folktales is afforded by  the story of sikulume that hero wins the heart of the daughter of a demoniacal being named mangangezulu and flies with her from her fathers house the bereaved parent pursues but the girl throws down successively  an egg a milksack a pot and a smooth stone the demon is for a time baffled by the mist into which the egg turns the sheet of water which comes out of the milksack and the thick darkness due to the flinging down of the pot but he is not completely foiled until the smooth stone is thrown it became a rock a big rock with one side steep as a wall he could not climb up that rock and so he returned to his own village in european folktales a brush and a comb are the objects most often relied upon by similar fugitives very quaint though not absolutely novel is the story of the  big ugly cannibal with only one leg who took home a bag into which he had inserted a very nice girl and called all the other cannibals to come to a feast and they came expecting to get something nice but when the bag was opened it was found to contain  only snakes and toads for the girls father had effected an unwelcome substitution the other cannibals were so angry when they saw this that they killed him and made their feast off him quaint also is the  person with only one arm one side and one leg who kindly cries to magodas runaway children  see the cannibal has eaten the rest of me take care of yourselves the opening of the story of the cannibal who calls to demazana pretending to be her brother demana is singularly like that of the german story of  the wolf and the seven kids the kaffir girl replies  go away you cannibal your voice is hoarse you are not my brother he consults with another cannibal who advises him to burn his throat with a hot iron  he did so and then no longer spoke hoarse the girl admits him into the cave in which she lives and he carries her off in the german story grimm no 5 the wolf detected by the gruffness of its voice  went to a shop and bought a great piece of chalk which it ate and by that means rendered its voice more gentle by way of conclusion we may mention as an original story and one which is in accordance with the already mentioned kaffir idea about drowning  the story of tangalimlibo that lady who made it a rule never to go out in the daytime and was therefore known as the walker by moonlight was drawn under water one day when she had broken her rule in deference to her fatherinlaws repeated requests for water in vain did her fatherinlaw offer the riverspirit an ox in exchange for her she remained unseen all day when the night came her child cried so bitterly that its nurse carried it down to the river  then the mother of the child came out of the river and sang a sad song and afterwards took her child and put it to her breast to suck the story ends more happily than the russian tale of the dead mother who used to suckle her wasting child by night for a fat ox having been offered to the riverspirit by  a woman skilful in the use of medicines the demon was appeased  there was a great shaking and a rising up of the river and tangalimlibo came out there was great joy among those people when they took her home to her husband we trust that we have quoted enough from mr theals book to prove that it is one which may be cordially recommended,juvenile

margaret gatty illustrated by alice woodward g bell and sons 5s net this new edition of mrs gattys wellknown parables has some charming illustrations and is prefaced by a brief note or biography of the writer margaret scott the daughter of dr scott who had been foreign secretary to nelson and his chaplain on board the victory was born in 1809 after the battle of trafalgar dr scott became vicar of southminster and of catterick where margaret and her sister led a life of cultivated leisure such as does not seem possible to those of this generation who rush along through existence in the present hurry of the world the girl became a good french and italian scholar but her strong taste for natural history did not develop until much later in life when during a stay at hastings in 1848 she began to take an interest in seaweeds and zoophytes her  history of british seaweeds came out in 1862 there is little to record in her serene and uneventful lifemrs gatty never went beyond the united kingdombut her marriage to the rev alfred gatty vicar of ecclesfield and her death in 1873 her parables have survived the test of time and are remarkable for a certain sobriety a freshness of humour and for an unaffectedness rare in the style of literature to which they belong her knowledge of birds and beasts was minute and conscientious she cculd neve acquiesce in making scientific statements without ascertaining their accuracy and  when writing her  parables she was aided in verifying her facts by two scientific friends this truthfulness of her presentment of nature has much to

instructive annotations  and the charms of the authors fancy are increased by the artists responsive skill nothing that we can say is wanted to procure a welcome for mrs gatty in every home where there are children or those who sympathise with children but her many admirers will be grateful to mrs ewing for having in the present edition of her mothers bestknown work given them svh particulars of the authors life as wili bie them to ralise the scenes and circumstances which fed her fertile fancy and bent it in that direction where she achieved so much success margaret gatty waa the younger of the two daughters of dr scott lord nelsons chaplain and inherited both from her father and mother a love of learning and a power of turning it to account left motherless in her infancy she grew up within the quiet walls of a yorkshire parsonage books were her chief companions and from these as well as from constant intercourse with men of culture her education was derived it does not seem that she underwent any systematic course of training but her innate love of study and the abundant materials around her supplied her with all that she needed that her time was well employed is obvious from the facts that she attained considerable proficiency in art before her childhood was over and that when she was seventeen she began to translate dantes inferno into english verse and to illustrate each canto with appropriate designs in 1839 she married the rev alfred gatty dd vicar of ecclesfield where the remainder and most productive period of her life was spent her marriage says her daughter  like that of her parents was founded upon congeniality of aims and pursuits and her work met only with additional help and encouragement in her new home her first book entitled the fairy godmothers was published in 1851 and four years afterwardsthe first series of parables from nature with illustrations by the author herself appeared it is interesting to trace the origin of this mrs gattys most characteristic work she had been much struck with the beauty of adamss allegories and especially with that of  the old mans home and the kings messengers  but she was very much distressed that the mosses and green lizards should have been made emblems of sin in the story of  the distant hills and thought it a very undesirable association of ideas for the minds of children the subject awakened in her mind the memory of quarless emblems which had been her delight in childhood and prompted her to her first essay in morai teaching through natural objects with these her acquaintance was something more than superficial as the notes to the present edition abundantly show her powers of imagination and extensive range of reading enabled her to carry on with much success the plan she had adopted and five volumes of parables appeared between 1855 and 1870 on these her reputation is mainly based but we should not be doing justice to her industry and enterprise if we omitted to mention that within the same period she published numerous volumes of tales and a scientific treatise on british seaweeds and also started upon its successful course the admirable serial known to all children as aunt judys magazine mrs gatty died on october 4 1873 working almost to the end in spite of the disease which during the last ten years had invaded limb after limb and function after function until the intellect alone remained unimpaired her daughters criticism upon her writing is one in which most readers will concur and if we cannot call mrs gatty a genius we may readily allow that her sincerity commonsense and unaffected love of goodness render her a far better companion for children than many an author to whom that terra has been applied her tales are uniformly wholesome as well as attractive and it is in our opinion no slight recommendation that  not one of them depends for its pathos upon early deathbeds or unavailing regrets i charles j robinson f,juvenile

couple who resided on this snot were john and marion telfer their history i am now going to relate john was the only son of an honest industrious couple who lived in the neighbourhood of langholm but who unfortunately both died of a fever when he was little more than ten years old leaving him nothing but their blessing and thc virtuous habits of integrity and obedience in which they had trained him from his earliest youth on their deathbed they entreated that the excellent clergyman who in spite of the malignity of the disease continued to comfort and pray by them in their last moments would take compassion on their poor kttle orphan and find him employment among the neighbouring formers either as a herdhoy to some of the numerous flocks of sheep which arc common in eskdale or a ploughboy in their fields mr martin for such was thc name of the pious pastor assured them that he would do all in his power for their chikl and lie kept his word for as soon as they were dead he took thc boy home to hil own house and there endeavoured by kindness and sympathy to console him forhjs great and irreparable loss for some days ail ins endeavours were unsuccessful john though sensible of the kind attentions of mr murtin still felt miserable and unhappy all his dear mothers care and tenderness all thc pains and trouble that his kind father used to take in teaching him to read his bible after perhaps a hard days work thc delight with which they both watched his improvementall all rose to poor johns mind aud made him believe he newer more could be happy mr martin at last seeing the boys melancholy continue thought that a little employment might serve to rouse him he therefore one morning called john into hi study and asked him if he would be so good as to assist in dusting anel arranging some books which mere in a large chest in the  corner ofthe room john from lowness of spirits did not much like to bc employed  but as he had been taught by his father always to be obedient and to do at once whatever he was desired he immediately set about dusting thc books thc first two or three he merely wiped aud put them down without looking at them but at last rubbing one a leaf fell out which obligee him to open the book to put it back again the work happened to be a handsome edition of robinson crusoe with very beautiful prints mr martin who was watching him unobserved culled to him to bring the book and then told him he might look at the pictures if he pleased jolm who had never seen any thing of thc kind before was delighted with this permission and placing himself at a little distance so as not to disturb mr martin began turning over the leaves  his eyes sparkling and his little hands trembling with increased delight at every new scene that was represented at last he came to the one where man friday is saved from the savages here his curiosity got the better of the natural awe he felt for air martin  and he cried out  pray sir lie so good as to tell me what this meansfor though john had been taught to read his bible as well as his poor father was capable of teaching yet this was in so imperfect a way that he could by no means read easily and was obliged to spell more than half his words mr martin smiled goodnaturedly as johns exclamation made him raise his head from the book he was reading and desiring him to come near his chair he explained at some length what the print represented after which he asked john if he would not like to be able to read the story himself jolm immediately answered o dear yes sir that i should  but looking down and the tears starting into his eyes  that can never be now  for my dear father is dead and gone and nobody else will ever take thc trouble to teach so poor a boy jw i am anti yet continued he looking in mr martins face and brightening a little with a kind of hope  dont you think sir that if i succeed in getting a place and if i am very very attentive and alway taite pains to please my master i may in time be able to save out of my wage as much as a penny u week  for i know if i could do that i might so to the school at langholm 1 remember nearing my poor dear father wsh very much that he could afford to pay so much money forme as he said he waa sure that mr campbell would teach me to read much beater than he could the history proceeds through the innocent details of life such as it might bc found in a valley in the primitive age the young peasant grows up la understanding and morals and the ministers family is the place of tranquil virtue but there conies a disturbance to all this quiet in the conduct of a son the minister has hot had the power of communicating his own spirit to his turbulent boy and brother william runs off to sea leaving helen in sorrow the effects of this disobedience tire however most injurious to hil parents his mother overwhelmed with sorrow takes to her bed the scene that follows is pictured with great artlessness and we think with peculiar feeling letters arrive from william mentioning his having fixed himself on board a ship going to sea helen folded up the letters and sat for a few minutes considering on their content her own good sense and feelings of obedience to her parents pointed out to her in how very improper a style her brother wrote  but her love and affection for winiam made her try to excuse him  boys are so different from girls thought she  william hat been away so much too from home and besides he must chase a profession and rt would be hard not to leave him at liberty to be what he thinks himself flt for in the evening of this doy mrs martin felt herself better and for thc first time since her illness spoke to her husband on the subject of william mr martin told her he was with her brother and likewise that he had heard from himself he thea stated what captain elliott had said as to williams being allowed to remain with him but owned he was very averse to this pian mrs martin answered very calmly  my dear husband as fur as my judgement goes i perfectly agree with my brother i would not certainly have chosen that william should be a sailorif i could have prevented it hut as he has acted i think it is thc best thing we can now do he will be under my dear brothers care  and i shall now  controlled she looking at her husband with tendcitwsa  die in peace on hw account convinced fhat elliott will exert every means to correct and improve my poor boy thc last legacy of dying sister mr martin quite alarmed by this address asked lier if she felt herself worse and rose

evidently not meant for her husbands ear isle had remained quite motionless all the time she was speaking when she ceased he became almost convulsed with agony for some minutes but a violent shower of tears relieved him and most probably saved either his reason or his life or indeed perhaps both helen coming into the room showed him thc necessity of composure  and hastily passing her saying he must send answers to his hitters he left the room and shut himself up in his study there to implore compassion and resignation from a being who is never deaf to thc petitions ofthe humble and sincere believer a few days showed plainly that mrs martin knew her own situation but too well she appeared gradually though slowly sinking one evening she asked her husband to raise her up a little  and then desiring helen to bring her pen and ink she insisted on 1 teing allowed to write a few lines  i shall write very little  said she  but it is a duty thatimtst not be longer delayed she then wrote what appeared to be only a short note which she sealed and addressee to william anel putting it into her husbands hand saul  send this my love when all is over  not before it may comfort him poor fellow he will require comfort then mr martin now felt it his duty to inform his dear helen of the state her mother was really in but it was some time before bc could gain sufficient courage to break it to her one evening however seeing his wife worse than usual he was apprehensive that should her death take place while helen was unprepared it might have fatal effects upon the poor girls health he therefore followed her into her room when she went to prepare for bcd and there in the gentlest manner informed her of the truth helen at first wa in such a state of violent grief thtt she could listen to nothing her father said and indeed for some hours was utterly incapable either ef reusoiiug or exertion  but at last lifting up her head and jeeing her poor father pale anel exhausted leaning over her she started up aili throwing herself into his arms cried  forgive me my dearest father for being so selfish i will indulge in this almost criminal conduct no longer leave me for a few minutes you may trust me i will then join you anil endeavour to perform my duty both in attending the last moments of my prc eious mother and in being a comfort met a burthen to myeiilally dear father mr martin thought it bcif te comply with her rc quest and retired to try and subdue his own feelings that bc might be able to attend to his wife in half an hour helen and her father were at mrs martins bedside she smiled faintly when she perceived them holding out her hand she thus addressed her husband my dear i wish much to see my mother pray write for her she will i inn sure gratify me mr martin immediately left the room to send off a messenger to melrose mrs martin then took hold of helens hand and said  my clearest girl 1 wish to say a fewwords to you but it must be when you ure composed enough to listen to me the length to which this extract has run compels us to leave out thc last affecting advice of mrs m to her excellent daughter it thus concludes helen now in a quiet composed voice went over every circumstance that her mother had enumerated und added a sacred promise never to disobey her lust commands in thought or deed when she had so done her mother clasping her in her arms gave her in a solemn manner that most precious of all gifts to a dutiful child a dying mothers blessing she then aked for a little jelly and on her husbands coming into the room advised helen to take a turn in the garden and recruit herself by getting a little fresh air she obeyed and after a shower of tears became composed enough to return to her mournful duties within doors mrs ms mother mrs elliott arrived the next day when mrs martin had the satisfaction of gaining her consent to give up her house nt melrose ind come to live at the manse mr martin assured her that she should ever be considered by him os his own mother his wife joined their hands exclaiming my work is finished in this world i have now only to look forward to another and a better her work in this world did indeed seem finished the next day without any apparent change for the worse as her mother and helen were sitting by thc bedside and her kind anxious husband was supporting her in his arms she laid her head on his shoulder and seemed to fall asleep it was some minutes before he was aware that she was gone for ever thus perished one of the best and most exemplary of mothers entirely from anxious

history of an orphan who by the common accidents of rustic life and the easy exercise of rustic virtues makes his way through the world not indeed to title and estate the absurd lures of viiluge ambition but to competence tocharactcr to thc possession of the woman of his carly fondness and to perhh thc still higher reward the mer of giving his carly benefactors child a shelter under his roof anti repaying iib debt of gratitude to the sleeper in the grave hy invaluable kindness to the dejected being that he hail left behind to the struggles of the world the writer opens her design in a brief preface the author of this work many vcars ago spent a few weeks in kskdale the beauly of the country made a deep impression on her perhaps the more so from its being the farthest excursion to the southward that she bael then made from her native home the general character and manners of the inhabitants are she believes correctly represented for there is scarcely an incident exemplifying these of which she had not known the coiuiterpart in real life the respect universally paid by the parishioners to their clergyman mid the great influence which he possesses in forming their minds and morals are circumstances which have fallen under her own observation she hts felt a peculiar satisfaction in describing the simple und useful life of mr and mrs martin from thc remembrance of many worthy cjipls h hniltr situations sh ha ea deavoured in relating the adventures of john telfer thc herdboy to impress on the minds of her young readers the permanent advantages ot early integrity and gratitude in thc short and unfortunate life ot william martin she has attempted to show thc duty of subduing a disobedient and selfwilled temper the character of helen is meant on thc contrary to illustrate thc inestimable value of which a dutiful daughter may be her prudence steadiness and even energy on some trying occasions are the result of an education conducted on those principle which ensure the love of the child by a reliance on the justice and affection of the parent in short this is an excellent mothers book we give some extracts the narrative begins in this simple manner in the year 1807 there stood on the beautiful hanks of thc river esk in dumfriesshire one of the most southern countries in scotland a small cottage thc neat white walls ttcllthatched roof and clean casementwindows ornamented as they were with honeysuckles and roses attracteirthc admiration of the few strangers who from the uncommon beauty and grandeur of thc scenery were tempted to turn off the direct road from langholm to edinburgh and follow the windings of the river to its source the cottages in general in that part of the country present a very different appearance  having too frequently a look of neglect the windows broken the walls dirty and instead of a pretty garden a heap of mud before the door the contrast therefore rendered this build  ing thc more remarkable and led people to suppose what indeed was the case that its inhabitants were more industrious and had seen a little more of the customs of other countries than their less neat and cleanly neighbours the names of the couple who resided on this snot were john and marion telfer their history i am now going to relate john was the only son of an honest industrious couple who lived in the neighbourhood of langholm but who unfortunately both died of a fever when he was little more than ten years old leaving him nothing but their blessing and thc virtuous habits of integrity and obedience in which they had trained him from his earliest youth on their deathbed they entreated that the excellent clergyman who in spite of the malignity of the disease continued to comfort and pray by them in their last moments would take compassion on their poor kttle orphan and find him employment among the neighbouring formers either as a herdhoy to some of the numerous flocks of sheep which arc common in eskdale or a ploughboy in their fields mr martin for such was thc name of the pious pastor assured them that he would do all in his power for their chikl and lie kept his word for as soon as they were dead he took thc boy home to hil own house and there endeavoured by kindness and sympathy to console him forhjs great and irreparable loss for some days ail ins endeavours were unsuccessful john though sensible of the kind attentions of mr murtin still felt miserable and unhappy all his dear mothers care and tenderness all thc pains and trouble that his kind father used to take in teaching him to read his bible after perhaps a hard days work thc delight with which they both watched his improvementall all rose to poor johns mind aud made him believe he newer more could be happy mr martin at last seeing the boys melancholy continue thought that a little employment might serve to rouse him he therefore one morning called john into hi study and asked him if he would be so good as to assist in dusting anel arranging some books which mere in a large chest in the  corner ofthe room john from lowness of spirits did not much like to bc employed  but as he had been taught by his father always to be obedient and to do at once whatever he was desired he immediately set about dusting thc books thc first two or three he merely wiped aud put them down without looking at them but at last rubbing one a leaf fell out which obligee him to open the book to put it back again the work happened to be a handsome edition of robinson crusoe with very beautiful prints mr martin who was watching him unobserved culled to him to bring the book and then told him he might look at the pictures if he pleased jolm who had never seen any thing of thc kind before was delighted with this permission and placing himself at a little distance so as not to disturb mr martin began turning over the leaves  his eyes sparkling and his little hands trembling with increased delight at every new scene that was represented at last he came to the one where man friday is saved from the savages here his curiosity got the better of the natural awe he felt for air martin  and he cried out  pray sir lie so good as to tell me what this meansfor though john had been taught to read his bible as well as his poor father was capable of teaching yet this was in so imperfect a way that he could by no means read easily and was obliged to spell more than half his words mr martin smiled goodnaturedly as johns exclamation made him raise his head from the book he was reading and desiring him to come near his chair he explained at some length what the print represented after which he asked john if he would not like to be able to read the story himself jolm immediately answered o dear yes sir that i should  but looking down and the tears starting into his eyes  that can never be now  for my dear father is dead and gone and nobody else will ever take thc trouble to teach so poor a boy jw i am anti yet continued he looking in mr martins face and brightening a little with a kind of hope  dont you think sir that if i succeed in getting a place and if i am very very attentive and alway taite pains to please my master i may in time be able to save out of my wage as much as a penny u week  for i know if i could do that i might so to the school at langholm 1 remember nearing my poor dear father wsh very much that he could afford to pay so much money forme as he said he waa sure that mr campbell would teach me to read much beater than he could the history proceeds through the innocent details of life such as it might bc found in a valley in the primitive age the young peasant grows up la understanding and morals and the ministers family is the place of tranquil virtue but there conies a disturbance to all this quiet in the conduct of a son the minister has hot had the power of communicating his own spirit to his turbulent boy and brother william runs off to sea leaving helen in sorrow the effects of this disobedience tire however most injurious to hil parents his mother overwhelmed with sorrow takes to her bed the scene that follows is pictured with great artlessness and we think with peculiar feeling letters arrive from william mentioning his having fixed himself on board a ship going to sea helen folded up the letters and sat for a few minutes considering on their content her own good sense and feelings of obedience to her parents pointed out to her in how very improper a style her brother wrote  but her love and affection for winiam made her try to excuse him  boys are so different from girls thought she  william hat been away so much too from home and besides he must chase a profession and rt would be hard not to leave him at liberty to be what he thinks himself flt for in the evening of this doy mrs martin felt herself better and for thc first time since her illness spoke to her husband on the subject of william mr martin told her he was with her brother and likewise that he had heard from himself he thea stated what captain elliott had said as to williams being allowed to remain with him but owned he was very averse to this pian mrs martin answered very calmly  my dear husband as fur as my judgement goes i perfectly agree with my brother i would not certainly have chosen that william should be a sailorif i could have prevented it hut as he has acted i think it is thc best thing we can now do he will be under my dear brothers care  and i shall now  controlled she looking at her husband with tendcitwsa  die in peace on hw account convinced fhat elliott will exert every means to correct and improve my poor boy thc last legacy of dying sister mr martin quite alarmed by this address asked lier if she felt herself worse and rose to send for mr armstrong she krid her hand gently on his arm  my dearest love said she  i am not woree bm i own i have been watching for an opportunity of preparing your mtnd for what i believe myseltto be inrvitablc i do not suv i shall die immediately  yet i am convince my constitution is ao tdibjuered tliut a very short time will no t be allowed me to prepare for my uwful change i have thought that by letting yo know what my own mi nion is your mind would be better able to bear thc stroke when it happenstaau if it carno upon you suddenly besides my beloved husiand i have much to say to you with regard to helen at present i must have don my strength will not permit nie to continic the conversation only write my dearest love to my brother and tell hiin i consign my son entirely to his management  and i trust he will endeavour to guard his father from all future anxiety on his account he has cost him epiite enough already the last words were spoken so low that they were evidently not meant for her husbands ear isle had remained quite motionless all the time she was speaking when she ceased he became almost convulsed with agony for some minutes but a violent shower of tears relieved him and most probably saved either his reason or his life or indeed perhaps both helen coming into the room showed him thc necessity of composure  and hastily passing her saying he must send answers to his hitters he left the room and shut himself up in his study there to implore compassion and resignation from a being who is never deaf to thc petitions ofthe humble and sincere believer a few days showed plainly that mrs martin knew her own situation but too well she appeared gradually though slowly sinking one evening she asked her husband to raise her up a little  and then desiring helen to bring her pen and ink she insisted on 1 teing allowed to write a few lines  i shall write very little  said she  but it is a duty thatimtst not be longer delayed she then wrote what appeared to be only a short note which she sealed and addressee to william anel putting it into her husbands hand saul  send this my love when all is over  not before it may comfort him poor fellow he will require comfort then mr martin now felt it his duty to inform his dear helen of the state her mother was really in but it was some time before bc could gain sufficient courage to break it to her one evening however seeing his wife worse than usual he was apprehensive that should her death take place while helen was unprepared it might have fatal effects upon the poor girls health he therefore followed her into her room when she went to prepare for bcd and there in the gentlest manner informed her of the truth helen at first wa in such a state of violent grief thtt she could listen to nothing her father said and indeed for some hours was utterly incapable either ef reusoiiug or exertion  but at last lifting up her head and jeeing her poor father pale anel exhausted leaning over her she started up aili throwing herself into his arms cried  forgive me my dearest father for being so selfish i will indulge in this almost criminal conduct no longer leave me for a few minutes you may trust me i will then join you anil endeavour to perform my duty both in attending the last moments of my prc eious mother and in being a comfort met a burthen to myeiilally dear father mr martin thought it bcif te comply with her rc quest and retired to try and subdue his own feelings that bc might be able to attend to his wife in half an hour helen and her father were at mrs martins bedside she smiled faintly when she perceived them holding out her hand she thus addressed her husband my dear i wish much to see my mother pray write for her she will i inn sure gratify me mr martin immediately left the room to send off a messenger to melrose mrs martin then took hold of helens hand and said  my clearest girl 1 wish to say a fewwords to you but it must be when you ure composed enough to listen to me the length to which this extract has run compels us to leave out thc last affecting advice of mrs m to her excellent daughter it thus concludes helen now in a quiet composed voice went over every circumstance that her mother had enumerated und added a sacred promise never to disobey her lust commands in thought or deed when she had so done her mother clasping her in her arms gave her in a solemn manner that most precious of all gifts to a dutiful child a dying mothers blessing she then aked for a little jelly and on her husbands coming into the room advised helen to take a turn in the garden and recruit herself by getting a little fresh air she obeyed and after a shower of tears became composed enough to return to her mournful duties within doors mrs ms mother mrs elliott arrived the next day when mrs martin had the satisfaction of gaining her consent to give up her house nt melrose ind come to live at the manse mr martin assured her that she should ever be considered by him os his own mother his wife joined their hands exclaiming my work is finished in this world i have now only to look forward to another and a better her work in this world did indeed seem finished the next day without any apparent change for the worse as her mother and helen were sitting by thc bedside and her kind anxious husband was supporting her in his arms she laid her head on his shoulder and seemed to fall asleep it was some minutes before he was aware that she was gone for ever thus perished one of the best and most exemplary of mothers entirely from anxious solicitude about a son who in spite of all admonition and remonstrance had allowed j the growth and practice of disobedience for  several years to embitter his kind parents  lives und whose headstrong violence and selfwill at last brought the being whom he  most loved n earth to a premature grave  the narrative now rapidly approaches  to its close william perishes his father dies in purity and

B15,"['8467653', '4973077']",  the literary examiner danish fairy legends and tales by hans chris tian andersen pickering this is a charming little book of fairy tales and excellently well translated but why the tales should he called danish we do not perceive  except inasmuch as a dane is the author there is an occasional northern colouring but only so far as it could not be helped all the rest is so free from everything national or exclusive that we do not remember to have met with any production so given up to a sense of the variety of being that exists in the universe at times it is even painfully so we have so strong a sense given us of the feelings of ducks and ducklings  of swans and storks  of mermen and mermaidens  of nightingales flowers and daisies  even of slugs and cuttlefish  aud of what all sorts of animated creatures round about us think do and might say if they could speak that ones consciousness as a human being almost becomes lost in the crowd we begin to feel as mrs gulliver did when her husband returned from houynhnm land  and think we might as well take to being of a different species we need not say that it implies a rare and surprising art to convey such impressions as these when johnson laughed at goldsmith for thinking of writing a story in which u little fish should be the actors the author of animateil xetture very properly told him that it was not so easy a matter as he thought it  and that if he johnson were to write such a story he would make his little fish talk like  great whales there is no such confusion of ideas in mr hans christian andersen his whales and his little fish all talk in character we are not sure that we ourselves after reading his book could not have talked at pleasure like sharks minnows mermaids bulls ducks or green teas for his vegetables have as much conversational character as his ducks and geese nay his very pegtops and balls are full of individuality there is a pathetic daisy in his story of that name who is quite a  sweet creature for the pastoral beauty of her tongue  and in another story there is a leatter ball of so aristocratical a character that when proposals are made to her by a pegtop because they happen to have been companions in the same drawer she indignantly asks him whether he is aware that her father and mother were morocco slipjiers and that she has  cork in her body we are here however it may be said confusing the specific and the superinduced character mr andersen keeps all clear he has so just a sense of the necessity of adhering to verisimilitude and of the forgetfulness of it on the part of writers in general that he introduces one of his stories with a remark that ought to become proverbial  in china the emperor is chinese esome of his descriptive touches recall the wonderful observation and exquisitely graphic felicity of mr dickens there is a wretched little hut in the tale of the ugly duclding  so wretched that it knew not on which side to fall and therefore remained standing admirable is the picture of the stork parading about on his long red legs discoursingin egyptian which language he had learned from his mother who does not feel that egyptian ls the very language that by way of accomplishment a stork would know  the touches of tnis kind are innumerable the fault of the book if we must find one is that all the stories have too much meaning  that they overflow with intention and moral not always obviously sometimes obscurely but still with incessant intelligence you desire occasionally something more childish and less clever and some of the stories nre too long but the genius and refinement are undeniable we must give an extract and are somewhat at a loss so many of the teles nave such strone chums but with all the fairy fancy of the volume in general perhaps the beet story nevertheless if that whkh k least mirylike it rn celled the bmpem nemcbmm voaumvmbtkhm westra of the spirit of humbug ead of the way in wbicb the

io my realms are unfit for their office and fatso be able to distinguish the wise from the foolish i this stuff must be woven for me immediately and he caused large sums of money to be given to both the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly  so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected to work very busily though iu reality they did nothing ait all they asked for the most delicate ails and the purest gold thread  put both into their own knapsacks  and then continued their pretended work at the empty looms until lau aat aaight   i should like to know how the weavers are getting on with nay cloth said the emperor to himself after some little time had elapsed  he wa however rather embarrassed when he remembered that a simpleton or oiae unfit for his office would be unable to seo the manufacture  to be sure be thought  he had notheaeg to risk ita his own person  but vet he would prefer memling soaeeobodv else to bring him intelligence about the weavers

how igiaomaat their neighbours might prove to be   1 wall send nay faithful old minister to the weavers said the emperor at last after some deliberation  he will be best able to see how the cloth

that lae might repeat them to tiae emperor aud theta the knaves asked for moro silk aaael gobi saying that it was necessary to complete what they had beguia however they put all that was given them into their kaaapsacks  anet continued to work with as much apparent diligence as before at their empty looans  the emperor now sent another officer of his ceaurt to see how the mon were getting on and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready lt was just the same with this gentleman an with the minister lae surveyed the looms ou all sides but could see laothiug at all but the empty frames   does not the stuff appear as beautiful to you as it did to my lord the minister r asked the impostors o the emperors seconel ambassador at the same time making the same gestures as before atad talking of the deaeigu and cejiours which were not there   i certainly am not stupid  thought the messenger  it must be that i am not fit for my good profitable office  that is very odd however no one shall know anything about it and accordingly he praised the stuff he eomld not see aud declared that he was delighted with both colours nnd patterns  iudeed please your imperial majesty said he to his sovereign when he returned  the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent  the whole city was talking of the splendid cloth which the emperor had ordered to be woven at his own expense  and now the emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture whilst it was still on the loom accompanied bv a select number of officers of the court among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the doth he went to the crafty impostors who ss soon as they were aware of the emperors approach went on working more eli ligently than ever although they still did net pits a

children in the mhool ef mr hans christian audersen  wzctzon idanish fairy legends and tales by hans christian andersen london 1846 pickering sonie time since these tales were noticed amid the foreign literature of the critic that notice attracted to them considerable attention and translations were immediately commenced in various quarters the first that has made its appearance is now before us exquisitely printed at the aldine press and tastefully bound so as to form a birthday gift or school prize as attractive in external appearance as it will prove in its contents which are precisely such as youth most loves to read appealing at once to the imagination aud the heart conveying the morality of poetry and the poetry of morality an dersen has succeeded beyond all modern writers in catching the spirit as wvell as the manner of the legendary lore of his country it may be that he has only remodelled fables already current among the peasantry of denmark but even if he be not the inventor he is entitled to much applause for the skill with which he has put them into presentable shape without divesting them of the simplicity of language and the air of childlike faith in their literal truth which are essential to the storyteller and in which in fact lies the differ i encebetween the real and the false legend making the latter however cleverly constructed dull and uninteresting when compared with the former andersen writes as if he thoroughly believed that there was a time when beasts and birds talked like christian men  when i fairies danced anl mermaids sung in this lies the  charm of his legends and tales anrd for this and be 1 cause they invariably carry a wholesome moral without thrusting it offinsively forward teaching it rather by the example than by precept do we heartily recommend this volume to young persons and to the regards of all who are looking for an acceptable present for their young friends the translator who wve understand is a lady has performed her task with a hearty appreciation of the characteristics of the author which she has carefully preserved by rendering the simple language of the original into a pure and simple english so well fitted to convey legends and tales such as these and always so charming because so intelligible to children as specimens both of author and translator anl as in themselves worthy of perusal we extract some of these legends what poetry there is in the daisy listen to my story  in the country close by the road 4 side there stands a summerhouseyou must certainly have i seen it in front is a little garden full of flowers enclosed by i white palings with green knobs and on a bank outside the i palings there grew amidst the freshest of grass a little daisy i the sun shone as brightly and warmly upon the daisy as upon i the splendid large flowers within the garden and therefore it grew hourly so that one morning it stood fully open with its delicate white gleaming leaves which like rays surrounded the t little yellow sun in their centre it never occurred to the 1 little flower that no one saw her hidden as she was among i the grass she was quite contented  she turned towards the i warm sun looked at it and listened to the lark who wasf singing in the air the daisy was as happy as if it were they day of some high festival and yet it was only monday the c children were at school  and whilst they sat upon their forms hi and learned their lessons the little flower upon her green stalk n learned from the warm sun and every thing around her how 1 good god is meanwhile the little lark expressed clearly and 0 beautifully all she felt in silence and the flower looked up a with a sort of reverence to the happy bird who could fly and d sing it did not distress her that she could not do the same a  i can see and listen thought she  the sun shines on mne h and the wind kisses me oh how richly am i blessed 94 there stood within the palings several grand stifflooking t flowers the less fragrance they had the more airs they gave fl themselves the peonies puffed themselves out in order to ai make themselves larger than the roses the tulips had the b gayest colours of all they were perfectly aware of it and held ti themselves as straight as a candle that they might be the better 01 seen they took no notice at all of the little flower outside c the palings but she looked all the more upon them thinking y4 how rich and beautiful they are yes that noble bird will st surely fly down and visit them how happy am 1 who live al so near them and see their beauty  just at that moment vi ji quirrevit the lark did fly down but he came not to the peonies nor the tulips no he flew down to the poor little ac daisay in the grass who was almost frightened from pure joy in and knew not what to think she was so surprised the little to bird hopped about and sang  oh how soft is this grasm rtand what a sweet little flower blooms here with its golden of heart and silver garment  for the yellow centre of the daisy rn looked just like gold and the little petals around gleamed silver n white ihow happy the little daisy was  no one can imagine of how happy the bird kissed her with his beak sang to her le and then flew up again into the blue sky it was a full quarhe ter of an hour ere the flower recovered herself half ashamed n and yet completely happy she looked at the flowers in the th garden they must certainly be aware of the honour and haput piness that had been conferred upon herthey must know tir j how delighted she was but the tulips held themselves twice al as stiff as before and their faces grew quite red with anger as i to the peonies they were so thickheadedit was indeed well he that they could not speak or the little daisy would have heard something not very pleasant the poor little flower could see  well that they were in an illhumour and she was much vexed at it soon after a girl came into the garden with a knife i sharp and bright she went up to the tulips and cut off one after another  oh  that is horrible sighed the daisy  it  is now all over with them the girl then went away with the i tulips how glad was the daisy that she grew in the grass lit outside the palings and was a despised little flower  she felt e really thankful and when the sun set she folded her leaves is went to sleep and dreamed all night of the sun and the beaul tiful bird the next morning when our little flower fresh ir and cheerful again spread out all her white leaves in the sunshine and clear blue air she heard the voice of the bird but he is sung so mournfully alas  the poor lark had good reason for e sorrow he had been caught and put into a cage close by the ly open window lie sang of the joys of a free and unrestrained i flightlie sang of the young green corn in the tields and of the pleasure of being born up by his wings in the open air the poor bird was certainly very unhappyhe sat a prisoner in his narrow cage  the little daisy would so of illingiv have  helped him but how could she  ah that she knew not she squite forgot how beautiful all around her was how warmly the sun shone how pretty and white her leaves were alas  she could only think of the imprisoned bird for whom it was not in her power to do anything all at once two little boys 1 came out of the garden one of them had a knife in his hand e as large and as sharp as that with which the girl had cut the y tulips they went straight up to the little daisy who could e not imagine what they wanted  here we can cut a nice r piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys and he began n to cut deep all round the daisy leaving her in the centre it i tear out the flower said the other boy and the little s 1 daisy trembled all over for fear for she knew that if she were e torn out she would die and she wished so much to live as she e was to be put into the cage with the imprisoned lark  no g leave it alone  said the first  it looks so pretty  and so e it was left alone and was put into the larks cage but the s poor bird loudly lamented the loss of its freedom and beat e its wings against the iron bars of its cage and the little flower e could not speak could not say a single word of comfort to ihim much as she wished to do so thus passed the whole imorning  there is no water here said the imprisoned vlark they have all gone out and forgotten me not a drop 1 of water to drink  my throat is dry and burning there is fire and ice within me and the air is so heavy  alas  i must i die i must leave the warm sunshine the fresh green trees and all the beautiful things which god has created  and then he pierced his beak into the cool grass in order to refresh him self a little and his eye fell upon the daisy and the bird bowed to her and said  thou too wilt wither here thou poor little flower  they have given me thee and the piece of green iaround thee instead of the whole world which i possessed before  every little blade of grass is to be to me a green i treethy every white petal a fragrant flower alas  thou only remindest me of what i have lost  oh that i could comfort him  thought the daisy but she could not move yet the fragrance which came from her delicate blossom was stronger than is usual with this flower the bird noticed it and although panting with thirst he tore the green blades in very anguish he did not touch the flower it was evening and yet no one came to bring the poor bird a drop of water he stretched out his slender wings and shook them convulsivelyhis song was a mournful  pipi his little head bent towards the flower and the birds heart broke from thirst and desire the flower could not now as on the preceding evening fold together her leaves and sleep she bent down sad and sick to the ground the boys did not come till the next morning and when they saw the bird was dead they wept bitterly they dug a pretty grave which they adorned with flower petals the birds corpse was put into a pretty red box royally was the poor bird buried whilst he yet lived and song they forgot himleft him suffering in his cage and now he was highly honoured and bitterly bewailed but the piece of turf with the daisy in it was thrown out into the street no one thought of her who had felt pnost for the little bird and who had so much wished to comfort him what a moral in the buckwheat if after a tempest you chance to walk through a field where buckwheat is growing you may observe that it is burnt as black as though a flame of fire had passed over it and should i you ask the reason the peasant will tell you that the lightning has done it but how is it that the lightning has i done it  i will tell you what the sparrow told me and the sparrow heard the story from an old willowtree which grew and still grows close to a field of buckwheat this willowtree is tall and highly respectable but at the same time old and wrinkled its trunk had been riven asunder from top to bottom grass and brambles grow out of the gap the tree bends forward and the branches hang down almost to the ground looking like long green hair there were different kinds of corn growing in the fields around the willowrye wheat and oatsthe beautiful oats whose ears when they are ripe look like a number of little yellow canarybirds sitting upon one branch the cornears were richly blessed and the fuller they were the lower they bowed their heads in pious humility but there was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willowtree the buckwheat bowed not like the rest of the cornhe stood stiff and proud  i am quite as rich as the wheat said he i and besides i am so i much more handsome my flowers are as beautiful as the i blossoms of the appletree it is delightful to look at me and l my companions do you know anything more beautiful than l we are you old willowtree  and the willowtree bent his l head as much as to say  yes indeed i do  but the f buckwheat was puffed up with pride and said  the stupid  tree he is so old that grass is growing out of his body  c now ctnne a dreadful storm all the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads whilst it passed over them 1 the buckwheat lowever in his pride still stood erect t  bow thv head as we do  said the flowers  i have no c need said the buckwheat  bow thy head as we do said  i the corn  the angel of storms comes flying hitherward hei h has win s which reach from the clouds to the earth he will it strike thee down before thou hast time to entreat for mercy n  no i will not bow said the buckwheat close thy i p flowers and fold thy leaves said the old willowtree look a not into the flash when the cloud breaks even men dare not n do that for in the flash one looks into gods heaven and that t sight can dazzle even human eves  what then would it prove tl to mere vegetables like us if we should dare to do so we al who are so inferior to men  so inferior indeed  said the ir buckwheat now then i vid look right into gods nr heaven and in his pride and haughtiness he did gaze upon c the lightning without shrinking such was the flash that it southeast seemed as if the whole world was in flames when the tem southeast pest was over flowers and corn greatly refreshed by the rain re once more breathed pure air but the buckwheat had been ta burnit as black as a coal by the lightning it stood on the field e a dead useless plant and the old willowtree waved its branrelse to and fro in the wind  and large drops of water th fell from the green leaves as though the tree wept and the of svarrows asksd  winv weepest thou  it is so beautiful here  to see howvthe sun shines  how the clo uds pass ever the clear i sky  hvw sweet is the fragrance of the flowers 1whv then a eellest thou old willowtree  ard the willow tree told of 11 ti iuek wleat s prise anl hao zhl iil e and of the crux lisol law a ei1 full hal i  re  a is lorv liar ir orthe sparrowsthey told it to me one evening when i asked ul them for a tale endt what sly satire in n the emperors new clothes iad many years ago there was an emperor who was so exces mst sively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress pt he did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor ith did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase except for iv the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new ud clothes he had a different suit for each hour of the day and nd as of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he  he is sitting in council it was always said of him  the he emperor is sitting in his wardrobe time passed away tie merrily in the large town which was his capital strangers arrived every day at the court one day two rogues calling themselves weavers made their appearance they gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colours and elaborate patterns the clothes manufactured from re which should have the wonderful property of remaining in as visible to every one who was unfit for the office he held or id who was extraordinarily simple in character  these must he indeed be splendid clothes  thought the emperor  had i as i such a suit i might at once find out what men in my realms he are unfit for their office and also be able to distinguish the v wise from the foolish  this stuff must be woven for me im r mediately and he caused large sums to be given to both id the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly to so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected be to work very busily though in reality they did nothing at all ie they asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold it thread put both into their own knapsacks and then con e tinned their pretended work at the empty looms until late at e night  i should like to know how the weavers are getting g on with my cloth said the emperor to himself after some ie little time had elapsed he was however rather embarrassed is when he remembered that a simpleton or one unfit for his goffice would be unable to see the manufacture  to be sure ht lie thought i he had nothing to risk in his own person but n yet he would prefer sending somebody else to bring him in 0 telligence about the weavers and their work before he e troubled himself in the affair all the people throughout d the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to n possess and all were anxious to learn how wise or how ignos rant their neighbours might prove to be  i will send my e faithful old minister to the weavers said the emperor at last i after some deliberation  he will be best able to see how the cloth looks for he is a man of sense and no one can be more i suitable for his office than he is so the faithful old minister went into the hall where the knaves were working with all their might at their empty looms v what can be the meaning of this  thought the old man opening his eyes very wide d i cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms however he did not express his thoughts aloud the impos1 tors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms and then asked him whether the design pleased him and whether the colours were not very beautiful at the same time pointing to the empty frames the poor old minister looked and looked he could not discover any thing on the looms for a very good reason viz there was nothing there  what  thought he again is it possible that i am a simpleton  i have never thought so myself and no one must know it now if i am so can it be that i am unfit for my office no that must not be said either i will never confess that i could not see thestuff 1 well sirminister said one of the knaves still pretending to work  you do not say whether the stuff plleases you  oh it is excellent  replied the old minister loking at the loom through his spec tacles  this pattern and the coloursyes i will tell the emperor without delay how very beautiful i think them w e shall be much obliged to you said the impostors and then they named the different colours and described the pattern of the pretended stuff the old minister listened attentively to their words in order that he might repeat them to the eimtperor and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold saving that was neeesary to complete what they had begun llowcvcr they put all that was given them into their knapi s9c1 mnld c tinued to work vwith as much aippmrent diligence kfjrc t iir cq1ty looms the enpietor now rent au other officer of his court to see how the men were getting on i and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready it t was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister he i surveyed the looms on all sides but could see nothing at all  but the empty frames does not the stuff appear as beautiful l to you as it did to my lord the minister  asked the imposx tors of the emperors second ambassador at the same time  making the same gestures as before and talking of the design i and colours which were not there  i certainly am not stupid i thought the messenger  it must be that i am not fit for i my good profitable office that is very odd however no l one shall know any thing about it and accordingly he i praised the stuff he could not see and declared that lie was i delighted with both colours and patterns  indeed please your imperial majesty said he to his sovereign when he returned  the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent the whole city was talking of the 4 splendid cloth which the emperor had ordered to he woven at his own expense and now the emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture whilst it was still on the loom accompanied by a select number of officers of the court among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth he went to the crafty impostors who as soon as they were aware of the emperors approach went on working more diligently than ever although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms is not the work absolutely magnificent   said the two officers of the crown already mentioned if your majesty will only be pleased to look at it what al splendid design what glorious colours and at the samz l time they pointed to the empty frames for they imagined that i every one else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship  how is this  said the emperor to himself  i can see nothing  this is indeed a terrible affair  am i a simpleton or am i unfit to be an emperor  that would be the worst thing that could happenoh the cloth is charming said he aloud  it has my complete approbation and he smiled most graciously and looked closely at the empty looms for on no account would lie say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much all his retinue now strained their eyes hoping to discover something on the looms but they could see no more than the others nevertheless they all exclaimed  oli how beautiful  and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material for the approaching procession magnificent charming  excellent  resounded on all sides and every one was uncommonly gay the euperor shared in the general satisfaction and presented the impostors with the ribbon of an order of knighthood to be worn in their buttonholes and the title of  gentlemen weavers the rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place and had sixteen lights burning so that every one might see how anxious they were to finish the emperors new suit they pretended to roll the cloth off the looms cut the air with their scissors  and sewed with needles without any thread in them 1 see  cried they at last  the emperors new clothes are ready  and now the emperor with all the grandees of his court came to the weavers  andl the rogues raised their arms as if in the act of holding something up sayings  here are your majestys trowsers here is the scarf here is the mantle  the whole suit is as light as a cobweb one might fancy one has nothing at all on when dressed in it that however is the great virtue of this delicate cloth  yes indeed  said all the courtiers although not one of them could see any thing of this exquisite manufacture  if your imperial majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes we will fit on the new suit in front of the lookingglass the emperor was accordingly undressed and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit the emperor turning round from side to side before the lookingglass h how splendid his majesty looks in his new clothes and how well they fit  every one cried out  what a design what colours  these are indeed royal robes   the canopy which is to be born over your majesty in the procession is waiting announced the chief master of the ceremonies  i am quite ready answered the emperor 1 do my new clothes fit well  asked he turning himself round again before the lookingglass in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit the lords of the bedchamber who were to carry his majestys train felt about ou the ground as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle and pretended to be carrying something for they would by no means betray anything like simplicity or unfitness for their office so now the emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession through the streets of his capital and all the people standing by and those at the windows cried out  oh how beautiful are our emperors new clothes  what a magnificent train there is to the mantle and how gracefully the scarf hangs  in short no one would allow that he could not see these muchadmired clothes because in doing so he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office certainly none of the emperors various suits had ever made so great an impression as these invisible ones but the emperor has nothing at all on  said a little child  listen to the voice of innocence  exclaimed his father and what the child had said was whispered from one to another  but he has nothing at all on  at last cried out all the people the emperor was vexed for he knew that the people were right but he thought the processionx must go on now and the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever to appear holding up a train although in reality there was no train to

B5565,['8652563'],  young benjamin franklin or the right road through life a boys book on a boys own subject by henry mayhew with illus trations by john gilbert bryce young benjamin franklin is a biographic fiction that will meet with readers of mature years who will lay it aside acknowledging that it is healthy in tone and amusing notwithstanding the many violations of artistic orthodoxy which render it useless as a memoir and unsound as a view of life in his preface mr mayhew defends himself by anticipation against the censure to which he feels he has rendered himself liableand in doing so explains both thc object and the internal structure of his work i give he says the present volume to the youth of the time in the hope that it may serve them for what i myself felt the want of more than anything after leaving westminster school as a young man crammed to the tip of ones tongue with latin and greek and nothing else viz for something like a guide to what uncle ben calls the right road through life to accomplish this undertaking an endeavour is made to set forth though means by which benjamin franklin acquired that purpose and will which not only raised him to the foremost rank of transatlantic statesmen and scholars but also enabled him emphatically to lead thc lifo of goodness the opening chapters in which little ben is displayed in the domestic circle of the boston tallowchandler pinned down to the ungrateful occupation of cutting wicks in readiness for  melting day dreading his fathers penal  strap devouring the pages of  robinson crusoe and running away from the home to which he is brought back penitent and scared aro of no common merit indeed they arouse a hope that the succeeding chapters will give a vigorous picture of the society so admirably adapted for literary illustration in which the early years of franklin were passed no such portrait is however attempted with the conclusion of part i mr mayhew may be said to bid farewell to his subject as faras nature and troth are concerned little ben bet ween the years often and twelve ls given over to the tutelage of his uncle ben who takes him about boston to see life and instils into his ductile mind the precepts of morality and philosophic observation though child and his mentor visit the palaces of the rich aud the garrets of the poor penetrate workhouses and jails and hold edifying conversations on the pleasures of art the world of opinion  though purport of intellectual pleasure and other similar subjects of a metaphysical nature that little boys often years old are known to prefer to skating or squalcs surely so practical a writer as mr mayhew does not need to be told that the intellectual and moral characteristics of a remarkable man cannot reasonably be accounted for by showing that he enjoyed the advantages of associating with a septuagenarian who poured into his ear sonorous preachings about tning3 in general which like coleridges monologues commenced without premises und ceased without conclusions let mr mayhew be honest and confess how much ho remembers of his experiences of ten and twelve apart from flogging and birchrods has ho a dozen vivid reminiscences of his early westminster career franklins character was formed by the stern lessons taught him in the school of adversity by the stirring events of contemporary history by the political atmosphere he breathed in early manhood and more than all by the characters of thc men with whom he as a bold and inquiring young man was brought into contact but mr mayhews theory astounding as it is has more kinship to troth than have the pictures with which he endeavours to sustain it the life to which little ben is introduced is london life in the year of out lord 1861 not boston life in the last century there is not even an attempt to impart an american colouring or an air of historic fidelity to these deportations from the banks of the thames the fop and the miser the gourmet and the dnmkard are of sound old british oak without any touch of yankee veneering so also uncle ben is the peculiar product of the nineteenth century being compounded in equal parts of wordsworth lord shaftesbury ami mr buckle in his preface mr mayhew argues that he is justified in creating uncle ben and giving him such prominence in the drama by that shakspeorian nile of art  which often throws an internal moral principle into an external dvamaiis pmmtn as the witches in  macbeth are merely the outward embodiment in a weird and shadowy form of macbeths own ambition and have obviously been introduced into the play with the view of giving a kind of haunted and fatalistic air to a bloody and devouring passion even so in a small way has uncle ben here been made the exponent of the franklin view of life but herein lies the difference between the witches in  macbeth and the uncle ben of the childs story shakespeares conception was in accordance with historic truth and the notiorh relative to supernaturalism that existed in his day and were believed by his auditors to have existed in the days of macbeth whilst mr mayhews conception is directly at variance alike with events and opinions the prison visited by little ben and his uncle in boston a hundred years since is the author informs us what does the reader imaginetothill fields prison as it appeared in 1856 how could a sight of thc abuses of our modern system of prison discipline have had a part in fashioning the mind of franklin  it would be ns reasonable to write the life of peter the great showing that his whole aftercareer was the result of his reading vanity fair or hearing of the balaclava charge,juvenile

we hope it may and that mr gaskin for all his merits may not run away with all the praise a good many of mr gaskins drawings for the book will have been seen at the arts and crafts exhibition where they had an honoured place and no wonder the school of draughtmanship to which outwardly he belongs has prodiiced a great deal of work beautiful regarded as mere decorati n but which set to illustrate tales of real moving human life is unsatisfactoryit delights the eye but it is not what illustrations should be a commentary on an illumination of the text this cannot be said of the pictures here while altogether removed from commonplace realism they are yet instinct with life with feeling with humour the tenderness in the loveliest rose of the world in the bond of friendship in  ib and

robert neumann 7s 6d peter davies the rest is silence bv c and  scharten antink s 6d rich  cowan these five novels can be safely recommended to readers in search of stories which are far removed from the doings of everyday english life mlr kincaid takes us to an indian native state and the two foreign novels deal with international finance and life in italian prisons mr bell and  taffrail certainly begin their stories with conventional english backgrounds but they soon sweep us into adventures and excitements which have nothing in common with our ordinary experience the most exotically minded reader can hardly complain that these five authors have not served him well  durbar  is mr kincaids first novel and his account of twentyfour crowded hours in the life of an indian state is written with freshness and vigour some of his descriptive passages are slightly overloaded with detail but that is a small fault in a book which has so many virtues the rajah who was educated at oxford his unhappy wife and the princess indira who sponsors the plot against him are vividly realised characters and their strangeness is well contrasted with the western equanimity of the british resident and his wife the discovery and overthrow of the plot to assassinate the rajah lead to an unexpected climax which brings with it the dawn of a new hope for the imaginary state in which the action has taken place the story is tense and exciting but the great value of  durbar lies in its picture of a section of indian life which is quite different from the usual angloindian scene mr neil bell begins his new novel with a study of a small shopkeeper in a provincial town but the ham and beef shop at the corner of franklin road is swept away in the general chaos when a scientist annihilates several atoms and destroys the civilised world a number of men and one woman who were making a trial trip in a new submarine are lucky enough to survive and the responsibility for preserving the human race devolves on this small community mr bell has made good use of the opportunities which such a situation provides but the experiences of his solitary heroine in an otherwise male community become in the end a little monotonous there is no monotony however in  taffrails crosschannel thriller doverostend an innocent lieutenant commander comes back to england for the simple delights of five weeks leave and before the first evening is over he is in the hands of a gang of villains who force him to take a reluctant part in an act of piracy in the english channel the story is told in a pleasantly breezy manner and the author almost makes us believe that it would be quite feasible for a gang of criminals to hold up a crosschannel steamer on its way from dover to ostend herr robert neumanns mammon  is a strange and uneven work which seeks to depict the ramifications and chicanery of international finance much of the book is interesting and it is often amusing but the development of the plot is so intricate that only readers with a considerable store of patience will be able to follow herr neumann from beginning to end the dutch authors of  the rest is silence have told a simple story of a convict in an italian prison who is sustained in his years of captivity by the vision of a womanprisoner whom he hopes to meet again when he is freed there is a certain charm

the betrayal and trial of christ the dark hours was published recently by mr jonathan cape here and there too many of the stories in mrs whartons new book do no more than exhibit her craftsmanship of that there is now no doubt and it is a pity that she should expend time on themes which rouse her ingenuity challenge her skill but little and do not really move her unmoved herself she cannot move the reader only in two tales does she achieve the effect of having something that must be said of presenting characters with whom she has lived and whom she desires us to know the fates and the mischances of them one of the stories is a tale of  beyond  bewitched it has something of the indeterminate fear that belongs to the genuine as distinct from the manufactured ghost story how rutledge was haunted with what ghostly visitor he made his rendezvous and how their intimacy was finally dissolved remains uncertain what is not uncertain is the power and the suggestive discomfort of the story the hard farmers orrin bosworth deacon hibben and sylvester brend saul rutledge deceiving or deceived mrs rutledge harsh determined not to be deceivedall these characters live and there is a deadly determination in the way in which their combined efforts do to death someone or something frail and beautiful helpless in momentary beauty better still is  the seed of the faith a story of a mission in morocco and its hopeless ignorant yet not ignoble struggle in the face of triumphant sensuality and hard bitter confident religion it is surprising in this story how mrs wharton contrives to make you respect and even like the old missionary half crazy in his final spurt of misguided zeal while your reason and your charity can only condemn his stupidity and his bigotry mr oflahertys temptation is overabundance not since maupassant i think has there been a writer who can so quickly make out of an incident a glimpse an overheard scrap of dialogue a broken fragment of memory something which arrests the attention quickens the blood or numbs the mind his very skill leads him at times to take subjects or incidents scarcely worthy of his power and this volume in spite of some halfdozen really magnificently wrought vignettes cannot be put on a level with that admirable and haunting novel he gave us last  the informer the best things in this book are however equal to the best he has given usthat is they rank with maupassants work and kiplings early sketches as supreme examples of the realistic method yet there is more than realism in mr oflahertys tales he is never as detached as maupassantand he was never completely detachedfor he is always ridden by the angel of pity and haunted   here and beyond by edith wharton appletonthe tent by liam oflaherty jonathan cape

is a wild humour in a few of the sketches as in  a red petticoat and mr oflaherty betrays the same flaming impatience at the war in ireland as inspires mr ocaseys work one story in the book a terrible even revolting story  the sensualist might almost have been written by tolstoy for in it mr oflaherty definitely abandons the pure realistic method and writes a tract of extreme bitterness and force against the crazy sensualism which indulged in carries man back to the impersonal animal life out of which he has slowly emerged that there are more ways than one of slipping back into that older world can be learned from the first and most important of the stories in mr huxleys new book i cannot agree with those who see in  three or more graces the best work mr huxley has yet done it is more ambitious in theme than any he has yet attempted but he is not yet equal to the theme either emotionally o r spiritually you cannot be witty with such a subject as the dissolution of personality unless you are frankly writing farce and mr huxley has not helped matters by trying to soften the edges of his wit by the appalling and tiresome mono logues of kingham kingham seems to me a character borrowed from one of mr d h lawrences novels even in the wild exotic world of that novelist it is difficult to believe that these creatures misbehaviours would be tolerated i am quite sure kingham would be kicked often and hardactually or metaphoricallyin the politic world of mr huxley grace comfrey married to john peddley mr huxley has a great talent for names is a woman who is always as it were framing herself she sees herself as this or that definite type and within the limitations of the type behaves congruously the disasters which occur to her through her lack of a fixed personality are only what might be expected in an age with no fixed standards mr huxley is unusual among the younger novelists in his realisation of the excessive boredom and the more excessive tiresomeness of  free  modern society it is like a dirtyminded dormitory he follows graces changes with remarkable patience but he has not really enough imaginative sympathy to show us the woman herself or to show us the lack of a self this is not harsh criticism it is only saying that mr huxley has not yet got the emotional experience to deal adequately with a subject that might have taxed dostoievsky the other stories are slighter and variations on themes which mr huxley has already almost exhausted  the monocle is one more study in dirt noise inanity and vanity  halfholiday is a savage little attack on the more idiotic more selfish society woman  fairy godmother is another warning to elderly charmers to be careful when mr huxley is taking notes he has not been bored by vain women for nothingnro will be mr upward has written much better books than  the domino club and i hope he will do so again it is difficult to be more than politely unimpressed by this very conventional story of the young medical man and the lady violet bredwardine mr upwards great physician sir frank tarleton is an equally conventional figure and it is disappointing that this first introduction of psychoanalysis into

with equal pleasure we heartily recommend the little volume as a work very suitable for a present to young people al d that our readers may see the grounds on which we cordially praise it we proceed to furnish them with a short resume of its contents during seven months of the year the lofty mountain chain of switzerland known as the jura is covered with a mantle of snow and ice which prevents all access to it by travellers but during the other five months from may until october the scene changes then the snow disappears the forests are clad in all their verdant livery and excellent pastures are furnished by the rich grass allured by the latter attraction the swiss drive forth their herds to browse upon the mountain peaks of jura on these occasions the shepherds remain with their flocks until the hard winter again sets in residing during their absence from home in rude chalets formed of stone and occupying their intervals of leisure with the manufacture of the grweere cheeses so well known in the list of epicura delicacies the scene of the narrative of  three months under the snow which by the way is founded to 1 a very great extent upon facts is laid among the spots just described and commences at a time when the shepherds had driven back their flocks from the mountains of the jura one of these i shepherds frangoisthe father of pierre lopraz the little hero of the bookdoes not as was expected return with the others alarm is in consequence excited and pierre accompanied by louis his t fadther determines to proceed in eat of his mssing parent in the course of ascent up the mountain pierre has the  thee ontihe under the snow the journal of a yon inhabitant of the jun tranuated fro the french of oldpomowha rigiu tact society curosity to go near the edge of a dangerous ravine when his grandfather in his anxiety to warn him against the danger stumbles and sprains his foot no particular notice of the aeci dent is taken at the moment but it turns out to i be the pivot on which the whole plot turns on arriving at the pasture ground pierre finds his father well and intending to return the following day the illness of some of his cows having prevented him from leaving the mountain at the time when the other shepherds took their departure the whole party goes to sleep that evening in a rude chalet in which the father has resided during the summer but next day a new difficulty arises the old mans foot has so much swollen that he cannot walk and as there is not assistance enough to carry him back to the village it is arranged that pierre shall remain with him at the cottage while his father drives down the flock and brings back directly the needful aid from home the father departs accordingly although all parties have ominous misgivings the father trembles lest the snow should set in and bury them alive before his return while pierie and his grandfather are apprehensive that if the snowstorm actually comes on it will not only be fatal to them but will overwhelm franjois before he reaches the village meanwhile the mountains have begun to be tinged with snow and a loud wind is whistling past the cabin when suddenly it is recollected that there is another tenant of the cottagone indeed who turns out in the issue to be a most important one our wooden clock says the young hero in a diar which records the incidents of each dayhad scarcely struck threeat this moment i called my grandfathers attention to the bleating of the goat   poor blanchette said he  her milk is troublesome and she is calling us light the lamp we will go and milk her and then have our supper  the wind roared violently it rushed among the shingles which shook with its force so that we had some fear that the roof of the chalet would have been carried away i lifted my head several times fear nothing said my grandfather this house has sustained many similar assaults the shingles are loaded with large stones and the roof being nearly flat gives very little hold to the wind he then made me a sign to go before him and we entered the stable when the goat saw us she redoubled her bleatings she seemed ready to break her halter by the efforts she made to get to us how greedily she ate the handful of salt that i gave her her tongue licked my hand over and over again that she might not lose a grain she gave us a good pailful of milk such is our introduction to blanchette before the reader has done with her ho will find that she rises in importance until he is as much interested about her as he is about the other inmates of the snow prison on the regularity indeed with which she yields her milk the lives of the prisoners are found in a great measure to depend up to this time although the wind iwa been roaring around the mountain cottage there had been nothing to indicate that positive danger had set in on the following morning however when i i pierre awoke he was surprised to find himself in complete darkness at first he thought that his sleep had left him at an earlier hour than usual  grandfather he cried  you are up before daylight  my dear boy replied the old man  if we were to wait the light of day we should remain long enough in bed i fear the snow is above thewindow the terrible truth at last flashed on the mind they were entombed in the snow which had fallen thickly and heavily during the night they knew too from experience that there was little or no prospect of obtaining relief until the spring returned it is at this point that the peculiar value of the book as teaching presence of mind in danger and cheerful confidence in providence appears the old man who is pious takes a hopeful view of things and like mariners on a raft after the wreck of their vessel the little party begins to scrutinise the stores that are left to enable them to accomplish their arctic voyage pierre seeing that a glimmering of the sun appears down the chimney through a part which the snow has not choked up manages to emerge to the roof of the chalet  i but as nothing but bleak desolation meets his gaze he speedily comes down again a fire is lighted but in the midst of their confusion the little hut itself gets nearly burned down by the kindling of  some straw still their hearts do not fail to guard against similar emergencies they fill a tub with snow and place it beside the fireplace ready to extinguish any future conflagration their situation too is not found so cheerless as might have been imagined happily their wooden clock keeps correct time so that they do not lose their reckoning there is plenty of hay also for blanchette on whose life theirs now depend a limited stock of potatoes is also discovered while a bottle or two of swiss wine and some three loaves of hard mountain bread with a few other trifles turn up pierre likewise in the course of his researches finds an axe some straw to plait into hats and what proves a greater treasure still an old work of devotion which supplies them with admirable counsel in their difficulties leading them to earnest prayer to god for his protection and for the improvement of the trials which he has sent to them blanchette moreover is brought from the stable to the hut and proves pleasant company for them a month or more passes in this was pierre takes another journey to the roof and watching carefully the mode in which the snow lies conceives it possible to digg away some of the superincumbent portions of it so as to open the door and admit light to the window the brave and noble boy at the risk of much inconvenience and peril accomplishes his obect and once more the light of day refracted from piles of glittering snow and ice breaks in upon them they have not time however to enjoy this very much before another snowstorm sets in blocking the cottage doors and windows and covering the roof with a heavier load than before the old mans piety comes again to his aid and he encourages his nephew not to despond but to believe that this disappointment is ordered b7 providence for wise purposesa conclusion which is proved by the event but we must take the narration of this incident from the work itself december 13thwe had a dreadful alarm yesterday today even i can scarcely collect my thoughts enough to write down what has passed alas we are not yet sure that we have escaped all danger i was busy milking the goat while my grandfather was lighting the fire suddenly she pricked up her ears as if she heard some extraordinary noise and began to tremble all over swhat is the matter poor blanchette  i said caressing her but immediately we heard the most dreadful howlings as if it were over our heads  wolves i exclaimed silence my boy caress blanehette said my grandfather and he approached her himself and gave her some salt she continued to tremble and the howlings continued also well louis said he in a low voice  what would have become of us had you opened a passage to the window who knows if even the chimney might not have afforded a passage to those ravenous beasts   and do you think we are safe even as we are p i  i hope sobut speak low and do not cease to caress blanchetteher bleating might betray us one would have thought that she had the same fears for she did not make the slighitest noise my grandfather came and sat down by me i held the goat in my arms he had his hand laid upon my shoulder and i needed all the encouragement of his calm and serene countenance to keep me from shrieking aloud with fright au that i had previously experienced in the chalet could not be compared to the agony of yesterday throughout the whole day we passed it by the side of blanchette and at several intervals we heard the howlings of the wolves at one time it was so loud that i thought my last hour was come they are digging through the snow i cried clasping my grandfather in my arms they will i get in and devour us  the grandfather calms him however and the danger passes away the wolves it is conjectured had not scented the rich prize below but had brought the carcass of some animal and made the outcry which alarmed the inmates of the cottage by their quarling as they devoured their prey as the winter advanced a more serious trouble arose to daunt the heart of poor pierre for his grandfather unable to stand the severe cold gradually drooped and finally died what followed is well calculated to teach young people the value of calmness selfpossession and moral courage most boys under similar circumstances would have been iin danger of losing their reason but pierre encouraged by the excellent advice which his grandfather had given him before his death bears up even under his new trial the scene in which he is represented as digging a grave for his grandfather and interring him is not only admirably painted but divested of all repulsive features our youang hero was now lft alonea solitary hermit on the top of the jurawith nothing but his goat blanchette to keep him company and iyet he was not quit alone either for as mungo p ark was cheered in the african desert by seeing a flower so pierre was reminded of the omnipresence of the great creator by another equally striking incident a piece of rubbish had fallen down his chimney the noise attracted his attention and as apprehensive of the soot having taken fire he looked up an iron tube which sewved as an escape for the smoke a star passed over its orifice crossing it slowly at its greatest breadth the appearance lasted but a moment yet it affected pierre greatly reminding him that even in his forlorn condition apparently forgotten by every human being there was one to whom he could make known by prayer his wants and difficulties he had indeed poor fellow need of all the comfort he could get for one morning he heard around him what sounded like the final cruh of naturethe ceiling cracked pieces of plaster fell and a portion of the wall of the cottage lost its perpendicular after the uproar had ceased he began to fear that an avalanche had fallen in his neighbourhood covering for aught he knew the chalet with its fragments however the shock roused him from a state of dejection to face a new and perhaps more perplexing difficulty blanchette the goat began to cease giving her milka dreadful discovery for it threatens to reduce him to the cruel alternative of starvation or of killing the poor animal which has cheered by its company his solitary hours from day to day the condition of blanchette is recorded in pierres diary and we read with deep interest the accounts which show the allimportant milk to be continually diminishing  january 27the milk decreases and the goat fattens in proportion  february 2she has given even less milk than the day before and i have gained nothing

stoop she gave me a look of defiance as if she were standing on her guard against any further attempt i threw away my pail i sat down near the poor beast embraced her and wept bitterly what is the poor fellow to do now  it breaks his heart to think of killing the affectionate animal ah happily his trials are well nigh over on the 24th of february he lighted his fire scarcely had he done so when the smoke began to ascend and he heard a great noise without at first he thought it was the wolves which had returned but human voices are heard hailing him quicker and quicker come the strokes of the

his ductile mind the precepts of morality and philosophic observation though child and his mentor visit the palaces of the rich aud the garrets of the poor penetrate workhouses and jails and hold edifying conversations on the pleasures of art the world of opinion  though purport of intellectual pleasure and other similar subjects of a metaphysical nature that little boys often years old are known to prefer to skating or squalcs surely so practical a writer as mr mayhew does not need to be told that the intellectual and moral characteristics of a remarkable man cannot reasonably be accounted for by showing that he enjoyed the advantages of associating with a septuagenarian who poured into his ear sonorous preachings about tning3 in general which like coleridges monologues commenced without premises und ceased without conclusions let mr mayhew be honest and confess how much ho remembers of his experiences of ten and twelve apart from flogging and birchrods has ho a dozen vivid reminiscences of his early westminster career franklins character was formed by the stern lessons taught him in the school of adversity by the stirring events of contemporary history by the political atmosphere he breathed in early manhood and more than all by the characters of thc men with whom he as a bold and inquiring young man was brought into contact but mr mayhews theory astounding as it is has more kinship to troth than have the pictures with which he endeavours to sustain it the life to which little ben is introduced is london life in the year of out lord 1861 not boston life in the last century there is not even an attempt to impart an american colouring or an air of historic fidelity to these deportations from the banks of the thames the fop and the miser the gourmet and the dnmkard are of sound old british oak without any touch of yankee veneering so also uncle ben is the peculiar product of the nineteenth century being compounded in equal parts of wordsworth lord shaftesbury ami mr buckle in his preface mr mayhew argues that he is justified in creating uncle ben and giving him such prominence in the drama by that shakspeorian nile of art  which often throws an internal moral principle into an external dvamaiis pmmtn as the witches in  macbeth are merely the outward embodiment in a weird and shadowy form of macbeths own ambition and have obviously been introduced into the play with the view of giving a kind of haunted and fatalistic air to a bloody and devouring passion even so in a small way has uncle ben here been made the exponent of the franklin view of life but herein lies the difference between the witches in  macbeth and the uncle ben of the childs story shakespeares conception was in accordance with historic truth and the notiorh relative to supernaturalism that existed in his day and were believed by his auditors to have existed in the days of macbeth whilst mr mayhews conception is directly at variance alike with events and opinions the prison visited by little ben and his uncle in boston a hundred years since is the author informs us what does the reader imaginetothill fields prison as it appeared in 1856 how could a sight of thc abuses of our modern system of prison discipline have had a part in fashioning the mind of franklin  it would be ns reasonable to write the life of peter the great showing that his whole aftercareer was the result of his reading vanity fair or hearing of the balaclava charge,juvenile

B7363,"['9346800', '6846666', '2432794']",  i the crock of gold i l by james stephens w1acknijan d uo whe mr stephens published his first collection of verses a few critics were keen enough to discern a new and gmenn voice possessing a note of its own after a while came the charwomans daurhter and showed plainly that a writer of proe had emerged too now in the crock of gold this author gives the measure of a larger and more individual talent than could have been absolutely foretold his work is neither a fairy tale nor an essay nor an allegory nor a novel although it has features of all these forms there has been nothing hitherto quite like it but it is safe to prophesy that by and by there will be plenty of imitators to take it for their pattern in some respects the book is characteristically irish modern english writers can introduce fairies but they cannot succeed in treating them quite as a matter of course even mr barrie seems to be always hinting to us how pretty and quaint his fairies are but to mr stephens as to mr yeatsand formerly to blakefairies are as natural as sparrows neither irishman would feel a quiver of surprise at encountering a  leprecaun  in any woodland walk nor deem that there was any incongruity in the association upon the same page of leprecauns and policemen indeed one of the triumphs of the crock of gold  is the mingling of the wildest fantasies with sudden gleams of melancholy realism in chap xvi the philosopher who forms the connecting thread of the narrative is lying awake in prison hearing the lifehistories of his two companionsunvarnished tales of contemporary poverty and privation such as might but for their beautiful simplicity of style have come straight from the registers of the charty organisation society in chap xvii the child ad the fosterchild of the phlsher are carrying back a crock of gol t the leprecauns and afterwards resting themlv against the flanks of a friendly cow and hearing her highly instructive conversation with a fly we read on without a jar and every now and then some wise or whimsical saying arrests our delighted progress a lite later perhaps aim like a view through a suddenly unshuttered window the picture of southeast landscape painted in a few words the style which conveys these excellent thring reminds us now of one good writer now of another but never of a bad one and in spite of these links of kindred remains alwa personal in its flavour in short mr stephens has produced a remarkably fine and attractive work of art  the crock of gold fiction by james stephens macmillan and co 5s it is a very excellent thing when the watcher on the toweras the reviewer is imagined to be by the guileless of heartmay leave his post and simply pull a joyous peal on the bells of praise it is splendid to sheathe the sword on ones hipto think for one moment of the petty scalpel of criticism by so dignified a titleand to pull vigorously on because the merry clangour over ones head is the only thing proportionate to the joy in the soul really that office is won more often than it would appear when it takes a little courage to fulfil it but no courage should be needed in the case of the  crock of gold the crock of gold itself has little to do with the subject neither have the two philosophers nor their two respective wives the grey woman of dun gorrin and the thin woman of inis magrath nor for that matter their two children nor the leprechauns nor pan nor angus og nor caitilin ni murrachu there is only one person who has anything to do with the book and that is mr stephens who has given some considerable care to blake and a good deal of care to his own devilment in fact he has given so much care to blake that he has not altogether digested that mighty mans st heme of things being too content to give it speech cn his own lips with a disorder of idea that it had not in its originators brain that is an incidental complaint common to most of blakes readers who cannot step quite as decisively as the strong man himself did in the involutions of his scheme of things but the inspiring spirit is here and it gives a singing beauty to mr stephens own devilment that devilment is undeniable it both makes and mars the book it was a very good thing for one of the two philosophers and his wife the grey woman of dun gortin that they in a surfeit of life spun round like tops till they died or they would have added to the number of people in whom our interest is aroused to remain unresolved at the end of the book caitilin ni murrachu leaves pan for angus og and that is an end of herand a very good end too one may say but her father meehawl macmurrachu who stole the crock of gold and was singularly afflicted by the leprechauns in consequence is never heard of again the surviving philosopher is rescued from prison by the shoe after their hosting we are told but the manner of it we are not told nor are we told why the she hosted nor what came of it in the larger purpose of things the book concludes with four dots to signify a conclusion that is no conclusion the remaining half a page should have been filled with dots had mr stephens wished adequately to signify the unconcluded interest but the characters happen not to be the matter of our interest it is mr stephens who provides that interest and the characters are only by way of a framework on which he may stretch himself we have spoken of hts spirit in the book as one of devilment but it must be understood that it is that manner of devilment that is full of wisdom the inspiration of which indeed is wisdom no man can dance down the road and leap and laugh in the sun and pluck flowers where he will and stretch in the fields when he will without having joy in his heart and he cannot have that joy in his heart without having wisdom in his soul he cannot tell us that wisdom since wisdom defies the intellect he can only communicate that joy to us and we may find the wisdom for ourselves the phrase of his song the light in his eyes the sunlight on a blossom in his hand may communicate that joy to us but if it cannot it will not so irresponsible is it and such is the procedure of the book being what it is it is a little matter that it is unconcluded or that its characters are not taken to the end of their history in the tangle of interest aroused by the crock of gold even as it is a small matter that the song sung on the roadside should lack an ending the manner of the singing was all there and the manner of the telling is all here it is such chance things that recreate the sunshine that is the air of joy and wisdom not a wellframed tale and a concluded interest we can scarcely imagine anyone reading this book without having a sunshine kindled in his soul and without looking with a kindlier and wiser eye on his dear mother earth and his brother man and if mr stephens wants a better praise than that then he is a different man from that we have taken him for  the crock of gold by james stephens london macmillan ss net mr stephens makes a mortal maid and her divine bridegroom sing to the lovers of gaiety a song which ends  has the attorney enchanted thee    come away for the game has begun lightly the wind is sounding over the hill the sun laughs down into the valley and the sea leaps upon the shingle panting for joy dancing dancing dancing for joy no one who knows mr stephens poetry will doubt that he can very well sing such a song as might undo the attorneys enchantment he has a capacity for lightness and gaiety which can only be called blitheness a very rare quality blitheness runs and dances all through this narrative saves it and makes it it is unconsciously and alas too consciously also aimed against the sadness which is due to the fact that man has departed from nature and lives by crafty and twisted thought it asserts and when it does not assert it almost proves that a leprecaun is of more value to the earth than is a prime minister or a stockbroker because a leprecaun dances and makes merry while a prime minister knows nothing of these natural virtues we are positively assured that the crown of life is to be found not by the thoughtful or the good but the gay ones the adventurous ones the careless plungers an old thief declares that it is easy enough to have brains but not a little gaiety or carelessness or childishness it is however the chief merit of the book that it unconsciously declares what by an indiscretion of art it makes the subject of half a dozen sermons we are a little tired of hearing that the good are always the merry save by an evil chance but we shall never be tired of a merry heart that goes all the way through a novel of over three hundred pages the story has flaws in it which possibly mr stephens would laugh at and he can afford to since he trips on and on with so agreeable a mixture of naivete and choiceness he has never written a poem so pleasant to read nor is he likely soon to find a rival for lightness quickness and gaiety in talk and narrative,juvenile

B8152,['8837662'],  kaffir folklore or a selection from the traditional tales current among the people living on the eastern border of the cape colony by george mccall theal son nenschein  co the stories which mr theal has collected during a residence of twenty years among the kaffirs are very curious and interesting and the information ho gives in his introduction and notes about these wild people among whom he has exercised many functions including those of a mission teacher and a border magistrateis most valuable the word kaffir he remarks is often used to signify any black native who is not the descendant of an imported slave but it is applied on the eastern frontier of the cape colony only to a member of the amaxosa tribe from these amaxosa the tales in mr theals volume were obtained the kaffir of the coast region ia described as  a model of a wellformed man possessing reasoning powers  quite equal to those of a white man it appears that for anything approaching frivolity he has a supreme contempt and therefore it is to be feared that any distinguished representative of his race who may visit london will carry away an unfavourable impression as regards fashionable society the language of the amaxosa is  rich in words and is musical in expression and it contains three clicks which are now represented in writing by the superfluous letters c q and x it is at first encouraging to be told that they are easily sounded separately by europeans  the c by withdrawing the tongue sharply from the front teeth the q by doing the same from the roof of the mouth and the x by drawing the breath in a peculiar way between the tongue and the side teeth but mr theal afterwards saddens his readers by the information that these clicks generally prove an insurmountable difficulty to an adult who wishes to learn to speak the language the language of the women varies a good deal from that of the men on account of  the custom called ukuhlonipa which prohibits females from pronouncing the names of any of their husbands male relatives in the ascending line or any words whatever in which the principal syllables of such names occur of many other curious customs mr theal supplies an interesting account especially as regards marriage death and witchcraft he gives a couple of curious instances of their superstitions which came under his own notice in 1875 a kaffir girl was drowned while bathing her companions ran away home and declared that she had been lured away into a dark hole by a spirit and that she cried out just before sinking for the last time  go and tell my father and mother that it took me her father immediately collected his cattle drove them into the water and implored the spirit  to take the choicest of them and restore his daughter he spoke in vain but  the failure to get the exchange effected is still attributed by the relatives of the drowned girl to the absence of one skilful to work with medicines in july 1881 a kaffir woman sorrowfully sought mr theals assistance the  witch  finder of the village had pointed her out as the person who had caused the death of a neighbours child the result of her being thus smelt out was that no one would so much as speak to her and even her own children avoided her such treatment was unendurable and mr theal interfered on her behalf the witchfinder was sent for and a large number of kaffirs appeared to judge the case it is pleasant to know that the witchfinder failed to satisfy the judges when the ordinary tests were put to him and when he was compelled to admit that he had never held converse with the people under the water he was convicted of imposition and his victim was acquitted of the terrible charge he had brought against her one of the most unreasonable of the ideas indulged in by kaffirs is that in consequence of which they use no kinds of fish as an article of diet and call them all snakes without distinction but they do not intend by so doing to insult the fishy race for  the snake is treated with great respect by the kaffirs if one is found in a hut the people will move out and wait patiently until it leaves the owner will say that it is perhaps the spirit of one of his ancestors who has come to visit him in this form the kaffir stories are for the most part wild and all but unintelligible a few of them appear to show traces of foreign influence and may possibly have adapted to south african uses certain incidents properly belonging to asiatic tales this may account for the resemblance between part of the story of the girl and the mbulu and the numberless asiatic and european variants of the tale which it has been proposed to call the substituted bride in the kaffir story the girl is induced to bathe and the mbulua fabulous being which can assume the human form but cannot part with its tailputs on her clothes and assumes her place passing itself off as a chiefs daughter and making the girl act as its servant the girl lightens her cares by song and sings the tale of her woes the neighbours who hear her test the truth of her metrical assertions satisfy themselves that the substituted bride for a wedding has taken place  has a mbulus tail and put the interloper to death the deceived bridegroom then marries the girl whose place the mbulu had usurped the story ends after a fashion which may be said to be original  she had a child and one day when it was playing a square pumpkin came out of the ground where the mbulu was buried and tried to kill the infant but the people chopped the pumpkin into pieces and burned it they afterwards threw the ashes into a river so that nothing more could come of that mbulu  though story of five heads also is one which resembles to a suspicious extent the numerous popular tales which tell how a foolish or haughty maiden turns a deaf ear to the good advice which is given to her while she is on her way to the dwelling of a demon or witch and suffers in consequence and how her wise or humble sister listens to similar counsel and is rewarded the demoniacal being in the kaffir tale is  a big snake with five heads and large eyes a creature of a foreign aspect closely akin to the sevenheaded snakes which are part of the stockintrade of russian and other storytellers one of the beings about whom a piece of advice is given to the kaffir damsel differs from those we are accustomed to hear of in european tales she is told that she will meet a man  whose head is under his armand she is advised not to take water from him she meets  a man carrying his head under his arm and takes water to drink from him in consequence the snake eventually kills her with his tail being discontented with the bread she has made for him the opening of  the story of the girl who disregarded the custom of ntonjane in which a snake comes out of a pool wherein a number of girls are bathing and takes possession of the clothes they have left on the bank is very like that of the russian story of  the watersnake which again is closely akin to a burmese tale of a waterspirit who marries a mortal maiden but the incidents which follow are entirely different there are several kaffir stories also which describe the apparent destruction of men and beasts by some monster and their ultimate rescue uninjured from its inside just as in the norse tale of  the devouring cat or the indian story of  the voracious frog in one of the kaffir variants of what seems to be a naturemyth which has dwindled into a grotesque story for children a monster called an inabulele swallows a young hero who finds inside it  his father and his mother and many people and cattle he pierces his living prison with his assagai and the captives escape in another tale two boys kill a glutton and their mother opens it whereupon people came out and cattle and dogs in a third the devouring creature is a monstrous cannibal  the men went and skinned the cannibal when a great number of people came from him one of though most thoroughgoing parallels with alien folktales is afforded by  the story of sikulume that hero wins the heart of the daughter of a demoniacal being named mangangezulu and flies with her from her fathers house the bereaved parent pursues but the girl throws down successively  an egg a milksack a pot and a smooth stone the demon is for a time baffled by the mist into which the egg turns the sheet of water which comes out of the milksack and the thick darkness due to the flinging down of the pot but he is not completely foiled until the smooth stone is thrown it became a rock a big rock with one side steep as a wall he could not climb up that rock and so he returned to his own village in european folktales a brush and a comb are the objects most often relied upon by similar fugitives very quaint though not absolutely novel is the story of the  big ugly cannibal with only one leg who took home a bag into which he had inserted a very nice girl and called all the other cannibals to come to a feast and they came expecting to get something nice but when the bag was opened it was found to contain  only snakes and toads for the girls father had effected an unwelcome substitution the other cannibals were so angry when they saw this that they killed him and made their feast off him quaint also is the  person with only one arm one side and one leg who kindly cries to magodas runaway children  see the cannibal has eaten the rest of me take care of yourselves the opening of the story of the cannibal who calls to demazana pretending to be her brother demana is singularly like that of the german story of  the wolf and the seven kids the kaffir girl replies  go away you cannibal your voice is hoarse you are not my brother he consults with another cannibal who advises him to burn his throat with a hot iron  he did so and then no longer spoke hoarse the girl admits him into the cave in which she lives and he carries her off in the german story grimm no 5 the wolf detected by the gruffness of its voice  went to a shop and bought a great piece of chalk which it ate and by that means rendered its voice more gentle by way of conclusion we may mention as an original story and one which is in accordance with the already mentioned kaffir idea about drowning  the story of tangalimlibo that lady who made it a rule never to go out in the daytime and was therefore known as the walker by moonlight was drawn under water one day when she had broken her rule in deference to her fatherinlaws repeated requests for water in vain did her fatherinlaw offer the riverspirit an ox in exchange for her she remained unseen all day when the night came her child cried so bitterly that its nurse carried it down to the river  then the mother of the child came out of the river and sang a sad song and afterwards took her child and put it to her breast to suck the story ends more happily than the russian tale of the dead mother who used to suckle her wasting child by night for a fat ox having been offered to the riverspirit by  a woman skilful in the use of medicines the demon was appeased  there was a great shaking and a rising up of the river and tangalimlibo came out there was great joy among those people when they took her home to her husband we trust that we have quoted enough from mr theals book to prove that it is one which may be cordially recommended,juvenile

B4515,"['6731552', '3162037']",  the jungle book ti by rudyard kipling misc millans hitherto we have been accustomed to find inequality in mr kiplings work he has never yet given us a book entirely good each collection of his stories is a mixture of suooess and failure naturally this peculiarity has always stirred some annoyance and perplexity in his critics for at his best he is not easily surpassed while at his worst he is almost puerile there is a popular superstition not without an element of truth in it that equality and mediocrity are interchangeable terms but though no author however gifted can always be at his best the inequalities of mr kiplings work offer too startling a contrast his frequent falls from the heights to the deeps his dazzling leaps from the mire to tne mountain top cannot be satisfactorily accounted for by any theory however respectable so we are unable to take up a new volume of his without knowing our hopes are dogged by a most uncomfortable fear faith in his ultimate suooess is founded tpon the fact that the more di cult his task seems though greater though certainty that he will be successful consequently if he wishes to sustain his reputation he must refuse resolutely to write on subjects commonplace or indifferent the jungle book has been cordially welcomed and it is only just to confess at once that it is more carefully designed than anything he has yet given to us there are no serious blemishes in the style and grammar as a pieoe of technique it is quite blameless but a serious doubt arises as to whether the matter of the book is at all worthy of the labour bestowed on it again it is certain that thoso flashes of genius that used to dazlo us seldom illumine its pages in them mr kiplings finest qualities are to seek we prefer to hear his men and women talk as only mulvaney or mrs hawkesby can talk be bagheora and baloo never so ingenious it is impossible to rid oneself of the conviction that any author rather more clever than the average could have contrived though greater part of th jungle book there are indeed a few pages that no one but the creator of soldiers three could have written and one new friendship is cemented for whioh we are grateful rikki tikki though only a mongoose fights his way stuantly enough into the list of mr iplings immortals the history of his war with the cobras is entirely delightful and refuses to be forgotten there are times when plain speaking is necessary and then the most ardent admirer of an author must if he be honest say the truth though truth is that the jungle book had it been written by a person unknown might have stirred a languid interest and a cor ta in reasonable hope of better things to come as the work of a man of recognised genius it compels disappointment it is generally true that to gain a worthy success a writer must toil hard must choose his words with discrimination but there is no rule without an exception and in this case mr kipling would seem to be that exception his best work achieves itself apparently spontaneously it is a startling nay dangerous thing to say of a man that he places failure far from him only when he is most careless but mr kipling may at any rate be advisedadapting a remark of mr henleys not to concern himself again with words and phrases but with the greater truths of destiny and emotion his last bcok prompts this reflection few authors know the human heart so well as he let him forsake thereforo mowglis and mules and monkeys and remember that his vital phrases have ever been born not made percy addleshaw  the jungle book  the jungle book is made up of story and song both of them rich in vitality and imagination but every time a verse occurs as the heading of a chapter one is inclined to think that mr kipling should write nothing else so instinctive is his power over vigorous rhythm and so vivid are his ballad pictures this  nightsong in the jungle  is only meant to tune

not be  not for nothing are ye called the free people ye fought for freedom and it is yours eat it o wolves there is something sternly grand about all the mowgli stories imaginative children whether or not they follow the narrative with perfect comprehension will be impressed and even awestruck by the solemnity and dignity of jungle life as mr kipling paints it of the habits of the animals of the scenes amidst which they live he has a marvellous knowledge it is this picturesqe knowledge joined to a vigorous interpretation of not their own character but the ideal nature he has constructed for them a nature at once remote and familiar to us that makes the success and the fascination of the stories man without his intellectual power but with his natural faculties of sight and hearing infinitely intensified and without the enfeeblement the deceit the pettiness that are the fruits of his civilisation would be something like this conception of the beast that obeys the jungle law we are grotesquely reminded here and there of the ideals of rousseau and the natural state idealists their primitive man they would have desired to be like mr kiplings loyal beasts there are stories in the book where he is not at his highest point of vigour  the white seal  comes near to being a failure and so does  servants of the queen the adventures of rikkitikkitavi the mongoose that fought with nag the cobra and nagaina his wife are too deadly to be amusing and the glamour of imagination does not play round them to turn the terror into fascination the temperature of ones admiration having been reduced by these we find several other things to wonder at not all admiringly mr kipling cannot resist opportunities of political allusion indeed invents them and his love for playing the schoolmaster grows on him it is this quality that is at the bottom of the imperfect sympathy which runs parallel in many readers minds with a warm admiration for him the pedagogue in him hides under free and vigorous and unconventional speech but he is mostly there were he to fall asleep a bit oftener and let some careless lawless fellow take his place if even only for a few minutes mr kiplings range of understanding of human nature would be greatly widened but grumbling at mr kiplings temperament is not very relevant here it does not greatly offend in  the jungle book more to the purpose is it to point to the feats of imagination in these beast stories next to the three mowgli tales for great qualities comes  toomai of the elephants toomai is a little boy who saw what few be lieved in and none had seen the great  dance of the elephants at night and alone in the heart of the garo hills he was on the back of the tame elephant kala nag that he tended and when kala nag got the signal for the dance the boy was born away up the wooded hill through the thick underwood through the bed of a river to a space of three or four acres where the grass was trampled and hard the assembling elephants crashed through the trees and entered the danceplace and rolled their eyes and tossed their trunks and clicked their tusks and flicked their great tails  then an elephant trumpeted and they all took it up for five or ten terrible seconds the dew from the trees above spattered down like rain on the unseen backs and a dull booming noise began not very loud at first and little toornai could not tell what it was but it grew and grew and kala nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other and brought them down on the ground onetwo onetwo as steadily as tripbammers the elephants were stamping altogether now and it sounded like a wardrum beaten at the mouth of a cave the dew fell from the trees till there was no more left to fall and the booming went on and the ground rocked and shivered and little toomai put his hands up to his ears to shut out the sound but it was all one gigantic jar that ran through hinmthis stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth    the morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills and the booming stopped with the first ray as though the light had been an order it is a magnificent sight that toomai saw that night when the favour of the elephantfolk and of the gods of the jungle was with him mr kipling has some splendid visions for all his love of discipline and order it is when his spirit gets away into the wilder

volumes that come from america its score of illustrations are well reproduced and paper and printing are all that could be desired it is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story of an animal we have no hint of the  jungle books  or of any sort of derivativeness consequently it is deserving of more serious consideration than its predecessors the hero is buck the offspring of a st bernard sire and a sheepdog dam we meet him first as the wellloved tyrant of a luxurious home in the south then because the wages of a gardeners helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny buck changes hands and begins to learn the law of club and fang the klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals buck steals a good sum of ready money bucks first ordeal in the primitive fighting life is his meeting with a man in a red sweater who has released him from the crate in which he has travelled north and who proceeds forthwith to break him inwith a club  for the last time he rushed the man struck the shrewd blow he had purposely withheld for so long and buck crumpled up and went down knocked utterly senseless  answers to the name of buck the man soliloquized quoting from the saloonkeepers letter which had announced the consignment of the crate and contents  well buck my boy he went on in a genial voice  we ve had our little ruction and the best thing we can do is to let

patted the head he had so mercilessly pounded and though bucks hair involuntarily bristled at touch of the hand he endured it without protest presently buck is sold and he with the reader is introduced in excellent form to the life of a sledgedog on the trail in a temperature of fifty below zero it is an enthralling story told ably and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over thornton fell on his knees beside buck head was against head and he was shaking him back and forth those who hurried up heard him cursing buck and he cursed him long and fervently and softly and lovingly gad sir  gad sir  spluttered the skookum bench king  ill give you a thousand for him a thousand sirtwelve hundred sir thornton rose to his feet his eyes were wet the tears were streaming frankly down his cheeks  sir he said to the skookum bench king no sir you can go to hell sir its the best i can do for you sir the detail of the mans face and tears is a blemish but the description of the whole incident is most spirited buck eventually recalls the books title by harking back to the life of his remote forbears and joining a wolfpack in the wilds but not until his beloved master is dead and the dog has most thoroughly and savagely avenged the mans murder the

reasonable belief that the first novel received for 1914 was an average specimen of the coming output would enable us to wish our fellowreviewers a  happy new year  with some hopefulness of fulfilment

more than one vivid description of his competence in the ring she is possessed of that marvellous strength of sacrifice on behalf of her man which can only be properly appreciated perhaps by those who

after his marriage their flight from the sordid struggle of the town to the open solves the struggle of existence for them and further makes the opportunity somewhat too obviously for a display of much agricultural lore in an atmosphere the sweetness of which becomes cloying towards the end of the tale the narrative is written breezily throughout though the authors handling of the bellows has not been sufficiently masked he has perhaps more scorn for than sympathy with the pettiness with which he is obliged to endow many of his puppets in order that they may be true to life the individualism of socialists and the trickery by which even the wellintentioned are content to earn a living are after all but the natural concomitants of an environment in which the breadth of outlook is lacking to make  waste not want not a worldmaxim the tale which is essentially american may not appeal to all english readers but though the conditions vary in different lands the author has grasped the essential traits of humanity in its present stage of development and such understanding being a necessary preliminary to further advance any one who helps us to it deserves our thanks  the son of the wolf by jack london isbister 63 we notice in the advertisements of a god of his fathers a previous work of the authors appended to the present volume that a critic remarks it is no exaggeration to say that mr london does for the klondyke what mr rudyard kipling has done for india a reading of the son of the wolf leaves us with the conviction that mr rudyard kipling need be under no uneasiness mr jack londons tales are all  vigorous his men are all muscular heroes his language his style his situations all have the ideal and the downright virtues of muscularity so far so good but we want analysis not deification of the muscular ideal and that is where mr jack london fails we do not wish to disparage in any way the son of the wolf the nine tales of which the book is made up are healthy breezy narratives of sensational incidents in the  worthland scruff mackenzie goes on the trail seeking a wife braves a whole tribe of indians kills two men and carries off the beautiful zarinska the chiefs daughter xaass an alentian chief travels thousand of miles from the behring sea tracking axel gunderson a modern norse sea rover who has carried off from him the peerless unga of course he lures gunderson and unga to a trackless wilderness in search of a gold mine and of course they die in the most melodramatic fashion the best story in the book is to the man on the trail because it is the least theatrical  in a far country  is a tale with the same motive as  an outpost of progress  by mr joseph conrad to compare the manner in which the two authors bring the same situation before us is to see why mr jack london cannot be called an artist he is a vigorous story teller for the general publicwhich is not a bad thing but his sphere scarcely touches that of those writers who like mr rudyard kipling have created a manner and a method of presentation which is all their own  lhovel lnotes the call of the wild bv jack londin 6s lieinernann a reading of  the god of his fathers inclined us to classify mr jack london as the canadian kipling and the call of the wild further justifies us in doing so for any other study of animal life to compare with this wonderfully intimate story of the dog  buck and his companions one must turn to the jungle books not that mfr london is in any sense an imitator he writes with  stocks mrs humphry wards residence south view from pkotogratk by j t newman berkhansted much of the same directness the same vivid simple realism the same insight into the souls of men and beasts but his stories are entirely his own and his types as unlike those of the famous angloindian as the snowy remoter regions are unlike india the kidnapping of the petted household buck the brutal breaking of his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild make a story of unique interest that has more than a touch of genius in the conception and the writing of it the coloured illustrations are extremely effective  the valley of the moon by jack london 6s mills  boon the idyllic title of mr londons latest noveland his bestwill neither delude nor deter those who know its predecessors they will know there are grim forces stirring somewhere in the region of this nook of shelter and starlight and that the people who populate it are very fierce realities as a matter of fact the lunar paradise does not arrive until the real action of the book has ceased it is reserved as a kind of reward or escape after many strenuous chapters in which the struggle is not merely one of thew and sinew but a moral war with principalities and powers we get in the opening chapters the hinterland of san francisco at its worst and oakland seems to engage itself chiefly with the clatter of steam laundries the strains of the dancing saloon and the faction fights of public holidays this abrupt plunge into a western world of slang and steam and strife is made palatable to english readers by the pride with which the hero and heroine contemplate their saxon origin but the author must not be accused merely of making an effort to conciliate his critics over here he brings out certain qualities in those two figures which we are glad to recognise as admirablethe more so that the woman is the deeper and more consistent character and has none of  billys weaknesses billy roberts like the book is mixed in his composition brought up as a prizefighter he qualifies as a teamster and handles horses with the same mercy and discretion wherewith he handled men he is certainly a  hunky  gladiator this sixfoot giant of the blue eyes and fair complexion but when poverty and hardships arrive he loses selfcontrol and shows once more that the physical training of the ring however thorough is no discipline for the finer issues of life  saxon his wife on the other hand keeps true to her simple ideals and brings him through her emotions are always fresh and womanly she succeeds in everything her modesty allows her to undertake but she cannot help the author to interest us in certain chapters which are only agricultural pamphlets in disguise this is the real defect of his book from the literary point of view the moral one is that in billys excesses the ethical balance is not sufficiently preserved otherwise we have nothing but admiration for this powerful and human story,juvenile

long familiarity with cruikshank  phiz  and mahoney one is always apprehensive of a new illustrator of dickens it is not that our visualising of a dickens character has become stereotyped but a certain rigid standard has grown up in the mind the pictured figure must conform to certain delicate criteria the artist must have the  dickens touch in this respect we are glad to find that mr

method of suffusing his mind with that  christmas atmosphere the loss of which is a common matter of lament in these prosy and practical days there are probably many others who find that the magic of dickens is similarly potent for them and the present christmas will especially call for such a source of refreshment for the spirit a welcome may therefore be extended to from dickens christmas carol chambers this new edition of  a christmas carol with its fine bold type and coloured illustrations by a j keller  a christmas carol  will always have an abiding place in the affections of the general reader it is not merely that the characters are life  like but that as someone has aptly said of dickens  he is a portrayer of living souls rather than of living men it is here that the secret of the great novelist is found to read a christmas carol with a responsive mind is to be brought into rapport with the essential spirit of humanity and to be awakened to the true meaning of fellowship with the world especially the struggling heroic and kindly portion of it the present repoduction of covy chambers volume should make an acceptable a n d a p prop riate christmas gift to all but those

most popular of dickenss christmas books illustrated bv one of our most popular artists the art of mr rackham is in its way as unique as the art of dickens and in  a christmas carol  he has a theme that is exactly suited to his genius pickwvick might have been too beefilv real and robust for him  oliver twist  and other of the novels would have called for a more conventional realism than would have appealed to him but the carol with its mingling of the fantastic the supernatural and actual life gives natural scope and play to his peculiar powers and it is not too much to say that never have those qualities in dickens been more sympathetically or more imaginatively interpreted than in the delightful series of drawings that illustrate this book the genial humour the grotesque eeriness the pathos and graceful fancy that are in the story are faithfully mirrored in mr rackhams pictures they could not have harmonised more completely with the atmosphere and feeling of the tale if the very spirit of dickens had entered into the artist while he worked the result is a beautiful and ideal edition of the ideal christmas story,juvenile

by the rev g f townsend routledge  sons the princess i late a fairy talc saunders otley co mrs s c halls latest publication is a very pretty and rather whimsical story about little peoplewe can hardly call them fairies according to the popular notion which requires something different in description from minute men and women who live in among and under flowers and leaves using them as men employ houses and having the senses limitations and passions of mere men to say this much in respect to the shortcomings of this charming story is but to declare that the author whose work is now before us has failed exactly where ninetynine out of every hundred fairytale writers have done likewise we know no modern fairy story of this kind and having the pretensions of this one which surpasses it either as regards spirit prettiness or piquancy of treatment richness of incident or carefulness in imparting local colour to the book which tells how a noble queen foam of south wales whose tiny people and lazy royal husband were seated near tenby a wateringplace to which mrs hall seems to have taken an overwhelming fancy bad a son prince ivor who being pressed by his imperious mamma to marry a certain beautiful princess of pembrokeshire flatly refused to do anything of the sort and preferred banishment and transformation nay even loss of the privileges of  faery and to incur the defeats of mortality rather than wed the princess gossamer daughter of king bulbul the btory further relates how the prince was banished and trarsformed what were the pranks he played on earth these are rather trivial in the order of their inventionhow he got rid of some of that freakishness which mrs hall in common with all fairytale tellers ascribes to the little peoplehow he fell in love with an earthly damselwhat took place upon the last event the political consequences of which do not appear to have been calculated for by queen foamhow he returned home and what then took place we have all this with a moral of the good sound sort which of course we shall not impart neither relate the termination of the story in the fate of the little prince let the reader learn it for himself and in so doing appreciate at his best the manner of the writer whose ornate fancy revels in  pretty rather than in potent matters whose conception of faery lacks vigour quite as much as it comes short in inventioniwhose ideas savour of the operatic style and whose book is by no means free from affectation the considerate reader who knows not only the rarity of firstrate fairy tales but the immense difficulty which besets their writers will know how well our author has succeeded notwithstanding the shortcomings we are in no unkindly spirit compelled to point out as to the illustrations before us m this volume they are thoroughly in keeping with the text the immemorial hand of mr kenny meadows has contributed a larger number than that of any other artist these suit the story wonderfully of sounder work and better art are several wellexecuted landscapes from drawings by messrs e m wimperis and w s coleman mr w j allen is a very happy contributor of vignettes and tailpieces bright thoughts for the little ones is a book for infants the novelty of which consistsso far as we see the notion is a new onein the fact that little pieces of verse are made to alternate and proceed from little pieces of prose both classes of the text are pleasantly perhaps a little too pleasantly written all the boys and girls behave themselves as they should obediently lovingly and with a wonderful show of forbearance the illustrations which are by mr john proctor are good enough for a commonplace purpose but not good enough to be of the better class bounder workmanship or at least more of refinement in execution is desirable for them many are spirited there is nothing to challenge in the book unless indeed it be a recommendation to see general tom thumb lightsome and the little golden lady is a capital childs fairystory with just the slight defect of a rather dull beginning to create such beginning is on the part of the author with mr bennetts aim a great mistake and almost fatal to his hopes of obtaining a hearing from children whose standard is not above that of his book once he gets the little ones by the ear we have no doubt that they will be more than thankful to him the event of the scorpion that attacked skambel whenever he was envious and did bo with a clash as of the tumbling down of ten sets of fireirons and the locking up of fifty streetdoor locks is very much to our minds grim hoddidod the hunter has a family resemblance with which we are not unfamiliar as he supports the reputation of his awful race be is not the worse for that in fact one rather likes to meet him here for the sake of the old days when breathless we came upon the great beanstalk with our brave but surely temerarious friend jack there is some poverty of invention shown in the repetition of the method by which lightsome cuts off the tails of the bulls moreover it is incredible that the same thing should happen more than once the history of the scales that weighed everything into gold which runs through the book is very well told the illustrations are rather heavily drawn but not without spirit they are the work of the author  washed a shore is a tale of the coast and the sea of an old captain who lives in an ancient fortress his son who mixing with smugglers comes to grief and suffers a sort of honourable transportation of a lifeboat adventure with a wreck a storm of two saved from its violence one of these is a dashing midshi pman who tells a young laxlya very young ladythat man friday was notablackwhatever defoe might have written there is also a very good blind pedlar a hardhearted magistrate and abundant adventures with smugglers seamen and such like materials for a boys story that it is a little overlaboured may be no deterring matter for juvenile readers especially as a considerable amount of local colouring is applied to descriptions of southern islands and the manners of their inhabitants the discovery of the longlost son of the old seacaptain who lived in the ancient tower and the narrative of that sons adventures make up jjr a sort of robinson crusoe stry that is well worthy the attention of the readers for whom the book is written three

we not long since reviewed croxaus production is almost universally known in this country and is one of the oldfashioned ornate sort of translations from the classics which obtained favour when the severe simple manner of such originals was little appreciated among us the new translation now before us is decidedly clearer purer in style and infinitely terser than its predecessor it contains also a much greater number of fables than was comprised in the edition to which we have just referred and morewe believe than are to be found in common editions as a literary production the present is creditable to the editor aud traudator it is however rather bald and somewhat deficient in that terse wordpainting which gives life to a literal translation the illustrations which are thu work of mr harrison weir are very unequal in quality some are good as the fawn and his mother the crow and the  pitcher others are not at all commendable see j those which contain human figures the worst of i the book as a whole is that their author has not  the slightest sense of the eopian humour here i as in other respects no one of modern times has i approached the happiness of thomas bewick in his old age the princess ilsee is a fairystory of which the producer of the book before us be she translator or author hus no mean opinion it begius i with an account of the deluge and dryingup of  the earth and gives a rather fantastical description of the process of the latter by the hands of angels with huge besoms made of the wind and enormous brushes composed of sunbeams ono of these angels being rather tired with the  cleaning up sits down on the top of a lofty mountainalpine teak  our writer styles it and meditates on the terrestrial and moral prospect before him much in the manner of a serious and highlyrespectable  young lady in a drawingroom this angel is spoken of as male his notions are those of neither one sex nor the other  which is orthodox no doubt although the effect on the reader is rather depressing in short the story is not otherwise describable by us than as nambypamby worse than that is the fact that it is a nambypamby allegory and an example of a style which has our peculiar abhorrence tried by its own standard there is however ample evidence of care and even of delicacy in writing on the authors part she has carried out her intentions with exactness neatness and precision the illustrations to this work are by m froment and are thoroughly in keeping with the text that is they are cleverly but too prettily drawnhave a good deal of daintiness and not enough

we possess in english and one that is of especial value since the tales are not merely translations the word  english however is somewhat misleadingso many of the tales are scotch it would be of interest also to know the actual source of the tales which mr jacobs heard in australia many of the tales are of course familiar to all students of folklore in english forms and i am not sure that mr jacobs versions are always the best occasionally too one seems to miss the genuine ring not of the folktale but of the folktelling and there are certain omissions thatunless mr jacobs is as i hope contemplating a second volumeare difficult to account for but despite small faults of commission and omission faults one only notices because the work is so good thc volume is most welcome only one protest  tom tit tot mr jacobs declares is  superior to any of the continental variants with which he is acquainted it may be that i am prejudiced and that therefore the german variant which delighted me as a child still seems to me the best be this as it may to me at least  rumpelstilzchen  seems more graceful more humorous and more dramatic than tom tit tot but whatever the grownup folk may say the little folk will be of only one opinion concerning these  talesthey will receive them with a chorus of delight and after all are not children the best as they are also the most honest of critics

tales more english fairy talfs collected and edited by iosepii jacobs illtistratel by j  batten d nutt mr jacobs has kept some of the best of his tales for this volume adhering to his former plan and stoutly defending it in his preface he has given them for the most part in the racy speech of the people but always keeping in mind that they are meant to be read and liked by children he refuses to draw a line between scottish and english border tales and so  rashincoatie  and  habitrot  are here it is a delightful and at the same time a very amusing collection full of humour and insight into peasant character and customs but none of the tales are here for any such serious reason but simply because they are good to read and listen to nfr batten never entered more thoroughly into the spirit of the tales than he has done in this volume which should be fully as popular as any of mr jacobs former oncs  celtic fain tales solectod and edited bv joseph jacobs editor of folklore illustrated by john d batten nutt tales and lng ends by av carew hazlitt sonnenschein  co mn jacobs tolls us in the preface that his chief difficulty has been that of selecting where there is so much ready to hand his collection consists of twentysix stories representing ireland scotland wales and cornwall but chiefly ireland and scotland in fact though brythons have here onl five storiesfour from wales  the shepherd of myddvai the wooing of olwen the brewery of eggshells and  beth gellort and one from cornwall  the tale of ivan mr jacobs however explains that it is not his fault that little wales is not better represented and hopes that the eisteddfod may do something for welsh folklore by offering prizes for collecting folktales in the principality this has been done to some extent but with no great rosults as yet at least so far as though public is concerned thus the eisteddfod held in london a few years ago awarded a prize to the rev elias owen for work done in this field  but what has becomo of it  we are not awaro that it has ever boon published then as to complete stories of any length we feel pretty certain that there are none such to be found in wales at the present day and this is our idea also as to though time not long ago when that peculiar collector of folklore wirt sikes flourished mr jacobs gives his readers clearly to understand whero ho has found his tales and how he has dealt with them modifying or excising though original translations from celtic hero and there where he found them ovorliteral for his avowed object is not to appeal to english folklorists and scholars but to intorost and please a more youthful class of roaders and wo certainly think that he has boen eminently successful mr batten has also done his part admirably and both he and mr jacobs leave one under the impression that they have not themselves escaped the fascination whereby  though captive celt has enslaved his captor in though realm of imagination though present volume accordingly attempts to begin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years and it may bo trusted to act in some measure as an antidote to the ruthless unreason of the budding golthers of our day by no means the least interesting portion of the volume is that consisting of the thirty pages of notes to the stories these it is neodloss to say are not quite exhaustive but it would be invidious to suggest here a variety of small additions which occur to us as of interest to the specialist all the notes aro decidedly instructive reading and some such as that in which the origin of the beth gelert story of llewelyn and his greyhound is traced break new ground others illustrate accidentally the position of mr jacobs in the folklore world for our readers are doubtless aware that folklorists aro divided in opinion on the question of parallel developments as against borrowing wo may cite the following passage as both explaining what we mean and dealing with a curious feature of folktales it occurs in mr jacobss notes on the story of  hudden and dudden p 248  it is indeed curious to find as m cosquin points out a cunning fellow tied in a sack getting out by crying i wont marry the princess in countries so far apart as ireland sicilyafghanistanand jamaicait is indeed impossible to think these are disconnected and for drolls of this kind a good case has been made out for the borrowing hypotheses by m cosquin and mr clouston who borrowed from whom is another and more difficult question which has to be judged on its merits in each individual case probably in this instance all would agree that there has been borrowing by somebody  but in some cases the other theory namely that of parallel developments in a similarity of circumstances is held by some students of folklore and to these mr jacobs at the recent international folklore congress gave the name of  casualists what is to bo the name of the other partythat to which he himself belongs probably some such name as  niigrationists  would do as well as any other but the difference between the two schools is only one of degree the migrationists being as they themselves think more sensitive to though numerical argument from a calculation of though chances against independent developments in each particular instance before we turn to mr hazlitts book we may bo permitted to express our regret that leisure was not found to revise the printers errols moro carefully for if words which are not english are introduced into an english book pains should be taken to have them spelled in some way recognised in the languages to which the belong  if you must needs speak of  the cymru you should know that it means  the wales and that you have to write  the cymry  if you wish to allude in that way to  the welsh people we have seen more than ono way of spelling the gaelic word for antiquary or storyteller but ve have never before seen it made into theenachie similarly  archroologia britannia and similar slips in the notes look strange and ought to disappear in future editions of which thore will we doubt not be many as the volume cannot fail to become popular and deservedly so it is difficult to know for what class of readers mr hazlitts book is designed not surely for students of folklore for in the preamble to robin hood on his 242nd page mr hazlitt says that  in dealing with this ancient and favourite tradition the editor has for the first time made use of such material only as appeared to him authentic so exactly half the book is valueless for scientific purposes unless as we gather from other parts of it mr hazlitts command of english is not always so complete as to enable him to say what he means students of folklore too require much more precise information than is here afforded and will naturally prefer to go to the fountain head for these interesting but wellknown old stories neither can the book be intended for young persons  or children for various incidents are related with  the masculine frankness of the old time nor yet for lovers of ballad poetry for none such when reading a selection of ballads from the  reliques which have been digested into prose whatever that may mean  would admit that  the probability is that many of the ancient tales here found present themselves for the first time in an intelligible form or that the handling of say for instance the nutbrowne maid is faithful and judicious and has made it capable of yielding to the lover of the ballad and folktale a store at once of entertainment and instruction what possible instruction is to he obtained from a translation which changes 0 lord what is th s worldys blysse tfhat ohangeth as the mone  my somers day in lusty may is derked bel ore the none 1 here you saye

mr hazlitt knew it he should have completed the work of modernization hy saying  part here to our mind however such treatment of our old ballads is both barbarous and unnecessary never yet have we seen the child of fair intelligence who could not after taking thought read and got pleasure out of  chevy chace  adam bel the  battle of otterburn and many others which have had both poetry and point taken out of them by mr hazlitt for a bit of fine confused writing showing a great deal of appreciation of and contempt for theso ballads and legends we commend our readers to the preface it is

fearsome pictures by a touch of humour  english fairy tales by joseph jacobs illustrated by j d batten nutt the flyleaf of this book tells us how to get into it the difficulty however will not be how to get into it but how to get out of it for from first to last almost without an exception these stories are delightful there are old friends among them which never can appear too often there are others with which we have hitherto only had a bowing acquaintance and there are one or two which are entirely new we are not quite sure about the whole party being englishone or two seem to have strayed out of grimms  kinder und hausmiirchen and to have been a little weakened on the way some of them judging from the point of view of folklore might certainly have been more appropriately included in a scotch collection mr jacobs explains their appearance thus  i have also included some stories that have only been found in lowland scotch i have felt justified in doing this as of the twentyone folktales contained in chamberss  popular rhymes of scotland no less than sixteen are also to be found in an english form the reasoning here is not strong but the stories are good we can imagine mr jacobs feeling the same pious joy that thrilled the old north  country steward who recounting to his absent lord the depredations caused by a foray made by the scots when  the falsehearted thieving loons  drove away flocks and herds over the border wound up by saying  but thankit be the lord we have outstolen them the more stories of this kind that are  lifted  into books that the public are likely to read the better and as mr jacobs informs his readers that some day he is going  to treat the subject of the english folktale on a larger scale with all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus  his readers may for the present wink at an english fairy tale called the laidly worm which is avowedly patched up out of a ballad by mr lamb of norham  with touches from the more ancient version  kempton  mr jacobs has performed the service of compiling an excellent version of  jack th giantkiller from two old chapbooks itt the british museum it is in all substantial points the same as that of which grimm gives a summary in the notes on english folktales at the end of the  hausmarchen a satisfactory version has long been needed for the chapbooks which told the story well seem to have been altogether superseded by those which told it badly we wonder no one took the trouble to go to the british museum with this object before all the illustrations to this book are good but that which shows jack entering the giants castle wearing the cap which makes him invisible is very good indeed and decidedly original in the preface to the  cauld lad of hilton mr jacobs speaks of him as the contrariest brownie ever known but he was not more contrary than brownies always are or were  they always behaved just as the  cauld lad  did if they found things orderly and clean they at once proceeded to break furniture and crockery to turn everything topsyturvy and play uncomfortable tricks of all kinds if however the servants were dirty and disorderly and went to bed leaving their work undone the brownie immediately began to put all in good order a brownies mission was therefore to demoralise servants by showing them that it was wise policy to leave their work undone the servants who had to do with the cauld lad of hilton castlenot hall by the way as mr jacobs has it must have been good ones or they would have suffered no inconvenience from the nightly visitant the brownie of hilton was however supposed to be the ghost of a poor lad working about the place who had been murdered there which may account for the servants anxiety to get rid of him another part of a brownies mission seems to have been to teach ingratitude for any present of clothes or of anything more substantial than a little milk or food always resulted in depriving the household of his services if a fault can be found with this book it is that we do not always quite like the way in which the stories are told mr jacobs says in his preface generally speaking it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse will speak when she tells fairy tales this being the case the critic can but ask himself two questions has mr jacobs done this satisfactorily  and is it a thing that it is well to do  he has done it very well if he wishes his nurse to be a rather vulgar one of the present day it is not prudent however to adopt this form of narration unless the imaginary nurse be made to use a simple and rather antiquated phraseology as a nurse of a hundred years ago whose style was formed on the bible might have done all the events recorded in fairy tales are supposed to have taken place long ago and seem to demand a somewhat archaic or to say the least oldfashioned form of speech the critics sense of fitness was always a little ruffled ly mr dasents method of telling a tale and the same irritation is felt upon perusing such sentences as these   dartersays she  put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em a little  or  go you and get one o them there pies or  she sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry   or  he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents but that did not btop long or this in  childe rowland  and the thing to do is this  after you have entered the land of fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the burd ellen you must out with your fathers brand and off with their head or this from  jack and the beanstalk    right you are said the man  and here they are the very beans themselves he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of strangelooking beans  as you are so sharp said he i dont mind doing a swop with youyour cow for these beans  walker  says jack   wouldnt you like it  it is to be hoped that when mr jacobs republishes these stories with the  necessary paraphernalia referred to already he will carefully do away with the only thing that damps the readers pleasure in them by carefully revising the nurses language  literature fairy tales indian fairy tales edited by joseph jacobs nutt fairy tales from the far east by theo gift lawrence  bullen fairy tales in other lands by julia goddard cassell  co scenes in fairyland by canon atkinson macmillan  co household tales and fairy stories routledge  sons mr jacobs has put together a good collection of stories some of which were gathered into the fold of literature more than two thousand years ago in the  kathasarit sagara of somadeva while others are the jetsam and flotsam of the present day rescued by miss frere miss stokes major temple c here too are to be found some of the fables of bidpai and the jatakas being interpreted  kathasarit sagara means  ocean of the streams of story did somadevas title mean that all known stories of all known lands had streamed into the ocean of his collection and found a home there and in the country in which it was formed mr jacobs is evidently inclined to hold the contrary opinion and to believe that all other countries derived their fairy tales and fables from india the majority of the tales in this volume he writes  havo been known in the west in some form or other and the problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in farthest west and east surely if as mr jacobs asserts they existed or began to exist at one and the same time in farthest west and east there is no problem to solve for it would be manifest that they were not transmitted from one country to another but that each had its own independent origin some mr jacobs continues aa benfey in germany m cosquin in france and mr clouston in england have declared that india is the home of the fairy tale and that all european fairy tales have been brought from thence by crusaders by mongol missionaries by gipsies by jews by traders by travellers we are happy to find that mr jacobs though he exhibits a strong leaning towards this theory does not go so far as these writers were it true indeed we should have to believe that for more centuries than we dare to contemplate the children of rich and poor alike in europe went supperless to bed so far as food for the imagination was concerned and that the patient peasantry spent the long dark hours when work was impossible unamused and unamusing we do not believe that they waited until the lord of the land brought back a story from the crusades or an argosy of stories put into port from the far east we prefer to believe with the grimmsthe farseeing fathers of all literature of research of this kindthat while the possibility nay in particular instances the probability of a story passing from one people to another and there firmly rooting itself on the foreign soil is not to be denied the property in fairy tales is common to all and that the  selfsame stories crop up again and again in places most widely remote from each other like a spring which forces its way up in spots which lie far apart and just as wherever the eye can pierce we tind domestic animals grain field and kitchen utensils household furniture armsin fact all the things without which social life would be impossibleso do we also rind sagas and stories corresponding with each other in a striking and yet independent manner they are just as much a necessity of existence as these things and only where avarice and the jarring wheels of machinery benumb every other thought can one imagine it possible to live without them this being the case in comparing the stories of various countries it is by no means necessary to attribute a storys origin to the country in which it appears to have been first current we must always remember that the number of rootstories is extremely limited so that a good deal of similarity must naturally be looked for the jatakas or birth stories of buddha have with the assistance of prof rhysdavids supplied theo gift with nine excellent stories for children nine however would by no means have sufficed had she not lengthened them considerably sometimes pleasantly and judiciously at others we are tempted to ask her to study one of the stories she has selected  the tortoise that could not hold its tongue that story bytheby in the original is told in three or four pages theo gift tells it in twentynine she ignores chronology and eastern local colour with absolute frankness and courage in one sense to ignore facts of time and space is to catch the very spirit of fairyland in another to talk of perambulators in a tale which was not new when it was committed to writing in the fifth century ad gives a shock to any reader who cares about the fitness of things deserts in theo giftrs stories seem to have a good deal of juicy grass interspersed with the sand  farmyards appear to be very like english farmyards  cows are called buttercup  and buttermilk aud clover seem to be going there is a story indeed which begins once upon a time in the days when the great great greatgrandfathers of our great great greatgrandfathers were just having their first breeches made there lived a farmer with one daughter of whom he was very fond he was a rich farmer and his fields were full of corn and clover and his orchards of apples and plums  and he had plenty of horses and cattle and sheep and poultry and pigs and pigeons and a yarddog and kitchen cat and every one of them was so well fed and cared for that even the geese in the pond said   this is the best place in the whole country to live in and so said the sage and onions too this is a hopelessly lower class nineteenth century presentment a great many more greatgreatgreatgrandfathers are needed to take us back to the time when these stories were  human natures daily food and a great deal more study to imbue us with its spirit and yet in spite of aberrations of this kind the book is often entertaining and well written we must not omit to commend mr oswald von glenns illustrations the ten little stories miss goddard has printed will be welcomed in the nursery and probably all the better liked for bearing a strong family likeness to other stories which have long reigned supreme in that domain if the  beauty  brings down the  beast on the father by asking for a few samples of the great wall of china instead of the conventional rose the story is still pleasant reading and the beast though much less interesting is as placable as the beast of our early affections if the japanese red riding hood becomes a  blue mantle and the wolf turns into the allegory of the nile the story is still a story in addition to these departures from the wellbeaten track we have a scandinavian somewhere close to the north pole jack the giantkilleronly he ought not to have been called jan an egyptian puss in boots which becomes a cat in yellow slippers and a persian jack and the beanstalk in which the beanstalk is turned into a carrot with a bushy top and jack has to descend underground instead of climbing up to dangerous heights this little book is sent forth with no hint of any desire to do more than amuse children from beginning to end there is not a word as to the origin of the stories or any of their incidents we accept it on its own showing the stories are prettily told fairyland appears to be easily entered from the moorland parish over which canon atkinson has for forty and odd years presided and yorkshire scenery and dialect come largely into play in his volume when they do not coin words for themselves the hero and heroine use those in vogue in cleveland they  scuttle people off home and encounter other people who stump about cannily and laugh a ramshackle laugh the fairies too wash their clothes at  the kerd of the country side and bittle them on the big flat stones near by this is pleasant enough but when  miss mary who does lessons is surprised over things and continually expresses her surprise by exclaiming  whatever will nurse say we wish she had done these lessons to more purpose miss mary is disappointing  instead of being witty she is snappish when she opens her mouth it is most frequently to say  psha and in spite of her various experiences in fairyland she cannot be persuaded to believe in fairies a book of this kind makes us hasten to renew our allegiance to the incomparable alice and the sweet unreasonableness of lewis carroll it is unreasonableness which never runs too long in the same groove but for ever surprises us with some unexpected change of venue while alices good manners and politeness under trying circumstances are unfailing 4 scenes in fairyland shows a

another playerssay a golden ball caught a blue oneit just opened and took it bodily in and became twice the size it was before and the player whose ball got most of the other balls and grew to be ad big as a great school globe as it might he was the winner it was mr lang who said that fairy 44 tales consist of but very few incidents grouped together in a kaleidoscopic variety of arrangement and

collections of perrault madame daulnoy grimm and a good collection of english fairy tales and he will henceforth see little that is new in any book of the kind the christmas book of fairy tales seems indeed to be produced with as much regularity and in much the same way as the christmas pudding we almost think we could give the recipe by which  household tales was compounded take four or five stories from perrault dilute those which seem to require it with good wholesome commonplace mix thoroughly with these an equal number from madame daulnoy a handful from grimm and a sprinkling from mlle de la force or any one else who is preferred then stir in a number of old english stories and ballads and boil the mixture for six hours by the study fire dish up in blue or scarlet and gold

of the human brain but with the far more laudable object of amusing the young herein he should be successfcal at any rate he has contrived to entertain the old and perhaps the young are not vastly more ritical mr jacobs has thrown his net wide and has gathered in stories from the printed works of campbell kennedy hyde curtin and the rest nor has he shrunk from editing and adapting such work as he elected to reprint indeed his book is completely purged of pedantry his single aim being to amuse he has ingeniously blent the comic and the romantic and has positively published a book without an afterthought a conspicuous triumph in these days of moralities true in his preface he murmurs something about a union of hearts but he obtrudes no  views and one little excursion into the prevailing vice may be condoned the book has its blemishes the story of beth gellert for instance is wholly out of place mr jacobs version is a bald paraphraseworthy of a boardschool boyof the hon w r spencers poem taken from an obviously literary source the narrative chimes neither in diction nor in eftect with the genuine folktale in vain does mr jacobs inform you that the story is an apologue which is met with in every country from india to wales the question may scarce be answered authoritatively and there seems no reason why it should not be a record of actual experience the tidelity of the dog the sudden anger of the master may easily be matched outside the radius of folklore and once you grant the story the moral follows as a matter of course a child of six could hardly hear of elerts death and not take it as a warning against human iinpctulositv but even if it be a recurrence of the old type its sctting is so modern and the atsence of the supernatural and the inconsequent so marked that it were far better away however it serves to suggest to mr jacobs a learned note which we trust no child will be induced to read now and then too the diction generally studied and correct descends into the commonest slang but these are venial errors  and the book in their despite is as pleasant a collection as you could wish to imeet the stories are both quaint and picturesque of

addressing a young lady the other day after this fashion 44 so you are for the heir of redclyffe i divide young ladies into two species one who swear by the heir of redclyffe and the other by queechy was it not an exasperating speech ladies  and an insulting comparison many will add yet queechy has its beauties too  not the hushed and sweet pervading charm the perfect taste the innate elegance the refined beauty no nor even the passion and intense interest of the heir of redclyffe but a simple untamed natural beauty of its own it is emphatically protestant and perhaps what is called a little sectarian  rough too and outspoken at times it has an air of the wild woods and the back settlements about it the 44 heir of redclyffe is like a deep blue italian sky with a rich gorgeous passionate sunset queechy is more like an autumn heaven iii our cold climate with merry patches of sunlight bursting through the gloom and a cold sharp healthful wind abroad chasing the falling leaves yet these are but fantastic similes and only play about the truth like bees that hover round the blossoms without settling the 4heir of redclyffe  is out of all compare the higher and the deeper work artistically and morally its foundations are deeper laid and its parts are more thoroughly selfconsistent it yields evidence of a highly cultivated mind a genial spirit a kind and generous heart and a clear and powerful intellect so keen is the discrimination of character evinced and so sweetly and unobtrusively is it displayed we might rather match miss yonges creations with those of miss sewell also admirable of their kind her 44 katharine ashton being an especial favourite  we were sorry to find her fall so far beneath herself in her late 44 cleve hall but both these gentle and cheering lights may well shine on in their kindred spheres without having the relative brilliancy of their orbits too curiously investigated the star of the 4 heir of redclyffe  casts a wider and more brilliant ray but there is a chaste and holy influence in the beams of the sister planet but no more of this come we to the matter directly at issue the merits of the 44 daisychain this is a certainly lengthy family chronicle of some 600 closely printed pages with little or no plot and perhaps not much romantic interest and yet it has interested and edified us not a little there is little or no direct didactic teaching but a healthful atmosphere breathes through the whole there are a thousand wayside flowers though no gorgeous magnolia or other hothouse blossoms the dear mother so soon removed the enthusiastic gallant generous father the doctor and all the children become familiar to us as real acquaintances we do not think of them as of characters in a book but as of actual people respecting whom we are entitled to hold our own opinions sometimes not coinciding with those of the author norman is too proud and too fastidious to please us though he is a noble fellow after all henry is well nigh our favourite of the boys  richard is very good but a little of a bore  then for the girls ethel though certainly a good deal like miss bremers 44 petrea is like with a difference more learned and perhaps more earnest more english altogether margaret verifies the motto si douce est la margarine mary flora all are to the life whether we like or dislike them but how yield our readers an idea of the charm of this book by quotations that were impossible unless the quotations were very ample and our review exceedingly elaborate within such limits as we shall allot ourselves we can only say that reading the 44 daisychain  is something like taking a walk through a plain country which does not appear romantic at first sight in the early summer when every chance step discloses some new object of delight the wild flowers in the hedges the rich blossom of the may the gay and giddy butterflies the blue sky overhead with its white clouds scudding past the sun and the sense of living joy which animates creation this is not a book to read straight through or in a hurry you will not enjoy it then you are not hurried along by wild excitement as in miss brontes startling creations but young people will love the 44 daisy chain and so will many of their elders and we feel that we are bound to thank miss young for teaching us unselfishness simplicity and rectitude in such a very pleasant and unpretending way she has strung a wreath of daisies it is true but they are daisies that will not wither  the daisy chain  or aspirations a family chronicle by the author of the heir of i redclyffe c parker  son the links of the daisy chain are eleven young children living in a country town with kind parents and a happy english home each daisy is the complete child of nature yet has its own individuality which is preserved throughout and each character speaks so naturally for itself that the reader seems to be one of the  chain and sitting in family conclave round the hearth the book must be taken up with a determination to enter into home feelings for story there is none the contrast between the children and their various  aspirations form the only incidents that verge on excitement so that the feelings must be interested alone by the truthfulness and simplicity of the family chronicle so many young heroes and heroines with their instructors give the author of the heir of redclyffe and  heartsease ample opportunities for exercising her peculiar genius for minute sketches of character but we must warn her that when carried into too minute ramifications it will be apt to be pronounced  finicking no better idea can be given of the story than by quoting the daisies mothers description of them which certainly will interest those the most who have daisies of their own  you say it is long since you had a portrait gallery of the chicken daisies and if i do not write in these leisure days you will hardly get it after i am in the

has not such a happy life as blanche he is often in trouble at lessons and bullied by harry at play in spite of his champion mary  and yet i cannot interfere for it is good for him to have all this preparatory teazing before he goes into school he hus good abilities but not much perseverance or energy and i must take the teaching of him into my own hands till his schooldays begin in hopes of instilling them the girlishness and timidity will be knocked out of him by the boys i suppose harry is too kind and generous to do more than tease him moderately and norman will see that it does not

heedlessness of all but one absorbing object have kept her back and caused her much discomfort yet i sometimes think these manifest defects have occasioned a discipline that is the best thing for the

prepared to say offhand how many different artists have interpreted the christmas carol  since john l eech illustrated it on its first appearance but we have no hesitation in saying that miss appletons eight paintings are worthy to rank beside the best of those illustrations by her many predecessors she is not much concerned with the humour the grotesquerie of the story but we doubt if the poetry the grace the tenderness and fantasy of dickens were ever more delicately or more sympathetically depicted than they are in her drawings her scrooge should have been a little grimmer a little harder of feature perhaps but her tiny tim and bob cratchit and the rest of his family are delightfully natural and human she is very successful too in dealing with the eerie ghostly elements of the narrative her wintery nights have the hue and atmosphere of winter and the spirits that haunt them are veritable things of mist and bodiless we congratulate both artist and publishers on this

long familiarity with cruikshank  phiz  and mahoney one is always apprehensive of a new illustrator of dickens it is not that our visualising of a dickens character has become stereotyped but a

method of suffusing his mind with that  christmas atmosphere the loss of which is a common matter of lament in these prosy and practical days there are probably many others who find that the magic of

chambers this new edition of  a christmas carol with its fine bold type and coloured illustrations by a j keller  a christmas carol  will always have an abiding place in the affections of the general reader it is not merely that the characters are life  like but that as someone has aptly said of dickens  he is a portrayer of living souls rather than of living men it is here that the secret of the great novelist is found to read a christmas carol with a responsive mind is to be brought into rapport with the essential spirit of humanity and to be awakened to the true meaning of fellowship with the world especially the struggling heroic and kindly portion of it the present repoduction of covy chambers volume should make an acceptable a n d a p prop riate christmas gift to all but those

most popular of dickenss christmas books illustrated bv one of our most popular artists the art of mr rackham is in its way as unique as the art of dickens and in  a christmas carol  he has a theme that is exactly suited to his genius pickwvick might have been too beefilv real and robust for him  oliver twist  and other of the novels would have called for a more conventional realism than would have appealed to him but the carol with its mingling of the fantastic the supernatural and actual life gives natural scope and play to his peculiar powers and it is not too much to say that never have those qualities in dickens been more sympathetically or more imaginatively interpreted than in the delightful series of drawings that illustrate this book the genial humour the grotesque eeriness the pathos and graceful fancy that are in the story are faithfully mirrored in mr rackhams pictures they could not have harmonised more completely with the atmosphere and feeling of the tale if the very spirit of dickens had entered into the artist while he worked the result is a beautiful and ideal edition of the ideal christmas story,juvenile
