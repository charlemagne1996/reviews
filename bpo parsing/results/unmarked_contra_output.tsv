book by vernon lee otherwise miss viola paget is far too well known to require to be dealt with at length the present volume of vanitas polite stories which the authoress describes as sketches of frivolous women is a second edition in which has been included a new story entitled a frivolous conversion the heroine madame nitzenko middleaged commonsensible charming sarcastic kindly and russian is one of a party stopping at the engadiner hof her vishvis is count kollonitz a young man of the world who has done everything and seen everything and who has worked out for himself a kind of philosophy of life which can be turned and twisted to suit his present mood from the depths of an armchair madame nitzenko riddles his philosophy with her common sense and pricks his overweening vanity with her sharp tongue little by little however the young count loses his first dislike of her seeks her out and discusses life and its component parts the charm and value of the story lie in the psychology and characterisation the atmosphere is bright and gay and the various philosophies under discussion are treated with the light and skilful pen which miss paget knows so well how to wield the second heroine created by miss rhoda broughton is of quite a different mould though by some strange coincidence the action of the story takes place in a similar milieu the devil and the deep sea is the name of the book and it must be read from cover to cover all by herself lonely and shrinking from attention this young girl sits among the flexes her face stamped with the lines of suffering she thinks of the past with horror and fright and is only recalled to the possibilities of the present and future by the sight of a man in even worse plight than herself battered and broken lying helplessly in an invalid chair in the golden sunlight her sorrow is partially obliterated by the sight of his and pity for his loneliness makes her do little things for him in spite of his rudeness and obvious detestation of being noticed at all she finds out that he too has a past which it is his one object in life besides that of getting well to keep secret this mutual tie draws her sympathies still more and she protects him from the importunities of the other visitors in the hotel step by step she overcomes his timidity and reserve in a charmingly unassuming manner and compels him to look upon her as a friend until at last they both discover to their fright that love has ousted friendship from their hearts he is forced by outside circumstances to confess his secret past and she forces herself by the strength of her love to open her skeletoncupboard to his view what is inside it would be unfair to disclose but it is well worth reading the book to find out the dramatic surprise reserved for the last few chapters is a surprisea thing which is rare miss broughtons characters are all alive and human though we think it would make for more enjoyable and fluent reading if she would boldly write  dont  shant etc instead of the oldfashioned forms  do not you shall not you the little sketch of the family who also share the hotel with the heroine is most refreshing and amusing the sudden drama and tragedy is so unexpected that it is not until one has read the last line of the last page that one can appreciate the full meaning of the title mr e m sneydkynnersleys heroine makes her debut as a mountain climber in the alps the book labours under the title of  a snails wooing seeing that the heroine met the snail in august for the very first time and that the aforesaid molluscous animal proposed to her in the september following we do not think that there is justice or even propriety in the title we suppose that in the mountains they have change tout cela be that as it may the heroine whose name though cordelia  might have been goneril or yerenhappuck is a delicious young girl bubbling over with enthusiasm and delight at seeing and doing new things the possessor of an angelic singing voice and guaranteed to cause a disturbance in the heart of the most ferocious bachelor she carries all before herguides experienced climbers edelweiss and mountains

endured bef ore bagging them to quote the authors phrase those who have no experience of the alps will assuredly find themselves longing to follow in the tracks of the snail and the heroine and capture for themselves the wonders and beauties peculiar to the vast snowclad peaks in switzerland the author is possessed of a keen sense of humour which he has not sought to repress and the pages of this delightful book team with the spirit of fun till laughter voiceless through excess waves mute appeal and sore above the midriffs deep distress for breath to laugh once more we do not desire to convey that our condition at every page was such as is described in kiplings  necessitarian  the book would be extremely painful if such were the casebut the author is so sudden and unexpected at

head who compelled the admiration and service of all who had the good fortune to come in contact with her a certain period of the life of an english gentlemanan enormous giant of a man who cares for nothing save physical adventure and who sleeps with his sword by his pillowwhich is bound up with her interests is the groundwork for an excellent quasihistorical novel of the stanleyweyman type the presence of the great cardinal looming in the background and incidentally drawn on the cover with the vacillations of louis and his brother throw up into strong relief the more or less pathetic figures of anne and the duchesse surrounded by their friends fighting against overwhelming odds scheming plotting and intriguing by day and night under the shadow of the bastillethe huge englishman quick of brain strong of arm and clever of sword finds the intrigues amusing and only requires to be attracted by the beautiful marie de rohan now duchesse de chevreuse to throw his lot in heart and soul with the losing side the story of his adventures and the share he has in the fight against richelieu make up mr humfrey jordans novel entitled  my lady of intrigue it is admirably constructed and the interest is sustained throughout we like the englishman for his blunt common sense and with him feel sympathy for the defeated woman the sketches of richelieu gaston the kings brother anne of austria and many other wellknown historical personages of less note are skilfully and interestingly drawn and the exciting and adventurous elements in the book are told with none of the flamboyant  word painting  and excess in which so many of the historical novelists indulge we do not know mr humfreyjordans name as the author of other novels and if this is his first attempt he is to be

first productions were brilliant successes the channings and east lynne areeven yetimpressedupon our memories as amongst the most entertaining and lifelike of novels the channings especially opened quite a fresh field to storylovers its chief excellence lying in the fact that it forsook the worn tracts of ordinary romance and came nearer home readers fancied that theyllad met the channings out of the pages of the novel in ordinary social intercourse and no book was given with greater confidence into the hands of children by parents than the channings there was a high social tone pervading its pages the characters were not immaculate but real living beings whose alternate shades of darkness and light both in their dispositions and worldly vicissitudes might have found their types in many a pure elevated english household east lynne was not by any means so pure an example but it had very high excellences there was but little that was overstrained the episodes were startling but they were not improbable thecharacters had very decided human weaknesses but they wvere not put forward in an offensive light but rather toned down to meet possible prejudices many objected to certain incidents being incorporated into the story the elopement of the doctors wife through jealousy was not a pleasant subject but the incident is not an uncommon one in ordinary life and it was carefully handled the concluding incidents were the most faulty in the story the return of the first wife in disguise to find another in her place and to be compelled to conceal her identity was rather an awkward conception which although it was got rid of by her speedy death left a most uncomfortable conclusion to the story it had been well for mrs henry woods reputation if she had tried to improve such defects in her style as appearel in her first works  and instead of treating her popularity as a mere commercial speculation to earn money had steadily set herself to study the art of fiction

george canterburys will and  bessy rane as fit only to rank amongst the most inferior of sensation novels there is a bad moral tone pervading them throughout the atmosphere is unhealthy and not all

criticism from the press but we will insert two specimens of a new style which appears in mrs henry woods novels for the first time and leave the general public to judge for themselves it is dickens

would call  simple narration a device used by balzac and turgenev but not we think by any other great european novelist of the nineteenth century not even strangely enough by de maupassant the user of this device may be deemed to adopt the following attitude toward his reader   see here i have some very curious and interesting facts to tell you and i will relate them straightforwardly without embroidery and with only such explanations and descriptions as are absolutely necessary i merely want you to get hold of the facts indeed you must listen to them because they have interested me tremendously and i am sure they will interest you whatever you do dont mistake me for a romancer a concocter of stories now just listen and i wont waste your time  there now wasnt that worth hearing  true  of course it is true that is why i wished you to hear it such an attitude and such a method employed with skill and discretion are enormously effective in the way of vraisemblance and vraisemblance is esteemed by novelists the highest quality of narrative art it isntno one ever imagined that paradise lost was truebut that is another and a larger question there are five stories in mr harriss volumetwo rather slight and unequal to the three larger onesand each leaves you with the impression that the events told did actually occur the best tale is the first one the lovestory of an old espada told like most of the others in the first person it is a sinister and powerful recital and the bullfighting lore comes out of the mouth of old montes in a very natural and convincing manner  profit and loss  is a tale of kansas citymr harriss cosmopolitanism amounts almost to an affectationand the theme is an arson committed by an employee at the instigation of his employer the reward being the latters daughter the analysis of the criminals feelings after the crime is one of the best things in the book  he realised that all efforts were in vain that nothing could check the fire that his work was done completely and then remorse came upon him at first with a vague sense of loss nuch as one feels in missing the familiar and accustomed later with the full understanding of waste and destruction as acutely keen regret    the last story  sonia is russian and very obviously it has been composed at the feet of ivan turgenev mr harris could not have gone to a better master but nevertheless sonia is only a clever imitation the episode of the assassination of alexander ii is here used with singular dramatic effect the book as a whole is capable but mr harriss careless way

excellent stories in this book the first and though one called first love a confession  montes the matador is tiie story of a great matadors love and hate but it is chiefly remarkable for the wonderful descriptions of bullfighting which occur in it mr harris not only must havo seen and enjoyed the sport but he makes his readers see it enter into though spirit of it and admire the excitement the wonderful escapes and the combined daring and skill of good bulllighters whether cspada banderillo or ehulo as a dramatic description of the great spanish tport by a lover of it this could not lie bettered she sordid aspect and the cruelty are left out of sightbut that is right for the matador who tells the story would not see them  he sees only the glorious excitement and the art of it ho even reveals a sort of love for the bulls whom he kills which comes from his intimate knowlodge of their character and their differences the story too which he tellshot passionate and cruelseems to flt exactly with the atmosphere to which it belongs in its way this tale is perfect tliero is not a jarring touch in it it is simply a bit of spanish life  first love is good also though it does not seem so inevitable as the first story lt is the description of the calflove of a very young girl for a quite ordinary young man to whom she attaches all manner of heroic qualities she linds that she can attract him against his will but knowing that ho does not love her she goes away and delilerately kills her passion he meets her years afterwards when he is prosperously married hears the story from her and is sorry at what he missed the conscientious vulgarity and stupidity of the young man on the stock exchange are admirably indicated in his own jmrrative of though events mr harris by the way shows great skill in allowing the unimaginative young englishman honourable but terribly commonplace to reveal himself unconsciously in describing his love affairs it is just the same type of man this time a budding mp who plays the second rule in the last story  sonia his ijewildorment and almost unwilling attraction on meeting a young woman ol unconventional ideas are very well suggested by his falling in love with her chiefly because she is a mystery to him and his very evident though shamefaced relief when he leaves her to consort with his correct young friends in the diplomatic service nevertheless sonia herself is not quite convincing and still less is though hero of profit and loss this is an otherwise delightful study in irony but it is spoilt by our inability to believe that david tryon would ever really have committed the crime he is here represented to have perpetrated altogether it is a book which proves mr harris to be in the first rank ot shortstory

downright virtues of muscularity so far so good but we want analysis not deification of the muscular ideal and that is where mr jack london fails we do not wish to disparage in any way the son of the

his spirit his reduction to working in harness with teams of sleddogs the gradual awakening of the inherited primordial instincts of his race and his final lapse into savagery and return to the wild

that could be desired it is the best thing the public has had so far from the pen of a young author who though he made his first bow but yesterday has already shown a fresh and vigorous bent in story combined with a certain amount of originality and dramatic power hitherto his originality has smacked strongly of kipling worship but in the present volume though it is from beginning to end the story

numerous progeny buck changes hands and begins to learn the law of club and fang the klondyke rush is in full swing dogs are urgentlyneeded for sledge work and the thief who steals buck steals a good

and with a restraint and artistry which were wanting in the authors earlier books the author has a stronger hand in description than in dealing with human emotions that is a painful chapter which recounts bucks sale to a trio of incompetent greenhorns who hope to make up with brutality for what they lack in ability and knowledge from their stupidly cruel hands buck in the last stage of starvation and exhaustion is rescued by the best master he ever had a friend and master whom any dog north or south might love and honour they make a brave pair and much might be quoted from the authors account of their escapades spurred on by native recklessness and by his pride in his dog bucks master accepts a wager of a thousand dollars that his dog can break out and walk away with a thousandpound load on a sledge this is a task for a team of ten dogs the account of bucks success is heartstirring failure on the dogs part would have made a beggar of his master and after it was over

air of the south downs in the pages of this novel we rise refreshed and inspirited fiom the perusal of these three enticing volumesa result which has become so unusual latterly with readers of works of fiction as the story ran through the pages of blackwood it had many admirers and it is not too much to say that mr blackmore has never produced superior work in ilorna doone there were more striking passages of natural description possibly and in  the maid of sker there was at least one character of more intense individuality but the present novel is remarkable for its general merit given unquestionable genius at the outsetwhich mr blackmore possesseswe should expect an author to ripen in this manner so that his work while it may not impress us for the force of any single attribute will leave upon us a very distinct idea of power that a novel should be styled a worthy suc cessor to the two works we have just named is no mean tribute yet it is one which we are able to pay on the present occasion in the fullest and frankest manner one point has especially struck us in relation to the present story and that is the utter lack of straining after effect either by a spasmodic brilliancy of style or sensationalism of plot the gentleman and the scholar are alike perceptible in every chapter and we are never in a state of dubiety as to the healthy morality he would teach of absolute flinging of moral lessons at the head of the reader there is indeed very little but the whole might very well be placed before the hysterical and sensuous school who having gratified the lower passions of their readers throw an occasional sop to the almighty by patronising religion the true end of the novelist mr blackmore always keeps in viewnamely that of telling the unvarnished history of any character he undertakes to depict one incident at the close of his latest story would in other hands have appeared unreal and grotesque but the author has so manipulated it that it adds to the effect of his work the lorraines of coombe lorraine were a very old family possessing undoubted records of their abode in the land for centuries there was always from the time of baronets either a sir roland sir hilary or sir roger lorrainenames which were never strayed from for the head of the race the present baronet when the story opens in 1811 was sir roland he had an only son hilary and an only daughter alice hilary is sent up to the inner temple to read with glanvil malahide kc one of his fellowpupils was a gregory lovejoy son of a grower who made a rich thing out of his land in the valley of the upper medway a few miles above maidstone while on a visit here with gregory hilary falls desperately in love with mabel lovejoy at which we can express no surprise if the original were anything like mr blackmores portraiture she is a most charming creature yet with a strong heart circumstances favouving as in duty bound thy ought to do mabel was induced to return his aftbction elut here the smooth course of love ends oz returning to coombe lorraine hilary endeavours to persuade his father in favour of mabel sir roland owever will not permit him to descant upon her numerous virtues and concludes in this strain let th wings of imagination spread themselves in a more favourable direction this interview must close on my part with a suggestive but perhaps selfevident proposition hilary the door is open hilary avails himself of the parental suggestion and goes off to the war in the peninsula as he finds he cannot give up his love for the growers daughter the young recruit covers himself with glory at ciudad rodrigo and other places and becomes very popular with all the fellows in his regiment on one occasion he gets desperately wounded and is tended during his illness by the lovely daughters of the count of zamora one of these goes very near wounding him deeply in the region of the heart and he does not get released from his entanglement except at a very severe cost she is the means of his losing 50000 guineas the property of the british army for which he is cashiered by the duke of wellington he afterwards however recovers his credit meanwhile during this history what has become of the heroine who gives the title to the book  alice is a truly noble highspirited girl a proposition is made to her by her grandmotherwho eventually obtains sir rolands consent to the matchthat she should marry captain chapman the disreputable son of sir remnant chapman a landowner who has got possession of too many of the lorraine acres lady valeria lorraine thinks this would be an excellent way of recovering them alice ventures to think otherwise but in the end being persuaded that the honour of the house requires it she consents to sacrifice herself on the morning of the weddingday nevertheless she casts herself into the woeburn a stream which has always been a dreaded one with the lorraines on being drawn from the river after she has fulfilled the prediction of the astrologeronly this can save lorraine one must plunge to rescue twainshe remains for several hours apparently lifeless but the heart at length resumes its office and she is recovered sir roland lorraine is stricken with illness when he learns of his daughters supposed suicide a happy event hastens the story to a happy end mabel lovejoy has an immense fortune left to her which is generously given to the lorraines by her father and hersolf and alice and hilary are thus both savedthe former to marry major aylmer a brave british officer and the latter to reconcile sir roland to his union with mabel the above is the merest outline of the story and gives no idea of the quantity of byplay which runs through the volumes some of the best drawn characters are those which are least prominent notably the rev struan hales a sporting parson of the old type and bonny a boy wvho owns a donkey which may lay claim to more intelligence than we should

universallycirculated report that it contained a portraiture of mendelssohn and the fact that any revelations concerning that beloved and lamented man of genius find an eagerpublic in england encouragedwe may warrantably say intoxicatedby the attention paid to that novel its author here gives out a second story as wild florid and rhapsodical as if the least sane passages in mr disraelis  vivian grey  in mr melvilles  typee and in  villette  had been flung into the cauldron with the hope of the mixture turning out something astonishingly sublime and beautiful  the hero of  counterparts is a young jewish physician whose wisdom courage beneficence subtlety and taste exercise a powerful charm over the inhabitants of x the town in which he practises the heroine is an inscrutable teacher in a ladies boardingschool who happens to be called down to speak to the physician when he is summoned to attend a sick pupil dr sarona on seeing miss dudleigh perceives that she herself is in great perilon the verge of a brain feverand at once brings her to his house and domesticates her there with his perfect sister salome thus begins the tale  and the characters and incidents through which it leads us are in perfect correspondence with the probabilities of its commencement six miles from x there lives by the side of the sea a young poetvery rich very childish and very wayward he is a darling friend of dr saronas and on miss dudleigh making his acquaintance she is smitten to the heartall x including miss sarona imagining the while that she and the doctor are about  to make a match of it so far from this being the case dr sarona is about the same time fatally wounded by the charms of miss rose de bern a protegee of miss dudleighs which lady the young poet bernard marries but it apears afterwards that the young poet would lave preferred to marry miss dudleigh rather than hose and had only refrained from trying to win the former because he imagined that the doctor was in love with her we have given the merest possible skeleton of this case of delicate distress  the combinations of selfsacrifice and misunderstanding with which it is filled up being too numerous for present recital what has been said moreover will in no respect forestall the close of the story it is told in even wilder and more gorgeous language than its predecessor and of this we will give a specimen or two lest we be thought critical without just cause redhaired ladiesthe ladies lake and the viscount windermere their brother who appeared to be exteiiding over them a haughty yet serene superintendence had all red hair a vivid violent red not too fine but waved and crisped like the ripples of a river in a breeze together with red hair they possessed those waxen complexions ofthe

pupil overspread the iris  the lustrous seagreen in its grey was lost and the look became more like a crouching leopards than that of a man and a poet with a soft fierceness and subtle detestation which can only be so described nor was the similitude destroyed by the smile that divided the lips and through their mysterious parting showed the glitter of teeth like snowa bluish white rather than pearly ivory the victim all unconsciously was gathered to the spell stern as she was and scarcely womanhearted she was bowed to the bending expressionnot approach a wonderful facealready his faceso

clinging to her lips like those unheard whispers of the touch which men call kisses that exalted almost unnatural ecstacy which lifts the martyr into insufferable calm  which presses on the dying like a sea of lightwrapped folded interpenetrated lier she never was with sarona whose spiritual nature was unsheathed instead of shaded by the spell of presence hut she remembered the one expression of his love now withholden from his glance now iced beneath his smile but which once had dawned in a moment that stretched throughout eternity the above are only three among a thousand similar passages that could be cited yet in the midst of all this clotted nonsense to avail ourselves of johnsons phrase the just reader will find that there is somewhat of power and passion imbedded the writer has wrought inself up into believing that such fine language is deep and real but not as sometimes happens in like cases out of poverty so much as out of perversity there is genuine selfdelusion in his frenzy we imaginenot conscious imposture could he prevail on himself to respect the modest boundaries of common sense he might become a good novelist whereas should a third tale outdo  counterparts as far as  counterparts outdoes its predecessor tia case must be given up as one of hopeless disease past the power even of so omnipotent a philanthropist as dr sarona to relieve  counterparts or the crou of love by the author of charles auchester smith elder and co 65 cornhill the plot of this novel is somewhat flimsy in structure and is rather devoid of interest nor is it interspersed with powerfully delineated dramatic scenes calculated to rise vividly before the imagination of the reader the three volumes are chiefly filled by long monotonous dialogues between persons whose characters have little affinity with those by whom the world is really peopled dr herz sarona the chief medical adviser of the inhabitants of h is the perfect character of the book superior to all around him he overawes them by his manners his judgement never errs nor does he ever desert the path of duty attending a case of brain fever in a school his keen perceptive faculty leads him to discover that miss dudleigh the music teacher is a genius whose brain must infallibly succumb under the effects of overtaxation if the be not removed he makes arrangements with his sister to receive her in their house

turns on mesmerism and it is arranged that after dinner its power shall be tried odyle a new miss dudleigh you may begin bernard had really made himself very comfortable under the circumstances and cecilia sat down as soon as ha was settled his laughing face framed by the darkblue fringe she sat upon the scroll of the sofa and and her eyes  bat i thought yon were to hold my hand and to neve your arms tush miss dudleigh you dont half do rt she took not the least notice nor moved her lips her countenance grew fixed and breathless more colourtat than ever her lips seemed turned to stone her tells frozen even salome who was over at the fire wum hardly believe what she saw for the countenance warne a mere cast and though whole intelugencc intellect aad intention grew into grew out of though gazing eyes and sarona as he eat looking intensely into the eyes of rose was silent too not like a cast neither marble mr stone nor steel the mask of ice behind whose cold transparence his loveliest smile was wont to play his warmest glance to intercept itself had melted the fires of the wain that made his eyes coruscant that had tnd their very darkness into light dwelled only there and ripon the mysterious forehead whose whiteness was as the impenetrable ivory veined and polished but around the mouththat feature whose poetry barnard refused to interpretlay sweetness rall expanded af an open flower it breathed but its fragraace was aa faint as sweet just as the blossom however fresh waves wearily in the sun or scatters its sighs without a stir did that very sweetness strike unconsciously and the smile seem to droop the parted ups in languor but not repose all purity but passion sarona as it were fed upon her countenanceforgot his mission not she hors rose never clianged nor paled hor ups wore fixed her luminous eyes watched his as the moon looks down at us from its heaven  no tendril of uer hair trembled she gave no smile but beneath saronas finger her pulse grew restless and unequal t never strong it now quivered as the strong vibration of a smitten harpstring it throbbed to pain and then its throb became a thrill she no longer felt her heart beat the pulsation seemed to have gone down into her wrist and up into hor dazzled brain she knew exactly how long to bear it and that she could not bear it long she suddenly drew back her hand very quietly and softly and said in a hushed voice 44 that is quite enough i think i am to be of no moro use than the rest sarona gave a sharp start as from a celestial incubus roseturned quickly and was about to speak then as sharply he turned back upon bose and stared 44 just look at bernard everybody was looking even lord federne who had taken a fresh observation was transfixed in the opening of the door mossmoor in boywonder kept smiling up at salome she could not smile she was too absorbed for bernard outstretched upon the sofa had sunk lower and lower until he lay as if in bed one arm was thrown over his forehead and the rosy palm of that hand lay open like a shell the fingers were relaxed as an infants his face was suffused with the blush of slumber the warm blood so seldom gathered to the cheek except in childhood tinted far more than usual his somewhat eallid lips its frequent frown had melted from the foreead the mouth was just open enough to show the glimmer of the teeth above all most strange to say the eyes were closedclosed with no flutter ot the lidsno quiver of the eyelash from the feet crossed carelessly to the calm of the soft dark hair all wai at rest with bernard miss dudleigh had never moved since she first assumed her seat she stiu looked at him but not so rigidly and now in place of her stonelike paleness her cheeks were slightly flushed she felt sarona behind her for he advanced on tiptoe and without moving her head she whispered 44 is it not strange  i cannot understand it myself 44 it is most wonderful and yet does not surprise me you succeeded better than i did 44 oh that is only because i did not try to do so much i only wanted to make him sleep and i know i could i resolved i thought of nothing else 44 and yet you could do more i am persuaded try nowpray do you ought with such a power 44 not for the world indeed i do not know that i could and i would not on atrv account mr bernard would not like it i hope i shall be able to wake bim 44 do not yet said rose softly coming up close to cecilia 44 he looks so happy sarona gave ber a quick look which be snatched away again before she received it 44 he shall not be disturbed that state will not do bim any harm as it would if he became comatose and then moss fetched his father and federne brought mrs delapole nothing could convince this lady that it was any hut an everymght sleep sarona did not try to convince her neither did anybody else and yet through all the talking and laughing that followed bernard did not wake he slept for quite an hour in that entranced position never moving his lips nor closing his open hand not till sarona declared he must bo gone did cecilia set herself to wake him and strange to say it was not so easy she looked at him a long time before he even stirred and then t was impatiently pettishly  he rubbed his fingers into his eyes and opened them  staredrubbed them again  frowned darkly the spanish gloom passing as a cloud upon the rose of slumbersat up and looked halfcuriously halfcross at sarona and called at him  what the devil have you been doing to me    been doing to you  tou have been chained as fast as before you were born  asleep as the  sleeping beauty and what do you think of it all now rafe   i think with the wayward softness returning to the lipthe shimmering mischief to the eye i think the etymology of odyle is  choose   ralph bernard issues cards for a ball at rockedge his country seat cecilia the musical genius resolves unknown to any but sarona to send some music under a feigned name to this fete which shall fill the minds of till the listeners with astonishment but she ictuses to go to the ball sarona however goes thither to watch rose whom he madly and hopelessly loves while he sees her passion tor bernard hourly augmenting he too is struck by the beauty of cecilias music thb powxk ot music it may be supposedand is we believe by the musically uninitiated who fancy they have fathomed its remotest significancethat all music is exciting it is not so to the musical music is the only calmthe only restthe one idea of heaven which is the essence of things longed for the soul expanded overpowered with though presence of jehovah as he revealed himself in that ancient shrine where his shadow was lightthe tranced folds of sacred raiment about the sacerdotal feetwere not more still of more serenity in their repose than the musician fully gifted with the conception and the revelation of tone his only worship there is excitement until the highest ecstasy is attained the element of that enthusiasm which lifts the soul on wings to god but never afterwards but for music to be exciting it must bear relation to our humanitymust simulate our pains and pleasuresmust humour us by reminiscence yea even from the loftiest type of regular dramatic illustration to its lowest form a rhythmical association of sound with motion there is in fact no music so physically and merely exciting as music written for the dance but it does not follow that all dancesymphonies excite all persons bernards temperamentthe susceptible alt music for the dance excited saronasthe impressible seldom any but for once he was to be touched tonight standing by federne and resolving as a duty to aleud and listen outwardsneither to take notice nor to hear the beatings of his heart within himhe first became aware that he had never heard a measure so strange before his memory was first aroused as cecuias had been in writing by the dream in the deeps of ages gone and passed awaywhich bernards words in their youngest poetry had evolved as by another musicthe dreams of forms forgotten when giants were upon our islandearth and left thrir footsteps on our sandsthe dream ot midnight with white pillars meteorwreathed and no templeroof but the starry vaultthe dream of that awful march whose tramp shook garlands darkly scatteredthe streaming stores like snowreefsthe hands that moved upon dread harps like virginflame the pompous stirtie unknown ritethe secret words and then as lt had been with cecuia thc mythic marvel passed and another mood succeeded she had poured her whole passion into those notes the fabulous phantasm but beguiled as a veiling mist upon the mountain the chords broke pitilessly upon the heart when the brain had received its impression the pulses answered it was like the repinings of lost lovethe daint of wandering fancy sarona was obliged to go on istenmg having once given way impatiently ho longed for the strain to close it seemed remorselessly to extend it held him fast in its undulating spellit mocked with sweetness that soothed him not but that he felt through though toils of the harmony as she had felt it while she wove the sounds m solitude and it affected others too for bernard it was the witchcraft of a will far wider than his own its grave yet bounteous measure made him at once understand what he had felt and feel it more utterly and as in feeling most and meaning to express it he was most unlike sarona under strong exoitement so in this expressiob he became more like him in his medium moments bernard calls on sarona to announce his intended marriage with miss de berri and seeks to persuade herz to offer his hand to cecilia dudleigh after bernards marriage dr saronas parents come to stay with him and frequent and long are the conversations on temperaments between cecilia and the father of herz miss dudleigh goes to rockedge to stay with the bernards the semblance of pride and contempt which had hitherto lain between her and ralph is dispelled and they converse as friends one lovely summers evening they go out in a small boat on the seaalone too late he drew his oars in laid them down glistening like gathered reeds and stepped across the seat it was the only one between them and he sat down on it slowly close before her she drew the mantle from his hands and flung it round her  one end splashed down into the sea and she turned to reach it but bernard caught it first and wrapped it carefully and closely to her breast leaning towards her looking at her with his most serious expression  a gravity terrible upon such a face so long he looked he leaned that she raised her eyes and fixed them full upon him those glorious lights so calm if passionate and perfectly serene had scarcely touched his vision before his own eyes fell he looked asleep and surely must have slumbered for in another instant he had clasped her fingers in a clench which itself told agony beyond all words and pressed them to his lips she felt not summer breath nor blossom kisses but a tear that fell upon her cold hand cold as death then softly warily she folded both her arms  ok fear notdo not be afraid he whispered441 will ask nothing tell you nothing but i will say thisfor my own saxe not yours for of course you cannot suffer i always loved youwould have married youi mean have asked youbut for saronas sake she stretched her white hand with a grace as calm as her unalterable aspect and laid it on his tips one moment he was silent but the next on that strange face of bis there gleamed a spectral smile 4 but you love me again he said this time not whispered  4t i do not ask you to say yes but if you say not 4 no i shall believe it there was no reply and bernard took up the oars he seemed between each soft and soundless dip each silver splash to listen for her voice in fear the soft and sound less dip though silver splash were all the moonlight rocks drew nearer  they were past the cliff shone close and bridit the haven was at hand from the silence between that two companions it might have seemed as though thehaven were the dearest longed for as if uncongenial and unloving they dreaded not but rejoiced to part perhaps it was so for bernard as they approached the mcflringi darted from the boat as if to escape the sea then and for ever i the cholera rages in h sarona fews for roses life should she be attacked fljnd so sends her to sea in bernards yacht with orders that they touch at no english port until the destroying angel has taken flight the plague passes away and sarona

brought a pillow and bernards bead fell into it his feet were in her lap bose sjopd behind sarona but he drew her forwards with his hand put back then bernard opened his eyes upon the twin of his immortal his sister for eternity  i should like to go to sleep were the words of his int earthly voice cecilia felt that they were for her the old proud evening when her foul had mastered his came over her then sank her memory turned dark within her in his strength he had slept at her command  but the charin was spent in her dry eyes and brain and the will her power and her pride passed out of her in prayer no inward voice nor form of thought nor recollected music but a passion which swept eternity and fainted at jehovahs throne while sarona prayed that he might be spared at least till they could bear to lose himwhile rose lifted up her infant longings for his life and healththe one who loved him with a love more strong than death prayed only that he might die and die in sleep and he slept with breath that slept between lips just open till the first of though morning twilight when sarona who had never stirred looked up into cecilias eyes the phantom laid should disturb the soul no more the authors happiest effort is shown in describing the varied phases of nature there is a quaint peculiarityabout the style more observable even than in  charles auchester end which though occasionally pleasing becomes wearisome from its monotony and from a euapicion it engenders that it is not altogether unaffected music metaphysics and the influence of mesmeric power form the chief topics of the novel bnt there is frequently a germanic absence of clearness and precision in the descriptions of the feelings which actuate the unreal phantoms who figure in this

emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his

like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own

the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,unmarked_contra

B1152,['6788536'],  great short stories selections from the worlds greatest short stories by sherwin cody chicago  mcclurg tins volume  illustrative of the history of short story writing with critical and historical comments comes from the land where the magazine tale enjoys its greatest vogue and where the art and craft of the short story is practically taught in many schools and colleges including chiefly the university of chicago mr cody says   it is believed that a book like the present volume will prove useful alike to the student at home and the student in organised classes apparently therefore we are to regard it as a sort of textbook mr codys credentials for his task are that some years ago he put forth not so much wrote as put forth the first systematic treatise on the art of short storywriting and that he had an hours chat on the subject with mr w e henley in 1895  in recent years he remarks the art of the short story has developed into  something very definite indeed it has come to be amatter of conscious art almost as much as poetry or the drama or sculpture and laws have been discovered which the short story writer must obey though in novel writing this is not the caseas yet it is a pity that mr cody does not state these laws discovered since the publication of his previous book however we have to thank him for a definition of art namely  skill in displaying knowledge of human nature to advantage   also for the dictum that  both genius and art are utterly barren unless united and the greatness to which they give birth is usually measured by the harmony and completeness of their union this sentence we fancy should be read for the rhytlmi alone as walter pater read anthony woods diary his development of though definition of art just quoted leads to some pretty argufying which may be summarised thus   art is skill in displaying knowledge of human nature  the world grows in knowledge of human nature therefore a story of transcendent interest to ono age becomes the merest commonplace to the next and the world has  in part already outgrown virgil and homer and  in time the world will outgrow even shakespeare lt is a long while before we arrive at settlement of that vexed question what is the essential difference between a short story and a novel  but we do arrive at it on page 321   short story has but one character whose life either physical or mental is materially altered by the event while a novel represents the collision of several characters who alter each others lives this simple statement of course explains why kiplings the courting of dinah shadd is a novel and why george moores esther waters is a short story mr codys brilliant generalities run through the entire volume the last of them is this   all art really gains power and loses nothing by its limitations here is a list of short story writers and of short stories  cervantes  thc liberal lorn scott   wondering willie tole de vigny  serritilden it

contains nothing save firstclass stuff and sundry of its items are supreme of their kind it is not however mr codys list for mr codys list absolutely excludes all these twelve authors indeed with the exception of turgenev and tolstoi he makes no reference whatever to any of them in his critical and historical comments his choice results as follows   boccaccio  patient irimida arabian night aladdin irving   rip van winkle balzac   a passion in the dear rt dickens   1 childs dream ufa star   a christina carol in its lecture form thackeray  a princess tragedy from barry iji inion poe   the gold

tales are good but the balzac the two de maupassants and the poe are very badly selected from the works of those authors and tue last two have no business at all in any museum of the worlds greatest mr cody writes a brief expository note to each story and we are bound to admit that we have seldom perused literary criticism with such relish most of the decameron he says is unreadable today but prose has its rhythm as well as music and poetrypeace hath her victories as well as war j and in patient griselda we lind a long gentle undulation and a total absence of the staccatolike variations of the more modern shortstory and touching griselda herself he remarks there is probably not one woman in a hundred in modern times who if she were treated as griselda was would not invoke the courts yet there are some who will bear almost anything for the sake of peace aladdin brings him to the subject of romance high romance he bursts forth in ecstasy romance takes us out of ourselves and makes us free spirits of the hour it is one of the greatest blessings of life and the fact that the mere printed pages of a look can do this today shows the marvellous advancement of the average intelligence in modern times washington irving reminds him of prose style  that intangible something known as prose style  he remarks  was a contribution to english literature made by the essayist whose art rose with addison steele swift goldsmith and johnson reached its climax in lamb with special developments in macaulay and de quincey and has since sunk into desuetude we picture the shades of sir thomas brown and r l stevenson weeping together in the frozen zone of mr odys contemptuous neglect in the next story balzacs a passion in the desert he leaves prose style for the more elemental question of love although there is no woman in the story nevertheless we find an innocent and purified study of sexual passion and feminine caprice and character by reflection in the tiger which leaves the oftentimes bald vulgarity of the decameron far behind in its essential interest but dickens forces him back to prose modern writers have found means to produce all the effects of poetry in prose and have even proved that in its possibilities of expression prose is vastly superior to verse no doubt we shall soon be hearing of these writers from across the atlantic however dickens was lacking in the musical element but not thackeray  the first thing that strikes us in thackeray is the even musical flow of his sentences his words tripping along with never an ungraceful angle mr cody does not reconcile this with his pregnant remark that a princesss tragedy has  all the elements of the bloodandthunder dime novel but thackerays reserve as well as his art raises it into a drama awful and majestic as to poe  the gold bug    wears better than aladdin because it is so much more finely wrought poe was a purely intellectual being else how could he have written the fall of thc house of usher the raven the pit and the pendulum the maelstrom and other syllogisms he is also  the american inventor in estimating hawthorne mr cody himself shows the possibilities of prose as a medium of expression   poetry has always been apt in blending the noble and lofty in moral sentiment with the element of beauty and in hawthorne we find the ancient fable clothed most naturally and gracefully with the poets cloud of fancy and splendour of colour lastly mr barrie is a  realist  one of the devices of realism is dialect and mr morrisons story  is not a great one in itself but its cleverness

B8082,['6769224'],  twentyfive years reminiscences stories and memories by katharine tynan smith elder and co ios 6d net it is required in writers of reminiscences that they possess one of two qualifications either they must have worthy matter to set down or they must have a worthy manner of retailing happenings of small moment in the larger world of affairs with our new psychological scale of values there has come about a new perspective in the relative importance of events thus things that to a former generation seemed of mighty concern now bulk much less largely in our estimation while a detail that one of the older historians would have passed over entirely is now magnified and given its true significance and force so it frequently happens that for sheer enjoyment and for actual edification using that term in its widest sense a book full of memories of the most trivial kind will outshine weightier works both on account of the charm of its style and because of its wealth of significance when both matter and manner are of the highest order the result is likely to become a classic miss katharine tynan for she is not yet mrs hinkson in this volume has brought out of the treasures of memory things both great and small holding the balance pretty evenly between the trivial and the weighty and exhibiting all with much happiness of manner the whole work reminds one of a delightful oldfashioned garden in which one can wander at will and pluck many fragrant and beautiful blooms we turn to the greater names first and find a goodly list sir charles russell gladstone parnell cardinal manning the morrises the rossettis the meynells william sharp w b yeats and george russell ae miss tynan was introduced to gladstone at the house of sir charles russell but the encounter that made the most impression on that occasion was her meeting with parnell towards whom her attitude is throughout worshipful indeed whether one loves or hates that tragic yet fascinating figure one cannot but admire the wholehearted devotion of miss tynan to him and to his cause there is much concerning parnell and much of the writers association with the land league which will interest students of that particular history a very distinct and rather amusing picture of christina rossetti emerges on page 158 she entered the room wearing short serviceable skirts of an irongrey tweed and stout boots her dress did not at all go with her spiritual face and the heavilylidded wideapart eyes which one only finds in a highlygifted woman  i certainly believe she made the worst of herself perhaps as a species of mortification she even affected a short matteroffact way of speaking which took me somewhat aback at our first meeting she put one off sitting at her feet completely concerning william sharp the author says decisively  i may say here that i do not even yet believe that william sharp was fiona macleod but of that more in its proper place on that point we looked anxiously for further enlightenment but found none so we presume we must wait for one of the two further volumes of memories which miss tynan hopes to publish the few glimpses of wilde are not very flattering he seems never to have sparkled in her presence there is a great deal about w b yeats the earlier reminiscences partake very much of the nature of loving banter we imagine that the future biographer of the irish poet may some day be very grateful to miss tynan for her pages on his early development very interesting and curious it is to read of his entire absorption in poetry during youthhe lived breathed ate drank and slept poetry in another place she says i remember how the big dublin policemen used to eye him in those days as though uncertain whether to run him in or not but by and by they used to say shure tisnt mad he is nor yet drink taken tis the poethry thats disturbin his head and leave him alone in his inability to take care of himself and his utter forgetfulness of all but poetry he fulfils the traditional figure of a poet in his youth pretty completely further later reminiscences and a number of letters round off this part of miss tynans book equally interesting is the romantic personality of george russell to whose poetry the english public seems just awakening there is something almost olympian about his figure he tells what is perhaps one of the best stories in the volume he told me a story the other day of a friend of his who somewhere in the wilds of america became friends with an old indian he told him all the marvels of the old worldwireless telegraphy radium men flying in air speech kept long after the speaker is dead wonderful wonderful said the indian tell me more at last the reciter paused wearied the white man is very wonderful said the indian can he do this he stooped lifted a handful of dust and threw it in the air stretched himself upwards and thin delicate flames ascended from his hands and his feet and his hair his body shone in air he was a living jewel from head to foot then the glory faded there was only an old indian can the white man do that he asked it is required also of writers of reminiscences that they should display a certain degree of intimacy and should refrain as far as possible from the use of limelight here again miss tynan satisfies our requirements one does feel closing her book that one has really got to know her the person who emerges with perhaps greatest distinctness from her pages is her own father his strong points and weaknesses are alike set down with a loving pen he is very lovable very human with more than a touch of greatness we are grateful too for the accounts of one or two early friends who died untimely some of them showing considerable promise rose kavanagh frances wynne charles g fagan and jim alderson they are written of with an affection that it is good to see in these reticent days of lesser points we might mention a score if space allowed such as miss tynans theory that hair is an index to character or the naive confession of her early earnings and how she spent them in a way that would shock the unco guid or this single characteristic

exercises a gift noticeable in commanding spirits and parodied in mediocritiesthe gift of range he has the large interest in life detached from himself which has been the inspiration of all great as distinguished from little masters in fiction his ego cheerily travels and is impressed by life it is venturesome and industrious therefore it does not starve for lack of subject matter or feed upon itself there is a kind of genius in being a jew but mr zangwill discovered that the ghettos of the world were not enough for him if not the ghettos neither were the studios and so at last we find him penetrating political laboratories elijah is a prophet who preaches peace and economy in days which the younger generation vaguely imagine to have been extinguished under crinolines in the oliveseason elijah became a cabinet minister and nursed an elisha whose precocious taste in mantles awoke his patrons hopes of an appreciative heir to his own but england emerged both from the crinoline and the glasshouse of 1851 and learned to maffic as well as traffic then elijahs mantle went begging for elisha became an imperialist the tragiirony of the book is both general and personal the man who wished to see  the wen of india amputated  and  the spider spinning his web across the cannons mouth  lived to see his own daughterthe sensitive and idealistic allegrasuffer as the wife of a person who when head of a great department of the state fomented a war which beaconsfield himself might have disdained to excuse and this person was elishaa very respectable though incongruous elisha be it added car en apparence toujours il na rien sacrifie rien repudie ni son norn ni ses theories ni  sa surface de radical as m berard says of another english politician broser is elishas workaday name ana it is one that cleverly indicates the formidable tenacity the expansive selfcomplacence and innate coarseness of fibre which characterise him he is to england what the lyons of unleavened bread is to the united states by cunningly describing himself in his election address as  a humble follower of marshmont the elijah of mr zangwills story he involved the latter in  opinions more iconoclastic than he had ever professed yet it was marshmonts  translation  to the upper house which induced broser to propose to his daughter and his humility did not prevent him from remarking to the first mrs broser when she pleaded her inability to converse with political gentlemen  well talk about me that will always interest them but his second helpmeet knew the texture of his humility and when on the occasion of going to a musichall he observed i couldnt risk hanging about ive wired for a box a  suspicion that what he could not risk was being incognito awoke within her a feeling of absolute pity for his limitations on its political side the book is distinctly successful herein mafekingliness so to call itthough mr zangwill has nought to do with south africais viewed philosophically kingdoms progress en mass in legislation and in almanacs but the quality of the type varies hardly at all through the centuries otherwise we would all be beyondmen underneath  rule britannia  breaks the cry  feefofum a primitive cry for blood or treasure the clever journalist and political opportunist are shadowy artists in insincerity euphemism is so habitual with them that to break to them the painful news that black is not white after all is to incur a serious responsibility these are not mr zangwills words but they outline the train of thought which he suggests on the domestic side his novel leaves something to be desired an immaculate lady of the old school found fault with him in our hearing for the pertness of his early victorian children but it must be observed that mr zangwill does not attempt to reproduce the typical early victorian domestic life he makes however a gallant effort to create the aristocracy in their own homes his duchess drops her final s as the privileged may hear the duke of fife do on the platform at this day when allegra remarks that something is an  economic fallacy she exclaims good graciouswhat is the world comin to such a phrase in your mouthits like a cigar did they drop their rs in those days  it hardly matters what does matter is the importation of a type whose presence in a mundane narrative is as perplexing as that of melmoth the wanderer we refer to the philosophical raphael dominick in whose company the probabilities suffer severely it is a character such as a poetromanticist could invest with charm knowing him to be patently of the stuff of dreams he would have filled him with the mellifluously mysterious speech of dreams and he would have been lifeless but beautiful but the lips of this bodiless zangwill open but to emit a crashing discord of clevernesses in chapter xxl book il he avenges bis creation by making even broser momentarily impossible we also object to the manner in which the characters run against one another for the convenience of the plot this is certainly victorianboth early and late the feminine triumph of the book in our opinion is elijahs wife in youth like how many heroines of fiction  she had clasped a hunted hare to her bosom an action that had made elijah fall in love with her but the cherisher of hares was a nagger of the most impracticable kind  you sent him to the shambles she screams to her innocent husband when she heard that their headstrong son had been killed in the war but when elijah is being mobbed for little englandism she rediscovers the hare in him and cries  fight fair you hounds of hell it is probable that this woman will appear overdrawn to many but we can vouch for the fact that she is an ablystudied cymric type allegra the heroine is drawn more ambitiously she writes a letter to her middleage as mrs meynell did to her old age but she uttered no words comparable with these oh in some hour of thine my thoughts shall guide thee suddenly though time darkness silence hide thee this wind from thy lost country flits beside thee yet allegras letter which recurs as a motif in the book rings pathetically true the idealist she thought to marry turned out to be selfinterest under another name the idealist she did not marry was become a mere egoist and for refuge she had nothing better than a motherly representative of the feudalism she had once despised but we must pause mr zangwills book is as a whole worthy of his reputation lt is wise and witty serious and pathetic if it be not all life it is at least life and mr zangwill and the second of these twain is not bad company even when out of place  the mantle of elijah new novels by i zangwill heinemann that the mantle of elijah is worth reading and that it takes a little more than ordinary reading are selfevident facts matter and style combine to warn off the skipping or casual reader without exactly sympathising with mr zangwills points of view you are interested because he presents them and their interpreters in an arresting fashion there is sincerity in some of the intellectual and moral attitudes of his figures his style has matured a great deal since the days some fifteen years ago when  the premier and the painter was published but even then he showed himself to be as now of a different stamp from the facile and obvious novelists of the hour his new book contains cleverness of a very varied kind traits of fine imagination of high spiritual feeling keen observation of the actual and a singular sense of discrimination in character and dialogue jostle each other he has at command a fund of epigrammatic utterances but unlike the general run of such sayings they are not mere interpolations put in for their own sake they spring from the substance and sentiment of his work and may not be easily dissociated from them the principal interest is political it is also retrospective it is the period when crinolines berlin wool and bad ormolu were in vogue

action of a story especially in these days the mantle of elijah almost demands as much for the development of the intellectual and moral forces of the leading characters they require full play and they get it now and then one feels that they almost get too much of it that the analysis and presentation are almost too close too serried the treatment of the engelborne group in the last part is not altogether happy these people are rather copiously than powerfully drawn yet their influence on allegra the heroine is a reason for their being at the age of sixteen allegra is a convinced but not unattractive idealist this is the most entertaining and interesting part of her career when we meet her again in book il she is a married and disenchanted woman of forty or thereabouts her illassorted marriage with broser a radical politician and her fathers secretary never appears wholly credible he is a strongly marked individual one of the best portraits or pictures in this gallery the mantle of the radical statesman an aristocrat by birth drops at length on the brawny shoulders of broser his follower only too ready to catch it he is the most robust and selfseeking of all the sons of the people yet depicted in fiction one feels the jarring aggressiveness of the man and the coarse germs of good and evil in his temperament he is strangely real the contrast between him and his amiable highsouled leader and the family is an excellent study the list of the peoples grievances and their remedies drawn up by broser and those mr zangwill calls  the boon companions of his political intoxication  is good satire so are his entrance into the house and his subsequent change of front then there is a visionary and much less strongly conceived being an israelite who rhapsodises on a

pendent to  american wives and english husbands the scene of the shorter story is laid in new york and mostly among easterners whom we gather mrs atherton does not like and whose vices and weaknesses she presents let us hope slanderously she speaks for the american of the south and the west and is almost as sensitive over the european lumping of the new world racial differences as a scot when he is looked on as a mere englishman the passages in the history of miss augusta forbes heiress to millions are presented to show how coldblooded businesslike and determined a young new york maiden can be in her pursuit of social position in englahd true the heiresss mother a southerner is nearly as keen in the matter but she is otherwise an agreeable and very affectionate person the longer book is a lovestory the villainess is an american to be sure raised in chicago but though she is powerful enough to bring on the catastrophe she cannot divert our attention from the heroine lee the western beauty and not too much of an heiress for lee let us be grateful since she means a much pleasanter atmosphere than can be breathed in any other of the books of this talented writer not too much of an heiress we have said but mrs athertons heroines demand a thick luxury for their graces and forces to develop in patience sparhawk and lee both know hardship in their childhood but that poverty can mean anything but starvation of the mind the soul the senses never seems to occur to this observer of life and lee is rescued from it at the age of eleven that her conquest of the highest circles may

clumsy title strikes a keynote this story like the last deals with the theory or practice of angloamerican intermarriage mrs atherton would protest one gathers against the blunt judgement which lumps all american wives into a single unflattering category after all she points out to us there is a world of difference between say your raw western heiress and the southern woman of good californian family with a century or two of delicate breeding behind her the former does not beseem a coronet the latter may meet an english noble with a pride of race equal to his own such a one is lee tarlton

reviewer but when to beauty she adds brains courage and a high sense of honour we feel that lord maundrell is a lucky man he too is well drawn though with a touch of transatlantic scorn for the impressive  set englishman the plot is not much the interest centres in lees development as a calif orman girl and an english bride over against her is set her husbands stepmother also an american of rank extraction who brings lord barnstaples fortune and good name to ruin he learns at last that the expenses of maundrell abbey are being paid out of her lovers purse and a strong scene between him and the truehearted lee follows  he was sitting at his desk writing and as he lifted his hand at her abrupt entrance and laid it on an object beside his papers she received no shock of surprise she went forward and lifted his hand from the revolver  must you p she asked  of course i must do you think i could live with myself another day  perhaps no one need ever know  everybody in england will

you must stay here until i am ready to let you go 11 want to stay with you  thank you sit down he handed her a chair and returned to his writing lord barnstable laid down his pen and sealed his letters he stood up and held out his hand  goodbye he said they shook hands closely and in silence then she went out and he closed the door behind her she stood still waiting for the signal she could not carry the news of his death to his son until he was gone beyond the shadow of a doubt it was so long coming that she wondered if his courage had failed him or if he were praying before the picture of his wife it came at last lord barnstable dies but the atmosphere remains electric we somehow expect that lord maundrell will follow in his fathers footsteps and that lee will fall into the hands of

B2177,['9045688'],  nadir shah by sir mortimer durand with illustrations constable  co sir mortimer durand has fallen between the proverbial two stools he has written a biographical romance which is at once too romantic to be a real biography and too biographical to be a true romance he confesses that he adopted this form  after some doubt because he found that  the existing accounts of nadir shah whether persian or european are hardly the material from which exact history could now be written no doubt  exact history is rarely to be deduced from eighteenthcentury persian or any other chronicles but a tolerably accurate biography of the great turkman conqueror might have been compiled which would at least have proved a useful contribution to history and would have been valued by students and even by orientalists to whom sir mortimer durands persian scholarship is known to such the present work without a single reference to original authorities is of little interest beyond showing the conception of nadir shahs character and career which an able man formerly resident in teheran and acquainted with the persian sources has formed even this has too much of the obvious in it and offers scarcely any originality we accept unreservedly sir mortimer durands assurance that his story is not  inconsistent with known facts and that he has done his  best throughout to treat known facts with proper respect  but since  this book does not pretend to be a history there appears to be no obligation to treat it with proper respect from the historical or biographical point of view taken merely as a romance founded upon history with the design of giving  more life and colour  to the story of nadirs career the work suffers from overlearning most of the romances in which the manners and modes of thought of the east and its  local colour  are sought to be imparted have been failures there are very few who possess mr marmaduke pickthalls happy gift and though sir mortimer knows persian and has been fairly intimate with upperclass persians we doubt if he knows the people as for example prof brown knew them when he lived amongst them or if he can think in persian as mr pickthall thinks in arabic the result in the present case is that the reader who is probably unfamiliar with persian ways is annoyed by frequently occurring words which he cannot understand and requires a glossary which is not supplied  the romance is burdened with archaeology and the action hampered by an attempt at historical accuracy which nevertheless leaves the reader unconvinced those who are already interested in nadir shah will read this romance of his life with appreciation but not because it is romance those who know nothing about him or his time will be perpetually puzzled and irritated it is not the business of romance to teach history and the mistake here made is not so much the founding of the romance upon an historical basis as the choking of the romance by too elaborate an historical setting the long accounts for example of nadirs campaigns have nothing to do with romance and are merely digressions perfectly justifiable and indeed necessary in a biography but out of place here the subject we admit lends itself to treatment as a novel or as a drama the rise of the turkman robber chief from obscure poverty to w ide empirewonderful though not unparalleled in the east the land of opportunities  the spoiling influence of success and the growth of arrogant ruthlessness under the sun of too favouring fortune the alienation of the affections of the people and finally the army by frequent acts of irresponsible injustice and barbarity culminating in the blinding of his son and the inevitable downward path pointed out by offended nemesis ending in the longforeseen assassinationhere are the makings of a tragedy sir mortimer durand has realised this clearly enough and has drawn the character of nadir with insight  but he is always taking our attention off the main subjectan interesting though not very unusual psychological studyto carry us away to campaigns and marches in places with outlandish names outlandish at least to the majority of readers which could have been sufficiently indicated by a few allusions without interrupting the development of the story the real romantic interest centres not in nadir but in the beautiful tender rajput girl whom he made his bride in india when he was crushing the mogul emperor here sir mortimer is fairly in the realm of romance for whatever truth there may be in nadirs marriage to an indian wife the story of her relations with the conqueror could never have been divulged but the introduction of sitara and her devotion gives the book its chief merit as a romance and also a real charm the indian girl is admirably drawndrawn with knowledge as well as sympathy the inevitable contralto to sitaras soprano the shirazi wife a particularly hateful characterrests on surer historical foundations for sir mortimer had traditions of her related to him by a persian minister who had them from one who had known her second husband residence in persia does not tend to exalted opinions of the people and we do not advise persians of either sex to apply to sir mortimer durand for j a character we cannot recommend the book to novelreaders pur sang they will find it tedious in spite of

B7337,['3237356'],  little novels by arthur schnitzler 7s 6d constable not only little novels but too often little themes and little women schnitzler is always skilful often subtle but he is preoccupied with that in human nature which is least admirable and he treats of moods and desires which not only bring humanity into contempt but seem to show that he sees in it little which is not contemptible except when the rarer emotion of pity is aroused this deep distrust of human nature is shown at its height in the last story  the death of a bachelor a maupassant subject handled with a weariness a disillusioned boredom of which maupassant is never guilty the mood of pity is predominant in  the greek dancing girl and the best and latest story in the collection  the murderer here the schnitzler of twenty years ago shows the power and the humanity of his later postwar work and the final scene between alfred and the baron his mistresss champion has real poignancy and dignity we must commend the enterprise of the publishers in introducing more of this rather neglected authors work to an english public,unmarked_contra

dress he was entirely unique he wore invariably a short red shelljcket thrown open with a white waistcoat and short but large white trowsers cotton stockings and shoes on his head a cockedhat with an upright red and white feather the whole surmounted by a green silk umbrella held painfully aloft to clear the feather to this may be added a shirtcollar which acted almost as a pair of blinkers on either side in person lie was ample but somewhat shapeless andl he had a vast oblong face which neither laughed nor showed any bign of animation whatever the history of the majors cockedhat wvas as follows strolling into an auctioi at bombay he was rather taken with the reasonable price of a cockedhat which the flippant auctioneer was recommending with all his ingenuity going for six rupeesmust be sold to pity the creditors no advance upon six shall we say siccas in an evil hour the major bid for the hat left his address and returned to his quarters the happy possessor of a  bargain seated

understood the predicament in which lie wras placed in vain lie appealed to the auctioneerto the company present it was too good a joke and they would have given it against him uimder almost any circumstances major holder was a rigid economist lie had also a mind which admitted but one idea at a time and indeed not very often that he was possessed of six dozen of cocked hats and they must be worn out being mostly in command of his own regiment he had unlimited clhoice as to his own head dress so he comnenced the task at once from thenceforth all other hats or caps were to him nmatters of history at the economnical rate of two hats a year lie might safely calculate upon laing much advanced in life before the case was exhausted true there were drawbacks lie was much consulted about auctions by his friends i many inquiries made of him on that point bills of auctions and especially anything relating to cocked hats forwarded to him by the kind attention of acquaintance and a question very currently put to him 16l the ensigns was  tom how are you off for hats  flhe interest generally taken in thine majors hats was far from dyin even after the lapse of years the less likely

jacks married before another hats gone when this individual arrived at the cape he was understood to be in his fifteenth hat but there occurred some confusion in the majors chronology for it was understood that owing to the practical jokes played there no less than three hats were expended during the short month of his stay to correct this he adopted the plan of sitting upon his hat at dinner

turned the tide of battle and saved the broken party whose cause she espoused from a shameful defeat it had been routed and panic stricken the natives regardless of the cries of their leaders were flying in wild confusion for their lives maiera who was on board a vessel in the harbour seeing how affairs went sprang into the sea with a musket in lher hand and swimming ashore intercepted the retreating fugitives she reproached them in the bitterest and most sarcastic terms and called out that  the barren mountains should be the future portion of the land for those that fled and their food should be grass and the roots of the feiis stung by her reproaches they rallied and turned upln their pursuers with such spirit and fury that they speedily converted a disorderly retreat into a victorious pursuit only very recently having learned that some of her chiefs had been tampered with and were betraying symptoms of favouring the french ariipae immediately quitted raiatea in a boat seized them and carried them back with her as prisoners had pomare acted as promptly towards her rebel chiefs probably many of her difficulties would have been spared her the protectorate flag was hoisted at hiaiatea in a singularly covert manner one morning so early that no one was stirring a boat from the steamer then lying at anchor at uturoa quietly landed a party on a little mole or jetty opposite the missionarys residence and this party happily for them raised the flag without notice or observationm and effected their retreat to the vessel in the same unostentatious way the natives became first aware of the flying of this smybol of protection thus royally andi rociously vouchsafed to them by hearing it saluted fiom the guns of the steamer they rushed out of their houses at the noise of the firing and saw with rage and indignation the cause of it so treacherously introduced without a moments hesitation they tore it down and rent it into shreds and one native vrappinu parts round his head and body ran frantically about the beach yelling shouts of scorn and defiance warned by this i suppose they refrained from attempting to land the flag at borabora but it was formally hoisted and saluted on board the steamer mu she lay in the harbour i this is the scene of a wreck the wreck of the mozart was one commingled mass the tents erected by her people were in good preservation and bore evidence of subsequent occupation by the crew of the maria helena provisions and water had been saved in abundance and about six tonnes of water still remained in good condition but the oil and bone ac was overwhelmed in one inextricable mass of wreck sand and coral fragments and the beach for miles was strewed with empty casks broken spars and other fragments of the unfortunate craft there is no water to be obtained upon the island and it must have proved a most merciful dispensation to the maria helena people that so much had been saved from the mozart as judging from appearances i do not think a drop of rain has fallen upon the island since the disastrous events took place but sailors are proverbially a lighthearted race little given to reflection and having no immediate fear of perishing from hunger or thirst the wrecked crew of the nlaria helena converted their misfortunes into a scene of mirth a painted sign announced the encampment to be mozart

like his lastfine book the nigger of the narcissus march straight on where they are tragic the tragedy was inevitable the artist selects and tells that selection is his concern and his alone things horrid and inexplicable may happen and it is not his affair to suggest why heaven remains sealed and unanswering any more than it is his business to explain why illusions are often better aids to living than the naked truth he tells and the critics business is with the sincerity and method of presentment not with the choice of subject we rise from the reading of these tales of unrest strengthened not depressed for the work is sincere and it deals with realities mr conrad is a writers writer he is for those who joy in a good sentence a deft characterisation or the way the knots of an exposition are tied but these tales must not be taken with a hop skip and a jump those who want brisk dialogue and breathless action must go elsewhere you must assimilate his background if you would grasp the significance of the figures that dot his middle distance mr conrad is a painter in landscape who could have worked entirely in genre but he chose the other like the great landscape artists he brings equal facility to a sunset or to a man working in a field and the man is real part of the harmony not a lay figure dumped down as a sop to those who clamour for  human interest for example let us take a passage from the story called  the lagoon  nothing moved on the river but the eight paddles that rose flashing regularly dipped together with a single splash while the steersman swept right and left with a periodic and sudden flourish of his blade describing a glinting semicircle above his head the churnedup water frothed alongside with a confused murmur and the white mans canoe advancing upstream in the shortlived disturbance of its own making seemed to enter the portals of a land from which the very memory of motion had for ever departed    the men poled in the shading water the creek broadened opening out into a wide sweep of a stagnant lagoon the forests receded from the marshy bank leaving a level strip of bright green reedy grass to frame the reflected blueness of the sky a fleecy pink cloud drifted high above trailing the delicate colouring of its image under the floating leaves and the silvery blossoms of the lotus a little house perched on high piles appeared black in the distance   the steersman pointing with his paddle said  arsat is there i see his canoe fast between the piles  three of the stories treat of life in the eastern archipelago where green islets scattered through the calm of noonday lie upon the level of a polished sea like a handful of emeralds on a buckler of steel of these  karabi a memory  is the longest and the most ambitious it is the story of a noble and masterful malay and how he was cured by a young englishman of a terrible illusion on the principle that like things are cured by like the ruse is quite successful  he left us and seemed straightway to step into the glorious splendour of his stage to wrap himself in the illusion of unavoidable success here is a picture of a dutch trader it is karain who is speaking he traded and planted he despised our joys our thoughts and our sorrows his face was red his hair like flame and his eyes pale like a river mist he moved heavily and spoke with a deep voice he laughed aloud like a fool and knew no courtesy in his speech he was a big scornful man who looked into womens faces and put his hand on the shoulders of free men as though he had been a nobleborn chief the story called the idiots brings us nearer hometo france it is a terrible little tale about a peasant proud of himself proud of his wife proud of the bit of land he owned proud of the thought that sons will be born to him who will grow up by his side and carry on his name when he is laid away children are born to himbut one and all are idiots the end is tiie murder of the husband and the suicide of the wife that is how things happened in this unfortunate family and the world went on much the same strangers even became used to the idiot children shouting from the hedgerows  there are unfortunate people on the earth says the mother of the murderess and suicide i had only one child only one and they wont bury her in consecrated ground  it is very sad replies the marquis of chavanes  you have all my sympathy i shall speak to the curd    good day madame here is a final taste of mr conrads quality   that child like the other two never smiled never stretched its hands to her never spoke never had a glance of recognition for her in its big black eyes which could only stare fixedly at any glitter but failed hopelessly to follow the brilliance of a sunray slipping slowly along the floor when the men were at work she spent long days between her three idiot children and the childish grandfather who sat grim angular and immovable with his feet near the warm ashes of the fire the feeble old fellow seemed to suspect that there was something wrong with his grandsons only once moved either by affection or by the sense of proprieties he attempted to nurse the youngest he took the boy up from the floor dicked his tongue at him and essayed a shaky gallop of his bony knees then he looked closely with his misty eyes at the childs face and deposited him down gently on the floor again and he sat his lean shanks crossed nodding at the steam escaping from the cookingpot with a gaze senile and worried well observed is it not  one of the tales in this volume the return treats a modern subject such a subject as has obsessed mr marriot watson more than once to this study of a conjugal fatality mr conrad brings the same vivid observation the same restraint the same artful choice of words and the same sincerity of expression he has written some halfdozen volumes but it is by the nigger of the narcissus and these tales of unrest that he becomes a writer to be reckoned with his full achievement we believe is still in the making  tales of hearsayt in most of conrads stories the theme turns upon a point of honour the crews and even more the officers of sailingships have before their eyes and under their feet a tangible responsibility a responsibility that must be served both by physical and by moral courage not the most conical or feckless can make light of such a charge it has a final and compelling gravity mishandled or neglected a ship is liable to sink with all hands there is nothing funny about it no gleam of humour or alleviating circumstance such as attends the majority of human ills from slipping on a piece of orange peel to going bankrupt no outlet for the native buoyancy of the spirit that in the face of disaster wants to cry no matter and begin over again a shipwreck matters as much as anything  thomas alva edison by francis arthur jones sos 6d hodder  stoughton t  tales of hearsay by joseph conrad 7s 6d fisher unwin can whether ashore or afloat the characters in conrad regard life or life that is worth living as something that through their own fault may at any moment sink under them to their navigating eyes a scruple of conscience a nice point of behaviour is as concrete an obstacle as a rock if they strike it they are doomed they are not baffled to fight better they donot rise on steppingstones of their dead selves to higher things they have no comfortable philosophy in which to bury or justify their mistakes on the contrary they lose their selfrespect their confidence in their ability to behave properly and pine away like the outcast of the islands like the  capataz de cargadores in a kind of spiritual death they are heroic figures patterns of more than roman virtue and we watch with admiration and awe and such sympathy as the weakness of our nature entitles us to give their efforts to live up to their ideals we cannot dismiss their preoccupations as morbid the unrest of a will disabled by brooding they are capable of action though they shrink from it realising its irrelevance its essential onesidedness its antipathy to the perfection for which they strive but they do not therefore excuse themselves from action they know that it will commit them and misrepresent them and they are prepared to take the consequences it was in this spirit that razumov betrayed the refugee who sought his protection in this spirit that the mild humane verloc arranged for his wifes idiot brother to blow up the greenwich observatory and himself and in the present volume the sea captain who sends the fogbound neutral ship to meet destruction on the rocks has the same dilemma to face always humanity and reason are sacrificed to principle we are not told what happened to the sea captain but verloc was murdered and razumov punished by an outrage more horrible than almost anything in fiction it is characteristic of conrads point of view this intense antagonism between reason and action directly an action ceases to be spontaneous and instinctive it is poisoned at its source it becomes a separate malignant power with a life and will of its own and to meddle with it entails a radical change in ones condition like taking an anaesthetic or contracting a disease there is no connecting link no visible fuse even between the passages of contemplation and selfexamination in  victory for example and the welter of meaningless destruction in which it ends we are not to suppose that the  enchanted  heyst one of the most delightful of conrads characters by giving up his life to a parcel of rogues made late amends for the failure of his coal mine action in conrads view seems not a question of one mans life for anothers it is not so reasonable as that still less though it has the appeal of melodrama is it of melodramatic intention and least of all perhaps is it the normal and inevitable expression of passions that have become too strong to be restrained it is like an exhibition of the forces of nature an eruption or an earthquake how can a hundred nuances and qualifications of motive be summed up in a pistol shot or a blow  when in the first and best of the  tales of hearsay the tenderhearted russian lieutenant puts his old friend and benefactor out of his misery in accordance with his wish what is the result  the lieutenant resigns his commission and retires to his estates with a stain on his name this is a tvpically conradian issue to an honourable action an action undertaken in anguish to promote the dignity and decency of life in the last story which turns out unexpectedly so grim is the disguise under which its humour walks to be a joke the mountain of action once more labours and brings forth a legitimate offspring and not a monstrosity voluntarily the mate falls headfirst down the companionwas and by this ruse preserves the secret of his white hair a great risk one would think to achieve a small result but the result is achieved had conrad really been in earnest over this story one suspects that the mate would have been killed it is fruitless to read any author of the first rank without granting his postulates conrad assumes in all his tragic characters a tenacity of purpose a devotion to an idea an inelasticity an obstinacy almostthat are rarely met with one imagines in life a rogue in shakespeare when asked what he will do with himself now that he has been exposed boldly replies  simply the thing i am will make me live it is just that thing that makes conrads characters die or rather the absence of that vital unmoral principle they  cannot live after that the are fallen sometimes one is tempted to feel that many of conrads situa tions would be relieved or e v e n prevented if the characters w o u 1 d avail themselves of those outlets and escapes that life allows and indeed often imposes would captain mchirr have attained or at any rate kept his position if an obstinate disbelief in the barometer had always been a feature of his seamanship might not lord jim have acted upon the fright he got in the harbour as a youth and abandoned a calling for which he was temperamentally unfitted  these are vain frivolous ques tions the whole secret of conrads emotional power depends of course upon the capacity of his characters to take things to heart  tales of hearsay  is full of beautiful passages none perhaps more beautifiul than this  outside the large ingle window the crepuscular light was dying out slowly in a great square gleam vithout colour framed rigidly in the gathering shades of the room  it was a long room the irresistible tide of the night ran into the most distant part of it where the whispering of a mans voice passionately interrupted and passionately renewed seemed to plead against the answering murmurs of infinite sadness it is with such sadness that one takes leave of this perhaps the last book of an author who was innotvator

B7236,['9415989'],  peg woffington  a novel by charles reade  bentley this is a very clever epigrammatic hook and carries on its every page the observation of a shrewd thinker who has succeeded in making himself well acquainted with the spirit and features of stage life in london between 1740 and 1760 the story is all but identical with the play called  masks and faces recently produced at the haymarket theatre and known in and out of dramatic circles as the joint production of mr tom taylor and mr charles reade we spoke highly of the play on its appearanceand must speak highly now of the novel but really we are at a loss to know to whom and in what proportion this praise properly belongs mr reade whose name alone appears on the titlepage of the novel speaks nevertheless of mr tom taylor as his friend and coadjutor to whom the reader owes much of the best matter in the tale and pays him with a dedication this seams to us something very like dedicating a mabs work to himself or the terms of the dedication may imply an excess of generosity on the part of mr reade mr taylor may have had a right hand or only an entire finger ht what garrick was pleased to call the  concoction of the piece and the twin stars may hereafter quarrel about the drama and the novel aa golman and garrick quarrelled about their joint shares in  the clandestine marriage leaving them to adjust their rival claims as they can we must turn to the book itself there has been of late  an amiable weakness in favour of one or two once wellknown actresses mr cunningham in a biography designed perhaps to show his knowledge of the intrigues of the time of charles the second gave an undue importance to nell gwyn and mr read and mr taylor have certainly given more than her fair amount of consequence to peg woffington not much is known of either actressand peg appears to us to have been an inferior kind of nelly margaret woffington was an irish girl of great beauty who came from the dublin stage and made her first appearance on the london boards in 1740the year before garrick appeared at goodman8 fields she  took  at oncebut as is the case with the majority of actors and actresses there was a diversity of feeling about her walpole speaks of her to mann in 1741 as a had actress who was much in vogue adding  but she has life he would seem to have disliked her from the first but then he admired kitty clive for his friend general conway writes to him in 1740 so you cannot bear mrs woffington  yet all the town is in love with her to say the truth i am glad to findsomebody to keep me in countenance for i think she is an impudent irishfaced girl she was in short what tate wilkinson called her a wanton arch wagadmirably adapted for certain characters which she both looked and acted in a way that drew down thunders of approbation she died unmarried in the year 17g0 wore she was forty and was buried in teddington church on the banks of the thameswhere her grave is marked by a modest tablet such was peg woffingtons story  and if the wader would see what she was like in face let him refer to fabers engraving of her as mrs ford  to van bleeks engraving of her as phoebe in a hatand better still to mardells fine mezzotint of her with flowers in her hand if from paper he is unable to conjure up the colour and complexion of the once wellknown mrs woffington let him go to bowood and there he will see what the woffington was like and how fine a portraitpainter hogarth could be when his heart was with his subject we remember the bowood picture well there pee isa sort of halflengthin pink and blue with a yellow hat trimmed with lace a cap beneath her hat tied under her chin and such a face the picture is worthy of rembrandt if rembrandt could have condescended even for once to place female beauty upon canvas the characters in this storyas in the play are peg woffington herselfa mr vane a shropshire squire having a young and lovely wife yet in love with mrs woffingtona sir charles pomander a second edition of lord foppingtona poor poetpainter namedtriplet and his wifecolley cibbermr quinand a few others the scene is laid at a time  when ladies were saying things which the men of this generation only thinkand the story turns on a liaison which calls up the better part of mrs wofflngtons nature the heroine is thus described in the bookwe group the several descriptions together  mrs woffington as an actress justified a portion of this enthusiasm she was one of the truest artists of her day a fine lady in her hands was a lady with the genteel affectation of a gentlewoman not a harlots affectation which is simply and without exaggeration what the stage commonly gives us for a fine lady an old woman in her hands was a thorough woman thoroughly old not a cackling young person of epicene gender she played sir harry wilduir like a man which is how he ought to be played or which is better still not at all so that garrick acknowledged her as a male rival and abandoned the part he no longer monopolized   she was dressed in a rich silk gown pearl white with flowers and sprigs embroidered her beautiful white neck and arms were bare she was sweeping up the room with the epilogue in her hand learning it off by heart at the other end of the room she turned and now she shone full upon him it certainly was a dazzling creature she had a head of beautiful form perched like a bird upon a throat massive yet shapely and smooth as a column of alabaster a symmetrical brow black eyes full of fire and tenderness a delicious mouth with a hundred varying expressions and that marvellous faculty of giving beauty alike to love or scorn a sneer or a smile but she had one feature more remarkable than all her eyebrowsthe actors featurethey were jet black strongly marked and in repose were arched like a rainbow but it was their extraordinary flexibility which made other faces upon the stage look sleepy beside margaret woffingtons in person she was considerably above the middle height and so finely formed that one could not determine the exact character of her figure at one time it seemed all stateliness at another time elegance personified and flowing voluptuousness nt another she was juno psyche hebe by turns and for aught we know at will   her bright skin contrasted with her powdered periwig became dazzling she used little rouge but thit little made her eyes two balls of black lightning from her high instep to her polished forehead all was symmetry her leg would have been a sculptors glory and the curve from her waist to her knee was hogarths line itself she stood like mercury new lighted on a heavenkissing hill she placed her foot upon the ground as she might put a hand upon her lovers shoulder   this lady was subject to two unpleasant companions sorrow and bitterness about twice aweek she would cry for two hours and after this class of fit she generally went abroad and made a round of certain poor or siek proteyes she had and returned smiling and cheerful sir charles pomander is thus described and the description is a good specimen of the smart writing throughout  this sir charles pomander was a gentleman of vice pleasure he called it mr vane had made his acquaintance two years ago in shropshire sir charles who husbanded everything except his soul had turned himself out to grass for a month his object was by roast mutton bread with some little flour in it air water temperance chastity and peace to be enabled to take a deeper plunge into impurities of food and morals here is a sample of our authors skill in bringing a dead actressmrs oldfieldinto life  i saw a brigadiergeneral cry like a child at her indiana i have seen her crying with pain herself at the wing for she was always a great sufferer i have seen her then spring upon the stage as lady townley and in a moment sorrow brightened into joy the air seemed to fill with singing birds that chirped the pleasures of fashion love and youth in notes sparkling like diamonds and stars and prisms she was above criticism out of its scope as is the blue sky men went not to judge her they drank her and gazed at her and were warmed at her and refreshed by her the fops were awed into silence and with their humbler betters thanked heaven for her if they thanked it for anything colley cibber is thus described this cibber was the only actor since shakespeares time who had both acted and written well popes personal resentment misleads the reader of english poetry as to cibbers real place among the wits of the day the mans talent was dramatic not didactic or epic or pastoral pope was not so deep in the drama as in other matters and cibber was one of its luminaries he wrote some of the best comedies of thc day isle also succeeded where dryden for lack of true dramatic taste failed he tampered successfully with shakespeare colley cibbers version of richard the third is impudent and slightly larcenic but it is marvellously effective it has stood a century and probably will stand for ever and the most admired passages in what literary humbugs who pretend they know shakespeare by the closet not the stage accept as shakespeares  richard are cibbers mr cibber was now in private life a mild edition of his own lord foppington he had none of the snobfop as represented on our conventional stage nobody ever had and lived he was in tolerably good taste but he went ever goldlaced highlypowdered scented and diamonded dispensing graceful bows praises of whoever had the good luck to be dead and satire of all who were here to enjoy it mr vane to whom the drama had now become the golden branch of letters looked with some awe on this veteran for he had seen many woffingtons he fell soon upon the subject nearest his heart he asked mr cibber what he thought of mrs woffington the old gentleman thought well of the young ladys talent especially her comedy in tragedy said he she imitates mdlle dumesnil of the theatre francais and confounds the stage rhetorician with the actress the next question was not so fortunate  did you ever see so great and true an actress upon the wholemr cibber opened his eyes a slight flush came into his washleather face and he replied   i have not only seen many equal many superior to her but i have seen some halfdozen who would have eaten her up and spit her out again and not known they had done anything out of the way  the stiff compliments of the time are not illrepresented in the following passage which is put into the mouth of cibber  when i was young two giantesses fought for empire upon this very stage where now dwarfs crack and bounce like parched peas they played roxana and statira in the rival queens rival queenb of ait themselves they put out all their strength in the middle of the last act the town gave judgement ia favour of statira what did roxana did she spill grease on statiras robe as peg woffington would j or btab her as i believe kitty here capable of doing  no statira was never so tenderly killed as that night she owned this to me roxana bade the theatre farewell that night and wrote to statira thusi give you word for word madamthe beat judge we have has decided in your favour i shall never play second on a stage where i have been first so long but i shall often be a spectator and methinks none will appreciate your talent more than i who have felt its weight my wardrobe one of the best in europe is of no use to me if you will honour me by selecting a few of my dresses you will gratify me and i shall fancy i see myself upon the stage to greater advantage than beforeand what did statin answer sir said mr vane eagerlyshe answered thus madam the town has often been wrong and may have been so last night in supposing that i vied successfully with your merit but thus much is certainand here madam i am the best judgethat off the stage you have just conquered me i shall wear with pride any dress you have honoured and shall feel inspired to great exertions by your presence among our spectators unless indeed the sense of your magnanimity and the recollection of your talent should damp me by the dread of losing any portion ofyour good opinion  whatacouple of stiff old things said mrs clive here is vanes description of mrs woffington  he drew pomander aside  what a simplicity there is in mrs woffington said vane the rest male and female are all so affected she is so fresh and natural they are all hothouse plants she is a cowslip with the may dew on it what you take for simplicity is her refined art replied sir charles no said vane  i never saw a more innocent creature pomander laughed in his face this laugh disconcerted him more than words he spoke no morehe sat pensive he was sorry he had come to this place where everybody knew his goddess yet nobody admired nobody loved and alas nobody respected her he was roused from his reverie by a noise the noise was caused by cibber felling on garrick whom pomander had maliciously quoted against all the tragedians of colley cibbers day  i tell you cried the veteran that this garrick has banished dignity from the stage and given us in exchange what you and he take for fire but it is smoke and vapour his manner is little like his person it is all fuss nnd bustle this is his idea of a tragic scene a littte fellow comes bustling in goes bustling about and runs bustling out here mr cibber left the room to give greater effect to his description but presently returned in a mighty pother saying  give me another horse well wheres the horse dont you see im waiting for him bind up my wounds look sharp now with these wounds have mercy heaven but be quick about it for the pit cant wait for heaven bustle bustle bustle the old dog was so irresistibly funny that the whole company were obliged to laugh a good scene in the novel as it was in the is that wherein vanes wife arrives in condon and is accidentally present when mrs woffington and some other of the dramatis persona are guests at her husbands house here is a portion of it  i beg your pardon ladies and gentlemen i hope you will forgive me it is six months since i saw him jo you understandi warrant me you did not look form so soon ladies some of us did not look for you at all madam aid mrs woffington what ernest did not tell you he expected meno he told us this banquet was in honour of a ladys first visit to his house but none of us imagined that lady tobe his wife vane began to writhe under that terrible tongue whoso point hitherto had ever been turned away from him  he intended to steal a march on us said pomander drily and with your help we steal one on him and he smiled maliciously on mrs woffington  but madam said mr quin the moment you did arrive i kept sacred for you a bit of the fat for which i am sure you must be ready pass her plate not at present mr quin said mr vane hastily  she is about to retire and change her travelling dress yes dear but you forget lam a stranaer to your friends will you not introduce me to them firstno no cried vane in trepidation it is not usual to introduce in the beau monde we always introduce ourselvesrejoined mrs woffington and she rose slowly with her eye on vane he cost a look of abject entreaty cm her but there was no pity in that curung lip and awful eye he closed his own eyes and waited for the blow sir charles threw himself back in his chair and chuckling prepared for the explosion mrs woffington saw him and cast on him a look of ineffable scorn and then she held the whole company fluttering a long while at length  the honourable mrs quickly madam said she indicating mrs clive this turn took them all by surprise pomander bit his lip  sir john brute falstaff cried quin hang itsir john brute falstaff resumed mrs woffington we call him for brevity brute vane drew a long breath  your neighbour is lord foppington a butterfly of some standing and a little goutysir charles pomander oh cried mrs vane  it is the good gentleman who helped us out of the slough near huntingdon ernest if it had not been j for this gentleman i should not have had the pleasure of being here now and she beamed on the good pomander mr vane did not rise and embrace sir charles  a more touching scene is that between sir charles pomander and mrs vanesir charles is in love with mrs vane  now sir charles was naturally welcome to mrs vane for all 6he knew of him was that he bad helped her on the road to her husband pomander  what madam all alone here as in shropshiremabel for the moment sir pomander  force of habit

macbeth weeps over her lapdog dead from repletion and belvidere soothes her broken heart with a dozen of oysters in a word it is the place where actors and actresses become men and women and act their own parts with skill instead of a poets clumsilymabel actors actresses does mr vane frequent suchpomander  he has earned in six months a reputation many a fine gentleman would give his ears for not a scandalous journal his initials have not figured in not an actress of reputation gossip has not given him for a conquest how dare you say this to me cried mrs vane with a sudden flash of indignation and then the tears streamed over her lovely cheeks and even a pomander might have forborn to torture her so but sir charles had no mercy  you would be sure to learn itsaid he and with malicious additions it is better to hear the truth from a frienda friend  he is no friend to a house who calumniates the husband to the wife is it the part of a friend to distort dear ernests kindliness and gaiety into ill morals to pervert his love of poetry and plays into an unworthy attachment to actors andoh  and the tears would come but she dried them for now she hated this man  with all the little power of hatred she had she detested him do you suppose i did not know mrs woffington was to come to us today  cried she struggling passionately against her own fears and sir charless innuendoes what cried he you recognised her you detected the actress of all work under the airs of lady betty modish lady betty modish cried mabel that good beautiful faceah cried sir charles i see you did not well lady betty was mrs woffingtonwhom my husband i know had invited here to present her with these verses which i shall take him for her and her poor little lip trembled  had the visit been in any other character as you are so base so cruel as to insinuate what have i done to you that you kill me so you wicked gentleman  would he have chosen the day of my arrivalnot if he knew you were coming was the cool reply and he did knowi wrote to him indeed  said pomander fairly puzzled mrs vane caught sight of her handwriting on the tray and darted to it and seized her letter and mid triumphantly  my last letter written upon th roadsee sir charles took it with surprise but turning it in his hand a cool satirical smile came to his face he handed it back and said coldly  read me the passage madam on which you argue1 poor mrs vane turned the letter in her hand and her eye became instantly glazed the seal was un broken she gave a sharp cry of agony like a wounded deer she saw pomander no longer she was alone with her great anguish  i had but my husband and my god in the world cried she  my mother is gone my god have pity on me my husband does not love me there is a mistake in this book which the author will do well to amend in another edition the very clever scene in which mrs woffington imitates mrs bracegirdles acting and leads cibber to believe that the real bracegirdle is before himcould not have occurred we conceive as far as cibber was concernedwhat mrs woffington who had never seen mrs bracegirdle act deceive by an imitation of that lady the best judge of acting  witness the famous apology  that this country has yet seen  the thing is impossible for cibber had acted in the same plays with her hundreds of times and had his eyes and his senses to the last mr vane might have been deceivedbut not colley cibber,unmarked_contra

B4827,"['3180636', '6776982']",  mutineers by arthur f j lapge 6s lane  mutineers  belongs to a class of books most difficult for a reviewer to do justice to he cannct te enthusiastic for he cot id have put the story aside at any page without regrc t and yet he must admire much of the workmanship the intelligence the conscientiousness the knowledge of life and hun nature displayed are exceptional there is not a spark of vivacity but to demand viracity is to demand a touch of genius and to crave that in every novel of this fictiongreedy age is absurd mr leg writes of life as many of us know it taday he is familiar with more than one circle of soci ty and recognises the state of fusion to which we are tending when pity for the poor breeds among luxury and socialistic literature is the favourite reading of legart persons 4mutineers is too violent a title most of the rebels hover timidly between two camps and are probably the more comprehensible to the average reader there are careful pictures of life in ifferent grades there are studies of character forcible in themselves though tfle personages do not group well in the story indeed the story is not very satisfactory it is a succession of incidents rather than a whole perhaps the writer shows himself to best advantage in a few beautiful descrptive passages lt no reader skip that really admirable picture of an august landscape will downs by the sea to be fcund on p 142 we wish we had room to quote it  mutineers by arthur e j legge john lane it is unfortunate that the title of this story should so closely resemble that of though preceding work for the books may be confounded by careless librarians and heedless readers mutineers is a very different story indeed from the mutineer it is not a romance but a novel moro properly socalled it does not deal with remote scenes but with english it is of the actual moment it deals with modern social matters taken stir le vlf it is wiso and witty and it sets forth character shrewdly observed and vigorously drawn though story is an ordinary story enough a young lady marries one man while loving anotherand of course after the marriage another begins to dangle and philander also there is a subsidiary story which mainly concerns a lower stratum of society but in the reading though story hardly matters for the book is of the sort in which the mind of the writer his views of life and his exposition of character aro all in all here is a passago in which though husband a silont and an apparently brutal person is shown in his true inward lighthe is riding in a steeplechase   meanwhile presterly was riding through the gloom with a stern expression on his rigid face the result of the race would mean something very like ruin to him  but still ho scarcely thought his mind was only bent on the recovery of gladys necklace he raced down the hill and cleared the fences and came so close together along the bottom he could still hear the beat of crusaders

B4781,"['8955427', '3186031']",  the prueian offlicer by d h lawrence duckworth  co aki net there is a certain sombre brutality in mr lawrences work recalling aspects of zolas la terre or huysmanss  en rade or to come to our own literature mr james joyces dubliners this last indeed furnishes a very fair parallel except that mr joyce adds the touch of farsighted melancholy evident in the later school of irish writing mr lawrence is more sensuous in the thorn in the flesh  and  the vicars daughters  he allows himself full rein in a manner which might have seemed highly disagreeable to an earlier generation yet there is sufficient sincerity in his realism to purge his offence for those who can see his work as a whole and recognise the breadth and accuracy of his characterization the title of the volume is misleading the first two stories alone deal with german subjects the one is a curious demonstration of instinctive brutality on the part of a prussian officer towards his soldierservant whose revenge is equally instinctive in its basis it is an unusual study in psychology not wholly convincing but unquestionably impressive the other also dealing with bullying and brutality is more logical in its motive and consequent crime one of the stories  a fragment of stained glass is a clever piece of imaginative work well conceived and showing knowledge of the periods presented of old time life in an english countryside of the countryside in general german as well as english mr lawrence has a keen and poetic understanding he can see and describe he is kinder in fact to his setting than to the figures that people it and it is possibly just this appreciation of nature in all her beauty and uncompromising movements that impels him to bring out the cruder and more instinctive side of humanity  the prussian officer in these short stories mr lawrence shows himself the salvator rosa of modern psychologists he takes the most ordinary human beings and thrusts them into a veritable tempest of emotion the thunder rolls through their mental atmosphere lightning sears their souls it is magnificent and yet the reader feels an irksome doubt as to whether the circumstances justify all this sound and fury a dull heavy good natured submissive soldier is kicked and bullied by his officer and their feelings are described as if they were both in the grip of the shirt of nessus another soldier subject to giddiness is ordered to climb a ladder and the terror possessing him is described as if he were some orestes pursued by the furies lucretius concourse of atoms  ruining along the illimitable inane  amble gently along compared with the passions that sweep through the mind of a vicars ugly daughter making love to a handsome miner her lungs become  full of fire and a sharp pang like lightning sears her from head to foot  when the miner fails to take an obvious hint the miner himself wvho has lived on not particularly good terms with his affectionate but slightly contemptuous mother feels xwhen that mother lies dying  as if a redhot iron were gripped round his chest there is a want of variety too about the motifs of these hurricanes of feeling the medi eval horse serf revenging himself on his master for a cruel unmerited flogging is only another variant of the tragic theme in the opening story where the persecuted orderly revenges himself on his master the miner ashamed of himself for his bashfulness in the presence of women all the more ashamed because otherwise he feels himself a firstclass labouring man bears a strong family likeness to the firstclass fighting man in the prussian army who is ashamed of himself for his lack of head in going up a ladder the coldblooded calculating curate is halfbrother to the coldblooded blast and cynical officer the one is cruel to his wife the other to his orderly in other stories the feelings are analysed of wives driven by tactless husbands to insisting defiantly on their interest in other men the fact is that mr lawvrence is a master of psychological analysis but like the old germans of the romantic period he loves to operate in a  storm und drang  ens ironment and thereby he necessarily limits his field of operations but let there be no doubt as to his power of analysis it   the prussian officer b d h lawrence os duckwvorth is almost inspired almost uncanny in its truthfulness some arresting sentence some piece of startling insight constantly crosses our path the vicar of a mining village who slipped into  conscious hatred of the majority of his flock and unconscious hatred of himself is one example out of a thousand of his skill in portraiture a correlative of this subtlety of analysis is subtlety of observation as when he remarks of this vicars family that they had  the curiously clean semitransparent look of the genteel isolated poor not a little of the power of the pictures here presented to us lies in the contrast between the minute work of the brush in some parts of the canvas and the broad dashing effects in others when the colour is laid on in splashes so that a farm labourer for example is described in one breath as  uneasy triumphant and baffled to scrutinise too closely such work is to lose its effect studied at a distance as a whole the strong colours melt as in gainsboroughs work into a harmonious unity and produce a

B4547,"['3191778', '6625339', '3168748', '8945669']",  many inventions  the porcelain ladyl by frederick niven is a wellwritten and curiously attractive story of journalistic life as it revolves about a london newspaper office it is possible that there may be such a place as the weekly daily and hourly offices but it may be well to warn mr nivens readers that they are not to be found every day if they were all the world would be journalists if they could but if the life is somewhat idealised mr niven has given us a very pleasant picture of the camaraderie the sympathy and the unfailing helpfulness which exist between the men and women of the ready pen and the romance of john borough and ruth winter ends as it ought though  the porcelain lady has very little to do with it mr niven generally sustains a high level of writing it is all the more pity that he sometimes lapses into expressions inconsistent with the dignity of his work as might have been expected from so good a scholar and so distinguished a journalist as mr harold spender  the call of the siren  has many excellent qualities and his pictures of bath and the hills about it comb down and lansdowne the lanes through kelston and swainswick through which the children oliver and elsie martin wandered so happily have the authentic atmosphere there are many characters and many incidents not closely related so that the effect is sometimes confusing and the author at times leaves the reader unsatisfied how for instance did johnnie burrows know that olivers father was a thief whence came the rumour and having come how did it die out so suddenly  even olivers remarkable success in a cricketmatch would hardly have the effect of making schoolboys forget so sinister a rumour on the contrary his greater prominence would lend additional zest to their speculation but leaving apart such minor blemishes there is much that is excellent in the book though some pruning would have improved it and the chapter

orange baronet by the name of obrien an orangeman would no more be called obrien than he would kiss the popes toe the wild justice of revenge is exemplified in  the burnt house by christopher stone the widowed mrs tremayne still young and beautiful is obsessed with the desire to accumulate such evidence as will convict blagg a drunken tradesman of the malicious burning of her home to this end she employs a friend of blaggs to spy upon him and ascertain his whereabouts on the night of the fire when simpleminded people employ amateur detectives the result is all but inevitable hillier the detective draws large sums of money from his employer and produces no evidence until at last mrs tremayne has her eyes opened and angrily dismisses him one part of the problem is solved by the opportune death of blagg of a paralytic stroke the other by the return of mrs tremaynes old lover john dethick quite a readable book and the writing above the average  the sword by c a benton is evidently a first novel but it shows considerable promise the female characters are ably drawn but that of the hero is not very well realised desiree st just young vivacious and handsome under the shadow of a husband serving a term of penal servitude for fraud is a pathetic figure and her renunciation of the man she loves at the last moment touches a poignant note miss benton must use her adverbs more sparingly in dialogue the reader should be allowed to infer the meaning of such expressions as  whimsically and  quizzically etc if they have any meaning from the context mr bernard capes has the art rare amongst english writers no doubt through lack of encouragement of telling a short story as it ought to be told in  bag and baggage 6 he does this often enough to justify the reproduction of these stories which have for the most part appeared originally in magazines but he does not always  beneath dark wings began excellently well and if it had been half the length it

lighter vein are good but none so good as this it is a tribute to mr desmond cokes skill that although none of his characters are likable and win our sympathy  helena bretts career  holds ones

great mans plaything in his leisure moments helena soon found that she had a formidable rival in her husbands work and being left much to herself she sought other diversions and as the family pot was with difficulty coaxed to boil helena blossomed out into the anonymous author of a work entitled  confessions of an authors wife if the secret had been kept all might have been well but it wasnt for the publisher was a bad man and could not resist the temptation to make more money by breaking the contract of inviolable secrecy and the fat was then in the fire helena apologises to her husband for having written such a bad novel that it had an instant success but he remembering his own dwindling circulation is not to be appeased but a deus ex machind arrives to solve the difficulty and with what success we must leave mr cokes readers to judge for themselves  the ways of eve by roy mleldrum7 is a bright and pleasant story written round the claim to an estate and the temporary impoverishment of the person in possession there are however no grim tragedies and only enough trouble to remind one that the world albeit a pleasant place enough is not yet quite a garden of eden the book ends with a wedding breakfast and the felicitous compliments generally associated with such an event and what more can one desire  h a h  manu inventions by rudyard kipling macmillans at last the short story has taken firm root in english soil though in france many a master of fiction has fashioned his most lasting creations in this form but of late certain english newspapers have caused a demand for such work and mr kipling has been more than any one else its pioneer as yet however too many of the tales put before us are only boileddown novels few of our authors have acquired as have their french contemporaries notably barbey daurevilly the trick of choosing such subjects as ought not to be treated in any other manner the doings of their personages for instance are not always immediately intelligible yet if a short story is to be effective the characters must be so introduced as to make the reader feel at once that ho knows them personally for in work of this class the rapid and sure delineation of character is of even more importance than the plot mr kiplings best stories contain the right qualities in a very marked degree and these same qualities are mainly responsible for his failure as a novelist it is a matter for rejoicing then that he lias stayed his hand from though writing of novels and given us a book after the style of his earlier better work yet it is not an easy book to review for it ia perversely unequal between its covers lie several historiettos i know of no more objectionable and appropriate wordwhich lesser men thau mr kipling might well have hesitated to sign he even sins at times by being dull and when the laugh is bid for the reader can only respond by a yawn it were of course useless to expect that any writer however capable should always be at his best moreover a uniform excellence too often means mediocrity still it is amazing to find in this volume such stuff as  brugglesmith  judson and the empire and  the children of the zodiac it were perhaps unfair to condemn mr kipling for having included them but it is impossible not to wonder at their presence for the rest of these stories we have only hearty praise in  the disturber of traffic mr kipling gives us one of those inimitable sketches of blended farce and pathos that he alone seems able to contrive the lost legion  is a splendid ghost story telling how an afghan robber was surprised and captured by english officers and their men through  though aid of a regiment whose name did not appear in the brigade orders how it aided lieutenant halley and the major in their manoeuvres and why those gentlemen lost their tempers it would be unfair to reveal several stories are devoted to the already famous soldiers three stories no less good than those that first gained for them immortal fame the psychological skill of  the finest story in the world is of course remarkable but the two most successful and certainly the boldest stories in the collection are  in the rukh and  a matter of fact it required a very sure touch an absolute mastery of words and form to overcome the difficulties that here threatened and would certainly have overwhelmed any but a really capable writer there was every chance of complete failure and yet they are perfectly successful and convincing in the rukh is an account of a wild native bred up in the jungle among  his brothers the wolves and mr kipling thus describes him  a man was walking down the dried bed of the stream naked except for the loincloth but crowned with a wreath of the tasseiled blossoms of the white convolvulus creeper so noiselessly did he move over the little pebbles that even gisborne used to the softfootedne88 of trackers started his voice was clear and belllike utterly different from the usual whine of the native and his face as he lifted it in the sunshine might have been that of an angel strayed among the woods he has not ceased to be human because he has power over all the beasts of the jungle dwells among them and moves about attended by his wolves calling them back and forth as a king calls his armies he gives repeated evidence of his power to the great contentment of gisborne sahib of the woods and forests and to the great confusion of the mahommedan butler whose daughter ho loves the whole study is ono of great subtilty and marked by a powerful restraint not usual in mr kiplings work it closes with a love idyll of exquisite beauty  a matter of fact narrates how throe journalists the author himself a yankee and a dutchman the only passengers on a  little tramp steamer see the seaserpent and its mate some six or seven feet above the port bulwarks framed in fog and as utterly unsupported as a full moon hung a face the mouth was op n revealing a ridiculously tiny tonguo as absurd as the tongue of an elephant there were tense wrinkles of white skin at the angles of the drawn lips while feelers like those of a barbel sprung from the lower jaw and there was no sign of teeth within the mouth but the horror of the face lay in the eyes for those were sightlesswhite in sockets as white as scraped bone and blind yet for all this the face wrinkled as the mask of a lion is drawn in assyrian sculpture was alive with rage and terror from this point the tragedy moves on relentlessly to its end the terrific deathstruggle of the monster the savage hopeless grief of the female the chill horror of the fog and the noisome masses of cold protoplasm on the waves are so vividly described that one shudders involuntarily as one reads the difficulty of the three enterprising  newspaper men  as to what they shall do with their magnificent but incredible and useless  scoop makes an amusing and welcome finish to an astonishing story these are not the only stories i should have liked to quote from one scene in  love o woman and some brilliant passages in  my lord the elephant and his private honour ought not to be ignored in the other side of the question  mr kipling has marked for us one more type among the peoples of that vast eastern empire of ours of which we are at once so proud and so ignorant a capital poem ushers in this remarkable volume for remarkable it is because though it con lins quite the worst things mr kipling ever wroteand they are very badit gives us more than two hundred pages of by far the best work he has yet published it is but fair to close with the last verse of the noble and characteristic envoy earnest let us hope of a book of sea ballads such as no other living englishman is so able to indite

does it is partly his own fault this volume seems and probably is inferior to  lifes handicap it contains no single work equal to his earlier masterpiecesnothing which one can pronounce quite perfect the reason is obvious he takes less pains i do not mean less time or trouble for likely enough he finds selfrepetition harder work than selfexpression but he no longer so entirely absorbs himself in the story growing up in his brain no longer lives temporarily in it and for it so completely as to grasp it as a whole as a living organism with definite proportions and nicely adjusted parts and thus to present instinctively all its vital elements marvellously ordered and balanced in a work of perfect art it could not well be otherwise in those early pages we trace the young struggling author cheered no doubt by visions of future fame and fortune but forgetting those visions in the intensity of production whose vivid creations become for the moment no longer a means to an end but the end itself the only reality the only interest and delight of life at such times as one of like experience has told me the story grows up and shapes itself of its own accord clamouring to be set down in writing till it is written the actual life and surroundings of the author fade and dwindle into faraway sordid unrealities and the dream alone is tangible fact so strong is the spell that we seem to but slumber to our external life and awake to the sharpcut vibrant reality of the world of imagination and this highly developed form of selfhypnotism is what men call inspiration it never lasts long aged seers may be experienced and impressive but the genuine prophets are the young ones mr kipling like the rest of us will never sleep or dream as soundly as of old a wider horizon new interests the varied business of life the demands of fame and of societyall must inevitably tend to disenchant the imperative vision once eagerly pursued and scrupulously recorded becomes less and less real more and more mechanical storytelling we find is not the sole but only a subordinate object of lifewe no longer live to write but write to live to amuse ourselves keep up our reputations or just from mere habit mr kipling has his own sphere and in that he is never likely to excel himself he has done enough when he is gone and things have settled down about a dozen of his short pieces will be selected and that little book will stand as a masterpiece probably never to be rivalled but that is no reason why he should now leave off he need not write for fame or to show us what he can do but to amuse and instruct and stimulate usin short because we all want him to go on and to go on in his own proper walk these new inventions may be more or less inferior variations on his old themes but they are variations not imitations and we much prefer to have them from the hand of the master himself rather than from those of his numerous disciples for that hand has by no means lost its cunning it is as supple as quick as strong as tender as brutal as before though not so instinctive and masterful no he alters very little his topics are the same his way of looking at them is unchanged his method of presentation never varies not one of his faults has he even attempted to correct so he still remains individual and beyond rules if his work is less superlative as a whole that is due to the inevitable cause that i have indicated yet not wholly it is partly his own fault there is not only a certain air of effort and weariness in some of these  new inventions but at times positive carelessness i find not a few passages where though instinct failed experience might surely have suggested improvement hardly one of the stories but would bear recasting abridgment or alteration they have not been so carefully or at least so earnestly thought out and reduced to shape the best test is perhaps the conclusions one is seldom able to end with a note of admiration but with a feeling of unsatisfaction or even of disillusion and  many inventions by r kipling macmillan further what at first were startling innoati fantastic vagaries and daring licenses become on frequent repetition too much like mannerisms one i will mention because its effects are really serious it is the trick of intentional obscurity we are told minutely what people do and what they sayand to make thing worse they talk in oraclesbut we are not told what they mean till the next page meanwhile we are supposed to be enjoying the mystification and so we did two years ago but now it only fatigues nay worse exasperates when as at pages 3 19 and 320 we try in vain to follow the action and then when the key is given turn back to find that the action was clumsily and obscurely narrated in this case the boat must somehow have turned round similarly the story is often eked out and the mystery kept up by making the characters speak in oracular evasive or ambiguous terms or else persist in holding their tongues in a most unnatural and annoying way another trick is his constant allusion to oaths and bad language and the euphemistic paraphrases he uses for them we know that soldiers expletives are not pretty but then they are mere expletives without definite meaning to our ears such words do suggest a meaning which disgusts and horrifies if then the ipsissima zerba will not bear quotation why hint at them at all  further the settings to the tales which were usually so appropriate a frame are getting a little mechanical while sometimes as in  love o women they overshadow the main story in one piece  in the rukh mr kipling reaches his highest standard his natives were always more picturesque than his europeans it is a most impressive study of the indian forest and contains many splendid descriptionsone line is superb  and the forest was waking to the hushed ravenous life of the night yet even here though there is a laudable absence of the supernatural we sup full of improbabilities the marvellous forestman has been suckled by a wolf and is attended and served through life by his four grisly fosterbrothers these wolves then rmust have remained young and agile to the age of twenty or thirty besides the fraternal tie does not last between wolves much less their human fosterbrothers after each has gone out into the world on his own account the orpheus scene is moreover a most illjudged and incongruous embellishment still all this does not destroy the singular charm of the story  the disturber of traffic is an amusing little nautical yarn very much spun out it contains an interesting study of mania and a curious malay of whom we would gladly hear more my lord the elephant is a variation of  motiguj but not nearly so good and much too long the description of the elephants in the setting is very fine but mulvaneys story is a palpable lie and to tell the truth we have had almost enough of the clever talk of the soldiers three perhaps the letrs persaxes have had their day but there was room for the clever little imitation called  one view of the question mr kipling is not only shrewd he is wise and in the letter from shafiz ullah he tells us some nasty home truths among them the hopelessness of an india governed by an england governed by newspaper writers and readers to this theme he returns in  judson and the empire which opens with some very painful and highly improper remarks on the sacred theme of democracy the story is amusing and developes into downright burlesque but though confessedly a mere foreign office skit it does exemplify most vividly such history as is manufactured in faroff africa and probably reveals the true bearings of the angloportuguese squabble and through it all staggers and wobbles most pitiably that biggest and emptiest of bubbles that ever man blew and likened to the great globe itselfthe poor soapbom windbag of nineteenthcentury republicanism in his private honour we have ortheris again who has been struck on parade by a young officer the story is too long and somewhat obscure this affair is arranged by private fisticuffs in the jungle for a civilian to hint an opinion is perhaps touching or at least talking about the ark but i do think it is too bad of the author to bolster up this stupid wickedness and hint at murder and mutiny british soldiers are neither hyenas not french assassinsnordinary to a popular journal this excellent young officer surely bad tact enough to say in private a few simple hearty and flattering words of explanation and regret which would have been accepted nay treasured by this excellent soldier and afterwards to allow it to be inferred that such words had been spoken that such would have been the natural the sensible the english the only course i am prepared to maintain in the face of the guns and mr kipling a very original munchausen tale of the death of the seaserpent in a submarine volcanic eruption is introduced as a matter of fact the idea is most original and picturesque but more might have been made of it and here again we are teased by the old trick of deferring the key to minutely recorded action otherwise the marvels are picturesque enough and the epilogue is an original and subtle idea though very coarsely and obscurely worked out  the lost legion an account of a night attack contains some masterly descriptions and much instruction on border warfare but is hardly improved by the supernatural element love o women opens with a fine episode of a murder and trial which introduce a long don juan story by mulvaney which so far as i can grapple with its obscurity seems to come under the head of the blasphemously goody yet mulvaney is always the irish gentleman and a king of men we hardly dare criticise him his glowing picture pp 270272 of the return of the troops warms the heart like one of marryats honest pages hitherto we have been dealing with mr kipling on his proper ground when he strays into english scenes the indefinable taint of journalism spoils everything of this we have here a few examples  brugglesmith  is a farcical adventure with a drunken man incredible and artificialin fact mere theodore hook without the rollicking fun how differently mr stevenson would have treated the episode with his art of embellishing trifles the novelist in a conference of the powers  is a journalistic caricature the boyishness of the young officers much exaggerated the conversation highly mechanical and the constant interpretation of indian terms very tiresome  the finest story in the world is a dead failure stories about metempsychosis are utterly unjustifiable save as jeux desprit and this one alas  is tedious circumstantial and longwinded the author has however more or less broken new ground in two directions one is an allegorical tale highly original and in parts very striking but it is rather obscure and the machinery novel and confusing six signs and these not all beneficent ones are called the  children of the zodiac and are to be murdered by the other six not all malignant which are called  houses leo the hero appears as a man plays the part of orpheus and marries virgo but there is nothing vague about  the record of badalia herodsfoot here mr kipling is in whitechapel and at once makes himself at home where the prim inmates of toynbee hall if they hold the fort till the crack of doom will be but strangers in the land i do not pretend to admire the manncr it is zolaism but the best piece of zolaism which any englishman has yet done nay it is in one way an improvement upon the master because it is terser and more concentrated many a point we might trace to its sourcethe curate brother victor the terrible epilogue and the victim screening the murderer which is plainly suggested by a similar scene in la terre but the picture is none the less original certainly none the less truthful its grim humour is terrible mr kipling sees and i only hope will make others see how hideous is the hell in which pullulate the nisbegotten untrained vicious children whom we call men and women of the unemployed and criminal classes how noble and how beautiful are the varied efforts of all the churches and sects and philanthropies and humanities to palliate its horrorsand alas how tentative how ignorant how blind to facts and first principles how illjudged how ineffectual he

might fitly stalk through three volumes though we have only known the saucy warmhearted vain faithful womanly woman for a few pages we are the better for it yy  literature many inventions by rudyard kipling macmillan  co mb kipling has gone back in the volume before us to his first lovethe short story  the light that failed if it was not altogether a masterpiece of construction possessed much solid excellence and  the naulahka so far as mr kipling was concerned with its making was full of picturesqueness and vitality but for all that neither of these more ambitious efforts was the great novel which the writers admirers were perhaps unreasonably expecting from him it is we think becoming clear that whether we take him as poet or as prose stylist mr kiplings best work is done within the narrower limits of the ballad and the conte his effects are gained by just the qualities which such forms of art require swift intuition and stern repression  and in his longer tales he has given as yet no suggestion of that power of patiently accumulating details upon a large and complex designthat epic faculty to put it briefly which is the attribute of the supreme masters of fiction this is of course not to deny that in the sphere he has made his own mr kipling is an admirable writer whether of prose or verse that he is so it would be absurd to dispute it simply means that we have now to reconsider our original guarded estimate of mr kiplings gifts and potentialities and to admit that he is something not less than but different from what we were at one time inclined to believe him in many inventions mr kipling has thrown together various specimens of the work which has appeared from his pen in several quarters during the last few years with one or two stories that we do not remember having seen before the best of them all to our mind is  love o women which is indeed one of the most masterly things its author has yet done and is fit to rank beside the six great successes of his  lifes handicap as a study of inexorable retribution and unspeakable remorse it is worth a hundred addresses on social purity platforms  and yet it is written with an artistic reticence which is beyond all praise mulvaney tells the story as only mulvaney can and the following fragment will suffice to show that what we have said above is no extravagant eulogy  ye can ondersthand that afther

fisticuffs between officer and private which in the most natural way restored the latters good opinion of himself and made a man of the former is inimitably described it reveals once more if the

B1967,['9087693'],  black magic  pfr amica silentia lunve   is a book for the yeats enthusiast that is to say we should not recommend it to any one who has anything else of mr yeatss still to read a man who knows only  innisfree and  the heavens embroidered clothes  may be left happily with the rest of the poems with the  stories of red hanrahan and should he wish to know something of the poets life with the exquisite  reveries over childhood and youth in  per amica silentia luna mr yeats is less often exquisite than affected it is not his genius that he reveals to us here but some curious crannies of his mind of course mr yeatss mind is a prodigiously interesting and unusual mind and well worth exploring  but when one is following a bewildering path into a cavern one does not like the guiding light to gutter or wobble about there are moments in this volume when we fancy a bat has flown into the candle here for instance are two consecutive sentences  one night i heard a voice that said   the love of god for every human soul is infinite for every human soul is unique  no other can satisfy the same need in god our masters had not denied that personality outlives the body or even that its rougher shape may cling to us a while after death but only that we should seek it in those who are dead even if we drink a glass of cold water and begin again it is impossible to make a coherent thought out of those two pieces of wisdom they need mr george robeys interpreting  in other words to simplify them they are the means however by which mr yeats softens to us the news that he believes in ghosts there was no need for mr yeats to protest his faith with such cocoons of per amica silentia luna by w b yeats macmillan  co 45 dd net words we are too eager for knowledge at the present day to be content with derision in place of it mr yeats says   i have always sought to bring my mind close to the mind of indian and japanese poets old women in connaught mediums in soho because no authority seemed greater than that of this knowledge running backward to the beginning of the world we wish that he had expressed himself always as clearly and beautifully as when he says   faith is the one gift that man can make to god it is difficult to catch the authoritative voice of conviction in a remark like the following   all souls have a vehicle or body and when one has said that with more and the platonists one has escaped from the abstract schools who seek always the power of some church or institution and found oneself with great poetry and superstition which is but popular poetry in a pleasant dangerous world mr yeats is too great an artist to make bogus confessions he is saying what he means however elaborate or deliberately casual his prose he believes that every great man has a demon to mingle with his life it is a daemon literally and not figuratively speaking who inspires every man of genius the demon who is the creator of the work of art mr yeats contrasts man with his failings in daily life with man at the divine moment of artistic achievement and divides them from one another under the names of self and antiself self is the man fretted by everyday vexations and distresses antiself is the daemon maker of a thing far greater than the man himself it is in his attempted explanation of his belief that mr yeats like other theologians breaks down he bases his theory in his own case on the fact that when he comes home from a dinnerparty where he has talked a great deal he experiences what one would describe if one were speaking of oneself as the feeling that one has talked for effect and made an insincere jabbering ass of oneself mr yeats describes his sensation thus  when i come home after meeting men who are strange to me and sometimes even after talking to women i go over all i have said in gloom and disappointment perhaps i have overstated everything from a desire to vex or startle from hostility that is but fear or all my natural thoughts have been drowned by an undisciplined sympathy my fellow  diners have hardly seemed of mixed humanity and how should i keep my head among images of good and evil crude allegories r how indeed  did not charles lamb talk for a whole evening about phrenology because a fellowguest had the misfortune to ask if milton was a great poet   but when i shut my door and light my candle i invite a marmorean muse an art where no thought or emotion has come to mind because another man has thought or felt something different for now there must be no reaction action only and the world must move my heart but to the hearts discovery of itselfall my thoughts have ease and joy i am all virtue and confidence it is in such moods of ecstatic confidence that mr yeats sees the vision that he translates for us in his work he will not accept the commonplace idea that this  heroic condition  is his true self he regards it rather as  the lord of terrible aspect  who appeared to dante and said  egodominus tuus  the descent of the demon who when the moment of creation comes makes for mr yeats what is to him a new personality and to us his genius  when i consider the minds of my friends says mr yeats  among artists and emotional writers i discover a like contrast and he cites example after example of men and women who are entirely opposed in their everyday life to the nature that they reveal in their work there is an actress who is a dove upon the stage and a termagant in private life a censorious friend whose comedies are full of unpunished rogues contemporary poets who have been preoccupied with religion in their verse but with women or liquor in their lives  and mr yeats refers to dantes lechery and shakespeares  pottle pot  with the satisfaction of a man who has scored a point in a debate but this division into self and antiself is too abrupt treatment for so complicated a thing as the human mind it is impossible to divide personality with a butchers cleaver one may get interesting generalisation as the result but one will not get truth if mr yeatss theory were correct psychologists might expect to find lyric verse behind every swollen nose the elements of a mans nature cannot be seen as separate things like the two sides of a penny but are interwoven like the branches of a tree with the air and the air with the veining branches of the tree,unmarked_contra

that a novel should aim rather at the exhilaration than the depression of the readers spirits that it should forbear to give pain which is not calculated to enhance the effect of its pleasurable representations that its illustrations of the evil should be put in contrast against equally vivid exhibitions of the good of human nature and that at the end it should leave the reader in the intellectual and moral condition of a man who has been listening to fiue music or contemplating a noble work of art or enjoying the stimulus of good company on the contrary by those many persons who delight in strong hysterical emotions and are of opinion that the romancewriter labours within the proper province of his art when he alternately freezes the readers heart and causes his hair to stand on end by pictures of eccentric vice and cruel violence a rush will be made to the libraries for the new tale of the novelist whose present performance surpasses all his previous wild stories in sensational inhumanity that the book overflows with cleverness and force no reader will deny but mr sheridan le fanu adds nothing to his reputation by another display of literary adroitness and melodramatic ability it must also be conceded that much labour has been expended on the first two volumes the separate parts of which are fitted together with the most precise and cunning workmanship and that the character of mildred tarnleythe faithful honest harsh old servingwoman who tells innumerable falsehoods in her masters service whilst she sharply censures his misconduct and sturdily declines to flatter himsecures the book from a charge of being altogether deficient in humour the naturalness of the other feminine characters is not conspicuous but the three principal men of the dramaold squire fairfield of wyvern and his two sonsare creatures of human flesh and blood surcharged with some of the most odious qualities of the race that they dishonour the harsh despotic scurrilous squire of wyvern a brute whose abusive tongue respects neither virtue nor the grave is not untrue to a period when englishmen of common stuff albeit of ancient pedigree used to think it a proof of manly spirit to bully their dependents and drink themselves at least once a day into stupefaction the disdainful abhorrence roused by the selfishness and moral imbecility of the squires elder son who by marrying alice maybell does her the greatest injury it is in his power to inflict upon her is evidence of the skill with which his despicable nature is portrayed and though harry fairfieldwho combines the smart  slanginess  of foker and the meanness of barnes newcome with the niggardliness of miser elwesis a more revolting specimen of the cheat sneak and cad than we have ever before encountered in prose fiction the picture of his loathsomeness does not surpass the bounds of possibility or even wander beyond the lines of experience the opening chapters of the narrative introduce the reader to alice maybell a fair and fortuneless beauty soon after her secret marriage with charles fairfield and to her patron the abusive old squire of wyvern who having in consideration of remote consanguinity extended patronage to her otherwise friendless infancy and girlhood is of opinion that the charming woman should reward his past kindness by consenting to be the wife of his failing years taking this view of her obligations the aged savage woos the frightened girl with a grotesque and boisterous amorousness that reminds us of squire westerns least delicate demeanour in the presence of ladies  and when alice escapes at the same time from his importunities and his house and flies with her bankrupt husband to a desolate and dilapidated old mansion not many miles distant from wyvern the furious dotard curses the pair with the choicest imprecations to be found in his comprehensive vocabulary of abuse and ere long he has grounds for flattering himself that his amiable wishes have not been ineffectual in carwell grange the miserable dwelling to which charles fairfield takes his bride even as a few years earlier he had brought the recentlydiscarded mistress

the grange in the person of a blind and unspeakably hideous dutch woman named bertha velderkaust who effects an entrance into the mansion during charlesfairfields absence and whilst alice is in bed of berthas peculiarities it is enough to say that in addition to blindness and the disfigurements of smallpox they comprise a strong appetite for opium and brandy a temper given to maniacal ebullitions of rage and a demoniacal hatred of the woman who has supplanted her in her former paramours affections having contrived to enter the house and terrorised mildred tarnley into giving her a supper and

and scrambling on the bed on bar knees she dragged her down upon it and almost instantly struck at her throat with a knife to make this blow she was compelled to withdraw one hand and with a desperate spring alice evaded the stroke through the intervention of timely aid alice escapes from her murderous assailant who is seized and consigned to the county prison where instead of exhibiting an anxiety for her own fate at the approaching assizes she vows vengeance on her former keeper whom she accuses of having committed bigamy but ere the wyvern  mystery can be unravelled by lawyers in a publio court the position of affairs is changed by the sudden death of charles wyvern shortly before alice gives birth to the boy with whose fortunes the remainder of the story principally concerns itself after charless death the interest of the tale sensibly diminishes and more than once in the course of the third volume the threads of the narrative seem to be falling from the weavers hand whilst he appears to be in doubt how to work them into an appropriate ending acting in harmony with his previous conduct harry fairfield gets possession of his brothers son puts him out of sight and makes alice believe that the little fellow is dead calling death to help him out of his perplexities the narrator kills old squire wyvern whose dying moments are worthy of the life that has preceded them and sends bertha velderkaust to the next world finally harry fairfield is shot in a fray with poachers and expires after making a confession that cooperates with other incidents to explain the wyvern

solution of the problem which the struggle raises  and it is in this instance dramatically at fault because evelyns interested and vigorous nature would never have been content with such a solution if it had not been for the accident of her physical weakness the knot is cut but it is not untied  or evelyns illness might be compared with a clumsy deus ex machina who comes to save an author the trouble of setting right his entanglements however the remedy still lies in mr moores own hands for though evelyns soul is left in a fainting condition it is presumably not quite dead and it might perhaps be revived in a third volume if it is not and this is really the end of the whole business one can only compare with regret mr moores pusillanimous treatment of the problem with that of mr meredith in one of his latest poems a reading of life as a final inducement to mr moore to deal with the subject more adequately in a third volume he might be reminded that tolstoys  war and peace that great novel with which he seems from a word in his preface to desire to challenge comparison also consists of three volumes to turn to the more immediate subject of sister teresa it must be admitted that it is a very dull book evelyn has some more struggles with the flesh and then goes into a convent as a novice and ends by taking the veil but her struggles are not over yet and she is on the point of leaving the convent to avoid a more subtle temptation than she had had before when she falls ill with the inconclusive result that we have described most of the book is devoted to minute details about the life in a convent its pettiness and its humdrum monotony for all except the infinitesimal number who can transcend the trivial details are brought out with more than sufficient force in fact mr moore seems so anxious to bring out the dullness of the life which after all did not require much proving that he makes even his description dull he reminds us of the conscientious actor who dyed himself black all over to act othello  similarly he seems to think it impossible to describe dullness without being altogether dull himself evelyn herself for example not only goes through certain experiences and sees certain things but she is described as going all over some of them again in her memory and mr moore spares us none of the original experience a second time we ventured in criticising evelyn innes to say that excellent in a way as mr moores characters are they never strike one as being really lived as the french say they are persons most minutely observed but always observed from an outside standpoint in a sense therefore his characters are perfect types but they do not seem to be informed with just that spark of life which genius alone can bestow mr moore talks of war and peace but mr moore never has made and never will make a character that one knows in the way that one knows natacha andrew peter  well one need not go through the list but every one of them they are all in a sense eccentric characters as all characters really known are but every action of theirs is absolutely the only thing they could have done another result of mr moores method by which one knows all about his characters without really knowing them is that the intimate details about some of them which he gives us seem to suggest a system of prying rather than an intimate knowledge though details for example about evelyns physical distress at lady ascots and about some of the aberrations of the nuns strike one as not only unnecessary but as if their knowledge were the result of ungentlemanly indiscretion now tolstoy has a scene which may in some respects be compared to the first alluded tothe scene of natachas distress after her intended flight with her lover is preventedbut there is all the difference in the world between the two the difference is perhaps difficult to explain but it can be felt the reason of the difference is that you know natacha as god knows her  je northeast crains pas dieu sil sait tout says some frenchwoman while you only know evelyn from mr moores exceedingly acute observation of her character and you feel you have no business to know so much about a woman whom you do not know more of to our mind the most successful parts of the book are where asher and ulick come in somehow the tragedy of ashers inadequacy in the presence of ulick when they meet at dinner seems almost the only real the only thoroughly felt part in  sister teresa nevertheless we hope that mr moore will write a third volume for it will show that he recognises the inadequacy even from a dramatic point of view of the present ending  fiction sister teresa by george moore unwin gs as the author admits in his prefatory note this is not a novel it is only a continuation a part of evelyn innes and though it is by far the best part of evelyn innes one experiences a difficulty in reviewing it separately from the rest of the book the time to review will be when the two parts further shortened are issued together sister teresa narrates how evelyn innes after a febrile and tempestuous career of art and pleasure takes the veil in a passionist convent at wimbledon the great merit of the book overshadowing all minor merits and all defects springs once more from mr moores singularand intense faculty of putting himself into a character and of  getting up  the details of an environment ho has done it before in esther waters and particularly in a mummers wife but wc do not think that he has ever succeeded more completely than in sister teresa the nun the convent aro realised for us in an almost absolute sense there is more than the artistic presentment of an array of picturesque facts there is an edifice of spiritual innermost vitality reared upon the factual basis though characters seldom open their mouths without uttering what we feel they must have uttered thus when the aged prioress first addresses evelyn as teresa she says i felt i should like to call you teresa and you will prove yourself worthy of the name my dear child aud one can hear the prioress using precisely those phrases this prioress is the dominating individuality of the book and the author in portraying her has many touches of pure insight meditating on evelyns grief and unsettlement  the prioress remembered the great relief that the mere putting on of the habit brings to the soul and she rose from her knees quite determined that evelyn should bo allowed to take the veil it is this stark imaginative power which alone gives the book its sanction  but the book has other qualities less intrinsic yet not to be ignored the whole conception is coloured by a profound appreciation of beauty in order to perceive how much of sheer beauty the book contains one should read a masterpiece of a different sort diderots la rcligieuse equally true equally convincing but repellent bitter and inexpressibly sinister two pictures of conventual life could scarcely be more at variance than these yet the facts save for a few gross details are the same in each there is the same pettiness paltriness hairsplitting hysteria arid ritualism the difference arises partly from mr moores continual effort after sympathetic comprehension and partly from his determination to find beauty and let us say that the honest search for beauty is always rewarded the book is pervaded by a melancholy sense of the beautiful this is especially true of the conclusion immediately before the end one is sure that evelyn will die one sees no other end than this sad end but mr moore discloses an end still sadder evelyn inns showed the inception of a development in the authors style of writing in sister teresa the development is continued mr moore is still ungrammatical and loose in his constructions and he has even lost some of his former force but he has acquired a mellowness and a curious wistful chantlike quality which are very persuasive one is struck again and again by the fitness and charm of his similes thc writing abounds in similes here is one   does another quest lie before me  she tried to stifle the thought but it cried across her life like a curlew across waste lands wo th ink there are traces everywhere of a certain affectation of celticism mr moores recentlyfound celtic aspirations are of course notorious he has not succeeded in keeping them out of his novel there is a passage on p gg   he must go with her to the pure country to the woods and to the places where the invisible ones whom the druids knew etc  wandering in the woods and underneath the boughs we shall know that the great immortal presences are by us otcwhich annoys us because it seems so obviously a homage ineffectively paid to mr w b yeats wte do not believe that mr moores enchanted eyes have seen immortal mild proud shadows walk and we regard it as an indiscretion on his part to try to rewrite mr yeatss poetry in prose if he will remain merely mr moore novelist

B15,"['8467653', '4973077']",  the literary examiner danish fairy legends and tales by hans chris tian andersen pickering this is a charming little book of fairy tales and excellently well translated but why the tales should he called danish we do not perceive  except inasmuch as a dane is the author there is an occasional northern colouring but only so far as it could not be helped all the rest is so free from everything national or exclusive that we do not remember to have met with any production so given up to a sense of the variety of being that exists in the universe at times it is even painfully so we have so strong a sense given us of the feelings of ducks and ducklings  of swans and storks  of mermen and mermaidens  of nightingales flowers and daisies  even of slugs and cuttlefish  aud of what all sorts of animated creatures round about us think do and might say if they could speak that ones consciousness as a human being almost becomes lost in the crowd we begin to feel as mrs gulliver did when her husband returned from houynhnm land  and think we might as well take to being of a different species we need not say that it implies a rare and surprising art to convey such impressions as these when johnson laughed at goldsmith for thinking of writing a story in which u little fish should be the actors the author of animateil xetture very properly told him that it was not so easy a matter as he thought it  and that if he johnson were to write such a story he would make his little fish talk like  great whales there is no such confusion of ideas in mr hans christian andersen his whales and his little fish all talk in character we are not sure that we ourselves after reading his book could not have talked at pleasure like sharks minnows mermaids bulls ducks or green teas for his vegetables have as much conversational character as his ducks and geese nay his very pegtops and balls are full of individuality there is a pathetic daisy in his story of that name who is quite a  sweet creature for the pastoral beauty of her tongue  and in another story there is a leatter ball of so aristocratical a character that when proposals are made to her by a pegtop because they happen to have been companions in the same drawer she indignantly asks him whether he is aware that her father and mother were morocco slipjiers and that she has  cork in her body we are here however it may be said confusing the specific and the superinduced character mr andersen keeps all clear he has so just a sense of the necessity of adhering to verisimilitude and of the forgetfulness of it on the part of writers in general that he introduces one of his stories with a remark that ought to become proverbial  in china the emperor is chinese esome of his descriptive touches recall the wonderful observation and exquisitely graphic felicity of mr dickens there is a wretched little hut in the tale of the ugly duclding  so wretched that it knew not on which side to fall and therefore remained standing admirable is the picture of the stork parading about on his long red legs discoursingin egyptian which language he had learned from his mother who does not feel that egyptian ls the very language that by way of accomplishment a stork would know  the touches of tnis kind are innumerable the fault of the book if we must find one is that all the stories have too much meaning  that they overflow with intention and moral not always obviously sometimes obscurely but still with incessant intelligence you desire occasionally something more childish and less clever and some of the stories nre too long but the genius and refinement are undeniable we must give an extract and are somewhat at a loss so many of the teles nave such strone chums but with all the fairy

literature of the critic that notice attracted to them considerable attention and translations were immediately commenced in various quarters the first that has made its appearance is now before us exquisitely printed at the aldine press and tastefully bound so as to form a birthday gift or school prize as attractive in external appearance as it will prove in its contents which are precisely such as youth most loves to read appealing at once to the imagination aud the heart conveying the morality of poetry and the poetry of morality an dersen has succeeded beyond all modern writers in catching the spirit as wvell as the manner of the legendary lore of his country it may be that he has only remodelled fables already current among the peasantry of denmark but even if he be not the inventor he is entitled to much applause for the skill with which he has put them into presentable shape without divesting them of the simplicity of language and the air of childlike faith in their literal truth which are essential to the storyteller and in which in fact lies the differ i encebetween the real and the false legend making the latter however cleverly constructed dull and uninteresting when compared with the former andersen writes as if he thoroughly believed that there was a time when beasts and birds talked like christian men  when i fairies danced anl mermaids sung in this lies the  charm of his legends and tales anrd for this and be 1 cause they invariably carry a wholesome moral without thrusting it offinsively forward teaching it rather by the example than by precept do we heartily recommend this volume to young persons and to the regards of all who are looking for an acceptable present for their young friends the translator who wve understand is a lady has performed her task with a hearty appreciation of the characteristics of the author which she has carefully preserved by rendering the simple language of the original into a pure and simple english so well fitted to convey legends and tales such as these and always so charming because so intelligible to children as specimens both of author and translator anl as in themselves worthy of perusal we extract some of these legends what poetry there is in the daisy listen to my story  in the country close by the road 4 side there stands a summerhouseyou must certainly have i seen it in front is a little garden full of flowers enclosed by i white palings with green knobs and on a bank outside the i palings there grew amidst the freshest of grass a little daisy i the sun shone as brightly and warmly upon the daisy as upon i the splendid large flowers within the garden and therefore it grew hourly so that one morning it stood fully open with its delicate white gleaming leaves which like rays surrounded the t little yellow sun in their centre it never occurred to the 1 little flower that no one saw her hidden as she was among i the grass she was quite contented  she turned towards the i warm sun looked at it and listened to the lark who wasf singing in the air the daisy was as happy as if it were they day of some high festival and yet it was only monday the c children were at school  and whilst they sat upon their forms hi and learned their lessons the little flower upon her green stalk n learned from the warm sun and every thing around her how 1 good god is meanwhile the little lark expressed clearly and 0 beautifully all she felt in silence and the flower looked up a with a sort of reverence to the happy bird who could fly and d sing it did not distress her that she could not do the same a  i can see and listen thought she  the sun shines on mne h and the wind kisses me oh how richly am i blessed 94 there stood within the palings several grand stifflooking t flowers the less fragrance they had the more airs they gave fl themselves the peonies puffed themselves out in order to ai make themselves larger than the roses the tulips had the b gayest colours of all they were perfectly aware of it and held ti themselves as straight as a candle that they might be the better 01 seen they took no notice at all of the little flower outside c the palings but she looked all the more upon them thinking y4 how rich and beautiful they are yes that noble bird will st surely fly down and visit them how happy am 1 who live al so near them and see their beauty  just at that moment vi ji quirrevit the lark did fly down but he came not to the peonies nor the tulips no he flew down to the poor little ac daisay in the grass who was almost frightened from pure joy in and knew not what to think she was so surprised the little to bird hopped about and sang  oh how soft is this grasm rtand what a sweet little flower blooms here with its golden of heart and silver garment  for the yellow centre of the daisy rn looked just like gold and the little petals around gleamed silver n white ihow happy the little daisy was  no one can imagine of how happy the bird kissed her with his beak sang to her le and then flew up again into the blue sky it was a full quarhe ter of an hour ere the flower recovered herself half ashamed n and yet completely happy she looked at the flowers in the th garden they must certainly be aware of the honour and haput piness that had been conferred upon herthey must know tir j how delighted she was but the tulips held themselves twice al as stiff as before and their faces grew quite red with anger as i to the peonies they were so thickheadedit was indeed well he that they could not speak or the little daisy would have heard something not very pleasant the poor little flower could see  well that they were in an illhumour and she was much vexed at it soon after a girl came into the garden with a knife i sharp and bright she went up to the tulips and cut off one after another  oh  that is horrible sighed the daisy  it  is now all over with them the girl then went away with the i tulips how glad was the daisy that she grew in the grass lit outside the palings and was a despised little flower  she felt e really thankful and when the sun set she folded her leaves is went to sleep and dreamed all night of the sun and the beaul tiful bird the next morning when our little flower fresh ir and cheerful again spread out all her white leaves in the sunshine and clear blue air she heard the voice of the bird but he is sung so mournfully alas  the poor lark had good reason for e sorrow he had been caught and put into a cage close by the ly open window lie sang of the joys of a free and unrestrained i flightlie sang of the young green corn in the tields and of the pleasure of being born up by his wings in the open air the poor bird was certainly very unhappyhe sat a prisoner in his narrow cage  the little daisy would so of illingiv have  helped him but how could she  ah that she knew not she squite forgot how beautiful all around her was how warmly the sun shone how pretty and white her leaves were alas  she could only think of the imprisoned bird for whom it was not in her power to do anything all at once two little boys 1 came out of the garden one of them had a knife in his hand e as large and as sharp as that with which the girl had cut the y tulips they went straight up to the little daisy who could e not imagine what they wanted  here we can cut a nice r piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys and he began n to cut deep all round the daisy leaving her in the centre it i tear out the flower said the other boy and the little s 1 daisy trembled all over for fear for she knew that if she were e torn out she would die and she wished so much to live as she e was to be put into the cage with the imprisoned lark  no g leave it alone  said the first  it looks so pretty  and so e it was left alone and was put into the larks cage but the s poor bird loudly lamented the loss of its freedom and beat e its wings against the iron bars of its cage and the little flower e could not speak could not say a single word of comfort to ihim much as she wished to do so thus passed the whole imorning  there is no water here said the imprisoned vlark they have all gone out and forgotten me not a drop 1 of water to drink  my throat is dry and burning there is fire and ice within me and the air is so heavy  alas  i must i die i must leave the warm sunshine the fresh green trees and all the beautiful things which god has created  and then he pierced his beak into the cool grass in order to refresh him self a little and his eye fell upon the daisy and the bird bowed to her and said  thou too wilt wither here thou poor little flower  they have given me thee and the piece of green iaround thee instead of the whole world which i possessed before  every little blade of grass is to be to me a green i treethy every white petal a fragrant flower alas  thou only remindest me of what i have lost  oh that i could comfort him  thought the daisy but she could not move yet the fragrance which came from her delicate blossom was stronger than is usual with this flower the bird noticed it and although panting with thirst he tore the green blades in very anguish he did not touch the flower it was evening and yet no one came to bring the poor bird a drop of water he stretched out his slender wings and shook them convulsivelyhis song was a mournful  pipi his little head bent towards the flower and the birds heart broke from thirst and desire the flower could not now as on the preceding evening fold together her leaves and sleep she bent down sad and sick to the ground the boys did not come till the next morning and when they saw the bird was dead they wept bitterly they dug a pretty grave which they adorned with flower petals the birds corpse was put into a pretty red box royally was the poor bird buried whilst he yet lived and song they forgot himleft him suffering in his cage and now he was highly honoured and bitterly bewailed but the piece of turf with the daisy in it was thrown out into the street no one thought of her who had felt pnost for the little bird and who had so much wished to comfort him what a moral in the buckwheat if after a tempest you chance to walk through a field where buckwheat is growing you may observe that it is burnt as black as though a flame of fire had passed over it and should i you ask the reason the peasant will tell you that the lightning has done it but how is it that the lightning has i done it  i will tell you what the sparrow told me and the sparrow heard the story from an old willowtree which grew and still grows close to a field of buckwheat this willowtree is tall and highly respectable but at the same time old and wrinkled its trunk had been riven asunder from top to bottom grass and brambles grow out of the gap the tree bends forward and the branches hang down almost to the ground looking like long green hair there were different kinds of corn growing in the fields around the willowrye wheat and oatsthe beautiful oats whose ears when they are ripe look like a number of little yellow canarybirds sitting upon one branch the cornears were richly blessed and the fuller they were the lower they bowed their heads in pious humility but there was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willowtree the buckwheat bowed not like the rest of the cornhe stood stiff and proud  i am quite as rich as the wheat said he i and besides i am so i much more handsome my flowers are as beautiful as the i blossoms of the appletree it is delightful to look at me and l my companions do you know anything more beautiful than l we are you old willowtree  and the willowtree bent his l head as much as to say  yes indeed i do  but the f buckwheat was puffed up with pride and said  the stupid  tree he is so old that grass is growing out of his body  c now ctnne a dreadful storm all the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads whilst it passed over them 1 the buckwheat lowever in his pride still stood erect t  bow thv head as we do  said the flowers  i have no c need said the buckwheat  bow thy head as we do said  i the corn  the angel of storms comes flying hitherward hei h has win s which reach from the clouds to the earth he will it strike thee down before thou hast time to entreat for mercy n  no i will not bow said the buckwheat close thy i p flowers and fold thy leaves said the old willowtree look a not into the flash when the cloud breaks even men dare not n do that for in the flash one looks into gods heaven and that t sight can dazzle even human eves  what then would it prove tl to mere vegetables like us if we should dare to do so we al who are so inferior to men  so inferior indeed  said the ir buckwheat now then i vid look right into gods nr heaven and in his pride and haughtiness he did gaze upon c the lightning without shrinking such was the flash that it southeast seemed as if the whole world was in flames when the tem southeast pest was over flowers and corn greatly refreshed by the rain re once more breathed pure air but the buckwheat had been ta burnit as black as a coal by the lightning it stood on the field e a dead useless plant and the old willowtree waved its branrelse to and fro in the wind  and large drops of water th fell from the green leaves as though the tree wept and the of svarrows asksd  winv

tale endt what sly satire in n the emperors new clothes iad many years ago there was an emperor who was so exces mst sively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress pt he did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor ith did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase except for iv the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new ud clothes he had a different suit for each hour of the day and nd as of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he  he is sitting in council it was always said of him  the he emperor is sitting in his wardrobe time passed away tie merrily in the large town which was his capital strangers arrived every day at the court one day two rogues calling themselves weavers made their appearance they gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colours and elaborate patterns the clothes manufactured from re which should have the wonderful property of remaining in as visible to every one who was unfit for the office he held or id who was extraordinarily simple in character  these must he indeed be splendid clothes  thought the emperor  had i as i such a suit i might at once find out what men in my realms he are unfit for their office and also be able to distinguish the v wise from the foolish  this stuff must be woven for me im r mediately and he caused large sums to be given to both id the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly to so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected be to work very busily though in reality they did nothing at all ie they asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold it thread put both into their own knapsacks and then con e tinned their pretended work at the empty looms until late at e night  i should like to know how the weavers are getting g on with my cloth said the emperor to himself after some ie little time had elapsed he was however rather embarrassed is when he remembered that a simpleton or one unfit for his goffice would be unable to see the manufacture  to be sure ht lie thought i he had nothing to risk in his own person but n yet he would prefer sending somebody else to bring him in 0 telligence about the weavers and their work before he e troubled himself in the affair all the people throughout d the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to n possess and all were anxious to learn how wise or how ignos rant their neighbours might prove to be  i will send my e faithful old minister to the weavers said the emperor at last i after some deliberation  he will be best able to see how the cloth looks for he is a man of sense and no one can be more i suitable for his office than he is so the faithful old minister went into the hall where the knaves were working with all their might at their empty looms v what can be the meaning of this  thought the old man opening his eyes very wide d i cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms however he did not express his thoughts aloud the impos1 tors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms and then asked him whether the design pleased him and whether the colours were not very beautiful at the same time pointing to the empty frames the poor old minister looked and looked he could not discover any thing on the looms for a very good reason viz there was nothing there  what  thought he again is it possible that i am a simpleton  i have never thought so myself and no one must know it now if i am so can it be that i am unfit for my office no that must not be said either i will never confess that i could not see thestuff 1 well sirminister said one of the knaves still pretending to work  you do not say whether the stuff plleases you  oh it is excellent  replied the old minister loking at the loom through his spec tacles  this pattern and the coloursyes i will tell the emperor without delay how very beautiful i think them w e shall be much obliged to you said the impostors and then they named the different colours and described the pattern of the pretended stuff the old minister listened attentively to their words in order that he might repeat them to the eimtperor and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold saving that was neeesary to complete what they had begun llowcvcr they put all that was given them into their knapi s9c1 mnld c tinued to work vwith as much aippmrent diligence kfjrc t iir cq1ty looms the enpietor now rent au other officer of his court to see how the men were getting on i and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready it t was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister he i surveyed the looms on all sides but could see nothing at all  but the empty frames does not the stuff appear as beautiful l to you as it did to my lord the minister  asked the imposx tors of the emperors second ambassador at the same time  making the same gestures as before and talking of the design i and colours which were not there  i certainly am not stupid i thought the messenger  it must be that i am not fit for i my good profitable office that is very odd however no l one shall know any thing about it and accordingly he i praised the stuff he could not see and declared that lie was i delighted with both colours and patterns  indeed please your imperial majesty said he to his sovereign when he returned  the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent the whole city was talking of the 4 splendid cloth which the emperor had ordered to he woven at his own expense and now the emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture whilst it was still on the loom accompanied by a select number of officers of the court among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth he went to the crafty impostors who as soon as they were aware of the emperors approach went on working more diligently than ever although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms is not the work absolutely magnificent   said the two officers of the crown already mentioned if your majesty will only be pleased to look at it what al splendid design what glorious colours and at the samz l time they pointed to the empty frames for they imagined that i every one else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship  how is this  said the emperor to himself  i can see nothing  this is indeed a terrible affair  am i a simpleton or am i unfit to be an emperor  that would be the worst thing that could happenoh the cloth is charming said he aloud  it has my complete approbation and he smiled most graciously and looked closely at the empty looms for on no account would lie say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much all his retinue now strained their eyes hoping to discover something on the looms but they could see no more than the others nevertheless they all exclaimed  oli how beautiful  and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material for the approaching procession magnificent charming  excellent  resounded on all sides and every one was uncommonly gay the euperor shared in the general satisfaction and presented the impostors with the ribbon of an order of knighthood to be worn in their buttonholes and the title of  gentlemen weavers the rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place and had sixteen lights burning so that every one might see how anxious they were to finish the emperors new suit they pretended to roll the cloth off the looms cut the air with their scissors  and sewed with needles without any thread in them 1 see  cried they at last  the emperors new clothes are ready  and now the emperor with all the grandees of his court came to the weavers  andl the rogues raised their arms as if in the act of holding something up sayings  here are your majestys trowsers here is the scarf here is the mantle  the whole suit is as light as a cobweb one might fancy one has nothing at all on when dressed in it that however is the great virtue of this delicate cloth  yes indeed  said all the courtiers although not one of them could see any thing of this exquisite manufacture  if your imperial majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes we will fit on the new suit in front of the lookingglass the emperor was accordingly undressed and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit the emperor turning round from side to side before the lookingglass h how splendid his majesty looks in his new clothes and how well they fit  every one cried out  what a design what colours  these are indeed royal robes   the canopy which is to be born over your majesty in the procession is waiting announced the chief master of the ceremonies  i am quite ready answered the emperor 1 do my new clothes fit well  asked he turning himself round again before the lookingglass in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit the lords of the bedchamber who were to carry his majestys train felt about ou the ground as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle and pretended to be carrying something for they would by no means betray anything like simplicity or unfitness for their office so now the emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession through the streets of his capital and all the people standing by and those at the windows cried out  oh how beautiful are our emperors new clothes  what a magnificent train there is to the mantle and how gracefully the scarf hangs  in short no one would allow that he could not see these muchadmired clothes because in doing so he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office certainly none of the emperors various suits had ever made so great an impression as these invisible ones but the emperor has nothing at all on  said a little child  listen to the voice of innocence  exclaimed his father and what the child had said was whispered from one to another  but he has nothing at all on  at last cried out all the people the emperor was vexed for he knew that the people were right but he thought the processionx must go on now and the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever to appear holding up a train although in reality there was no train to hold,unmarked_contra

B7993,['6746108'],  the sineater and other tales by fiona macleod edinburgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss macleod is the first writer who has tried nativdy to interpret the gael not of the scottish highlands but of the islands te southern readers and for sheer originality other qualities apart her tales in this volume are as remarkable perhaps as anything we have had of the kind since mr kipling appeared they are so original  in fact they treat of so strange a subjectmatter and in so strange a way that the unregenerate saxon may find them at first a little difficult on a further acquaintance he will find that their local colour their idiom their whole method combine to produoe an effect whioh may be unaccustomed but is therefore the more irresistible 44 why asks miss madeod in her dedicatory epistle to mr george meredith why do i write these things  it is because i wish to say to you and to all who may read this book that in what i have said lies the secret of the gad the beauty of the world the pathos of life the gloom the spiritual glamour it is out of these the heritanoe of tiie gad that i have wrought these tales this dearly commits the writer to the romantic method that we find preserved in all these tales though they have here and there a touch of that realism which romance has never been entirely withoutceltic romance especially the first of them the sineater is a capital example in its romantic kind you feel in reading it that the talewriter has not gone to her subjectmatter as a purely disinterested agent on the contrary she brings her passionate predilections instead of being disinterested she is perfervidly interested she goes prepared to find the things that count oeltically speaking and she finds themthe gloom the spiritual glamour and the rest tomorrow some new realist will go over the same ground and bring back his very different report of things as they really are and tell us what queer kind of porridge he saw the achannas eat but miss madeod being to the manner born writes from the inside and not from the outride is affected through her imagination and not through her nerves and is sometimes so carried away by her subject that she forgets how suburban the modern reader is apt to be and how he likes his sealions caged and labelled and his peatsmoke described in terms of fleetstreet not only does she forget this she deliberately does all she can to inorease the sea terror the wildness and the gaelic savour of her tales the sineater begins with the wet wind and the sea mist of the western ides and ends with the wild cry of the man neil ross as he goes down in the  black eddy  that rushes between skerrymohr and skerrybeag an eirig rn anama  in ransom for my soul all through it one hears the seanoises and feels the seawind and the sineater is treated in bold accord with such elemental circumstance half man half myth he is the scapegoat of the sea he bears the sins of others but with no scapegoats innocence therein lies the motive which is treated in this tale with so much force at last he makes his seaexit on a spar that is like the cross nay in the words of aulay maoneill who tells his end  it was the cross he was on i saw that thing with the fear upon me ah poor drifting wreck that he was judas on the cross it was his eric still more strange and from an english point of view more simply and artistically constructed and written is  the dannanron perhaps the finest thing in the book   you know what is said in the ides about    about this or that man who is under jheasan  who is spellbound    and    about the seals and    says marcus aohanna to anne the heroine of this strange tale   they say that seals he repeated slowly they say that seals are men under magic spells here we have suggested a fine dramatic motive at the threshold of an old gaelic folktale and miss madeod uses her opportunity with singular control of the magic machinery of an uncanny subject the figure of gloom aohanna who plays the tune of the dannanron on his feadan an oatenpipe or flute is one not easily forgotten he lives with unreal reality in ones mind his wild tunes hold ones ear though they are described with characteristic celtic exaggeration by indirection by colour instead of musio as eg  again gloom took up the feadan and sent a few cold white notes floating through the hot room breaking suddenly into the wild fantastic opening air of the dannanron a few pages further and we come upon manuss song which with the description that follows may be given as an instance of miss macleods writing of both verse and prose  the tide was dark an heavy with the burden that it bore i heard it tal kin whisperinupon the weedy shore each wave that stirred the seaweed was like a closing door tis dosing doors they hear at last who hear no more no more my grief no more 44 the white seawaves were wan and grey its ashy lips before the yeast within its ravening mouth was red with streamy gore 0 red seaweed o red seawaves 0 hollow baffled roar since one thou hast 0 dark dim sea why cauest thou for more my grief for more p  in the quiet moonlight the chant with its long slow cadences sung as no other man in the isles could sing it sounded sweet and remote beyond words to tell the glittering shine was upon the water of the haven and moved in waving lines of fire along the stone ledges sometimes a fish rose and split a ripple of pde gold or a seanettle swam to the surface and turned its blue or greenish globe of living jelly to the moon dazzle there is some excess of mere colour it maj be thought in all this but that too is very celtic and so throughout these tales the manner of their telling their idiom their very mannerisms only tend to increase their total effect to quote again from their tellers singular opening epistle from iona addressed to him whom she calls  prince of celtdom  they have been written  as by one who repeats with curious insistence a haunting familiar yet ever wild and remote air whose obscure meanings he would fain reiterate interpret it is only by insisting as she does with some romantic excess on the vivid traits and idioms of the remote gaelic folk she describes that she brings home to us their speech sentiment and spirit of life as the true interpreter may she expressly disavows the documentary method at the start she is subjective and interpretative to a degree she is often so much moved by her own subject matter that heines famous confession of overmuch sentiment iu his buch le grand is apt to recur as one reads her

it is not what the lexaminer calls it mrs norton possesses a great deal of descriptive power and much pathos her writings are always pleasant to read  she appeals strongly to our sympathies and her composition is remarkable for a certain glow of eloquence felt though it cannot be described but she is not peerless on the contrary she has many superiors she is defective in the two most important features of the great novelistshe cannot create characters nor can she construct an ingenious plot unlike most writers of fiction mrs norton has given us in stuart of dunleath a very uninteresting hero and in eleanoit a very interesting heroine the former is intended to portray a mind infirm of purpose but instead of that we have an inconsistent personage the distinction wtill be obvliots to

from the beginning to the end and perfectly in keeping always with her original type we pursue her through all her varied fortunes her first affections their blight her subsequent marriage and misery her maternal joys and sorrows so intense and fatal with a syimpathy that never for a moment fails and which sustains the attention breathlessly through the work until it is concluded and we lay it down with more inclination to weep for the early dead than to rejoice in the happiness of the living we will not give an inkling of the story of this novel for we remember how often our own pleasure in the perusal has been marred by the imperfect revelations of a review presenting just enough to destroy surprise and curiosityimportant ingredients in the pleasure of novel reading without those details which serve to make the story amusing nor is there any greater injustice to the author than such a manner of noticing a novel for it is impossible not to defoim the plot lvy such a

the black sea and of a pilgrimage to jerusalem it differs markedly from most books of travel however in that the author is less concerned with the things seen along the line of route than with his own spiritual emotions and experiences as he himself says it is not so much a book about russia as about the tramp mr graham is among those who find salvation by going out into the wilderness he reminds one at times of thoreau there is the same impatience with the meaningless restraints of civilisation the same wild exuberant delight in the freedom of nature but whereas thoreaus withdrawal from the world had bred in him a certain scorn of humanity mr graham is overflowing with the milk of human kindness he finds friends everywhereamong the peasants of the russian steppes in eastern monasteries or turkish bazaars thoreau was alike by conviction and temperament a pagan the tone and temper of mr grahams book on the other hand are those of the christian so one is not surprised at the note of blitheness that runs through these pages often footsore the wanderer is never weary the world is full of unexpected delights there is the joy of the road the feeling of exhilaration that comes upon a man as he shoulders his knapsack and sets forth bravely into the unknown and there are quiet restingplaces at the journeys end sunrise and sunset the sound of the sea the music of birds darkness and the coming of dawnthese things become invested with a new meaning to the man who has gone out into the wilderness to find his soul he has time too to thinkand to pray and prayer mr graham would have us believe has an added effectiveness when offered amidst the silences of nature    prayers he writes are strong out of doors made in the presence of all the stars one is compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses there is calm all around and in ones own heart the mysterous beauty of the starry sky reflects itself in the soul and across its mirror sails the pale moon my own body becomes a

life on the open road or as a powerful appeal to the modern world to forsake the worship of the golden calf the authors tramp was along the caucasian and crimean shores of the black sea and eventually to the heavenly city in the company of russian pilgrims his pen paints delicate little portraits of the simple and loveable russian peasant it describes too with striking vividness nights spent in strange cities and in lonely shacks i slept with the bare world as my house the sky as my roof and god as host he writes and lest an incautious reader should exclaim  how lovely we hasten to add that like the apostle paul mr graham was often in perils of waters in perils in the city and constantly in weariness and painfulness but the author expressly states that his book is more concerned with the tramp than with russia  it is the life of the wanderer and seeker the walking hermit the rebel against modern conditions and commercialism who has gone out into the wilderness commercialism he says is at present the great enemy of the individual man and the only hope for salvation is first of all for a few to live their lives out to the full in order that all others may live their lives completely mr graham seems conscious as he writes that he is a prophet crying in the wilderness and even if some of his readers may consider that he is imagining a vain thing they will be constrained to admit that the pursuit of this ideal has one great merit so far as mr graham is concernedthe delightful record of his vagabondage  a tramps sketches by stephen graham macmillan and co this is another volume by the author of undiscovered russia a charming tour of a tramp a real tramps life along the caucasian and crimean shores mr stephen graham admits frankly that he is a wanderer by predilection a rebel

great silences of expanse and yet full of incident of aperfus into russian conditions and the minds of peasants revealing a real spiritual and material sympathy both with the black earth and the monks of monasteries whose hospitality he enjoyed and with his fellowcomrades of the road it is life that interests the author here we can get it and it is like splashing about in a clear pool on a warm

a good turn with some readers to say that the preliminary chapters give no adequate idea of the writers powers a story of the times and struggles of young italy the incidents are stirring and picturesque enough but the real interest centres in the  gadfly a notorious conspirator and scathing pamphleteer and still more in his embodiment of the claims of humanity as against the claims made by the church for a crucified god it is a hysterical book but we own it is so chiefly because the gadfly  is hysterical by the writers intention he is one of those who gain a tremendous influence over their fellows for this strong reason among others that their point of view is personal that the circumstances and the friends of their own private life rule their attitude of love or defiance to the general world such men and womenthe women are many of course are vivider than others and impress their contemporaries though they are often unjust and unreasonable the writer seems to be haunted by a sense of the punishment for sin and weakness allotted to mortals the  gadfly for the overtrust the oversensitiveness of his youth is tortured ever after wounded maimed letrayed forced to fight against the being he loves best on earthhis father the great churchman his father for an early sin expiated by a long life of repentance selfdenial and benevolence has virtually to condemn his own son to death in the end just at the moment when he has come back from the dead to him there is too much torture mental and physical in the book and all the scenes do not convince us we believe the cardinal died of a broken heart but he who upheld the dignity of the church so long who chose its interests and the true safety of his flock before the life of his beloved son did not break out into that hysterical raving on corpus christi day what is altogether real and admirable is the personality of the bitter biting mocking suffering 1 gadfly untameable unrelenting and always  game a living man that will force the most unwilling readers sympathy as he wvon that of the men and women he worked with so discomfortably and with such splendid loyalty  thc gadfiy by e l voynich heine mann the strength of this book lies in the terrible tragedy underlying its plot arthur at the commencement of the story is found devotedly attached to his father confessor montanelli the lad is a student at the university of pisa and the reputed son of an angloitalian merchant at leghorn his friend is the director of a theological seminary and has earned a high reputation in the mission field of c iii na enthusiastic and nervous arthur has been inspired with the fervour of italian aspirations which preceded the mazzinian efforts of 1846 deeply religious he has endeavoured to combine this enthusiasm of democracy with his traditional faith and the confessor temporises with the conflict of emotions in his pupil poor arthur henceforth the gadfly is first physically crushed by severe imprisonment for partaking in the revolutionary movement and then spiritually scared by the discovery that the saintly montanelli is in fact his natural father he breaks at once with his supposed relatives the curiously philistine english merchants who tolerated him and suppressed their knowledge of his origin until his revolutionary escapade and betakes himself to south america whence after terrible privations he emerges thirteen years later to take a militant part against all foreigners and clericals arthur in his ingenuous stage is a little deficient in manliness on his return as a casehardened adventurer he falls into the bloodthirsty methods of an originally weak nature embittered yet the conflict of feeling in him his love for his father in spite of his vindictive opposition to him his easy reassertion of his influence over gemma the love of his youth who has married his rival and been widowed during his exile the contrast between his political ferocity and his tenderness to children and other weaklings make him a rarely interesting figure even more so is the successful prelate and lifelong penitent montanelli the relations and conversations between the two when the cardinal finds his son again in the wounded and defeated conspirator to whose death he is in a manner forced to consent on grounds of public safety though this incident is hardly supported by sufficient necessity are treated with a masterly if almost too ghastly wealth of detail and the deaths of the unhappy pair are infinitely dramatic though the interest is concentrated in the hapless father and son many of the minor characters like the patient conspirator gemma and her selfeffacing lover martini are sketched with pains  reviews the gadfly by e l voynich w heinemann i this is a remarkable story by an american writer which readers who prefer flesh and blood and human emotions to sawdust and adventure should consider as something of a godsend in order to give an idea of the book the outline of the plot must be told arthur burton an orphan a sensitive affectionate emotional enthusiastic youth of eighteenrevolutionary and pietist in one is arrested on a true charge of conspiring against the italian government and is thrown into prison he admits nothing denies all knowledge of his companions and completely baffles the authorities on gaining his release he discovers that the information for his arrest was communicated by the priest to whom he had confessed his jealousy of a fellow conspirator almost immediately afterwards gemma arthurs ideal of womanhood believing him to be a traitor to the cause to which she also belongs strikes him across the face and repulses him for ever and his guardians wife in a fit of rage at the discredit she considers him to have brought upon the family lets out the secret that he is the son of an illicit union between his mother and canon montanelli a good man and arthurs dearest friend these three blows coming one upon the other with such suddenness are too much arthurs faith in god and man crumbles away he seizes a hammer and smashes his crucifix spurns montanelli arranges a convincing story of his suiride by drowning and escapes for south america as a stowaway that is the prologue thirteen years pass and arthur returns as felice rivarez another monte cristo bent upon revengea cripple and a cynic gifted with great power of satire an avowed disbeliever in human fidelity aud truth and the implacable foe of priestcraft and religion under the soubriquet of the gadfly he is employed by the liberal party to carry on a pamphlet war against the jesuits gemma is a member of the committee from whom he receives his instructions montanelli who is now a cardinal is the opponent whose influence it is most important to break down the core of the story is the gadflys struggle between his true nature and his imposed nature between his love for his father montanelli and for gemma and his hostility to christianity it is unnecessary to follow his career as a conspirator let it suffice that in the end he is captured and sentenced to death cardinal montanelli alone stands between him and the grave a terrible scene takes place in the condemned mans cell resulting in the gadfly confession that he is the arthur of old the cardinals son 44 montanelli sat like some stone image or like a dead man set upright at first under the fiery torrent of the gadflys despair he had quivered a little with the automatic shrinking of the flesh as under the lash of a whip but now he was quito still after a long silence he looked up and spoke lifelessly patiently 4 arthur will you explain to me more clearly p you confuse and terrify me so i cant understand what is it you demand of me  the gadfly turned to him a spectral face 41 demand nothing who shall compd love p you are free to choose between us two the one who is most dear to you if you love him best choose him 41 cant understand montanelli repeated

you than ithen go to the colonel and tell him you consent and if you go then go at once and spare me the misery of seeing you i have enough without that montanelli looked up trembling faintly he was beginning to understand 41 will communicate with your friends of oourse butto go with youit is impossible i am a priest 4 and i accept no favours from priests i will have no more compromises padre i have had enough of them and of their consequences you must give up your priesthood or you must give up me 4 how can i give you up p arthur how oan i give you up p 4 then give up him you have to choose

gadfly is shot this is the scene on the ground of execution  he had repeated the request that his eyes might not be bandaged and his defiant face had wrung from the colond a reluctant consent they had both forgotten what they were inflicting on the soldiers he stood and faced them smiling and the carbines shook in their hands 41 am quite ready he said the lieutenant stepped forward trembling a little with excitement he had never given the word of command for an execution before 4 readypresentfire  the gadfly staggered a little and recovered his balance one unsteady shot had grazed his oheek and a little blood fell on to the white cravat another ball had struck him above the knee when the smoke cleared away the soldiers looked and saw him smiling still and wiping the blood from his cheek with the mutilated hand 4 a bad shot men he said and his voice cut in clear and articulate upon the dazed stupor of the wretched soldiers  have another try a general groan and shudder passed through the row of carabineers eaoh man had aimed aside with a secret hope that the deathshot would come from his ndghbours hand not his and then the gadfly stood and smiled at them they had only turned the execution into a butchery and the whole ghastly business was to do again they were seized with sudden terror and lowering their carbines listened hopelessly to the furious curses and reproaches of the officers staring in dull horror at the man whom they had killed and who somehow was not dead the governor shook his fist in their faces savagely shouting to them to stand in position to present arms to make haste and get the thing over he had become as thoroughly demoralised as they were and dared not look at the terrible figure that stood and stood and would not fall when the gadfly spoke to him he stahed and shuddered at the sound of the mocking voice 4 you have brought out the awkward squad this morning colonel let me see if i can manage them better now men hold your tool higher there you to the left bless your heart man its a carbine youve got in your hand not a fryingpan are you all straight p now then  readypresent  4 fire  the colonel interrupted starting forward it was intolerable that this man should give the command for his own death there was another confused disorganised volley and the line broke up into a knot of shivering figures staring befor them with wild eyes one of the soldiers had not even dischargedhis carbine hehad flung it away and crouched down moaning under his breath 41 cant1 cant the smoke cleared dowly away floating up into the glimmer of the early sunlight and they saw that the gadfly had fallen and saw too that he was still not dead for the first moment soldiers and offioials stood as if they had been turned to stone and watched the ghastly thing that writhed and struggled on the ground then both doctor and colond rushed forward with a cry for he had dragged himself up on one knee and was still facing the soldiers and still laughing 4 another miss tryagain ladsseeif you cant he suddenly swayed and fell over rideways on the grass 4 is he dead p the oolonel asked under his breath and the doctor kneeling down with a hand on the bloody shirt answered softly 41 think so god be praised 4 god be praised  the colond repeated 4 at last  these quotations bear rather upon the dramatic value of the book than upon its psychology its psychology is as it happens not impressive mr voynich can conceive interesting characters but at present he lacks the power to embody them adequately his imaginative force is in advance of his execution the end of the book where action predominates is better than the earlier chapters where conversation has to bear the brunt of the work mr voynich has no gift of flashing insight he tells us much of the gadflys wit but we meet with little worthy the name the book needs to be more tensemore well more meredithian vittoria was ever before me as i read the fabric of the gadfly is so good that some day mr voynich might rewrite the story but as it stands it is more deeply interesting and rich in promise than ninetynine out of every hundred novels that pass through the reviewers

B5242,"['8774297', '8943685', '3211357']",  the works pf george peele tj11 t a   edited by a h xuuen ua 2 vols nimmo after the labour involved in his edition of middleton mr bullen must have found the preparation of the new edition of feele almost a holiday task not that the text of peel offers little difficulty to an editor it is on the contrary in places so hopelessly corrupt that conjecture is baffled and the plays have to be left to speak for themselves in one case indeed that of peeles scriptural drama  david and bethsabe the only conclusion to be adopted is that entire scenes have dropped out not even in the case of a bible story could an author leave to the memory or the imagination of an audience so much that is vital to his plot wherever the reader turns indeed difficulty besets him and the editor who undertook to turn the whole into sense and metre would find as wide a field for conjectural revelry as is often supplied practically most that could be done for peel was done by dyce to whom in the opening sentence of his introduction mr bullen pays full homage sixty years fully occupied with critical investigation have passed since the appearance of dyces edition of peele and in that time little has been turned up to disprove his assumptions or modify his theories new facts concerning peeles history have been dragged to light and of these mr bullen has naturally made use in the athenceum of july 2nd 1881 the new matter of most interest concerning peel which appears in this latest edition first saw the light it is there shown that george peele whom pavne collier confidently stated to be the son of stephen peele a bookseller and a balladwriter was in fact the son of james peele clerk of christs hospital where the dramatist was educated successive advances towards george peeles education are chronicled in the court book as is the easily understood order to the clerk  to discharge bis howse of his son george peel   before mychelmas day next cominge vppon paine of the gounos displeasure the passages concerning this relationship constitute the most important addition to the new peele though mr bullens indefatigable search has been rewarded with other discoveries in the editorial part of his task mr bullen has been aided by mr p a daniel through whose hands every proof and revise has passed mr daniels name is also of frequent appearance in the notes to the plays not seldom it is affixed to a conjectural interpretation or emendation other than that mr bullen adopts in the cases in which mr bullen departs most widely from dyce we are generally in accord with him the authority for assigning to peel  sir clyomon and sir clamydes is a ms note in a very old hand on the titlepage of the first edition of this play which attributes it to peele dyce says he has no doubt it is rightly so attributed though slow to differ from his predecessor mr bullen who has wisely included the play in his collection cannot but think that this drama is the work of some playwright of the older school mr bullens sound instinct has not deceived him it is extremely difficult to believe that this dull and rhetorical work is by the author of  david and bethsabe and the old wives tale it is true however that except some tricks of phrase the various works of peel have little in common if we took the standard of his best work and measured all by this the greater part of his luggage would have to be thrown overboard that standard is obtained in the old wives tale the arraignment of paris and in  david and bethsabe though concerning the play last named mr sullen who regards it as  exasperatingly insipida messof cloying sugar plums declares that he does not care two straws for it cloying no doubt much of it is and it is essentially undramatic but it has as much grace of thought and expression as any other play ascribed to peele the golden curls of moss that sleeps with sound the waters make is a conceit pretty enough for any writer of the period and the whole has a sort of eastern extravagance of language which peel rarely employs elsewhere and which was doubtless intended a beauty of ex pression similar in kind and equally modern in sound with that before quoted is encountered in  the arraignment of paris where our author speaks of yellow oxlips bright as burnished gold two other lines a little spenserean in sound which occur in the play are beautiful in themselves and curious as anticipating an expression of lord tennyson the lines are and round about the valley as ye pass ye may northeast see for peeping flowers the grass the resemblance between the second of these lines and that in  the two voices you scarce could see the grass for flowers gave milton some hints for comus it is more than probable  it is all but certain that milton took from this pleasing play not only some hints but the scheme of comus tocomparemiltons work with that of his predecessor would of course be futile from whatever source milton took son bien he made it his own the resemblance is not however confined to the points which have been frequently indicatedthe two brothers the sister who is lost the necromancer who turns men into beasts cit extends even to expressions the very phraseology of  comus is to a certain extent taken from  the old wives tale traces of imitation moreover on the part of milton though they are most obvious in this instance are not confined to this play vigorous passages are less common in peel than in other dramatists of his epoch but such even are to be found and peel is occasionally touched by the  fine fury  which is the distinguishing attribute of the elizabethan drama in his less careful work he is slovenly in the highest degree the rhymes are at times scarcely more than assonance some ingenuity is necessary to find the rhyme between  beauty and excellency similar instances abound to force however as is done at the opening of sir clyomon and sir clamydes environ to rhyme to  ocean  may be regarded as a masterstroke as the play is of dubious authority peele who has enough to answer for without it may escape the responsibility for this in the lyrics inserted in his plays supposing them to be his he shows himself at his best  cupids curse in thearraignment of paris is an exquisite ditty it is pleasant too to find that the credit of the fine sonnet  his golden locks time hath to silver turned which has been attributed to the earl of essex belongs to peele with the plays mr bullen gives the poems and other works of peele including the jests of george peele to some portions of these mr bullen assigns a quasiautobiographical flavour in this he is probably right the jests themselves however are the common property of renaissance storytellers some of them doubtless are as mr saintsbury states assignable to the  eepues franches of villon jestbooks however in all times have been the same and a careful search by a competent scholar would probably assign some of the stories a more than respectable antiquity in getup the volumes are worthy of the series to which they belong and editor and publisher are to be thanked for a muchneeded contribution to dramatic literature facsimiles of mss of interest are given and the miniature title of the unique  tale of troy is copied it is pleasant to find mr bullen continuing work for which he has such a special capacity  the works of george meredith memorial edition vols ivl constable  co this memorial edition of merediths works is a pleasant compromise between the rival claims of stateliness and use for the greater part of its life a book is an article of furniture and stands upon the shelf to decorate the library with its patch of colour and glow of kindly associations  but from time to time there occur those crises of its existence when it is taken down and read books are as a rule designed primarily to meet these crises and meredith is in a peculiar degree an author whose significance is only to be discerned by reading him dickens thackeray george eliot delightful as they are can all be if we choose to make them so delightful memories and so clear are they in their place as to be intelligible almost at secondhand but meredith is still side by side with us as a name on the shelf he is an enigma and there is no choice between living familiarity with him and vexed confusion on this account he does not readily lend himself to the statuesque habiliments of a  library  edition which too often destines the author to be ranked in monumental impressiveness remaining mute yet a memorial edition would not fulfil its object if it were not monumental in appearance  and the twenty and more volumes which the edition before us is to comprise though a little large for comfort have an appropriate dignity which is pleasantly emphasised by their sober green attire they are novels and a novel is a book to be read in relaxation  one hand ought to be enough for it these really require two on the other side it may be said that this edition is illustrated and illustrations are mostly not worth looking at unless they are of a certain size while the clear type is relieved by a margin neither too narrow nor too broad we have in fact a page printed on sound paper free from eccentricities and asking not to be stared at but to be read the illustrations are certainly an interesting feature it is a pity that the open ing portrait has such a misty look  a new view of meredith is presented in it his piercing and soaring activity of mind  which is more familiar  yielding under the touch of age to a quality of clear introspection mixed with meditative sadness the photographs of various houses in which he lived or worked or scenes familiar to him and to the characters in his novels are tastefully done and though placed somewhat at random in the text suggestive in their degree charles keenes dxawings for  evan harrington of which five are reproduced will as time goes on become increasingly valuable as illustrations apart from their native character and charm the picture of evan wearing his tall hat in the greenhouse while his ladylove her hair neatly netted upon her neck honours him with the present of a rose it is a critical moment in their romance recalls to us better than a volume of history the public and the mind of the public which meredith originally addressed and which as was very natural only accorded him a qualified appreciation  the works of george meredith 17 vols 6s each constable to fall back on a wellworn phrase there is nothing cheap about this  standard edition  of

B3082,['8818706'],  new novels the heavenly twins by sarah grand 3 vols heinemann  the heavenly twins  is one of those books which it is difficult to criticise satisfactorily for in spite of its chaotic and haphazard arrangement and its unsatisfactory ending it is so full of interest and the characters are so eccentrically humorous yet true that one feels inclined to pardon all its faults and give oneself up to unreserved enjoyment of it the author is a lady who in the flippant words of the oxford magazine has come to believe in the mission of woman to civilise man to teach him to know his position and to estimate hers if he can but her ideas on the subject are dreadfully vague and though she gives some interesting cases of women who attempt the problem of readjusting the relations of the sexes their efforts are not crowned with much success there is indeed a shadowy personage called ideala who has organised a mysterious society for this purpose and for though propagation of a new religion and who it is hinted has obtained a solution of the difficulties but her utterances are too rare and dark to be intelligible the heavenly twins has been compared in a contemporary journal to 4 the story of an african farm the comparison is just inasmuch as both authors express a bitter sense of revolt against existing social arrangements both have a theory that to woman is reserved the future salvation of the world without any definite conception of how she is to accomplish it and in both books the intensity of feeling and the wealth of imagination are so great that the story is overburdened with a plethora of material which might with advantage have been distributed over several novels in this book there are at least two stories that of the heavenly twins which gives the book its title and that of evadne the wife who was no wife the twins angelica and diavolo young barbarians utterly devoid of ali respect conventionality or decency are among the most delightful and amusing children in fiction the conception of twosuch little monsters and the frank description of the superfluity of their naughtiness without encroachment on the domains of the improbable would alone have been remarkable  but to have made them at the same time lovable and to have related their unconventional escapades with the delicacy and good taste of  sarah grand shows something more than mere cleverness in the story of evadne which is really quite unconnected with the other except from the accident that evadne happened to know the twins the author has surmounted a great difficulty with success evadnes story is briefly this she is a thoughtful and clever girl of strong will who marries a man thinking him to be all that is good and noble on her wedding day she discovers that his character has been that of a  man of pleasure and she only consents to stay with him on the condition that they shall not live in the relations of husband and wife in spite of all protests from her parents and her friends and though it is represented to her that she might be the means of elevating him and she never swerves from her determination the difficulty lies not in making the reader intellectually approve of her position  the natural tendency would be theoretically to justify such a character but to regard her as almost repulsively cold and heartless especially as tne husband loyally abides by the arrangement and is represented as rather gentlemanly and pleasant than otherwise but in so vividly describing the state of her mind and the womanliness of her nature that the only feeling of the reader is sympathy and pity for her and this sarah grand has done she has created a true and delicate woman not a strongminded female made up of cold abstractions whom one instinctively thinks of ns wearing pincenez and short hair considerations of space permit us to notice one more point only in this bookthe quiet humour with which the author describes the characters she has the inestimable merit of hardly ever obtruding her personal views of them on the reader who is allowed to discover their peculiarities for himself gradually as if he were living with them this is especially the case with some of the minor characters mr hamilton wells for example the submissive father who makes tea and talks crude platitudes appears at first as if he were merely an insignificant bore  and that is how he would strike a stranger but closer acquaintance with him reveals the fact that he is a humourist of a high order and that the seeming platitudes are generally very much to the point in case another edition is printed it may be mentioned that either the author or the printer is shaky in french witness ilya deslonguers par envy dattaquer and the maxim given as  chercher la femme,unmarked_contra

of the mormons at home and certain as the sale of any fair account of these strange people would be we have received nothing beyond surface views or wretched caricatures yet when the war closes finally we know scarcely any topic likely to engage the hearts of good and thoughtful sersons more deeply than this question of lormon life its moral nature its mode of action and its share of success the mormons  who are nearly to a man and woman of anglosaxon bloodhave departed from the midst of us and set up a new system in the depths of the wildernessshaking off our laws our customs our letters and our god these extraordinary people have made for themselves a new scheme of life based on new ideas all of them contrary to our oldworld wisdom and some of them most repugnant to our domestic instincts can the new scheme work  while the mormons were merely a theological sectliving by the light of those social laws which are common to all european nations they excited interest by their passions their tenacity and their despair but the interests of this world are stronger in many minds than the interests of the world to come our curiosity about the saints has deepened a thousand times since it became noised abroad that these people who only yesterday as it were sailed from our shores leaving mothers and sisters in the old land have returned in the depths of the american wilderness to the eastern system of many wives at first europe was incredulous on this subject of polygamy however wide its usage in the east however high its sanction in the past a home of many wives was thought to be repugnant to anglosaxon nature and was pronounced impossible with anglosaxon women doubts also aroseand some of those doubts remainas to the real meaning of the mormon act of  sealing  several women to one man wedlock in the common use of words cannot be always meant by this act as we hear of poor aged and decrepit females being sealed to young and prosperous mormon saints sealing may confer some very pleasant and very substantial earthly rights but its chief function as the people who practice it seem to believe is a spiritual one like baptism or confirmation it appears to be taught in the mormon churches that a woman cannot be saved unless she be first sealed to one of the mormon saints thus sealing becomes a needful sacrament in the mormon system the observance is an act of grace and a probation for heaven yet when the cases of spiritual wifehood are allowed for on a liberal scale the fact remains unquestioned and unquestionable that in salt latte city a great number of men of our race and blood nearly all who can afford the costdo marry several wiveslive with them in the old patriarchal fashionand have children by them according to the rights and usages of our old world ways it is a strange and an exciting fact to discover in the middle of the nineteenth century in the very centre of the territory of the great republic and among the least imaginative people in existence we want to know how this system works do the wives live in oriental union or do they quarrel like kilkenny cats  do the husbands live in peace in their western harems in health and freedom  are the homes clean and cosy the children well trained and obedient such questions occur to the mind even before the other and higher questions about faith and salvation but unhappily we have no answer at least none that we can trustto these deeplyexciting queries mrs ferris whose book we opened with expectation is evidently not a fair witness and her letters are four years old she had good opportunities she accompanied her husband who had received an appointment as united states secretary for utah to the salt lake city she remained in the valley of the salt lake six months living on familiar terms with the mormons both men and women but then she carried her foregone conclusions with her before she and her husband reached the mormon settlements she had condemned the mormons in her heart that mrs ferris who prides herself on having played the fine lady in the prairie is not a very philosophical observeris not very nice in her mannersis not very delicate in her feelings every page of this odd book bears witness but as she professes to state what she saw and heard among the mormons we must take her with her faults and make the best we can of her evidence with all its drawbacks of vanity inconsequence and ill taste here is a note written from salt lake which may serve very well as a keynote for our quotations  we have made one disagreeable discovery polygamy is not only practised but openly justified and advocated on religious grounds   wc are unquestionably in the midst of a society of fanatics who are controlled by a gang of licentious villains and it will require all our circumspection to get along smoothly   that we are closely watched i ain well persuaded the very day arter we arrived while wholly absorbed in reading the news from home i was suddenly startled by a pair or eyes glaring in at the west windowbelonging to amaliguant looking man who was engnged in training some vines on that side of the house of course he desisted when he found himself observed but i detected him afterwards repeating the same thing in a very furtive manner if this man has not committed murder it has been for want of opportunity nothing is ever proved against the poor vinetrainer he does his work and goes his way but he gets deeper and deeper in the ill opinion of his judge the lady at whose house mrs ferris had been good enough to take up her abode is judged after the same fashion as the vinedresser  mrs farnham is a good mormon in all points except that she is bitterly opposed to polygamy but this may be only pretence to render us unguarded she may after all be as much a spy upon us as the cutthroat who gazed in at the window as mrs ferris wisely sent her pretty criticisms on her new friends through the mormon postoffice to her friends in new york and elsewhere and probably uttered much smalltalk in the same lively style at mrs farnhams table the reader will scarcely feel surprised that the saints began to look shy at the fair judge of their misdeeds but the saints were not very reserved either if we may believe their censor  i find the women very conversable she says  we were treated with distinguished attention  the company generally seemed to exert themselves to make the evening pleasant to us she says on another occasion mrs ferris we are afraid was scarcely doing her best to make things pleasant to her hosts we proceed to show the reader mrs ferriss view of a mormon home  on the opposite side of the way directly west of us in a small adobe house resides phineas young a brother of the governor familiarly known however by the uncomplimentary designation of old phin this man called soon after our arrival and manifested a disposition to treat us with civility i learned from mrs farnham that he had had 6ome seven or eight wives that his first or real wife still lives in the states and that the others had all left him but one whether he had been reduced to this low number by necessity or inclination i do not know i further learntd that the present mrs phin desired to make my acquaintance so an evening was appointed and thiy both called we found him very sociable with much general information and full of anecdote of the roving life to which all thc mormons have been more or uss subjected isle had a great deal to say of gentile persecutionsa theme which i find them ready enough to talk about among other things he gave us a history of the privations to which those saints were subject who were the pioneers in the valley it seems they were driven nearly to the point of starvation and had to dig seejo roots  a root extensively used by the indians from which they have received the name of diggers he gave quite a graphic description of the destruction which threatened their first crops by the ravages of an ugly cricket until the ravagers were in turn destroyed by flocks of white gulls which came over the mountain topsa thing which he assured us had never before been seen mr f asked him where they came from that he said was a mysteryhe did not doubt they were created for the occasion the man is a jesuit after all while marvelling about these mysterious gulls i could see him slyly watching the effect the narrative might have upon his audience i found time to have some side chat with mrs phin and learned she had been previously married to a man by the name of canfield nnd that she had persuaded him to take her sister to whom the was much attached as his second wife thinking they could get along harmoniously canfield finally concluded that two were not enough and took in a third and then abused the two sisters isle then went off to californin searching for gold and came back emptyhanded upon which she left him and took refuge under the shadow of  old phin such is the substance of the story told by the woman herself leaving discreetly untold no doubt the most salient points of her history we have charitably supplied the italics being unwilling to allow the most careless reader to escape the proofs of mrs ferriss good taste and feminine acuteness another great personage among the mormons to whom we are introduced is elder snow  isle resides near us in the second house beyond brother wakemans with six wives in two little huts and has twelve children in the principal hut the real wife sits at the head of the table and pours out tea and coffee for the rest of the bevy the latest acquisition to this highlyfavoured household and of course the reigning sultana for the time was the only one of them with whom he condescended to correspond during his absence her education however had not attained the dignity of an ability to read and either because the other inmates of the harem were in like predicament or that she was uni willing they should see these loving epistles she took them to the neighbours to bo translated like all other mormon missionaries he was a beggar and i thc story is that he has been so successful in his mendicity that the cottages are to give place to a large adobe mansion which will make a more convenient seraglio such is elder snow and yet he could talk about the works of art in rome and paris with some apparent appreciation of their beauties like our other visitors he expressed a wish that our sojourn might be rendered agreeable but not a word of invitation to visit his family or that his wife would be happy to see me really we feel for mrs ferris she wished to see the ladies of the snow family in order to abuse to mock and to spit upon themand the elder who possibly saw as deeply into the ladys purpose as she saw into his character refrained from asking her to his home it was very provoking  ol when she gets a chance however with the mormon women we do mrs ferric the justice to say that she uses it well for example   a goodnatured young woman with a baby in her arms wnited upon nie she proved to be one of the wives of the young man  and by further inquiry i drew fort that they had both boca married to him at the same time so that neither could claim the  precedence you will ask whether such things can i be yes they can he with just such women she j  was one of those gnodnaurcd stupid fools that  t would gnlp down though most preposterous proposition   merely saying perhaps du tefl or  you dont  say so or making some similar remark i nm s quite ready to conclude that a large portion of female    mormonism is made up of similar mat rials j or to offer another example    among the frequent visitors at mrs farnhams isa tall and rather interetinglooking young woman who is known by though name of harriet cook she is  one of brighams early sealed ones by whom she has  i one child is quite goodlooking and superior iu  jt point of native smartness but exceedingly capricious  and variable in her feelings nnd conversation the  first time i saw her she seene 1 to have an oppressive  sense of her real condition  expressed herelt bitterly v of her ruin of thc abominations of the harem and   even of hatreil towards her child representing it as an j n ugly ungovernable little wrtch 1 felt much interest j for her i asked her why she did not go to california  j she answered sadly   litre i uni ns good as mary fi ann brighams fi rat wie and the rest of them  a but elsewhere i am an outcast my brother wishes  ti me togo but it is of no use today this woman  a has called again and i dont know when in a con sj venation wish one nf my own sex my digust has been g more strongly excited she launched forth into a  i sort of expose of the filth e customs of though harem in  h language so coarse and vulgar and with so much  e apparent gusto that al sympathy for her is at an  fi end and hen after i cmi only talk with her as with s some others merely to pain information she is a i fair specimen of the utter an i hopeless degradation  effected by the mormon svteni  and as she grows j older will doubtles take a malignant delight in  a aiding to seduce others ia  thc same unfortunate  v condition  the will doubtless hove is exquisite and  t hairiet cook is as certain to seduce foolish  i women as the nameless vinodresser is to nit   throats mis ferris is not very civil to the  l hardier sex when she rinds them giving way to j the seductions of their many wives father lee is one of the favourites over whom she throws the  lambent light of her mirth  j j  father lee io a good typo otuno of though elements  of mormonism  the nwt unbounded credulity  easily persuaded to perform as a duty that which  in civiiied lands would coninn the perpetrator to j the penitentiary or the scaffold to look at him  j sitting before m he docs not eem capable ol harm  ing an insectbut what assurance is there tl at he  would not put arsenic or strychnine in my food if  told by the prophet that it was bis duty to destroy   an enemy of the true faith  j yes indeed what we doubt whether father  lee can ofter her any assurance on that serious i subject i further on mrs ferris gets a small ray of j light on the vexed subject of female submission in the salt lake community i it has been a matter of great wonder tome how the women could be induced to con sent to polygamous mar j riages it is so repugnant to all the instincts and feel i ings of a true woman that i could not understand it i the mystery is p rt ly solved itseems that one part of  their ridiculous creed i that a woman cannot be j saved unless she is southeast del or married to a mormon and he must bc one too who will remain steadfast to the end and as they are noted for a great number of apostates it becomes an object with these sillyfools to get into the harems of the priests and elders because it is believed they will not apostatize of course any one with half an eye can see the object i of the prophet smith in promulgating such a doc  trine and the wonder is that its transparency is not obvious to all i made this discovery by talking with aunty shearer about an old lady by the name of westerncommonly known as mother western one of brighams wives i was marvelling why she should marry in her old age especially as fiftieth or sixtieth wife when my oracle said  she was only sealed for the sake of salvation she further informed me that brigham had more wives in this way than anybody knew ofthat he did not even i know himself the sealing to him being considered a  more certain guarantee for salvation because he was i the reigning prophet and was sure to remain faithful  one scarcely knows whether to be amazed most at though profane profligacy of the leaders or the super stitiotis credulity of their dupes the effect of the  mormon creed is evidently to gather together a low class of villains and a still lower class of dupes nnd it follows that the latter are easily governed though only disturbing element is that the viii dns may quarrel among themselves and so far as i can learn this has happened on more than one occasion  a further effect will probably be to operate as a j botany bay to society generally by relieving it of j its superabundance of both classes i among the pleasant people to be met with at salt lake was the family of mr haywood and  we sympathise in mrs ferriss astonishment at finding a lady with good taste in dress i married to a man with two other wives j among our agreeable visitors must be numbered i mr haywood the united states marshal and his j h first wife they called at an early period of our  f  arrival and have continued to trent us with atten ol  tive politeness she is as pretty wellinformed and iv i accomplished ns you will find anywhere in a thou  h  sand and exhibits withal what is not common here j st  good taste in dress after forming their acquaintance  0  i was surprised to learn from aunty shearer that he j n  had two other wives one known ns sister very old fi enough to be his mother and who in fact seems to o  fill that office in the family of course she was j d said to hi sealed for the sake of salvation mrs h ii and sister very called one day and 1 found the i a latter an agreeable quiet elderly lady from old j b  salem sufficiently well informed and everything  about her such as you would expect to find in a j h i woman of her age from the land of steady habits t j except in the single point of being the second of i v  two wives in the same family this is though only v  instance in which i have scon two wives of the same i   i man together and judging from appearances the     ago of tiie one precluded anything like jealousy on j s t the part of the other what jarring there may be between them at home i cannot tell i only know  that in my presence they treated each other with   that degree of affectionate cordiality which properly j  i belong to the intercourse between mother mid i 1 j daughter what a strange spectacle here was t i nn elderly woman apparently of fair intelligence  jl   and correct notions of propriety in whom the feel j t  i ings nnd instincts of womanhood may be supposed   1  to have become fixed and permanent habits of  i  i thought yielding all that is valuable to a ridiculous   system of imposturein other words becoming a  1   concubine i can no longer wonder that gills are j r i so easily made fools of  i like mrs ferris we must introduce the third  i wife of this terrible mr haywood into our gallery j of mormon female portraits and the reader will t  f  smile after the scornful closing of the above   passage to seethe sort of girl who had been   i made a fool of hy the saint speaking of the   i elderly lady from old salem and the young  i lady with  good taste in dress mrs ferris  j goes on rousing her virtuous indignation until   i it is assuaged by a small act of politeness j f j  if thc worthy marshal had stopped here i could e  tolerate him very well considering we are sojourners   in thc mormon capital but lie has still another wife and i learn from my universal referee that in the states she was one of the strong mindediu fine n pseudolecturer on progressivismwho was so fully persuaded that womankind were in a false position that sdie has ended in making herself what she t i is the marshal keeps her and her baby on his   farming establishment in juab about eighty miles t i from herc isle spends six weeks of his time there and then the same time with his family here and so alternates between the two today he has been in partly on business nnd partly to make a friendly call and i felt disposed to be hateful towards him but he appeared so cordial and friendly and gave us such warm and pressing invitations to visit his family differing in this respect from the rest of these vagabonds that he partially succeeded in disarming resentment mrs ferris went to the homes of the mormons and to their public parties as we think few of our readers have ever assisted at a mormon evening party we are tempted with their consent to introduce them into the charmed circle of the saints  we went sufficiently late not to be among the first arrivals and were ushered into an anteroom to be divested of cloaks and shawls from this a short flight of steps brought us into a long saloon where six cotillions were in active motion another short flight lauded us on a raised platform which overlooked the dancingparty and here a band of music were in thc full tide of performance this dais was well accommodated with seats including two or three sofas on which were elders and apostles reclining with a few of their concubines brigham was there and had his hat on according to his usual habit we were treated with distinguished attention the company generally seemed to exert themselves to make the evening pleasant to us our old acquaintance judge snow was there with mrs s his only wife and i took advantage of our familiar footing with both to inquire out all the peculiarities of the evening elder kimble one of the chief 1 men was present and very sociable he has a  harem numbering some twentyfive or thirty but j strange to say has continued to treat his real wife 1 so thc story goes as superior to the rest she was  at his right hand on the present occasion and looked careworn and sad  on his left was one of his sealed  ones a keen shrewdlooking woman from phila delphia and who in the few words of conversation i had with her evinced some intelligence near them j sat a delicate woman with raven hair and piercing  black eyes who proved to be eliza snow the  mormon poetess and who belongs to brighams harem polygamy cannot be a subject calculated to protluce pottic inspirationat least the effusions  which appear under her name in the deseret news would scare the muses out of their senses i found i mrs orson hyde a pleasant woman of much simplicity of manners and to her husbands credit bc it said ho lives with her alone although one of the twelve apostles another of the twelve amasa lyman was pointed out a man of grossly sensual appearance this man lives in san bernardino and has a straggling harem extending at convenient 1 points from that place to salt lake he collects the 1 tithings in california and is constantly going back  and forth a heavy darkcoloured beetlebrowed  man was pointed out as elder john taylor who had been badly wounded when the prophet was murdered  in illinois isle had his wile on one arm on the l other was a young widow from tennessee reputed to be wealthy and reputed also to have been lately  sealed to this pious elder the cotillions upon the i floor when we went in were soon danced out and the i  dancers came crowding upon the platformand here  i happened what seemed to me the crowning incident  i of the evening parley pratt marched up with four j wives and introduced them successively as mrs  j pratts the thing was done with such an easy 1  nonchalant air that i had difficulty in keeping from  laughing outright the thought came over me with   what scorn these people who are here first and i foremost would be banished from society at home i  did the man do this to show what he could do or i because lie thought politeness required it of him  j i dont know some however only introduced the first wife and i internally thanked them for the forbearance one thing was peculiarit was only the first wives that tried to make themselves familiar with me dancing continued fast and furious till a late hour each man danced with two women at a time and took the lead in all the chassis promenades so it seems that even in their amusements women take a subordinate position these passages will amuse the reader they are fresh and feminine and we are sorry that we cannot treat the volume from which we draw them as a serious book now that peace has returned to europe perhaps some vivid and vivacious

wife to put herself t to the trouble of preparing a supplementary volume and even the promise of revelations upon the exciting topic of polygamy scarcely disposes us to approach these pages with any other feeling than that of suspicion that tile publication of the book is dictated rather by womanly vanity than a real desire to supply any useful information however as everything respecting that interesting people possesses very great interest in our eyes we lhave carefully perused mrs ferriss journal in the hope of picking up one or two facts about tie mormons with which we were not previously familiar the party headed by lieutenant ferris started from st louis up the missouri on the 12th of august 1852 landing at fort wayne they proceeded to independanec and in a very few days were journeying westward across  the plains by the middle of october they begin to hear sometiling about the m1ormons we lave heard some not very encouraging stories about the mormons it is said tiev do reall plracticee polygamy and some of the traders we meet express regret that mr f has brought his wife along fearing it may lay the foumidation for the same difficulties that occurred with the former officers the story is that the wife of the frmer secretary was invited to a house where there were six women with young babies all belonging to one husband and that she took offence at it i

B3502,['6732133'],  sketches from my life by the late admiral hobart pasha longmans impsbfect as they are and too hastily written these sketches form a pleasing and not ungraceful memorial of one of the very few englishmen of our day who born to rank interest and promotion have chosen to defy and successfully defy british prejudices social professional and political augustus hobart at sixtyfour was hardly likely to i betray the diffuse wrongheadedness of youth 1 or the effete garrulity of age middle life is 1 not the autobiographical epoch he was not looking back upon a closed career but like a busy man of affairs just utilised the enforced leisure of the sickroom to jot down a few reminiscences in his own plain modest yet confident manner his last words were as characteristic of himself as they are affecting now to all who mourn him  if i bring these pages to a somewhat abrupt conclusion it is because i have had the bad luck to get a chill out shooting and have been somewhat seriously ill however i have hope that there is  lifo in the old dog yet and that i may before long have some other adventures of a similar description to add to these 4 unvarnished sketches of my life and this was written in the last stage of a hopeless illness a few days before that death whose approach he sturdily refused to recognise nor was such fortitude the outcome of a rough coarse nature for we cannot too highly praise his delicate reticence and forbearance he suppresses the names of his private enemies the very names of their ships are so faintly indicated by initials that only the experts whom it may concern will trouble to track them out he has not studied in the new school of posthumous calumny and testamentary libel een in their ashes live their wonted fireswho launching greek fire and stinkpots from behind the tomb would tempt us to misread the old maxim as de superstitibus nil nisi bonum and revising solon to cry  call no man formidable till his death in his scramble through life hobart jostled against many a knave and many a fool who deserved exposure but seemingly he felt that each has a little followingif only one or twoof harmless believers who love nnd admire him for such measure of good as unseen of the world is in him and who must needs weep to see their idol stripped and mocked he passes lightly over his somewhat neglected childhood and first three years at sea under a bad captain that a man of rank and breeding should illtreat a child of twelvea relative confided to his careso barbarously ought to be but is not incredible the wretch belonged to a type nearly extinct he was a handsome young man with fine features darkened however by a deep scowlthe old type of the essentially wicked man no one is unaffectedly wicked nowadays because no one enjoys such despotic power as those captains of the old school when engaged in the suppression of the slave trade young hobart witnessed an instance p 22 of that unscrupulous and insolent naval policy which made our ships too often a byword in this case a sanguinary encounter and fatal eas us belli was averted by the humane surrender of his rights by the french commander the passage is too long for quotation hobart took part in the expedition to paraguay in 1839 and praises highly perhaps undulythe order and prosperity of the jesuit rule before we murdered paraguay among other victims by our precious liberating policy of slaverhunting and the great emancipation bubble hobart writes with distressing candour and highly improper veracity as a philanthropic and deservedly selfsatisfied nation we objeot to be reminded that philanthropy itself invented the slavetrade  or that the worst plantation was a heaven compared to the hell of cannibal africa or that the horrors of the slave ship 3 were entirely due to our interference or about the spies in our pay and the wholesale corruption we encouraged  or that after all we simply stole the slaves ourselves from their purchasers and enslaved them to work seven years for us in demerara and then by emancipation opened to them or such as survived the glorious vista of vice want and degradation such remarks are most true most imprudent most impertinent and should be put down for the baleful reign of philanthropythat thirsty vampire which has long brooded over the sleep of humanity has not yet passed away and simple truth is still blasphemy hobarts interviews with antonelli and pio nono chap viii contribute something to the history of the popes flight to gaeta more important is the authors justification of his seizure of the enossis at syra a leading case in the law of blockade here hobart is probably right upon a point where england has usually taken too moderate a view of her rights of the blockaderunning adventures we will only say they are exciting and racy had marryat practised the sport he would have described it not much better nor will we venture out of our depth to criticise the authors remarks on military and naval tactics turk and russian or his mockery of torpedoes one story however is as curious as it is exciting hobarts flagship once caught the czars splendid yacht the livadia in the disgraceful act of pillaging and burning a poor little turkish merchant ship and chased the imperial marauder across the euxine into sebastopol another story throws light on news manufacture a turkish ironclad hastening with stores to sulina reported that on her way she had casually chased a russian cruiser but could only spare time to exchange a few shots soon after appeared a paragraph in the times   turkish ironclad driven off and nearly destroyed by the russian mailboat cruiser vesta describing  how the vesta had engaged at close quarters a turkish ironclad killing her crew how officers in european uniform had been seen directing the working of the turkish guns c how her sides were crimson with the torrents of blood pouring from her decks and how she would have been surely captured had the vest i been provided with sufficient ammunition it added that the gallant russian commander was received with the greatest enthusiasm on his arriving at sebastopol and immediately promoted to high rank and covered with decorations the author is too fair not to add that when the impostor was found out he was instantly degraded for admiral hobart was a generous enemy he admires and celebrates the military virtues and splendid gallantry of the russians he deplores and blames himself that like others he saw too late the superior resources and indomitable courage of the  federal americans it was not his fault that 5 j fate once opposed him to the only nation which discerning tolerance could not respect the greedy greeks the rebel southern states had his sympathy in their foolish heroic struggle for liberty and existence he was not blind to their glaring faults but his strong sense was revolted at the hypocritical paradox of an eightyyearold confederacy founded on secession throttling secession by civil war one foreign people abovo alland the one he knew best and bad known in their bitter life and death struggle when national character flashes out in supreme sincerityclaimed his honest respect experience presented the ottoman turks to this practical sailor as history presents them to the philosopherdispelling the mists of ignorant intolerant

B6595,['8987816'],  a collection of short stories the garnet bracelet by alexander kuprin duckworth 7s net in his introduction to this volume of short stories mr lion phelps professor of english literature at yale university has seized the opportunity to inform caution and put right american opinion upon the whole subject of russian literature his manner in so doing is unfamiliar to english readers it makes us feel that while we read we are like alice dwindling away in height by the end of the first page we are much too young even to attend a university  by the end of the second and especially when that tiny little joke is popped into our baby mouths we are of a size to spell out maxims at a learned knee  a novel is not great simply because it is written in the russian language nor because its author has a name difficult to pronounce or a slavishno pun intendedadoration of russian novels is not tself an indication of critical intelligence or a pessimist is not necessarily a profound thinker nor is unclean ness in itself a sign of virility but surely mr phelps exaggerates the extreme innocence of american literary opinion  he must surely be mistaken in not realising that it has long cut down these modest flowers of thought with its little hatchet nevertheless even kuprin is described in terms that remind us of those infantile dogmatics about the cat and the mat and  run fox run    he soars and he sinks  he is holy and he is coarse  he is sublime and he is flat between this introduction and the preface contributed by the translator mr pasvolsky who ls at naive pains to inform us when kuprin is at his best and why he is at his best the author makes a difficult bow but happily the first story which gives the title to the book is wonderfully successful and so the bow is a triumphant one  the garnet bracelet  is a story of hopeless love it tells how a poor official fell in love with the beautiful princess vera nicolaeyna for seven years he wrote to her and then on her birthday he sent her the bracelet at this her husband and brother interfered they sought the man out and he after giving them to understand that he fully realised the impossibility of the situation promised them to disappear next day the princess read of his suicide she received from him a letter written just before he had shot himself expressing his happiness in having loved her and begging her to ask someone to play for her in his memory the largo appassionata from sonata 2 op 2 of beethoven from this oldfashioned plot oldfashioned like the poor bracelet with its illpolished stones its green stdrie in the middle with the five deep red ones surrounding there come rays of deep quivering light and all that they reveal is linked together just for one moment becomes part of the tragic lifestory of the strangely simple man for whom  to love was enough  may nothing transient or vain trouble your beautiful soul he writes but the life of the princess is composed of what is transient and vain  the society in which she lives is transient and vain  real love could have no part in it but being woman her secret dream is of a love that shall fill her whole life  it has come near her and now it is gone for ever the other stories in the book do not approach the first  horse thieves  and  the jewess  are we imagine written under the influence of tchehov the first which is an account of a little boys association with beggars and thieves and contains a hideous picture of mob violence has many a touch which puts us in mind of the great writer but only to marvel before kuprins heaviness at the delicacy and surety of the other in  the jewess again it is easy to see in what soil the idea has been nourished but a sorry weed has grown coarse straggling with no flower at all for all the authors urging until at the last he has propped it up with an old stick of allegory which never for an instant deceives us a word must be said about  an evening guest in a letter giving a hst of the works he considers his most successful the author places it first this is very interesting as showing the extraordinary difference between the russian consciousness and ours to us  the evening guest  is quite impossible  it is very nearly absurd in its ingenuousness one evening somebody knocks at th writers door it sets him wondering who is there who might be there and how unknown is the future he compares life at great length to a game of cards and then imagines that some madman should hit upon the idea of a lottery of life on an appointed day there would stand an enormous urn filled with cards one of which we must draw and then what is life except this drawing of lots out of an urn of fate  and so on until he falls to wondering whether he will be able to make certain sounds to which that other person on the other side of the door will respond until finally when we are almost inclined to call it childish he cries  every time that i think of the vastness complexity darkness and elemental accidentality of this general intertwining of lives my own life appears to me like a tiny speck of dust tossed in the fury of a tempest what more is to be said  k

gift he carries you along with him one need not wish for a better story of action than this it may not quite be life but that is one reason why i like it a fountain ssakd by sir walter besant chatto  windus sir walters taste for lovemaking is incorrigible he oonfesses as much himself or which is i suppose the same thing makes his autobiographical heroine confess it i this is a love story for my own part i do not believe that any others are worth reading i am indeed sincerely sorry for all poor women who have no love story of their own one must not magnify the passion of love but certainly there is no other passion that plays so important a part in this transitory life especially for my sex in  a fountain sealed  the ideal society is that of the quake4 represented by the heroines brother in whom religious fervour and shameless pursuit of worldly wealth go hand in hand sir walter has not hit upon a very original treatment of his theme this time the heroine breaks away from quakerism to the outer world of london and becomes the  divine nancy whom rumour assigned as an early flame to george the third sir walter reconstructs the story as he conceives it must have happened and puts it in the mouth of the lady this is her description of her lover ii i declare that if any young man whatever his rank bestowed upon me his affections in the springtime of my days when i posesseed some charms of face and form it was not on account of any allurements or snares but solely on account of those perfections which a generous and noble soul all out of his own nobility imagined in a woman all imperfections the more noble the lover the more heavenly becomes the woman of his imagination such a young man sees in the woman he loves a living well of virtue a sealed fountain a soul all beautiful within and without happy is the woman who is loved by so great a heart for even before her death she may be led upward so as to become an angel of heaven i am bound to say that this does not fit in with my conception of george m the hanoverians do not lend themselves readily to romance and sentimentalism and it does not fit in with the conduct of the story either the prince wooes nancy who is ignorant of his identity everybody else knows but nobody has the decency to tell her a marriage is on the very point of being celebrated when the prince learns the death of the old king his father  my lover my bridegroom who was never to be my husband stood with his face turned upwardsalas  away from his bride and his face was changed there was in it a new authority anew majestythat of the sovereign a new expressionthat of kingship t love had gone out of that face it wa ied with a new emotion the young king saw suddenly before him the vastness of his responsibilities the burden of empire the vast duties what was the simple girl beside him in presence of these kings  war and peace prosperty and adversity the happiness of millions or their ithe sovereignt of a great proud and tree people their love and loyalty or their ate how could love survive that sudden shook  in a moment the passion died out in his heart though the memory of it might afterwards return he was the king needs must that he marry in his own clas  dei gratih he murmured  by the grace of god then he turned to me and his brother rose nancy he said solemnly  fate calls me i am now the kingunworthy pray for me mly brother will see thee what has passed i pray thee to forget thou art all goodness nancy farewell be happy he stooped and kissed my headand i fell back of course the story is put in the mouth of a lovesick woman but i should have been glad of a sign from sir walter besant that he personally agreed with me in thinking that his hero behaved throughout prince or no prince as a common cad but alas no sir walter is capable of irony but in this book irony is reserved not for the lover but for the quakers the historian has his somewhat heartless comment in the preface  youth is attracted by beauty of whatever rank it must be pleant for a prince to step outside his rank and for a time to be treated as an ordinary gentleman  soldiers of fortune by richard harding davis lilus trated by charles dana gibson 69 heinemani something like mr masons man of action appears again in mr daviss story a pioneer in remote regions of the world is strongly defined against a tamer society whose refinements and graces fascinate him and whose womankind he idealises in his loneliness but whatever be the points of resemblance they are obscured by the great fact that  sodiers of fortune is a thoroughly pleasant and cheerful story the literary man is not a cad and if the first fair lady of the heros choice is unsatisfactory she has a sister who is a trump and who behaves handsomely all the way through the book is a romance of the engineering world  there are no men today    who lead as picturesque lives as do civil engineers they are the bravest soldiers of the present day and they are the least recognised so says king the literary traveller and the story forces us to believe it though clays experiences including as they did not only tunnelling mountains diverting river beds bridging roaring canions but also stemming a revolution in a south american republic must be called exceptional then he was amply paid for his past life of lonely hardship for when the revolution camne he was made captain of the forces of order and the lady of his heart was there to see and to help the two keep up a merry game of alternately saving each

B1210,"['8859985', '6736823']",  the mutable many new novels by robert barr methuen  co mr barrs latest novel though it is of considerable length can be read throughout with little cessation of interest much pains has been bestowed on it an effort is made to avoid the elaboration of the obvious and commonplace incidents of the story and it is difficult to describe any portion of the book as being below the average level of the whole in form it consists of an account of the affairs of a large factory in london with the inevitable strikes and contests between the manager of the concern and the workpeople the managers only daughter is the heroine who is it must be confessed a somewhat conventional type of the young lady of the day but she is the only one of the dramatis persona to whom the epithet can be applied the workmen and their leaders are all carefully studied characters and they are well presented to the reader the novel rarely approaches to anything that is very great in art though there are indications that the writer is capable of very successful efforts it is pleasant to notice that the novel is devoid of the element of padding which so frequently marks the fiction of the time especially where the author is under a contract to write so many thousand words by a particular date and it would be hard to point to any portion of mr barrs  the mutable many which is slipshod or hasty in composition with regard to the class of roaders who are likely to be attracted by the volume it may be said that the book is as well suited to the drawingroom as it is to the club table the socalled art critic of the day will hardly appreciate the uses to which mr bar puts him with a view to  booming an incapable and ignorant painter into notoriety and eventually into success  new novels the mutable any byrobert barr methuen  co mr bar writes this time in all seriousness but he comes perilously near the brink of caricature the success of marcella and of sir george teeaady has not unnaturally ushered in an era of political novels consequently i look forward to several hours of tedium for although the magic wand of art can ins pire politics and even labour politics with

fairly claim that the politicians should be living and not lay figures now mr barrs strikers come straight from the property room you have the clever artisan with the managership of the works in his eye the burly yorkshireman with lusty sinews and thick brains the glib union secretary and the  mutable many  themselves the veering mob of workmen for the real human being drawn with knowledge and sympathy you look in vain for sentimental interest mr bar gives you the managers beautiful daughter edna in love with the aspiring artisan aforesaid comicone might say farcical relief is provided by a pseudoartist a son of one of the masters he is caricature pure and simple wallowing in money varnished with humbug and a cad at heart he sets up a studio in chelsea with stone steps like those at the pitti palace and a flunkey in a blue crimson and silver livery of the artists own design nothing gives character and dignity to a place so much as a  man sumptuously fitted out in a style that is palpably regardless of cost and if it may be plainly seen that the man performs no needful function whatever then is the effect heightened for few human beings attain the apex of utter uselessness the great hotels of this country recognise the distinction reflected upon them by the possession of a creature of splendour at their doors who grandly wafts the incoming guests with a handwave towards the hall but these persons of embellishment often demean themselves by opening the doors of cabs and performing other useful acts thus detracting from their proper function which was barney insisted to content themselves with being merely beautiful when a visitor once complained that the man at the top of the stairs had refused to direct him into the studio barney laid his right hand in friendly

white paint that seems easy but i tell you it requires genius then if there is water even though unseen to the general eye one has to put in little wobbly lines of grey paint under the dots of high light and there you are dont you know it all seems simple enough to talk about and plenty of fellows are trying it now i have shown them the way but somehow they dont hit it off dont you know i i am afraid that mr bar has not put much heart into this story it is a bit of patchwork full of disconnected incidents there are too many  walking gentlemen who come in and go off again without forwarding

of the author sir geoffrey peveril is a good portrait of the hospitable but despotic country gentleman of hia day abounding in feudal prejudices and a plentiful lack of brains his puritanic neighbour major bridgnorth is but so io and he somewhat unaccountably diverges from a calm man of sense into a gloomy fanatic without a sufficiency of predisposing canse for the alteration the countess of derby is raised from the dead to little purpose except to give motive to a most inexplicable villain of the name of christian whose brother she had executed for treason in her petty sovereignty of man attention is exceedingly roused by this character but it is entirely in the excitation of a curiosity by a species of unaccountable versatility which is very poorly accounted for the hero julian peveril we have already said is nobody  and his counterpart alice however lovely in description is in action nothing at all and is this ailby no means for how could the author of  waverley dispense with the agency of a something mysterious and fantastic  in the present instance the personification is peculiarly grotesque the intriguer christian has a natural daughter by a moorish female whom if we un derstand the story fright he disposes of in her infancy to a dutch tumbler but afterwards redeems on a supposition of making her useful to his purposes this girl ie ted to hekere that his executed brother is her father and in eon sequence is induced to counterfeit deafness and dumbness in which supposed state she is received as a sort of elfin attendant on the countess of derby whose destruction is sought and whose most secret intentions she thereby gets at without suspicion this feasible scheme is however defeated by her imbibing an uncontrollable penchant for julian peveril who being related to the countess ia brought up with her son the young earl of derby and in consequence thrown in the way of this mysterious attendant when therefore he is induced to take some dangerous packets to the catholic friends of the countess during the ferment created by the popish plot she attends him from time to time as a kind of esprit follet until at length we find her a woman of wit speech and spirit although doomed to love in vain and to intrigue to no purpose either for her father or herself the dark moorish yet piquant aspect the slight symmetrical person profusion of dark hair and almost supernatural agility from her education in the tumbling line altogether make up a perfect nondescript and we fear not a very happy one the general conception approaches to j extravagance and the action assigned to it is almost ridiculous only think ladies of a girt agreeing to act deafness pand dumbness for several years and to be pitied and durwarded m such by the man she adored i eran in romance there should be some verisimilitude  upon the whole we think that  peveril and  nigel jjnjr rank pea on a par although charles ii falls tar tefamd jamesil in happiness of

absence of an international copyrightlaw between this country and america that our publishers seldom give us the chance of reading an american author in decent type and paper the reason is obvious the market is filledwith all manner of spurious cheap editions that render such an effort much too risky hence it is that american literature whichwith all deference be it spokenshould not scorn adventitious aids is generally associated with dirty grey paper bad type small size and insecure binding let any one who ignorantly fancies that such things have no effect upon his enjoyment of an author read romeo juliet published in the form of a dirty tract which may be had in holywell street for twopence let him turn to his own large clear wellprinted edition and then say whether the poem does not seem to have acquired a new grace and light and sweetness that it did not possess before we are glad to perceive therefore that edgar allan poe unquestionably the greatest genius that america has yet producedis at length offered to english readers in a handy and presentable form with the accompaniments of clear type and good paper but it was a bold notion to think of illustrating these wonderful poems failure might have been anticipated at the beginning it was a priori as impossible to translate the dreamlike beauty of annabel lee into a picture as it was impossible to set the poem to fitting music and we dare say a good many of our readers have had their fee outraged by hearing the mystically beautiful lines sung to the strumming of a piano the illustrations to this volume are tolerable only where they are independent of the poetry e g one or two chaming little landscapes by mr macwhirter but to begin at the beginning did ever anybody more wickedly burlesque a fine poem than mr c j staniland has done with the  raven did mr staniland fancy that this was a comic poem  we find a hideously ugly boy seated in an annchair before a fire the room being filled with ghouls and spirits that remind us of the mnagic weene in der pieibchutz done iu a cuwtlty theatre what these tawdry devils have to do with the weird simplicity of the poem we are at a loss to make out but this is nothing to the final scneu in which the boy is found lying on the floor with a merry imp presumably representing hearthurn or nightame sitting on his chest we forgive mr s hlaad for not being aie

not think it falls to be considered here in any detail mr ingram has done his best to clear poes name from the calumnies of rufus griswold a gentleman grim by name who makes so repulsive a figure in literary history that he might well have been coined in the morbid fancy of his victim  but when all is said it is not in though power of man to make poe altogether sympathetic i cannot find it in my heart to like either his portrait or his character and though it is possible that we see him more or less refracted through the strange medium of his works yet i do fancy that we can detect alike in these in his portrait and in the facts of his life as now most favourably told a certain jarring note a taint of something that we do not care to dwell upon or find a name for the tales themselves are all before us in these two volumes and though mr ingram does not tell us whether they are there printed in chronological order i fancy we shall not be mistaken in regarding some of the last stories in the second volume as being also among the last he wrote there is no trace in these of the brilliant and often solid workmanship of his better moments the stories are illconceived and written carelessly there is much laughter bat it is a very ghastly sort of laughter at bestthe laughter of those in his own words  who laugh but smile no more he seems to have lost respect for himself for his art and for his audience when he dealt before with horrible images he dealt with them for some definite enough creative purpose and with a certain measure and gravity suitable to the occasion but he scatters them abroad in these last tales with an indescribable and sickening levity with something of the ghoul or the furious lunatic that surpasses what one had imagined to oneself of hell there is a duty to the living more important than any charity to the dead and it would be criminal in the reviewer to spare one harsh word in the rpression of his own loathing and horror lest by its absence another victim should be permitted to soil himself with the perusal of the infamous  king pest he who could write  king pest had ceased to be a human being for his own sake and out of an infinite compassion for so lost a spirit one is glad to think of him as dead but if it is pity that we feel towards poe it is certainly not pity that inspires us as we think of baudelaire who could sit down in cold blood and dress out in suitable french this pointless farrago of horrors there is a phase of contempt that if indulged transcends itself and becomes a phase of passionate selfsatisfaction  so for the weal of our own spirits it is better to think no more of baudelaire or king pest it is not the fashion of poes earlier tales to be pointless however it may be with these sorry ones of the end pointlessness is indeed the very last charge that could be brought reasonably against them he has the true storytellers instinct he knows the little nothings that make stories or mar them he knows how to enhance the significance of any situation and give colour and life with seemingly irrelevant particulars thus the whole spirit of vthe cask of amontillado depends on fortunatos carnival costume of cap and bells and motley when poe had once hit upon this device ol dressing the victim grotesquely he had found the key of the story and so he sends him with uneven steps along the catacombs of the montresors and the last sound we hear ont of the walledup recess is the jingling of the bells upon his cap admirable also is  the use he makes of though striking clock at prince prosperos feast in  the mask of the red death each time the clock struck the reader will remember it struck so loudly that the musn and the dancing must cease perforce until it had made an end as the hours ran on towards midnight these pauses grew naturally longer the maskers had the more time to think and look at one another and their thoughts were none the more pleasant thus as each hour struck there went a jar about the assemblage until as the reader will remember the end comes suddenly now this is quite legitimate no one need be ashamed of being frightened or excited by such means the rules of the game have been respected  only by the true instinct of the storyteller he has told his story to the best advantage and got full value for his imaginations this is not so always however  for sometimes he will take a high note falsetto sometimes by a sort of conjuring trick get more out of his story than he has been able to put into it and while the whole garrison is really parading past us on the esplanade continue to terrify us from the battlements with sham cannon and many fiercelooking shakos upon broomsticks for example in  the pit and the pendulum after having exhausted his bedevilled imagination in the conception of the pendulum and the redhot collapsing walls he finds he can figure forth nothing more horrible for the pit and yet the pit was to be the crowning horror this is how he effects his purpose vol i p 214   amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended the idea of the coolness of the well emu over my soul like balm 1 rushed to its deadly brink  i threw my straining vision below the glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses yet for a wild moment did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw at length it forcedit wrestled its way into my soulit burned itself in upon my shuddering reason o for a voice to speak oh horror oh any horror but this and that is all he knows no more about the pit than you or i do it is a pure imposture a piece of audacious impudent thimblerigging and yet even with such bugs as these he does manage to frighten us you will find the same artifice repeated in  hans pfaal about the mysteries of the moon  and again though with a difference in thc abrupt conclusion of  arthur gordon pym his imagination is a willing horse  but three times as you see ho has killed it under him by overriding and come limping to the post on foot with what a good grace does he not turn those failures to advantage and make capital out oleach imaginative bankruptcy  even on a critical retrospect it is hard to condemn him as ho deserves  for he cheats with gusto after this knowledge of the stage this cleverness at turning a story out perhaps the most striking of poes peculiarities is an almost incredible insight into thc debateable region between sanity and madness though  imp of the perverse for example is an important contribution to morbid psychology  so perhaps is  the man of the crowd   berenice toofor ashorrible as it is touches a chord in ones own breast though perhaps it is a chord that had better be left alone  and the same idea recurs in  thc telltalo heart sometimes we can go with him though whole way with a good  conscience sometimesinstead of saying yes this is how 1 should bo if i were just a little more mad than ever i waswe can say frankly this is what i am there is ono passage ol analysis in this moro normal vein in the story of  ligeiaas tothe expression of ligcias eyes he tells us how he felt ever on the point of understanding their strange quality and ever baffled at the last moment just as  in our endeavours to recall to memory something long forgotten wo often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance without being able in the end to reincmbrr  and how in streams of running water in the ocean in the falling of a meteor jj though glances of unusually aged people in crrlaia sounds from stringed instruments in certain passages from books in the commonest sights and sensations of thc universe he found ever and anon some vagne inexplicable analogy to the expression and the power of these loved eyes this at least or the like of it we all know but in the general his subtlety was more of a snare to him than anything else nil sapicntiac odiosius he quotes himself from seneca  nil sapicntiae odiosius acumine nimio and though it is delightful enough in the c augusto dupin trilogyit was baudelaire who called it a trilogyyet one wearies in though long run of this strain of ingenuity one begins to marvel at the absence of thc good homespun motives and sentiments that do the business of the everyday world although the demonstrator is clever and the cases in structive and probably unique one begins to weary of going round this madhouse and long for thc society of some plain harmless person with business habits and a frock coat and nerves not much more shattered than the majority of his plain and harmless contemporaries nor did this exaggerated insight make him wearisome only it did worse than thatit sometimes led him astray thus in  the pit and the pendulum when the hero has been condemned  the sound of the inquisitorial voices he says seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a millwheel now it wants but a moments reflection to prove how much too clever poe has been here how far from true reason he has been carried by this niminm acumen forthe man being giddythe  idea of involution  must have preceded the merging of the inquisitorial voices into an indeterminate hum and most certainly could not have followed it as any fanciful deduction again as before in the matter of effect one cannot help fearing that some of the subtlety is fustian to take an example of both sorts of imaginationthe fustian and the sincerefrom the same story  arthur gordon pym   the four survivors on board the brig grampus have lashed themselves to the windlass lest they should be swept away one of them having drawn his lashings too tight is ready to yield up his spirit for a long while is nearly cut in two indeed by the cord about his loins no sooner had we removed it however poe goes on  than he spoke and seemed to experience instant reliefbeing able to move with much greater ease than either parker or myself two who had not tied themselves so closely  this teas no doubt owing to the loss of blood now whether medically correct or not this is on though face of it sincerely imagined whether correct or not in fact it is correct in art poe evidently believed it true  evidently it appeared to him that thus and not otherwise the thing would fall out now turn a page back and we shall find ii 78 in though description of the visions that went beforo pym while thus bound something to be received very much more deliberately  i now remember he writes that in all which passed before my minds eye motion was a predominant idea thus i never fancied any stationary object such as a house a mountain or anything of that kind but windmills ships large birds balloons people on honeback carnages driving furiously and similar moving objects presented themselves in endless succession this may be true  it may be the result of great erudition in thc thoughts of people in such sore straits  but the imagination does not adopt these details they do not commend themselves to our acceptance it is nowise apparent why stationary objects should not present themselves to the fancy of a man tied to the windlass of a dismasted brig and this being so the whole passage as art stand condemned if it be mere causeless fancy as it seems it is fustian of the most unpardonable sort if it be eruditionwell then it may be erudition bnt never art things are tit for art so far only ns they are both truo and apparent to make what i mean clear mr buskin in some one or other of his delightful books quotes and approves a poet i think it was homer who said of a brave man that he was as brave as a fly and proceeds in his usual happy manner to justify the epithet the fly he tells us is in very deed the most madly courageous of all created beings and therefore the simile is goodexcellent good and yet the readers instinct would tell him i am sure that the simile is a vile simile let him prefer his instinct before mr ruskins natural history for though it be based on what is true this comparison is not based upon a truth that is apparent it does not commend itself to our acceptance it is not art i have spoken at so great a length of these matters of method and detail that no room remains to me to speak of the larger questiona question avoided also by baudelaire on the same plea of want of spacewhy it is that these subjects interested poes imaginationa question difficult of solution indeed but not insoluble with time nor have i left myself room to speak of what is j perhaps still more important the relation  between poe and his far greater and better compatriot hawthorne that there is a consanguinity that the two saw the world in a fashion not altogether dissimilar that some of the short stories of hawthorne seem inspired by poe and some of poes short stories seem to be an echo of hawthorneall this is beyond question  but all this i can do no more than indicate nor should the reader be surprised if a criticism upon poe is mostly negative and rather suggests new doubts than resolves those already existing for it is poes merit to carry people away and it is his besetting sin that he wants altogether such scrupulous honesty as guides and restrains the finished artist he was let us say it with all sorrow not conscientious hunger was ever at his door and he had too imperious a desire for what we call nowadays the sensational in literature and thus the critic if he be more conscientious than the man he is criticising dare not greatly praise lest he should be thought to condone all that is unscrupulous and tinsel in these wonderful stories they are to be praised by him in one way onlyby recommending those that are least objectionable if anyone wishes to be excited let him read under favourable circumstances  the gold bug  the descent into the maelstrom  the cask of amontillado  the oval portrait and the three stories about c auguste dnpin the philosophical detective if he should then desire to read more he may go on but warily there are trapdoors and springguns in these two volumes there are gins and pitfalls and the precipitate reader may stumble unawares upon some nightmare not easily to be forgotten one word on the services of mr ingram this edition has evidently been a labour of love with him let us hope in the next two volumes which are to complete the series he may extend some of his love and labour to the scraps of french which poe was so fond of scattering about his pages there are some deplorable errors abroad in the two under

occupy a position which it is easy for them to defend and which it is difficult to assail to find fault with their wares is to advertise them and to expose the reviewer to the easy charge of prudery it often happens too that there is here and there a jewel hidden in the dunghills of the past some pure song among the many base ones of th6ophile vian some fact of historical value in the gossip of mrs aphra behn it is a pity that the student should not have such books always beside him as if the poorest student had not easy access to them in public libraries still there is this shadow of au excuse for many reprints of books which are meant to appeal only to prurient curiosity and when they are pro duced with some care and costliness in type and paper the chances are that they will not fall into the hands of readers whom they are likely to injure none of the excuses we have mentioned can be urged by the translator and the pub lishers of balzacs contes drolatiques the translator says in his preface in france the work has long been regarded as a classicas a faithful picture of the last days of the mayen dge when kings and princesses brave gentlemen and haughty ladies laughed openly at stories and jokes which are considered disgraceful by their more fastidious descendants in england the difficulties of the language employed and the quaintness and peculiarity of its style have placed it beyond the reach of all but those thoroughly acquainted with the french of the sixteenth century taking into consideration the vast amount of historical information enshrined in its pages the archaeological value it must alwats possess for the student and the dramatic interest of its stories the translator has thought that an english edition of balzacs chef dceuvre would be acceptable to many no doubt it would and no doubt a translation of the marquis de sades chefdceuvres or of any other  scrofulous french novel would be acceptable to many but the translator like everyone else must be per fectly aware that the historical information of the book is absolutely worthless that it has no archaeological value at all except in the same sense as esmoncd has archaeological value that is as an imitation of the style and manners of the past and the style and lan guage of the contes drolatiques are not nearly so successful in this direction as esmond is the old french is like no old french in par ticular indeed it resembles nothing so much as the bastard old english of lady novelists who put ys for is and spell the ye and begin all the substantives with a capital letter there is no philological instruction to be got from this kind of thing and even if there were it would be lost in a translation to be sure the translator does his best by using some fine old examples of wellknown errors in english grammar such as  the wise man would lay at full length in a ditch to translate balzacs conte8 drolatiques then is inexcusable on historical or antiquarian grounds even beroalde de verville has the value of being the exponent of the nastiness of a past age but there is no historical value in a modern imitation of beroalde de verville and even if the cn ies were useful to the student a student so advanced ought to be able to read them in the original french nor has the book the excuse of being published at a price beyond the humblest purse or in a form meant to please the lover of beautiful typography it is got up like the boys books that are current at christmas and an illiterate but wellmeaning grand mother might probably give it to a boy now even the author would have objected to this for when balzac in the preface to the first edition defended his work as a work of art he also said that it was intended pour lea lecteura choiie the present translation appeals to the public at large to a public which has none of the education that would enable it to appreciate the art without taking harm from the grossness the contes drolatique is a fair example of the baser work of the romantic school of 1830 it deals with mediaeval themes and the author thoroughly enters into the horror and the lust which inform the grotesque of the middle ages in the voice and with a cracked imitation of the ringing laugh of rabelais he tells tales more filthy than any in the collection of the cure of meudon and morehateful in theircruelty than most that disgrace the records of crime in the middle ages theserecords are dreadful enough but they are at least human in their earnestness men were cruel because they were terrified but it is scarcely human to take such themes for art a gross age laughed grossly but there is something apish in the imitative and affected ribaldry of a refined age a cruel age acted with cruelty but there is something of the tiger in the artist who in a humane age gloats over torture like all balzac did his contes drolatiques are works of patient art look at the story of la succube it is a masterpiece of the romantic school the blind gropings of pedants in the mysteries of nature and of law are reproduced with the skill of michelet a glamour of moorish colour a savour of exotic fragrance hangs about the vampire but in place of the indignation of michelet there is only a sound of mocking laughter and everywhere in the book in every page we are reminded that this is the work of that balzac after reading whom saintebeuve said he felt like one unclean the book is full of art but to translate it for english people is to perpetrate another of the many crimes that are done in the name of art in this sabbat of satyrs and obscene witches among these foul scandals of monasteries and shadows of nameless sins there appears here and there the face of a woman that is not wholly vile or of a knight that was not merely a lecher but there is none of the tender poetry the pure love that redeem the coarseness of boccaccio the romantic school has scarcely produced a more hideous work or one so likely to do mischief in an english form the volume is illustrated with dores famous woodeuts now very worn and ob scure mr hamerton and mr ruskin did full justice to these drawings while they were still confined to a book that was not likely to find its way into schoolrooms it may be observed that the publishers have chosen to mutilate mr ruskins observations in their catalogue he did not end when he had said

handicap has produced a story of vivid realism and grim humour concerning the lives of some avorkingmen who with himself were associated with a firm of house painters and decorators in a provincial town in the course of a aolume extending to nearly 400 pages he shows us the sordid lives of these men their opinions of other sections of humanity  their attitude towards politics in general and their views of socialism in particular we follow the author with interest as he faithfully records the hopes and fears that animate his comrades their fatalistic philosophy of life and their dull round of toil displayed in the avorkshop and by their relations with the  boss  and the foreman a zolaesque character nicknamed  old misery the struggle of the women is also depicted and thc tragedies

arrives home dispirited and tired to find the household budget disorganised hythe accumulation of debt resulting from his periods of enforced unemployment his avise has struggled hard and bravely but the crisis has mastered all the strategy of poverty and she explains to easton iioav matters stand he listens and then in ignorance rather than anger taxes her with carelessness and neglect  the woman did not reply at once she was bending down over the cradle arranging thc coverings which the restless movements of the child had disordered she was crying silently unnoticed by her husband  for months pastin fact ever since the child was born she had been existing without sufficient food if easton was unemployed they had to stint themselves so as to avoid getting further into debt than was absolutely necessary when he was working they had to go short iii order to pay avliat they owed but of what there was easton himself without knowing it always had the greater share if he was at work she would pack into his dinnerbasket overnight the best there was in the house when he was out of work she often pretended as she gave him his meals that she had had hers while lie was out and all this timo the baby was draining her lifo away and her work was lieaer done she felt very weak and weary as she crouched over there crying furtively and trying not to let him see then the man still

robert trossalf housepainter and signwriter who recorded his criticism of the present scheme of things until weary of the struggle he slipped out of it and that her task has been merely to cut away superfluous matter and repetition she has not done either duty satisfactorily repetition has not only escaped her pruningknife but there is also at least one apparent hiatus which rightly or wrongly we have debited her avith in the interests of novel  readers to whom the subject is little known it ought we think to have been explained that the descriptions deal with men masters and conditions of work and life far below the average and we feel a measure of sympathy with the impatience that his fellowworkers expressed at the authors socialistic discourses there is a measure of truth in the latters contention that they are not informed as to the rootcause of poverty the nearest ave get to it is that it is the outcome of private monopoly today it is too much the fashion to shelter the individual behind the system it is at least open to question avhether if workers secured control there avould be safetysecurity of decent life and fair avagesin numbers alone and no one can be blamed for questioning also avhether the more educated vorkingman should not educate his felloavs better before the majority take control nevertheless ave commend this work to the sociologist and the politician alike  while the general reader will find its pages a document of compelling interest and tragic stress it is a book that by no means should be overlooked or ignored  the ragged trousered philanthropists by robert tressall grant richards 6s net although this socalled novel is said to be the work of a deceased socialistic housepainter we strongly suspect a dual authorship the story of the bitter struggle of the poor painters who work for a slavedriving firm is terribly realistic the complete knowledge of the miserable conditions under which they lived is certainly firsthand the dialogue is of the kind not likely to be overheard loose jests oaths and curses with a perpetual use of the forbidden word it is a painful and possibly only too true picture of labour under its worst conditions but the real purpose of the book cannot be mistaken it is merely the repetition of wornout attacks on christianity and the exploitation of an impossible and utopian scheme of socialism in the form of speeches and lectures put into the mouth of the painter owen in a style and manner quite different from the rest of the bookin fact a rather weak essay on socialism laboured into the rough and ready dialogues of the workmen this weak and obvious device whether the work of the original author or not tends to spoil a book which at least has the merit of giving a remarkable glimpse of

B3269,['9050617'],  alone in west africa by mary gaunt werner laurie the avidity with which travel books are sought after by the public is apt to thrust into the market a type of descriptive work which wilfully trades upon the readers curiosity the principle of  omne ignotum pro magnifico focuses attention on the unknown country rather than the qualities that go to the visualising of it and tends to submerge critical acumen to avoid careful study becomes an acute temptation for this reason and on account of the multiple and disconnected impressions left by a book of this nature personality is invaluable in supplying unity and distinction and fixing a rallyingpoint for the reader mrs gaunts new book fulfils this demand it is not so much that her personality is virile and commanding as that it is sufficient to cut a way for the reader through the jungle of her journeys her salient capacity is a surprising and quickening commonsense she refuses to take things on trust alert enough to test all she hears and sees by her own experience our sole objection to her lucid and conscientious narrative is that she tends to lapse into impressionistic journalism the purely descriptive portions of her adventurous jaunt through littleknown districts in west africa do not call for detailed treatment mrs gaunt started up the gambia from bathurst through the  groundnut colony a land of promise so far as productivity is concerned she skirted sierra leone the white mans grave  staying a short time at its dirty illkempt capital freetown and spent some interesting days in liberia autonomous since 1822 through the courageous experiment of america for the semicultured native she has scant praise insisting on his boorishness his arrogance his raw and blatant egoism passing through the guinea coast almost fabulous in its natural beauties she reached half assinie and the french border from elmina the old portuguese mining settlement her pilgrimage took her to accra the capital of the gold coast colony up the volta to the krobo hills infamous for the mystic bloodorgies there practised by the nearly savage inhabitants over the eketo range and so to the border into the german colony of togo thence she travelled along the coast to the best point of vantage and turned inland into ashanti which has cost england so much money and so many lives and finally dipped down from kumasi its capital to the atlantic seaboard at sekondi where her route ended like another district which we deal with elsewhere much of this country had not been traversed before by a white woman mrs gaunts facile and rather gusty style never drifts into mere enumeration of peoples places and incidents her versatility is such that wherever she goes she kindles her narrative with patches and splashes of colour particularly illuminating are her hard penetrating comments on the prevailing fetishism concerning the west african climate the theory current as to its unredeemed vileness has she observes crystallised into superstition officials go there in confident expectation of having their energies enervated and paralysed by its humidity and in a spirit of calculated disgust they flout nature by burning the candle at both ends by falling into sedentary habits and a dumb mental resentment opposed to physical wellbeing so the consequent illhealth is as much the result of internal as extraneous causes it may be readily imagined how much the administration of the country suffers when activities but halfhearted and almost morose are applied to it mrs gaunts picture of the germans as colonisers of togo is in striking contrast to the verdict just given of their alertness regularity and cheerfulness she speaks in terms of ungrudging admiration their keen and trenchant methods of organisation she opposes to the british lack of plan and casual attitude without attempting to draw invidious comparisons she speaks of the presence of broad long roads the facilities for transit the instinct for governing the scientific warfare against sleeping sickness the insistence on cleanliness and order and the anxiety to preserve natural beauties where  england seems indifferent if the beautiful spot be not within the narrow seas german women too live with their husbands in togo their helpmeets there as at home englishmen on the other hand regard such itinerant companionship as akin to sacrilege the tropics are  no white womans country immorality and discontent are the outcome so far as ashanti is concerned however mrs gaunt is less dispiriting there a succession of zealous administrators have rescued the country from internecine strife strong measures have had the stimulating effect required concerning the vexed and seemingly inscrutable problem of the native population mrs gaunt is more reticent than we could wish her conclusions are enigmatic varying in accordance with the different status of the aborigines in different parts the halfemancipated native with his veneer of culture still she declares retains the rudiments of barbarism combined with the less agreeable characteristics of civilization his isolation from both white and black and his incapacity are complete for the primitive majority she veers towards the theory of a  benevolent despotism that depends for its validity on the temperament of the despot with whom unlimited authority is hardly favourable to the growth of sympathy and understanding and is apt to become inoculated with the virus of caesarism such are the scope and achievement of mrs

B8881,['8717710'],  basque legends  collected chiefly in the la bourd by the rev wentworth webster u a a is with an essay on the basque language by m julien vinson griffith  farran so difficult is the basque language that tradition asserts that the prince of darkness himself was obliged to abandon it in despair after having spent seven whole years in fruitlessly attempting to learn it as a specimen of the grammatical complications in which those who study it from without are involved may be mentioned one of the peculiarities of the conjugation of its verb the possession namely on the part of that verb of eleven moods and ninetyone tenses variable according to the sex or rank of the person addressed no wonder that as m vinson says in the tough but valuable essay appended to the present work the basque language is one which is particularly attractive to specialists it may be assumed however that the majority of the readers of mr websters pretty collection of  legends will not be profoundly interested in that tongue in spite of the fact that  its place in the general series of idioms has at last been well defined  it is an agglutinative and incorporating language with some tendency to polvsynthetism it consequently finds a place in the second great morphological linguistic group between the finnic and the north american family of languages like etruscan it has always possessed a fascination for the amateur as well as the professional philologist and over it as over etruscan the amateur has before now experienced some heavy falls the keen and by no means inexcusable desire of many a dilettante linguist is to grapple at once with the hardest problems which have baffled whole generations of trained scholars and about the origin and affinities of both basque and etruscan such things have been said as might well make the old inhabitants of etruria and the pyrenees turn in their urns or their graves or at least put on record a remonstrance through the medium of a table but the book now before us does not sin in this direction m vinson speaks with authority and his remarks must be listened to with respect and so few englishmen have taken the trouble to learn basque that mr webster thoroughly deserves all possible encouragement to continue his labours and to give the world more of the fruits arising from them but in writing about the  legends  of the basques he must proceed with rather more caution than is shown in his present book his knowledge of popular tales in general appears to be mainly drawn from mr campbells  tales of the west highlands an admirable book but one which throws light upon but a small portion of a very wide field the natural consequence of this is that mr webster is always laying stress upon similarities between the basques and the kelts it is not clear whether he suspects that their languages are akin but he evidently imagines that basque popular tales are more allied with keltic than with any other similar stories we have chosen the designation keltic he says  because the burning question concerning the basques at present is their relation to the keltic race undoubtedly the question is a burning one in one sense anybody who takes it up without very special knowledge of both basque and keltic is exceedingly likely to burn his fingers he goes on to say what is perfectly true that the basque stories are like the keltic but he adds  whether they have a closer affinity with them than with the general run of indoeuropean mythology may be an open question it may seem so to mr webster who does not once refer to and therefore may be supposed to be unacquainted with the works of yon hahn bernhard schmidt and others on modern greek folklore or those of gonzenbach and pitrc on sicilian popular tales or of wenzig on west slavonian or of schott on wallachian  or of vuk karadjich and mijatovics on servian not to speak of the numerous untranslated works with which a western critic cannot fairly be expected to be familiar of course be was by no means bound to read the whole literature of folktales before bringing out a collection of basque legends but it is dangerous for an editor who has not done so to indulge in critical observations on the origin of the stories he introduces to the public to the scientificcomparerof stories the basque tales will offer little that is new but he will be glad to possess them for they to some extent fill up a gap which has long remained open it was supposed by some comparative mythologists that the basque legends as being those of a people quite distinct at all events linguistically from the aryan family would offer new features but those which mr webster has laid before us possess little novelty as he himself remarks some are closely allied with keltic tales others are evidently versions of modern french stories of the perrault and daulnoy type the supernatural beings however who figure in them are interesting the basa jaun and basa andre or ogre and ogress and the lamiiiak or fairies the legends also about the herensuge the basque representative of the serpent or dragon family so notorious in popular fiction are important if they are trustworthy some of the casual references in the tales to sorcery are very interesting the basques are great believers in magic and witches used to flourish amongst them in spite of pierre de lancre who by the terrors of his hideous inquisition in 1609 produced a moral epidemic and burnt numerous victims at st jean de luz the last person thus put to death there was a portuguese lady who was charged in 1619 with secreting the host for magic purposes while her case was being investigated in the church a number of fishermen about to start for newfoundland who dared not set sail while such a crime was unpunished seized upon her and burnt her facts of this kind are always worth recording if mr webster will give us a book about the basques made up of such facts or of popular fictions carefully sifted and printed without other comment than may be demanded by difficulties arising from basque words or customs and the likethat is to say without theories hypotheses or mythological comparisons or explanationsthen he will be conferring a real benefit on the small number of readers who know a little about the basques and the great number to whom the language and literature of those  aborigines are entirely unknown,unmarked_contra

found peace they had both suffered enough to have paid the price of death for one at least philips story and petes character are the outstanding features of the book pete is a real creation humorous

B582,"['8781385', '4696693']",  tales of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beauclerk and henrietta mary beauclerk first series smith o elder from the multiplicity of novels which are almost hourly appearing we are compelled to contine our notices within the narrowest limits we had accordingly made a memorandum to forget this volume of tales but more than one consideration has induced us to change our intention in the first place it has been made the town talk in a degree that has excited no common curiosity  and a great deal of very respectable wonderment has been flung away upon it as it seems to us not very reasonably this alone might justify if not require from us a brief notice of the work  but there is connected with it extrinsic matter of more weighty concernment than the merits of a book of ephemeral amusement let those merits be as considerable as they may the primary source of the notice which the  tales of fashion and reality have obtained from the public is the fact that they are the production of the scions of o noble house of persons well known iu the world of fashion the next cause of notoriety is that the authors are two rory young ladies not lon emancipated from the discipline ofthe nursery and their third and last notability is the singularities of style which mark their composition and which are in strange contrast and contradiction to what men commonly suppose to be the position and habits of young ladies of quality as to mere literary criticism that is soon dispatched from writers of such tender years imitation is the most that can bc expected originality cither of invention or of thought is totally out of the question then as for thc subjects what could two young ladies know either of the world or its inhabitants beyond the drawingrooms in which they are exhibited  in what could they feel an interest but in the great business of their sex and age lovelove modified as it is hy the necessities and the circumstances of the exclusive society in which they live and have their being  the scope and character of the work are therefore determined by a rigorous necessity in like manner it might have been concluded beforehand with an almost mathematical certainty that any approach to developeinent should not bc looked for that the world the authors world and its appearances must have been viewed only in its broadest outlines in its widest generalities and that the tales must be skeletons divested of all proportion and form but all this being premised the work all childish as it is is not by any means without merit nor unmarked by indications of latent capability the source of better things should time and circumstance ever combine to call it from a potential to an actual being the wonder of the case is not that two young and inexperienced girls should have failed to compose a book fit for the public eye but that they should have been able to work the scanty materials of their limited sphere of observation into anything like a printable shape the merit however and the rarity whatever they may be would in all probability have been overlooked and the tales maugre all their means and appliances of fashionable notoriety would have remained unknown to fame beyond the circle of acquaiiitancesand friends but for the rather unusual vehemence of language and of passion which has set readers sluring and has furnished them with ii subject for much silly persiflage lt would seem both from the words and the actions of the young lady heroines of this volume that the authors had no idea that there was such a thing as restraint or selfrespect in human nature the first wish of the heart is embodied in deed while the slightest disappointment in the execution of the hasty purpose is the cause of measureless rage and violenceconfounding all distinctions of rank sex or station thus we have a young lady exclaiming  lay a finger tm mc who darts and by lean ns iii dig his eyes ont aud again a

these tides  it being thought by many a rather good joke that such ii vocabulary should have been at the command of the fair authoresses we have some reason however for believing that the case is not quite singular and that must young persons however attentively they have been brought up contrive to pick up a good deal more than it is wise or discreet to talk of it is matter of notoriety that female lunatics in all mnks of life frequently evince a cognizance with ideas and with language which it would seem utterly impossible they ever could have heard uttered in their presence and this remark is of the last importance as illustrative of the wisdom of laving the foundations of female conduct in a childish ignorance of the realities of the world such ignorance is not to bc obtainedlittle iit least short of a miracle is requisite to effect that end if the coarsest vulgarisms of the populace can and we know that they do find their way into the most secluded nurseries and schoolrooms so also must a knowledge of a vast many other particulars which we vainly hope to hide from our children and still more vainly attempt to exclude as a means of mental and moral discipline but if such an end were attainable pa rents in general take the very worst means of arriving at it the vulgarities and coarsenesses which surprise the readers of these tales are part and parcel of the minds of that humble class of females who are so heedlessly brought round young women in the nursery and the schoolroom pains are taken to degrade the condition of the instructress the salary paid her is most paltry she is banished from the society of the heads of the family and her function is not deemed respectable  how then is it likely that any female fit for the task will submit to its humiliations we say nothing of servants and the intercourse which whether forbidden or permitted does take place between them and the children in almost all families we consider then the volume before us as good evidence of particulars which ina less degree perhaps are common to most young women in the writers walk of life and we consider that it has great value as an exponent of the sort of stuff which fills the minds of young ladies of fashionof the sort of education by which they are prepared to become th partners of men of intellect the mothers and guides of a future generation the evil is one of deep and serious import for it strikes at the very root of society such as are the mothers such must be the children  such as are the wives such will be the  husbands frivolity and vice cannot abide ut  home without corrupting all within its sphere  and when home ceases to be agreeable it is too  much to expect that it will long remain respecti able the world is now taking new forms and education must be remodelled to fit the rising j generation for its encounter how ill adapted  it is at present to the exigencies of the times the  volume before us speaks  trurnpettongued j and as example is more powerful than precept j we wish that such a striking specimen should be  extensively studied it is not alone the obvious l defect of moral development in these young  ladies but the wonderful ignorance of all things  beyond a particular exclusive circle which is  so calculated to excite surprise the world i of everyday lifethe world of labour of inj thistly of struggle is not even dreamed of lin their philosophy oh how ardently do j i wish says the heroine of the journal of i a debutante  that every one had a compej tency of ioool a year then lhere would be no arguing of fathers and mothers no breaking of girls hearts no family dissensions and very few unhappy marriages here is no thought of earning money still less of the possibility of an existence unsupported by  4001 a year this is the pervading character of the whole book  wherever the humbler ranks of life are alluded to the trait is a caricature oran absurdity  it is a representation of something heard of imaginedor at best something read of in a book yet such we believe is the ignorance of most young ladies of fashion even in families of no very decided aristocratic pretension  and these once again are the destined mothers of a coining generation  how their sons are to meet the contingencies of reform is a question of no ordinary import it is however impossible to peruse the work before us without being deeply interested in the fate of its joint authorstwo young and innocent brings thrust upon the world with minds so empty of all reallyuseful knowledgeso guiltless of one idea concerning their own nature or the real bearings of society its duties and its rights and upon their own position and prospects the very excess and extravagance of the love scenes they have described afford conclusive evidence that they have drawn from an imaginary and not a real worldthat they have created from the head and not from the heart it is simplicity and not corruption that has con ducted their pen  and the talent which they have evinced if common justice w ere done to it would fit them for higher ends than those even of successful authorship with pain are we compelled thus to allude to circumstances of a personal nature  the fault is with those if such there be who could luive prevented the publication and did not as respects thc public the opportunity for useful instruction is too precious to be lost and as regards the individuals we would fain hope that it is not yet too late to qualify them something better for the parts they are destined to perform in life by remodelling

the method of writers who have sense enough to le conscious of mediocrity the one is associated with the name of sir walter scott the other with the anae of mr p r1 james the latter writer has been as to this matter wise in his generation his two horsemen are almost always discovered taking their accustomed ride on a summer evening during the exciting days of the league we know many very wellinformed people who have derived their principal knowledge of french history from a diligent perusal of such works as the  huguenot  rose dalbret and one in a thousand and it is undoubtedly pleasant to have historical information of some value thus tacked on to the fortunes of a young couple tried by many sorrows but certain to be made happy at the end on the other hand writers like sir e dward boliver lytton aiming unsuccessfuilly at the highest triumphs of art disregard the inferior source of interest to which we have referred and produce accordingly bad novels in the present instance mr whyte melville has done the same the  queens maries is we are sorry to say a very bad novel there can be nothing new to tell any one about the life of queen mary from her arrival in

been severe on queen miary or to have been very favourably disposed to the party which dethroned her yet in the abbot he dlescribes the regent as that distinguished statesman who possessed all the external dignity as well as almost all the noble qualities which could grace the power that he enjoyed  and had he succeelel to the throne ais his legitimate inhleritance it is probable he wolul have been recorded as one of scotlands wisest and greatest kingrs and this mnan mr melville brings before us as a lowm11inded shortsighted intriguer whose profoundest policy was to keep sober when other people were gretting drunk and whose highest statesmanship was to poison couriers at supper we should hardly have paused to commilent upon folly such as this were it not so very widespread just at

commands a style of much beauty and power and he sometimes reaches to genuine poetic feelingi  the old old story with all its vicissitudes of joy and sorrow was never told more touchingly than in the interpreter but he cannot write an historical novel in the first place he wants knowledge no byways of history are familiar to him by guiding us through which he might gain our attention he is forced to go in the beaten tracks and readers grow weary as they recognise the wellknown footimarks in the second place he wants imaginative power his characters are mere automiata whetherehis conceptions of them be right or wrong his representations of them are never lifelike he knows thoroughly the dandy of the park and can draw himr truly he is a thorough realist and can reproduce whatever he has seen and understood but the house of commons even of our own day would be somewhat beyond him and with the statesmen of past ages he is quite helpless holmby house was a striking instance of this the interest of that novel was entirely derived from the romantic lovestory which ran through it and which was ended so beautifully and so happily under the oaktree in the old park in northamptonshire every historical character in the book from falkland to cromwell was a mistake the same holds good as to  the queens maries with this unfortunate difference that while the historical part of the latter work is as bad as that of  holmnby house there is here no lovestory which can interest the most inveterate novelreader the whole plotif so it can be calledconsists in narrating the loves and alliances of queen mary and of her four maids of honour one of these young ladies falls in love with chastelar and when that worthy is executed for having taken the slight liberty of coming into the queens bedchamber at midnight nothing is left to the lady into whose bedchamber he did not come but to go into a convent and die which she accordingly does the second maid of honour falls in love with bothwells henchman the henchman is killed and the lady devotes herself like jephthas daughter to perpetual virginity the third faills in love with the english ambassador is jilted by him and then consents to marry a gentleman called ogilvy the fourth conducts herself much the most rationally of all throughout the whole story she loves and is loved by a worthy young mnan called maxwell whom she duly marries after she has succeeded in convincing him that a gentleman whom she is in the habit of meeting clandestinely in the gardens of holyrood is her exiled father and not a favoured lover finally as to the queen  still the stately flower bloomed on fair and fragrant under the pure air of heaven fair and fragrant in the close confinement and the darkened daylight of a prisonhouse all this is very sorry work there is nothing in the booknot even incident instead of the usual huntingfield with its impossible leaps we have a hawkingparty on the links of saint andrews composed of the queen and john knox than which we never read of anything more absurd these two volumes in short are as dull less authentic and far more lengthy than any record of the same period they have nothing of

B2902,"['9419058', '6810244', '3278138', '6834903']",  new novels pig8 in clover by frank danby heine mann frank danby falls between two stools the opening chapters of  pigs in clover give promise of an interesting study of english life on normal levels but we are disappointed on the entrance of karl althaus the south african millionaire several characters including a woman whose luckless blood is scientifically inherited from a demirep have a life and reality of their own but alas this does not carry us beyond the first sixty pages with karl althaus the novel takes a turn for the worse and becomes quite another thing with long lanes that seemingly have no ending and a mesh of characters and interests that are disproportionate and out of perspective there is for example mrs de groot who is described as the author of the kaffir and his master and who is also represented as making common cause with the prime minister of cape colony against the boers althaus is one of the hebrew millionaires who threw in their lot with the late cecil rhodes the advisability the taste and even the practicability of introducing contemporary people into modern fiction are open to doubt but we should say that there could be no question as to the verdict on the course frank danby has seen fit to adopt if through her delay says the prime minister of cape colony when the jameson raid is reported to him her damnable calm and red tape there is a hair of one of those mens heads injured ill pull the place down upon her i ii make hell through the length and breadth of the by continent this is the style in which he is made to talk to althaus and which should make the blood of history curdle karl althaus jew is a noble creature as all millionaires must be on the other hand louis althaus half gentile is a scoundrel and mrs de groot is a fool we should not have dwelled upon the unsatisfactory nature of this novel had we not seen in it the germs of something really good as it is frank danby seems to us to have simply wasted her material  pigs in clover by frank danby heinemann 6s there are two ways of pessimism in art one tnices the cruelty of circumstance the other of humanity from this passionate novel which we have seen miscalled  smart we cull a sentence that shows frank danbys way of pessimism  the bright elusive womanhood which had bewitched karl louis saw shy and wild and he wanted it as men always want to bring down wild things it is then a woman whom we see piloted into tragedy in reading these pages and in fact they reveal two women whom charon could hardly have conducted to shores gloomier than those they reached one is a politicians neglected daughter whose quixotic generosity entraps her into a foul marriage whence she emerges a creature who  always did what she was told the other is an author famous for a novel of south africa and she is the bright elusive lady in our quotation the man whom she thought might inspire a chapter wheedles her into adultery snubs her pen into silence finally lays his mean and faithless spirit bare before her yet never calls to the loving animal in her nature without shaking her with a frenzy of obedience for he is essentially belami a creature with genius in his flesh like the debauched journalist who prowls through de maupassants immortal pigstye there is no escape from his evil allurements save by death or flight imagine these women moving in the highest circles about the time of the jameson raid imagine finance in hundreds of thousands and controlling them a great softhearted jew who bawls that wrhen the jew is honoured as a jew he will shout in his synagogue  i believe in christ thank the great god i can say it now there is indeed plenty of bustle and chatter and actuality to persuade us that joan and aline are women of an unremote yesterday the vulgar references to gladstone are to ba regretted and it must be confessed that the identification of fictitious persons with public events is managed rather unadroitly one suspects a roman  def but there is neither losk nor key the strength and intensity of the novel however are beyond dispute  pigs in clover by frank danby 6s

persuades her to marry him having learned how she has been betrayed and deserted by the brother he now disowns it is difficult to believe that even aline could be so innocently impervious to friendly warnings while louis and joan renew their old acquaintance in karls absence and that when she finds joan weeping in louis arms she did not grasp the full significance of the situation unless we accept her as a wholly irresponsible imbecile alines earlier schoolgirl romance and its culmination in marriage smith the drunken jockey jack forrest are admirably well done and the hiding of that scandal and the farreaching consequences of it all help in the shaping of a well imagined and ingeniously constructed plot frank danbvs references to the late mr gladstones home rule policy are as
