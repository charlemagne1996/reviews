B7611,['9040671'],  peveril of the peak literary notices by the author of waverley c whatever the extent of the genius and invention of the author of  waverley we know not that it is a whit moro surprising than the singular aptitude with which he stimulates attention and the felicity of manoeuvre by which he tantalises curiosity we question if a committee formed pf lotteryoffice keepers and

of the author sir geoffrey peveril is a good portrait of the hospitable but despotic country gentleman of hia day abounding in feudal prejudices and a plentiful lack of brains his puritanic neighbour major bridgnorth is but so io and he somewhat unaccountably diverges from a calm man of sense into a gloomy fanatic without a sufficiency of predisposing canse for the alteration the countess of derby is raised from the dead to little purpose except to give motive to a most inexplicable villain of the name of christian whose brother she had executed for treason in her petty sovereignty of man attention is exceedingly roused by this character but it is entirely in the excitation of a curiosity by a species of unaccountable versatility which is very poorly accounted for the hero julian peveril we have already said is nobody  and his counterpart alice however lovely in description is in action nothing at all and is this ailby no means for how could the author of  waverley dispense with the agency of a something mysterious and fantastic  in the present instance the personification is peculiarly grotesque the intriguer christian has a natural daughter by a moorish female whom if we un derstand the story fright he disposes of in her infancy to a dutch tumbler but afterwards redeems on a supposition of making her useful to his purposes this girl ie ted to hekere that his executed brother is her father and in eon sequence is induced to counterfeit deafness and dumbness in which supposed state she is received as a sort of elfin attendant on the countess of derby whose destruction is sought and whose most secret intentions she thereby gets at without suspicion this feasible scheme is however defeated by her imbibing an uncontrollable penchant for julian peveril who being related to the countess ia brought up with her son the young earl of derby and in consequence thrown in the way of this mysterious attendant when therefore he is induced to take some dangerous packets to the catholic friends of the countess during the ferment created by the popish plot she attends him from time to time as a kind of esprit follet until at length we find her a woman of wit speech and spirit although doomed to love in vain and to intrigue to no purpose either for her father or herself the dark moorish yet piquant aspect the slight symmetrical person profusion of dark hair and almost supernatural agility from her education in the tumbling line altogether make up a perfect nondescript and we fear not a very happy one the general conception approaches to j extravagance and the action assigned to it is almost ridiculous only think ladies of a girt agreeing to act deafness pand dumbness for several years and to be pitied and durwarded m such by the man she adored i eran in romance there should be some verisimilitude  upon the whole we think that  peveril and  nigel jjnjr rank pea on a par although charles ii falls tar tefamd jamesil in happiness of

grounds indeplently of the mythological and philological interest attached to the dear existence of these stones this collection is valuable for another reason in it is preserved authentic remnants of pure scotch gaelic in the spoken lic as it flow exists there are three elements the irish gaelic of the chi bithe printed religious gaelic of later times which dates after he f  anntion ad the pure scotch gaelic of the morven and tine weurchan districts of ar leshire and of the western islands which b lenained uncorrupted by the english idioms that exist in perthshire d the lrishisns elsewhere the pure vernacular language is more perfectly werved in legendary tales and in poetry orally handed down than in written rw into which foreign idioms must gradually creep hence the value of p cl pupular ales as these and of such poetry as that of the uncultivated d3 published recently in the book of the dean of lismore it is another qesti how far it is desirable to foster the gaelic language or to let it die vttif it is to be preserved there can be no doubt on this point that it ought tobe preserved as far as possible in its original purity in these ballads nd stories handed down from generation to generation by oral tradition perfection of the original dialect is a necessary ingredient mir campbell beu collected these tales from the mouths of the speakers and thus he has done good service in preserving his favourite language pure and uncorrupted on these various grounds there can be but one verdict upon the three first lous of mr campbells book every one must thank him for his work and congratulite him upon the result of his undertaking it is a disagreeable task to find fault with what has given us so much pleasure but it is the duty of the reviewer to state his conviction honestly and it is more satisfactory for the author to see such a conviction expressed h toreadso many lines of undiscriminating laudation miscalled criticism the publication of the fourth volume is to be regretted twothirds of this rolume are occupied by the resuscitation of the ossianic controversy most people considered that it was buried and left to the oblivion of its grave it was not beautiful in its life in its resurrection it is not more imposing mr campbell raises the dead body but he fails to galvanise it into existence not one man in a hundred who will read his book can now feel the smallest interest in that exhausted controversy and if any interest was excited it would not be satisfied with the manner in which mr campbell reopens the discussion he is indeed an easy and agreeable controversialist neither flippant nor sarcastic but pleasant bantering and on this subject sensible but he is unsatisfactory he does not grasp the question thoroughly or handle it vigorously he is sadly inconsequent and inconsistent he begins with clearness and logical precision but soon falls away into digression and rambling desultory writing the reader is left much where he was he closes th book and has learned nothing similar accusations must be brought against mir campbells mythological fragments and his plea for gaelic there is throughout both these portions of his book a want of scholarlike thoroughness the argumentation is feeble sometimes frivolous and the whole discussion is pervaded by a superficiality that is the reverse of satisfactorv the following passage will show that this accusation is well founded if it was important for the interests of the state to found a chair of sanscrit which nobody speaks surely there ought to be some means of learning gaelic devised for england where a large section of the people speak the language sti this is unworthy of mr campbell on the same principle he would abolish all the chairs of latin and greek in the different universities and would establish in their place professorships of the language of the japanese and the maories it is of a piece with these two passages which at best are trifling and superficial iny one who knows gaelic can easily put a meaning on numbers of italian ames for example monte soracte monadh sorachan mountain peak or hi1lo is a small peaked mountain standing alone near rome monte afppennino mlonadh na beinne the mountain tract of the hill country is at last as descriptive in gaelic as italian and the sounds are very like still  english is a  bar to the advancement of proprietors if they cannot speak those who pay their rents and it is the want of english not the pos ion of gaelic which retards the advance of those who seek employment ere english is spoken so highland proprietors should learn gaelic and teach rlish gaelic is no bar to advancement it did not clog the steps of the lord ricegeneral or his brother the ambassador or of the vicechancellor or of us of other men of mark whose learning included gaelic it has not ighed in my slower race through life and it gave me a stock of sounds which in other languages and which an english tongue can rarely pronounce wt do not fec fn controvert the position advanced in this last passage fallacy implied in the use of the word  advancement  must be plain to r campbell himself when a man of mr campbells ability allows hims to write on a great question in this very inefficient manner his best iise is that his celtic proclivities at times get the better of his reason in pa for gaelic and in his idealisation of the highland costume on which etio we lo not propose to enter his celticism becomes ungovernable otally forg ets his acceptation and assertion of the aryan theory of lan and instead of looking upon gaelic as an offshoot of aryan he appears consider aryan as an offshoot of gaelic he gets upon his hobby and it away with hiii it is as uncontrollable as jains niare to whom the sea landare all one it gives its front to the sea and its back to the  and son carries him beyond his depth and leaves him hopelessly at it i a pity that this volume has been published in it mr campbell up then questions which he ought either to have left untouched or to worked out with much more thorough elaboration any one who has the masterly dissertation on subjects similar to those here treated at the ecftcent of the dean of lismores book by mnr w f skene will rle the difference between the vigorous writing and forcible reoning e ane and the colloquial ineffectivenems of the other  popular tales of the west hiejhlands orally collected with a translation bv j f campbell vols iii and iv edmonston  douglas we have two more volumes of mr campbells contributions to the existing mass of celtic literature they will be perused perhaps with some disappointment by those who received with alacrity and pleasure his former two volumes and readily appreciated the hearty nationality and good humour of the collector it is however in the nature of things that a second gleaning should not offer such rich results as the first the first of these new volumes contains mythological tales fables and ossianic ballads and the last is a volume of dissertations by mr campbell on the ossianic controversy gaelic poetry british traditions highland dress ornaments and mythology of the ossianic portion a good deal of the interest has been forestalled by the recent publication of the dean of lismores book and other ossianic publications nevertheless such versions as mr campbell has collected will be of use to the celtic scholar the compiler however entertains the ambition of setting the ossianic controversy at rest once and for ever but in this he mistakes his capabilities  as a collector he has done good service but he has too little of the critical faculty to render his opinions of much value most highland gentlemen imagine that nobody but a highlander is competent to pass judgement on their literature or on the genuineness of a certain portion of it but this ian entire mistake the mere possession of a knowledge of highland gaelic is of little moment for the purpose in view with whatever facility a man may speak gaelic that in itself is no evidence of his capacity to pass judgement on the genuineness of a single ossianic poem this will be apparent to any one who considers how few englishmen well read in english literature would be competent to pronounce a verdict on any newlydiscovered poem said to be by gower or chaucer how many englishmen who have not made such things their study are there at the present day who would discover rowleys poems to be forgeries from a mere inspection of their diction  indeed the general critic unacquainted with gaelic who has compared the poetic evolutions of thought and sentiment in other languages ii far more likely to come to a right conclusion i such matters than the mere speaker of gaelic but the critic av ho is now required to take th matter in hand is the scientific philologist who shall be neither a scotchman an irishman a welshman nor a breton at least in feeling and prejudice but a celt one who shall take up th whole of the literature of the celtic races and edit their legendary and traditional relics with true impartiality philosophic insight scrupu lous comparison and broadness of view suojb an investigation would clear up much that clark and perplexing in the history of one of the most interesting of the races in these islands among the celtic races none deserve moiecareful consideration for their literature thao the welsh as m renan himself a breton has shown with great ability in his essay  sur la poesy celtique and his countryman m hersart de villemarque also has declared the same thing in the preface to his translation of the poemes des bardes bretons published in paris in 1850 perhaps m renan with his vast philological learning and philosophic breadth of mind is the only maa of the day capable of embracing the whole range of celtic literature and marshalling the literary treasures of its various dialects in due order and showing the affinities which subsist between the different legends in the different countries of all the labourers in the field of celtic antiquities who have hitherto done good service none deserves more honourable remembrance than owen jones the poor peasant of myvyr who unassisted by patronage devoted his life to the preservation of the literature of his country he came up t london a poor boy engaged as a clerk in somecity establishment and after forty years f selfdenial with the accumulations of his hard won scanty earnings published the myvyrian archaeology at his own cost in 1801 and 1807 and it is from this repertory that sharon turner was enabled to draw his welsh legends and bardic poems in the first volume of his history where they first attracted the attention of m villemarque it was a work which might havebeen done by a king an institution or a society ofthe noble and the learned but it was accomplished and scrupulously accomplished by a poor welsh peasant nor must we forget the great service rendered to the literature of her country by lady charlotte guest whose three splendid volumes of the mabinogion with their fine paper type and steel engravings form a direct contrast in costliness of production tethe three modest and closelyprinted quartos cf poor owen jones the mabinogion is however also an invaluable treasure and there are the favourite topics of the most celebrated troubadours of mediaeval europe to be found in all their primitive beauty and simplicity for the stories of arthur aud guinevere of geraint nnd the rest of the knights of the round table of the famous  parceval le gallois of the  chevalier au lionall these are pure welsh li breton ont fait les lats says a poetess of the thirteenth century andy without any disparagement to sir thomas mallory or mr tennyson few can have any notiaia of the primitive beauty of these old tales till they read them in  the mabinogion it is curious however that the mabinogion clas of story seems to have no points of contact with taliesin and the bardic literature yet the welsh popular tales have certain undoubted analogies with the gaelic legends arthur and guinevere for example have a certain likeness to finn or fion and grainne his wife and lancelot and diarmaid have a resemblance for in both canes the beautiful warrior is the cause of the infidelity of the queen and in both eases he is more tempted than tempting a resemblance has also been attempted to be traced between oisein or ossian and taliesin hut on this as on many other points criticism will suspend its opinion till philology has done it work with more scrupulous severity  the literary iaier popular tales of the west highlands orally collected i with a translation by j f campbell two volumes edinburgh edmonston and douglas a better book of its kind than this no country possesses dr dasents norse tales are of high value and the relation of scandinavian mythology or legend to our own folk lore as well as to the traditions of the east is very close but gaelic of the british islands interests us even more than the traditions of the norse and mr campbell while he takes in his work as a collector all the interest of a philologist and shows a complete sense of the value of literal accuracy in placing the old popular tales of the west highland gaels within reach of all students of literature proves himself by the manner of his introduction to be not only a scholar but a man of genius his vi porous and graphic english and his curious felicity of illustration are of a sort very seldom to be met with in asciation with the scholarly exactitude for which these tolumes are conspicuous it is a very great addition to the value of the work that not only are the stories taken in gaelic from the lips of west highlanders collated compared and when proved by the form of their frequent occurrence to be true traditions of the gael set down in the closest of translations all the closer for being also nervous english but the gaelic itself has been taken down and printed hector urquhart gamekeeper at ardkinglas on loch fyne and hector maclean schoolmaster at ballygrant in islay have been mr campbells chief helpers in this part of his work a body of gaelic literature is thus taken from the lips of the people and fixed before the ministers and schoolmasters shall have silenced the last reciters of tradition that has lived through generation after generation the old days of telling tales or sgeulachd by the highland fireside are even now passing away as hector urquhart depoes i knew an old tailor who used to ted a new tale every night during his stay in the village and another an old shoemaker who with ilis large stock of stories about ghosts and fairies used to frighten us so much that we scarcely dared pass the neighbouring churchyard on our way home it was also the custom when an aodia or stranger cele brated for his store of tales came on a visit to the village for us young and old to make a rush to the house where he passed the night and choom our seats some on beds some on forms and others on three iokestd i 5insulto gh now ta  ju u i ha o whn a rfaed acor ca om to persan in the gtheave the goodman 1 th e uually

riddles in the solving of which all zn the hoos had to tax their ingenuity if one of the party put a riddle which asnot osved thatnight he went home with the title of king of riddles besides this there was usually in such gatherings a discussion about the fei which comes from fantamdh giant the fantaibh were a body of men who volunteered to defend their country from the invasions and inroads of the danes and norwegians or loclusia fiu who was always called king of the fein was the strongest man amongst them and no person was admitted into the company who was les in height than he however much taller i remember the old black shoemaker telling us one night that fiunk had a tooth which he consulted as an oracle upon all important occasions he had but to touch this tooth and whatever he wanted to know was at once revealed to him the above is all i can at present readily call to mind of the way in which the evenings were spent in the highlands thirty or forty years ago the minister came to the village in 1830 and the schoolmaster 1 soon followed who put a stop in our village to such gatherings and in their place we were supplied with heavier tasks than listening to the old shoemakers fairy tales from that period till i collected the few in this collection i have not heard a tale recited on going to visit my friends last summer i expected that i would get some old tales among them but i found that the most of the old men who used to relate them in my young days had died and the few who were then alive of them were so old that they bad lost their memories so that i only got but a trifle to what i expected it was doing no small service to literature to save these tales from perishing giving them to the english student in his own language to the gael and the student of gaelic in the exact words of the teller with the tellers name and habitat assigned to every one as precisely as a botanist would name the habitat of any plant in his collection mr ijrquhart in the letter we have quoted speaks of tales of the fein or fenii the first of our volunteers the irish and scotch gaels have many of these legends in common for all tradition bears witness to the close association in old timesin the third century if we may accept the date commonly assigned to fionnbetween ireland and the western isles of scotland and that mainland of alban the alpland or highland from which we have derived the name of albion the fein were the first of british volunteers sworn say the irish legends to defend their shores against invasion and each bound to fight nine men of any other nation who should challenge them their marvellous qualifications have been often told oisin ossian the son of fionn commanded the more ambitious of the two clans into which it split and he according to the book of hoath was sole survivor from the battle of gabhra in the year 296 he could live therefore to have his dialogue with st patrick and to be unwillingly converted by the saint quite apart from the extinct controversy about macphersons ossianie work which is now generally admitted to have been a sentimental rendering of gaelic traditions into a form suited to the english humour of his day all that can now be collected of traditions of the fein has a strong interest three years ago a weak effort was made by mr j h simpson in poems of oiain bard of erin to present to the public these traditions from the irish side his book included six or eight fenian traditions orally collected from among the mayo peasantry and incomplete and unsatisfactory as it was it has in the absence of a better certain literary value we trust that mr campbells example will now stimulate some irish scholar to do for the gaels of his own island what has been done so thoroughly for those of the western highlands giving as mr campbell has given precise authority for all that he prints and the gaelic of the storyteller as well as his own translation mr campbell himself with curiosity strongly excited and much baulked during a visit to the isle of man asks for a manx man who will fix also the legends of the manx gaels before in these days of schoolmasters who consider it their duty to discountenance all oldwives tales the oral literature that he compares aptly to the driftwood floated from a faroff world shall have been utterly destroyed we may question the speculation that can find analogies between the fairies and the lapps that will trace celtic fairy legends back to the supposed tatar tribes thinly spread over europe before the days of the great halfl historical invasions of cimmerians and goths those tribes that according to professor worsaae left their traces in the coast barrows containing only tools and weapons of shaped stone pass for the aborigines of europe who are represented in the south by the basques and in the north by the finns esths and lapps but there is ground even for that speculation which appears so fanciful and it is not so hostile as at first sight it may appear to another speculation that connects the fairy with the peri however that may be it is on this earliest period of european history that we may expect light to be thrown by an extended study of the popular traditions of all nations there can be no doubt also that this is the right time of year for a profound speculation on the fairies mr campbell who has himself spoken gaelic from his childhood went systematically upon storyhunting tours as other men engaged by other sciences set out upon botanical or geological excursions his specimens were of a kind to be got only by the skilful thus we are told how he went at easter to a highland district near the lowlands where a gamekeeper bad marked down a lot of taletellers and i was soon convinced that there was plenty of game though bard to get the difficulty may be worth some explanation for it exists elsewhere and bears on the collectior of tales everywhere highland peasants and fishermen especially those dwelling near the lowlands are shy and proud and even more peculiarly sensitive to ridicule than peasts elsewhere mauy bawc a lurking belief in the truth of the sioies whi they tell man a 3 eated castlatom tha wi ym with a better educaon will la1g at the bliet northwest the stay an the nu raw and his landuage f he should bwei enough to ventin on english and betroa his knowledge of seultachd and his creed e cannot im n that any on out of his owf clan am possibly be amused by his fivolous p sim no one ever has hitherto he sees every year a summer flood of tourists of all a ou ring through his loa sandglens but he knows as little of them as they know of him the shoal of herrings that enter loch syne know as much of the dundoer on the hialssde a londoners and highland peasants know of each other each gets an occaioial peep at the other as the deer may see the herrings capering on the locheach affeeb the other slowly but surely as the herrings do drive away the wild deer by attracting men to catch them but the want of a common language here as elsewhere keeps highlands and lowlands celt and saxon as clearly eparate as oil and water in the ame glass the first step then towards the acquisition of a story is to establish confidence it may be that the wouldbe collector sees before him a strapping lad dressed in the garb of a west country fishermana rough blue bonnet jacket and trousers he steps out and ranges up alongside the highlander glances from under his busby eyebrows and sees with his sharp grey eyes that the new comer is a stranger he looks rather like a saxon highland curiosity is strong and he longs to ask whence he comes but politeness is stronger and it would be uncivil to begin questioning at once so with a nervous kick of one foot and a quick shy glance the fisherman jerks out  its a fine day  tha n latha briagh  the day is fine replies the stranger and as he speaks the whole face and manner of his companion change as if by magic doubt and hesitation suspicion and curiosity become simple wonder his eyes and his heart open wide at the sound of his native tongue and he exclaims you have gaelic  you will take my excuse by your leave but what part of the gaeldom are you from  and then having found out all that is to be discovered the ice being broken and confidence established it oozes out gradually that the fisherman knows a story and after much persuasion he tells it while he rows the gentleman who can talk gaelic across a high land loch at parting he adds that he has only told it to please a  gael and that he would not have said one word to a gall stranger but the man who is fluent in his boat is shy and awkward when set down to repeat his story for transcribing and it is only when set with one of his neighbours whom he knows that his story is got on paper or it may be an old dame in a tall white mutch with a broad black silk band a red cloak and clean white apron she is seventy and can walk ten miles she has known all the neighbouring families for generations if you can claim cousinship with any she is your friend but she will praise the ancestors and tell of the adventures of bob roy the gregoracl the last of the freebooters but mary can you say murachag and mionachag huch my dear that is an ursgeul that is nonsense the good being bless you i knew your grandmother etc etc so one must rest contented with the fact that old mary knows one tale and probably many more which a weeks persuasion might perhaps extract and so forth the tales when got are often rude but sometimes excellent even to the spoilt modem taste the riddles in which celts delighted as much as the early anglosaxons are singularly pointless but some of the fables are as neat as man can wish nothing for example can be better than the fable of the fox who sat on his tail for a gossip with the cock in the farmyard and asked him how many tricks did your  mother teach you    three he said  how many have you been taughttwo or three thousand i know one that is capital i can shut my left eye and scream so as to wake a parish i can do that said the cock so he shut his left eye and began to crow with all his might the fox on the blind side of him snapped him up and was running away when the farmers wife looking out of doors cried iheigh fox stop that is  my cock tell herthe cocks yours whispered the victim so the fox opening his mouth cried to the dame the cock is mine  then it was his no longer out of a tolerably thorough study of the folk lore of all nations that has based on works like this but to which few so good as this are likely to contribute a most interesting and important book has to be written we have in these tales variations upon bluebeard and upon known stories of almost every land thus the incident in the battle of the birds of the giants beautiful daughter hid in a tree top over a well we read last with all its details as an incident in one of jacob ayrers plays a german translation of the english play from which shakespeare may have taken the first notion of the tempest  popular tales of the west highlasdst  the northwestern perts of scotland says an old dutch geographer are inhabited by irishmen the southeastern parts by englishmen this distinction one of the highest importance when these words were written is now of little practical value and is hence often overlooked intercourse between the two races to which he refrrs having almost obliterated the differences between them it must be clearly apprehended however by any one who would understand aright the history of scotland or the subjects discussed in the learned and able introduction to these volumes the scottish lowlands densely peopled by an english population were at all times permeable to the influences acting upon the civilised countries of europe every new continental school of philosophy or literature sent a wave of thought or feeling over this island which only broke when it reached the welldefined frontier of the highlands the old scottish knights who threw off the yoke of the english kings were closely connected with france and through france with all the latin countries of southern europe some of them indeed had been educated in the schools of paxis need we feel surprised then to hear that robert brace when he osted weary and travelstained by loch lomond side under the birch and the rowan trees with his mailclad followers withthomas randolph and hugh de ia hay and good sir david de berkelay read to cheer their spirits and wile away the time tales of gallantry and prowess from the pages of an old french romance a generation later and the first great poem in the english tongue recorded the exploits of the good king and his companions and told by its references to the nitingale and its use of the commonplaces of romance how much the literature of scotland had been influenced by the troveres and the troubadours the reformation burst forth in germany and forthwith appeared the evidence of a close intercourse between scotland and the low countries before the storm had reached the frontier of france the northern parliament had passed an act to prohibit  skippers  from introducing heretical books from the continent and friars were denouncing from the market places as familiar namesmartin luther that saw loon black bullinger and melanctoon a ery different state of things prevailed in the highlands there the people spoke a language unintelligible to the english of the lowlands their flinty hills attracted no foreign priesthood their old celtic institutions repelled feudalism no norman aristocracy introduced into the land the study of southern romance no highland students rose to fame at pari or padua the irishry or selvages of the highlands lived apart altogether from the traditions of the great continental world with ireland however the connexion of the highlands was intimate just as the english dialects of the people melt into each other between london and aberdeen the dialects of the erse pass gradually into each other between cork and inverness the people of the highlands ireland and the isle of man formed indeed one people the early history of the erse race is ill undertood six centuries before christ they are supposed to have reached the british islands already occupied by the welsh or british races and to have settled in ireland and northern scotland their oldest traditions throw little light however on this event they record the exploits of the brave tribes of the feene and more especially of fin mac coul thegreat hero of the race it is frm one of his epithets  miledh the warrior that the monkish chroniclers devised the story of milesius the word seene being after a similar fashion perverted into phamician the poems which record the exploits of the seene bore in some respects the same relation to the erse people that the homeric poems bore to the greeks many ments of them are yet preserved by oral tradition some have been committed to writing the gaelic poems of ossian which were formed of passae from poems of the feene have been proved to be authentic and he who now calls their genninenes in question

the persons from whom they have been gathered are housemaids nurses and old women drovers fishermen blind fiddlers and tinkers tailors and shoemak are however the principal tribuators the reason is

gatherings the sgeulachd have been set down just as they were told by mr campbell he well remarking that it would be as absurd to tamper with such relics as to gild an old copper coin or to paint the fossil bones of an ichthyosaurus one of the most striking and characteristic of these highland tales is that of i the southeast maiden told by an old fishean in the hebrides it is a tale to be found in all the european langaages it resembles an irish  fenian story taken from a very old ms there is something much akin to it in sanscrit it is a version of shortshaiks in the norse tales of dasent grimms german tales contain it its incidents appear in the classical stories of  perseus and an dromeda and hercules and hesione it is in the italian of strapanola as fortunio and in the french of the6 cabinet des fees it is in every lan guage in europe as st george and the dragon it is the story of sheep shanks  in a ms collection of lowland scotch tales made by mr peter buchan in 1847

to say he hag  set down stories told him by the egyptian priests which reappear in the high land tales k in the introduction to which we have already referred mr campbell endeavours to ascertain the date of the tales he has recorded and to ascertain whether his countrymen have derived them from other european nations or have inherited i them from old primaeval times to some it may be difficult at first eight to under stand how this is possiblean illustration may serve to explain it when an old wall was disinterred some years ago in paris a dispute arose as to its age some said it was roman others that it was medkeval  let us pull down one square ard of it said an antiquary  and i will be bound to say that you will find precise evidence of its date the wall was dragged down and in the very heart of it there was found an onamnt of the renaissance the building was proved to belong to a late period in modern history mr campbell has subjected these tales to a somewhat similar testcomparbng them with other stories to ascertain if they contain incidents which indicate the source by which they have head this island examined in this way he thinks that they have not been rived through the same channels as the old fairy tales but like the breton irman and norse tales recently published in truth ae directly derived from people in a very primitive stage of civilization here are a few of the consi rations which lead to this conclusion the hero often saves many maidens and weds them all this implies a state society at the period of their importation among the irish people

popular tales that combs were but those who have travelled among halfcivilized people understand what is meant when the knight lays his head on the ladys knee and she dresses his hair the giants may

B2967,['4373322'],  wives and daughters some such gentle assuagement of sorrow as many have felt on looking at the face of a beloved one for the last time and noting the perfected beauty that has come upon it with the coming of death will be felt by those who have known and loved the authoress of this book in recognising the grace of its design and the completeness of its execution much as literature lose by losing mrs gaskell in the ripenes of her power regret in tempered by the reflection that her eighteen years work has been crowned by three books at least that will rank as masterpiecescousin phillis sylvias lovers and wives and daughters it is too early to estimate the exact value of these stories but it is certainly not too much to say of them at onceas the editor of the cornhill magazine says in his concluding  wives and daughters an everyday story by mrm gukell with eighteen ro by george du a two volwe london 8uut remarks on the book now before usthat they are  some of the truest and purest works of fiction in the language in many respects they stand alone in no other works of fiction since those of mliss austen has the individuality of the writer been so completely sunk in that of the characters she has portrayed such an achievement implies extraordinary creative faculty and something of the greatness of the measure in which it was possessed by mrs gaskell may be recounised by comparing any of her later works with the best of those of miss austen both novelists have dealt with everyday life its people and its incidents but with an imnmense difference of perceptive power the pictures drawn by the authoress of  sense and sensibility  are clear fresh reliable as the finest photographs those of mrs gaskell as it seems to us more resemble in largeness of treatment the finest paintings of meissonnier on this account we are inclined to think that when the time has come for determining the place of her works on the list of english masterpieces of fiction wives and daughters will be found to rank more nearly with the adam bede of george eliot than with any of the novels of miss austen it is a work above and beyond the reach of critical analysis absolutely faultless it is not but such faults as there are in it appear so insignificant when its great and manifest excellencies are taken into account as not to be worthy of serious notice what is the use of objecting to one of the most exquisitely true and beautiful characters ever drawn by a novelist that she is too good  a lover might as reasonably object to the white perfection of his ladys brow or desire the blemish of a mole or a freckle on her cheek the spotless goodness of molly gibson has nothing in common with such goodness as the authoress of  christians mistake and  a noble life delights to paint molly gibson is good because she is good not merely because mrs goskell has chosen to make her so there are characters enough with faults in wives and daughters  but the mind which created them was too wise to think of exaggerating either the goodness or the badness in them a long way within the extremes of milkandwater saintliness and brimstone sinfulness she had found a great deal of human nature and she was content to reproduce it as she found itneither better nor worse we have no puny preaching about good and evil no nurserytale moral in wives and daughters  but instead a wonderful exhibition of human character an admirable display of intuitive knowledge of human action thought and feeling story there is hardly any in the sense of plot yet there is not an incident in the whole book that is not made as interesting as an event in an ordinary sensation novel by force of strongly awakened sympathy as in ordinary life the experiences of each days existence to each character is a story rounded and complete so far as it goes how endlessly varied and deeply interesting we learn when novelists like mrs gaskell reproduce it of the characters in wives and daughters we are made to know the dailycontinued story more thoroughly than we are likely to know the story even of our own daily lives for few of us ever get so comprehensive a view of our own characters as mrs gaskell gives of those of the personages of her drama no matter how difficult the characterization may be one great charm of her work indeed is the apparent ease with which it has been accomplished the men and women whom she has set before us might be real presences only it is certain that in such a case they would lack the exquisitely perfect contour with whichseenlingly without effortshe has reproduced them in her book they cannot be described apart from the persons and events by which they are influenced to say that cynthiathe most remarkable character of allis a coquette is to convey no idea of the cynthia drawn with such masterful completeness by mrs gaskell she is the child of her mother and her character requires to be studied in conjunction with that of her mother to be thoroughly appreciated so it is throughout the story none of the characters introduced lead lives apart from their fellowcreatures and it is by the faithful representation of their conduct when brought into contact with others that their characters are portrayed few books in the english language or perhaps in any language exhibit such an extraordinary assemblage of perfectly represented individualities the story of  wives and daughters was not finished by the authoress  what promised to be the crowning work of a life says the editor of the cornbill magazine in which periodical the novel first appeared  is a memorial of death a few days longer and it would have been a triumphal column crowned with a capital of festal leaves and flowers now it is another sort of columnone of thosie sad white pillars which stand broken in a churchyard enough of the authoresss intention was known h wever to suggest what would have been the end of the story had she happily lived to finish it only one chapter was wanting to complete her design even without it her work is beautifully proportioned with it it would have been artistically perfect we turn reluctantly to the subject of the socalled illustrations of this charming book we should have been heartily glad if the publishers bad not thought it worth while to reproduce the eighteen caricatures which disfigured the pages of the cornhill and doubly disfigure those of the two volumes now before us that such examples of all that is perverse in taste can give any satisfaction to the readers of  wives and daughters we do not believe to our mind they illustrate nothing but the egotism of one of a small band of artists whose vocation appears to be to bring the admirable art of woodengraving woodcutting has latterly we believe been adopted as the more correct description into contempt,biography_contra

world an episode in the life of a celtic squire not one of that select and possibly very respectable body who for some strange reason delight in prefixing the definite article to their patronymics but an ordinary mortal to wit one cathal more of cappagh house we presume in the county of mayo the period embraced in the narrative is the interval between december 1844 and july 1851 it purports to be a recital of actual occurrences and the characters introduced upon the scene we are assured are all drawn from life the second title to this work appears to us not to have been happily selected the principal deduction from the history before us as we apprehend being nothing more than that it is highly inexpedient for a landed proprietor to allow an unitarian to build a chapel on his estate from such a cause was it that most of the misfortunes d tailed in these volumes arose mr more and his mother we are informed had for a length of time exerted all their best energies in the management of their extensive territorial possessions and the amelioration of their tenantry on a stormy night in december 1844 their hospitality was solicited by two travellers whose carriage had broken down near the entrance to the domain the strangersfather and sonof the name of schelling were pressed to pass a few days at cappagh  they became acquainted with the rector of the parish mr hyde and his daughters catherine and agnes the individuals thus brought together make a series of agreeable excursions together in the vicinity from the conversations that ensue on these and other occasions we are led to infer that mrs more was a sensible intelligent old lady somewhat bigoted in her persuasions but sincere and amiable in every relation of life impressive eloquence she was in form a slight withered old woman worn by care and thought grave and gentle in her manner generally silent but when she chanced to speak of a topic interesting to her she became calmly but impressively eloquent one did not perceive the power of her words at the moment of their utterance but they left a deeper afterimpression than such orators as i have heard speak ever produced on me the charm was given to them by her wise life devoted to the cause of truth and her hearty faith in her own sincerity for these are the cornerstones of eloquence on which indeed it is good to erect an arch of wellsounding words out without which for foundation the finest edifice of language will be but an unsafe height to both the speaker and the hearer even her silence was  eloquent reposethe eloquent repose of lifes sunset glowing in the softened brightness that succeeds a burning day during which much good work in the vineyard has been done mr schelling was of german origin and the prejudices of his country biassed his theories and seemed in some measure to account for the strong belief he entertained in mesmerism a mysterious agent which according to him accounted for all that seems to ordinary people inexplicable in the mysteries which hourly occur around them he was moreover an enthusiastic unitarian losing on no occasion an opportunity of diffusing the principles of the creed to which he belonged anxious to carry out his plans of benefiting his poorer neighbours cathal more had made many ineffectual efforts to raise a large sum of money upon a mortgage of his estates mr schelling learning this and being a man of great wealth offered at once to advance the money upon condition of mr mores countenancing the erection of a unitarian chapel on his land after considerable hesitation mr more accepts the proffered boon the unitarian furnishes 20000 at four per cent upon mortgage of the cappagh estates and in due course the chapel is erected it was admitted to be a really beautiful edifice in the early english style and the architect neglected no means of appealing to the love of beauty inherent in human nature as he proceeded with his work the little edifice however no sooner received the last finishing touches of the mason than it excited the pious horror and roused the indignation of the vicinity a mr ludwig heinser is appointed the officiating minister and he spares no endeavour to obtain a congregation though all his efforts prove ineffectual to secure proselytes to his cause mr hyde the rector strongly reprobating the conduct of mr more in the business sternly refuses to visit at his house until the obnoxious structure is closed or removed cathal more himself is at length induced to view his own conduct in the light in which it is regarded by his friends and determines to undo the mischief which he is persuaded origiginated with himself heinser in his endeavours to aid his sinking cause becomes implicated in the rebellious proceedings of 1848 and only escapes conviction through the generous interposition of mr more meanwhile mr schelling becomes seriously discomposed at the turn affairs are taking and at the manifest failures of his attempts to fill the chapel on which so much outlay had been lavished nor are his annoyances diminished when he learns that his only son after a long illness and shortly before his death bad abandoned the creed of his father for that of protestantism the fathers curse he said not a word to any of us but he walked straight to where his son sat by the window rupert had sprung up to meet him when he entered but he had not time to advance before his father holding out a paper to bim asked him sternly what he meant by what he had written it was the letter that his son had sent four days before announcing his adoption of our faith lam sorry he began retract it instantly interrupted mr schelling  i see what means have been used to kidnap you he went on looking round at us  but before their faces you shall retract he spoke between his teeth and his words grated through them with a malignity of tone i never heard equalled my father said rupert who seemed to gather courage when his father spoke so roughly to him  ask what else you will and i will obey but not in this matter  i cannot retract  at peril of a fathers curse at peril of beggary at peril of ruining these people whom you call your friends will you refuse p asked mr schelling still maintaining a forced quiet of manner though he grew livid with the effort  so help me god i must said rupert firmly  so help you god repeated his father sneeringly  for you will need his help but now hear me rupert schelling and may the echo of my words never cease in your ears i curse the hour you were born your life and death your name and your religion i cast you off for ever except to injure you and those you love and as these friends of yours here are dear to you they shall be the first to suffer he threw his sons letter on the ground and grinding it with his heel he turned and left the room as abruptly as ho had arrived  rupert dear rupert all will be well you have done well said mrs more to the unfortunate young man who had sunk on the sofa i went towards him and lifted one of his cold damp hands it was dropping with blood and already a little pool had formed on the cushion under his head he had broken ono of the larger bloodvessels and the red lifestream was welling from his mouth mr schellings proceedings towards the more family after his sons death evince the most decided hostility the origin of which feeling we are subsequently informed is attributable to lonsubsisting jealousy the loan from schelling to mr more is attended with the ordinary resultsthe foreclosure of the mortgage and the sale of the cappagh estate and the personal effects of the owner at this painful juncture however a true friend appears in the person of major wyndham who plays a prominent part in the narrative and who at the momentous crisis to which we have alluded purchases for mr more not only the cappagh house and park but the pictures and furniture endeared by former associations mr more marries one of mr hydes daughters and determines to  become a real working man and practical improver instead of an idle country gentleman he demolishes the obnoxious unitarian temple and erects upon the site a cross on which are engraved these words  in this place i cathal more of carragh built a unitarian chapel this cross witnesses my repentance july ad 1851 mr schelling disappointed in his schemes of vengeance and under a threat from heinser that he will disclose certain fraudulent transactions in which they have been engaged commits suicide  thus dramatic justice is satisfied such is a brief indication of the history of cathal more assuming that it is not a work of fiction there is certainly not much in it to criticise the authors style is simple and unpretending though some of his observations indicate both thought and reflection still we do not apprehend that this his first literary production is calculated to awaken much interest out of his own immediate circle if on the other hand cathal more be a work of the imagination it certainly will not attain much popularity among those who occasion the principal demand for such books and whose appetite requires a more exciting pabulum than they will find provided here our readers will observe that in accordance with our invariable practice we have abstained from entering into the religious part of the question but we have never before heard that the sect to

B582,"['8781385', '4696693']",  tales of fashion and reality by caroline frederica beauclerk and henrietta mary beauclerk first series smith o elder from the multiplicity of novels which are almost hourly appearing we are compelled to contine our notices within the narrowest limits we had accordingly made a memorandum to forget this volume of tales but more than one consideration has induced us to change our intention in the first place it has been made the town talk in a degree that has excited no common curiosity  and a great deal of very respectable wonderment has been flung away upon it as it seems to us not very reasonably this alone might justify if not require from us a brief notice of the work  but there is connected with it extrinsic matter of more weighty concernment than the merits of a book of ephemeral amusement let those merits be as considerable as they may the primary source of the notice which the  tales of fashion and reality have obtained from the public is the fact that they are the production of the scions of o noble house of persons well known iu the world of fashion the next cause of notoriety is that the authors are two rory young ladies not lon emancipated from the discipline ofthe nursery and their third and last notability is the singularities of style which mark their composition and which are in strange contrast and contradiction to what men commonly suppose to be the position and habits of young ladies of quality as to mere literary criticism that is soon dispatched from writers of such tender years imitation is the most that can bc expected originality cither of invention or of thought is totally out of the question then as for thc subjects what could two young ladies know either of the world or its inhabitants beyond the drawingrooms in which they are exhibited  in what could they feel an interest but in the great business of their sex and age lovelove modified as it is hy the necessities and the circumstances of the exclusive society in which they live and have their being  the scope and character of the work are therefore determined by a rigorous necessity in like manner it might have been concluded beforehand with an almost mathematical certainty that any approach to developeinent should not bc looked for that the world the authors world and its appearances must have been viewed only in its broadest outlines in its widest generalities and that the tales must be skeletons divested of all proportion and form but all this being premised the work all childish as it is is not by any means without merit nor unmarked by indications of latent capability the source of better things should time and circumstance ever combine to call it from a potential to an actual being the wonder of the case is not that two young and inexperienced girls should have failed to compose a book fit for the public eye but that they should have been able to work the scanty materials of their limited sphere of observation into anything like a printable shape the merit however and the rarity whatever they may be would in all probability have been overlooked and the tales maugre all their means and appliances of fashionable notoriety would have remained unknown to fame beyond the circle of acquaiiitancesand friends but for the rather unusual vehemence of language and of passion which has set readers sluring and has furnished them with ii subject for much silly persiflage lt would seem both from the words and the actions of the young lady heroines of this volume that the authors had no idea that there was such a thing as restraint or selfrespect in human nature the first wish of the heart is embodied in deed while the slightest disappointment in the execution of the hasty purpose is the cause of measureless rage and violenceconfounding all distinctions of rank sex or station thus we have a young lady exclaiming  lay a finger tm mc who darts and by lean ns iii dig his eyes ont aud again a

these tides  it being thought by many a rather good joke that such ii vocabulary should have been at the command of the fair authoresses we have some reason however for believing that the case is not quite singular and that must young persons however attentively they have been brought up contrive to pick up a good deal more than it is wise or discreet to talk of it is matter of notoriety that female lunatics in all mnks of life frequently evince a cognizance with ideas and with language which it would seem utterly impossible they ever could have heard uttered in their presence and this remark is of the last importance as illustrative of the wisdom of laving the foundations of female conduct in a childish ignorance of the realities of the world such ignorance is not to bc obtainedlittle iit least short of a miracle is requisite to effect that end if the coarsest vulgarisms of the populace can and we know that they do find their way into the most secluded nurseries and schoolrooms so also must a knowledge of a vast many other particulars which we vainly hope to hide from our children and still more vainly attempt to exclude as a means of mental and moral discipline but if such an end were attainable pa rents in general take the very worst means of arriving at it the vulgarities and coarsenesses which surprise the readers of these tales are part and parcel of the minds of that humble class of females who are so heedlessly brought round young women in the nursery and the schoolroom pains are taken to degrade the condition of the instructress the salary paid her is most paltry she is banished from the society of the heads of the family and her function is not deemed respectable  how then is it likely that any female fit for the task will submit to its humiliations we say nothing of servants and the intercourse which whether forbidden or permitted does take place between them and the children in almost all families we consider then the volume before us as good evidence of particulars which ina less degree perhaps are common to most young women in the writers walk of life and we consider that it has great value as an exponent of the sort of stuff which fills the minds of young ladies of fashionof the sort of education by which they are prepared to become th partners of men of intellect the mothers and guides of a future generation the evil is one of deep and serious import for it strikes at the very root of society such as are the mothers such must be the children  such as are the wives such will be the  husbands frivolity and vice cannot abide ut  home without corrupting all within its sphere  and when home ceases to be agreeable it is too  much to expect that it will long remain respecti able the world is now taking new forms and education must be remodelled to fit the rising j generation for its encounter how ill adapted  it is at present to the exigencies of the times the  volume before us speaks  trurnpettongued j and as example is more powerful than precept j we wish that such a striking specimen should be  extensively studied it is not alone the obvious l defect of moral development in these young  ladies but the wonderful ignorance of all things  beyond a particular exclusive circle which is  so calculated to excite surprise the world i of everyday lifethe world of labour of inj thistly of struggle is not even dreamed of lin their philosophy oh how ardently do j i wish says the heroine of the journal of i a debutante  that every one had a compej tency of ioool a year then lhere would be no arguing of fathers and mothers no breaking of girls hearts no family dissensions and very few unhappy marriages here is no thought of earning money still less of the possibility of an existence unsupported by  4001 a year this is the pervading character of the whole book  wherever the humbler ranks of life are alluded to the trait is a caricature oran absurdity  it is a representation of something heard of imaginedor at best something read of in a book yet such we believe is the ignorance of most young ladies of fashion even in families of no very decided aristocratic pretension  and these once again are the destined mothers of a coining generation  how their sons are to meet the contingencies of reform is a question of no ordinary import it is however impossible to peruse the work before us without being deeply interested in the fate of its joint authorstwo young and innocent brings thrust upon the world with minds so empty of all reallyuseful knowledgeso guiltless of one idea concerning their own nature or the real bearings of society its duties and its rights and upon their own position and prospects the very excess and extravagance of the love scenes they have described afford conclusive evidence that they have drawn from an imaginary and not a real worldthat they have created from the head and not from the heart it is simplicity and not corruption that has con ducted their pen  and the talent which they have evinced if common justice w ere done to it would fit them for higher ends than those even of successful authorship with pain are we compelled thus to allude to circumstances of a personal nature  the fault is with those if such there be who could luive prevented the publication and did not as respects thc public the opportunity for useful instruction is too precious to be lost and as regards the individuals we would fain hope that it is not yet too late to qualify them something better for the parts they are destined to perform in life by remodelling

things which are absurd with a good deal that is clever in this volume we have seldom seen a work of more unequal merit there is a mixture of poetry and prose in the contents the prose is the best the poetry is poor in the extreme the merit of the work chiefly consists in the insight it gives into the foibles arid follies of the fashionable world the volume professes to be only the first of a

punish his child himself these were the first blows he had ever given her thc child stood trembling and motionlessdo not beat her on my account certainly not on my account exclaimed agnes thus indirectly irritating him still more the father however struck but in the midst of the sadness and at the same time of the anger which his sufferings caused him he observed at length for the first

twilight in the midst of the christinastree which had not yet been lighted up the mother saw it she stood confounded as well as deeply mortified and a remorse seized her which broke out almost into a rage against albert he wished to leave the room but at the door his knees failed him agnes hastened after him seized him supported him in her arms il i scolded him and wept with him while he sobbed and struggled in vain for composure she made him lie down then she lighted up the christmastree and the father saw but only as in a dream everything prepared when all was ready she said to him bring thy child and he did so but the joy of the child was extinguished she lifted up the little golden hood and the white frockbut scarcely smiled and hid herself on her father the angel at the lop of the christmastree took fire it blazed up and the child admired in her little hand the ashes of the angel and the remnant of tinsel from the wings during the night the child suddenly sat upright her father talked with her for a long time then she appeared to fall into a slumber but called again to him and said in a low voice  dear father father do not be angrywherefore should i be angry my child ah

looked shuddering around of course there was nothing to be seen but whilst he looked with tearful eyes into the dusky room only for the purpose of averting his looksthe lovely child had slumbered away

disappeared with the blood from ber cheeks and now for the first time she had on the white frock and the golden hood encircled ber little head but not so close as to prevent a lock of her hair escaping from beneath the little incident of the white frock and the golden hood of which the child had been twice disappointed and which she wears only in her coffin is most touchingly introduced how many robes that life covets in vain are at last granted for a shroud shortly after the childs death albert quits his wife for a season during their separation agnes learns better to appreciate the claims of her husbandwhile he acquires still deeper patience for those infirmities which had still their root in her love it is the worthy aim of thc novelist to show that even the trials of genius are part of its educationthat its very wounds are furrows for its harvest with the development of this moral and the death of albert the story terminates what we have already said implies high praiseand our extracts will justify it but the volume is not exempt from the besetting errors of the german school ideas which might easily have been conveyed in simple and precise definitions are sometimes provokingly hidden under a veil of misty and elaborate phraseology the symbols by which the emotions and characters of the agents are indicated arc often so minute and unconnected as rather to demand an interpretation than to manifest a purpose allowing that much which seems affected arises from the difficulty of translating the idiomatic hi expressiveness of the original language into c

and described as the authorized rendering the other as 4the story of gosta berling by pauline bancroft flach the latter is certainly much curtailed though it reads better than the authorised version this novel or romance selma lagerlofs first venture was we believe first published in 1891 or 1892 miss flachs preface says 1894  but that is surely a mistake like the 4 story of an african farm it did not attract immediate attention but as soon as it began to be noticed the authors reputation rose of a sudden to a great height there is always something which excites suspicion in sudden reputations few people would contend that miss schreiners later works were on a level with the 4 african farm but in the case of selma lagerlof there has certainly not been a fallingoft most people however are agreed that her last novel antikrists miraklerit came out in the autumn of last yearis the best thing she has done of this a translation is announced no doubt we may look for one also of the intermediate 4osynliga liinkar 4unseen links before long we all know that if the iliad had never begun with its mrjviv aeist stu and so forth virgil would not have written more egotistically his arma virumque cano nor tasso his  canto 1 armi pietose e 1 capitano nor ariosto his le donne i cavalier 1 arnie gu amori le cortesie 1 audaci imprete to canto and 4 paradise lost would have had a different beginning in the same way it is impossible to say what scandinavian fiction would be like had it not the tradition of the old norse sagas lying heavy upon it one sees how this tradition has affected most of bjornsons tales but nowhere is the influence more apparent than in the book before us of selma lagerlof but though this inheritance does in the french phrase  leap to the eye it seems to have escaped the notice of a good many of our authors critics in her own country and elsewhere these have spoken of this 4gusta bedings saga as a work of untrained genius whose very defects were those of a wild originality it is nothing of the sort it was an ingenious idea no doubt to write the history of a certain small locality in varmland only sixty years ago in something the same way that the icelanders wrote their 4 eyrbyggia or their  weaponhrth sagas  and up to a certain point it has been excellently well done but the prototypes were easy to find there is no wild originality in the notion for this reason for all that the swedish word saga means no more than story miss tudeer has been well inspired in adhering exactly to the title of the original  still better inspired in giving a map on which are shown all the localities mentioned in the tale just such a map in fact as would be needed to make plain the histories of the icelandic 4 weaponfirth  or 4 waterdale in the edition of the original which has come under the eye of the present writer no such map is to be found from what has been said it may be gathered that it is not possible to give an adequate description of the plot of this novel gosta berling is a priest who has been suspended for drunkenness and when the story opens has been rescued from the lowest depths of the vice by margaret celsing of ekeby a virago who rules her own and her husbands property and who has esub lished a kind of almshouse for gentlemanly neerdoweels who are called the knights of ekeby he is represented as a magnificent man this gos ta barling  handsome as an apollo adventurous a great drinker but a poet for all that to women he is irresistible and a large proportion of the chapters of his history are devoted to his successive conquests but they turn out to be very innocent conquests for the most part so that mrs grundy may be reassured  nor do they lead to consequences so tragic as did the loves of a gisli or a gunnar of old first it is anna stjarnhuk gusta has promised to bring her back from a ball and marry her with one to whom she had been previously betrothed but he falls in love with the lady himself and she with

of somo private theatricals and is eventually turned out of house and home by her father fur her goingson and left to perish in the snow she is rescued by gusta and the knights of ekeby finally mure serious than all it is the young countess doh na whose love is innocent though it is passionate  but her innocence dots nut save her from being repudiated by her husband in all these adventures of gusta and in some separate ones of their own the knights of ekeby play a role not dissimilar to that uf balzacs thirteen one does not know whether to regard them as heroes or criminals their conduct to their benefactress margaret celling would stamp them with eternal infamy save that we have to take into account a mysterious sintram who is either a man or the prince of darkness himself we are never clearly told which and who sets people at loggerheads by devices which seem rather palpable there is a great sense of localityof topography one might sayall through the story which gives it a peculiar charm and there are some really fine descriptions of scenery on the other hand the authors style is a very long way behind that of the old sagas which she has taken for her models we get in the end sadly bored by the constant apostrophes to the reader of which the following may be taken as a specimen   44 friends  children of men you who dance and you who laugh i pray that you dance carefully and laugh kindly for much sorrow may come to pass if your thinsoled silken shoe treads uxn a tender human heart instead of the hard floor plank and your gay silver ringing laugh may drive a soul to despair it may be suggested that the greek gods did not steer the world from the cloudcovered heights of olympia  les aubes is the maturest work which its author  after m maeterlinck decidedly the most interesting figure in the belgian wing of the french army of literaturehas produced though still a young man m verhaeren may be said to be already in his third period his earliest work was of the senses he was preoccupied with the attempt to give an exact and sometimes even a brutal transcript of what he very literally saw and then he discovered an imagination and his visions began to take colour not so much from the things seen as from the personality of him who sawfrom the nerves mr symons would have it for he considers that the poetry of linnie verhaeren more than that of any other modern poet is made directly out of the complaining voices of the nerves but a further stage in the poets evolution was still to come without losing his unembarrassed view of material facts without losing his individual gift of various and coloured metaphor he has advanced to the possession of ideas les aubes is full of an idea works out indeed to quote mr symons once more a sort of deliverance through ideas it is largely planned as a criticism a prophecy even a menace to the modern civilizations on the one hand you see the festering cities and the farms ruined by progress and by narrow greed on the other not an impossible pastoral ideal built up again but the cities once more regenerated from within themselves herenien the man of ideas the man of books is leader of the revolt and the dawn is nigh at hand when the besiegers and the besieged of oppidomagne alike throw off the militarism of their worthless rulers and hail the new era of fraternity with garlands and iconoclasm mr symons has achieved his version with more selfsuppression than is common in translators he has made it his business to reproduce as far as possible the precise rhythm of m verhaerens vers libre only replacing with the authors approbation the rhyme of the original by blank verse and we think he has been unusually successful in catching some of the more characteristic qualities of his model the repetition playing with such wonderful effect on the nerves of the reader the almost ollendorffian simplicity of the main web of the dialogue lending itself to ollendorffian parody we mean but giving such value by contrast to the passages of vivid imagery to the occasional delicate symbolisms which it encloses here is a sample of the rendering chosen because of the rhythmic transitions over which it is victorious herenien in the midst of the beleaguered city addresses his wife   ab you indeed are mv wife when on a night in june loiik ago now sweetly you gave me your soul did 1 not swear that

the insensate skies the stars hurtle together and consume and the hot fiery ashes fall of course we feel that mr symonss gifts are rather wasted in this kind of work for after all how few there must be to whom 4les auhes can have a message who are not prepared to read it in the original we are glad to find that at last ostrovsky the russian dramatist has been introduced to the english public we say introduced advisedly for although a clever article upon his plays was published in the edinburgh review thirty years ago it remained unnoticed at that time russian authors were not in fashion and it is fashion that decides these things the present play presents a sad picture of domestic life in russia  but the tragedy might have been enacted in any other country a gentle impulsive girl is led astray through having a coarse unsympathetic husband and a harsh stepmother there is nothing especially tatar about this to use the cuckoo cry similar things have occurred and are occurring no doubt within the sound of bow bells the characters are powerfully drawn and the suicide of poor katia at the end of the play is deeply pathetic the peasant kuligin with his mechanical inventions is a genuine russian study the translation is accurate and very readable  we hope that this is only an instalment and that mrs garnett will follow it up by versions of some of the other plays of this

tudeer chapman  hall 6s this is a novel of a totally new kind saga is perhaps the best name for it although it is in some parts as emphatically not a saga as we understand the word as in others it is imagine a sentimentalist and heroworshipper brought up in a scandinavian wild rich in legend and stories of the great men and lovely women of a past generation and then imagine him many years after reconstructing the old society of which in his impressionable infancy and boyhood he had heard so much from nurses and elders then you have some notion of the book before us it is however more than that for not only is the author a sentimentalist and heroworshipper he is poet too and romanticist and he is filled with sympathy and compassion for the weak no less than with joy in revelry and courage so much for what he has what our author has not is sense of form and reticence he has given his saga with both hands flung incidents and reflections on the paper with the slightest thread to join them leapt recklessly now forward now backward into time explained some things forgotten others but the book lives none the less it is shapeless bewildering inconstant and all the time it is alive passionate vigorous picturesque and absolutely foreign to english methods of thought we return to the word saga with some relief that is certainly the best description gosta berling is a young priest who has been deprived of his sacred office oe account of his drunkenness he becomes a beggar the lowest of the low and is seeking death in a snowdrift when the majors wife of ekeby drags him forth and reasons him back to life thenceforward gosta berling is one of the ekeby cavaliers and for the rest of the book he is brilliant and handsome and masterful at once the strongest and weakest of men how he crosses the lives of others and through suffering finds himself and justifies the core of good that is in him that is the story but never was plot unfolded with more doublings and divergencies never was allegory if it is allegory so bravely tricked out in the garments of romance one passage can give no notion of so varied a book yet here is part of the conversation between the majors wife the most striking figure in the story and gosta berling but suddenly the majors wife was silentand took two or three turns about the room then she drew up a chair to the fire placed her feet on the hearth and rested her elbows on her knees  good god she said half laughing to herself  what i said was so true i didnt notice it myself dont you think gosta berling that most people in the

tell you boy i am nothing but a dressedup corpse god alane knows how little life there is in me  the beggar leaned forward in his ohair and listened anxiously the old lady rooked herself before the fire and never glanced at him as she spoke dont you think she continued that if i were a living soul and saw you sitting there miserable and sad with thoughts of suicide in your mind that i oould dispel them in a breath  i should have tears and prayers to move you and i would save youbut nowi am dead god knows how little life there is in me for the later life of the majors wife for the cavaliers who were of the tribe of the three musketeers and their escapades and for gosta berlings history the reader must go to this remarkable book himself he will find himself in a new world it is too long it is often tantalising and it is not too well translated but gusta berlings saga is very well worth reading  gosta berlings saga by selma lacinel translated bw lille tudeer 6s chapman and

review the authors sixth novelwhich strange to say has not appeared in a second edition a week before the date of announced publication  lady audleys secret aurora floyd  eleanors vic tory john marchmont legacy henry dunbar the doctors wife make eighteen volumes in two years there is no secret in the mechanism of the doctors wife from first to last there is neither mystery nor an attempt at mystification in this respect the tale differs from moat of miss braddon stories but otherwise the book bears a strong resemblance to her previous novels indeed its principal characters incidents and positions are reproductions of the old materials crime is the mainspring which sets the puppets in motion the chief actors are vicious and at the close of the story the moral teacher assigns impunity to one sinner and wealth to another just to encourage the others bigamy plays no part in the drama but as was the case in  henry dunbar the heroine is the daughter of a convicted forger after obtaining his liberation on a ticketofleave from portland this convict murders his childs lover and makes good bis escape to america in addition to forgery and murder the proceedings are enlivened by some innocent conjugal infidelity and an unsuccessful attempt at seduction by disappointing her heartless seducer and making her false wife stop short of adulterous intercourse with the man whom she prefers to her generous and devoted husband miss braddon lays claim to rank amongst writers of morality a notable damsel is isabel sleaford the forgers daughter and heroine she has eyes of a  bright orange colour her hair is blueblackand when the reader is first introduced to her a curl of this wondrous hair is seen straggling on her white throather throat very white with the dead yet yellowish whiteness of ivory in other matters the girl is more in the usual way of dirty london life she seldom wears clean linen rarely washes her hands and has some young brothers who are said to smell of outdoor amusements slender is the education which a father steadily pursuing the profession of a forger has bestowed on this yellowandblue child but she is very romantic yearns to be somebody particular and has been so thoroughly visited by the novels of thackeray mr dickens and sir e b lytton that she hopes some fine day to meet an earl in the old kent road who will take her into his cabriolet and forthwith make her a countess it may not be supposed that miss braddon wishes to insinuate that the works of the three novelists just named are more likely than her own healthy writings to stultify and demoralise a young lady on the contrary she takes every opportunity to speak a handsome word for those writers every fifth page of her book containing an allusion to the works of  boz and the names of ernest maltravers and edith dombey appearing not less than a hundred times in the course of the tale no blame therefore is cast on the authors because their works have had a deleterious effect in the case of miss isabel sleaford who hopes to become a grand lady in spite of her indolence and dislike of soap and water not only does miss isabel cherish this hope but the hope is fulfilled the author ridicules the girls folly and then brings about the accomplishment of her expectations first of all a young surgeon prosperous and of good repute falls in love with her at first sight and marries her without troubling himself to ascertain the fortunes of her papa who is serving his time at portland it is well known that professional men living in quiet country towns are wont to take unto themselves wives of whose private histories they know nothing the main work of the first volume is to accomplish this marriage very dreary reading is this first volume but it has one or two pleasant points in it miss braddon expresses contempt for  sensation literature and satirises the artifices by which mr sigismund smith writer for penny papers panders to the lust of his ignoble readers surely the author of lady audleys secret could point to novels published in three volumes which are as rich in impossible horrors as any of the tales devoured by the vulgar people  who like their literatureas they like their tobaccovery strong having accepted the country surgeon without loving him isabel wearies of his society before the end of their first week of married life the doctor is manly intelligent goodlooking and warmly respected by his neighbours but he is devoid of enthusiasm for shelley and is fond of pickled onions  he was her lord and master observes miss braddon though his fingers were square at the tips and had an abnormal capacity for the consumption of onions  spring onions all the year round onions isabel thought for those obnoxious bulbs seemed always in season at graybridge who can say that the convicts daughter had no good reason for hating this surgeon   she was only a week married  and already as she stood at the window listening to the slipslop of the everlasting rain she began to think that she had made a mistake ere many weeks have passed the young woman knows she has made a mistake and longs to be quit of her husband so that she may live happily with mr roland lansdell to whom she has given her heart a poet superbly handsome of aristocratic family and possessing a fine landed estate mr roland lansdell sees isabels yellow eyes converses with her is charmed with her romantic disposition and resolves to make her his mistress volume ii and partof volume iii are devoted to the romantic intercourse of isabel with the rich gentleman whose expensive costume and luxurious dinners are contrasted with the rustic clothes and plain fare of the country apothecary mad with vanity of the most contemptible kind isabel has clandestine interviews with mr lansdell and learns to loathe the bare thought of her husband whose name she makes the object of ignominious scandal at length mr lansdell proposes flight to the young wife  but isabel firmly rejects the proposal she loves mr lansdell she tells him so she accepts his addresses but she avont be wickedshe wont be his mistress actually miss braddon is under the impression that her heroine is guiltless of conjugal infidelity because she confines herself to sinning in thought and to certain acts which dishonour her husband without entitling him to the relief of the divorce court the termination of the story is not less immoral and foolish isabels father is liberated from portland hunts her out and demands money from her purse to satisfy this request she asks and obtains 50 from the man who still hopes to be her seducer the father not only takes the money but eventually robs mr lansdell of his life through mr lansdells evidence the convict was sentenced at the old bailey and now the forger encountering once more the  languid swell who mixed himself up in business that didnt concern him falls upon him with a bludgeon and beats him so ferociously that the blows after an interval of a few days result in death whilst mr lansdell is dying isabels husband is also drawing near his end brought on by typhoid fever the doctor dies with his last breath uttering avords of endearment to isabel and scarcely has the vital spark fled when isabel pays a visit to the dying roland lansdell who made her a faithless wife and almost made her his mistress the interview between the lovers is intended to be most pathetic the widow whose husband lies unburied assuring mr lansdell that he has no need to ask her forgiveness and mr lansdell commending the lady to the protection of his family mr lansdell dies penitent leaving the bulk of his vast property to isabel and his murderer escapes to america thus freed from her plebeian husband

B1880,['6724682'],  the deemster  a romance by hall caine in 3 vols chatto this book would be welcome if only on the ground that it is well worthy of the author of the shadow of a crime in shifting his scene of action from the hills of cumberland to the isle of man mr hall caine has left behind him none of his three great gifts of imagination pathos and humour and he has found a people even more distinct than  cumshire folk with characters as well suited to exhibit human passion in its simplicity and a dialect as rich and racy as any in the north of england in addition he has found a story of intense terror mixed with intense pathos readers of focsle yarns will not be surprised at the attraction of the isle of man and its people to the writer of romance and will be glad that the field has been entered by so capable an author as mr hall caine it is to be hoped that the deemster himself is not a character common in the island for he is the incarnation of all that is most mean and despicable in human nature selfish cruel crafty and cowardly he is the evil genius of the piece and is drawn perhaps more thoroughly and carefully than any other of the characters it is he who manages to draw to himself in his fathers lifetime all his fathers property and turns his defrauded brother out of doors it is he who buys his wife of her father the archdeacon and breaks her heart with his infidelity in the first years of their married life it is he who cultivates the evil in his nephew dan and invents the lie which brings about the death of his own son ewan all through the book from the beginning to the welldeserved misery of his death he acts as a subtle malign influence poisoning the air little he gets by it except his barren position of power and the hatred of ail utterly without religion but superstitious to extreme his time is spent in doing illdeeds and striving to bribe providence to avert punishment one of the least adroit and most ridiculous of villains the evil he tries to do is always rebounding on his own head and the devil himself must have laughed when after haranguing the people and the bishop his brother as to the illdeeds of the bishops son and declaring that he will not lift a finger against the man who killed him he turns round to find that the corpse which was the subject of his oration was not that of his nephew but of his own son ewan the fact that the evil done by the deemster is not generally the exact injury contemplated by him but the casual action of a spirit of evil emanating from his infernal disposition is characteristic of the book it is not by themselves only and their passions that the fates of the principal characters are determined  and it is this which distinguishes the deemster rom what are usually called  romances the term serves to distinguish it from the novel or picture of modern life and manners but despite its narrativeform the spiritual grandeur of its conception and the tremendous character of the forces engaged raise it to the region of tragic drama among these forces the passions of though characters no doubt play the greatest part but above beyond and around these are the unseen if not supernatural powers of accident it is not without the aid of a network of circumstance woven by superstition and misconception and a thousand other impalpable devils that the noble natures of dan and ewan are brought into collision and dragged down to death and hell what mr hall caine calls the perfidy of circumstance is the great motor of the drama and dreams and presages second sight and curses superstitious terrors and evil thoughts all of them giving wings as it were to diverse spirits of evil which make a havoc of noble characters and lives of fair promise perform for him much the same office as the loves and hatreds of the gods with their emissaries of fates and furies dreams and omens for the poets and dramatists of greece it is this that raises the deemster into the rank of highest art and makes it not so much a romantic story of a few human individuals as a tragic poem of human life and fate yet the manner is that of a simple tale the characters are not complex they speak plain unconventional unpoetical english often the homespun of manx of analysis of character there is little the narrative if singularly vivid and abounding in remarkable incident is told without strain  fine  as the writing is in the best artistic sense there is not a word of what is usually called  fine writing to use an epithet once in favour with critics the method of presenting the facts to the reader is objective everything is described as if seen the characters are left mainly to reveal themselves by their deeds and the speech born of occasion the reader is a spectator not a confidant in describing the childhood of dan and ewan and mona the author employs anecdote mainly to distinguish character and even with regard to the deemster the most subtle of all the charactew we learn more by watching his deeds and listening to his words than by explanation of the author mr hall caine however mikes us know his men and women as well as if he told us all about them taeir presence their gestures the greater motives of their being are clear to us it is no minute and detailed portraiture but it is complete so far as is needed to distinguish one soul from another in force dan mylrea the bishops ungovernable son stands out clear from the resta being of intemperate will and passion beyond control but noble and honest withal capable of falling deeper and rising higher than ordinary mortals a scapegrace and prodigal on a grand scale gifted with the splendid health enormous strength and generous nature which made him a hero to his inferiors with the worst part of his nature j encouraged by his uncle the deemster and the best part of it but weakly attracted by the saintly example of his father the bishop he spends a youth of riot and instead of entering the church becomes the proprietor of a fishing smack after drinking away with his men the years earnings of the boat he pays his crew with a bill on which he forges the name of his cousin  the pazon as security ewan saves him from disgrace hy acknowledging the signature but his father casts him off and ewan while permittiog him to live in his house withdraws his friendship and forbids him from intercourse with his sister mona now the love between ewan and dan had surpassed the love of women and mona had been his dearest playfellow so was dan cut off from all the good influences of his life  they are taking the wrong way with me said dan dan does not improve he ruins his father by mismanaging his farm commits numerous excesses and the relations between himself and ewan become more and more strained one day a vile story is told to ewan by his father the deemster and maddened by the belief that dan has seduced mona he seeks him with a murderous heart pride and passion forbidding explanation they fight like devils and ewan reels and falls over the cliff far from this being the end of the story the events that follow are even more original striking and terrible and reveal more completely the genius of the author the truly tragic scene between dan and mons in which mona declares her love for the slayer of her brother the attempt of dan and his crew to bury the body at sea when it slips its weights and sails away to land the return of the boat the surrender of dan and his terrible expiation under the sentence of his father and the final scenes of the sweating sickness and the part dan played therein are all grandly conceived and grandly executed no doubt much fault might be found with the book while calling itself a romance it aims at such an appearance of literal truth that we cannot help asking ourselves if oil crist mylrea was really the bishop of mw at the beginning of last century and was brother to the deemster and our confidence in its realistic veracity on the one hand and our acceptance of the romantic illusion on the other are both weakened the book is too full of extraordinary incidents the curse of mrs kerruish is fulfilled so fully and literally the secondsight of kerry is so terribly accurate the story proceeds by such a constant succession of marvels that it is only the singular skill with which they are introduced and the convincing manner with which they are described that prevent faith from halting but after all these are small things compared with the undeniable grandeur and beauty of this work of art cosmo

forthwith his adventures in securing the prize constitute the staple of the tale which is full of improbabilities and presents little inducement to the reader to try the next the next however is considerably betterthe incidents are more stirring and striking leaving the impression of actual reality though of a very singular cast the scene is placed in the heart of antigua remote from other

the moment loads him with abuse and accompanies it with a blow this is not to be borne the young man flies from the house and takes refuge among the bushinen with whom a few weeks before he had had an accidental encounter in a few days the gang propose to levy contributions on the farmer the youth for the sake of the ladies warns the farmer of the approaching attack a kindness which lie repays by betraying him to his associates from the indignation of these desperadoes he narrowly escapes by darting into the woods and elulding pursuit in his forlorn condition he joins a small party of the

B8289,"['8517588', '8693422']",  the eustace diamonds the eustace diamonds by anthony trollope in three voomes chapman aod hall mr trollope has a place of his own and a very worthy place among novelists and moralists  and  the eustace diamonds  shows him at his best both as a moralist and asa novelist nearly all his men and women are wonderfully lifelike their characters and the incidents through which thosecharacters exhibit themselves are admirably portrayed and an excellent vein of satire genial yet searching in its way is shown in all his work the good sense that he always displays carries a moral that goes far beyond the ground to which his stories are apparently confined and perhaps without intending it certainly without weakening his books as mere works of fiction he uses them to preach very useful sermons on some of the follies and vices of the day in this respect 4the eustace diamonds is particularly noteworthy we do not know whether we have a right ta claim mr trollope as in aay way a supporter of the movement for improving the condition af women but if he is an unintentional ally his service is all the more valuable aad he could not possibly render better service than by his drawing of such characters as those el his two unheroic heroines in this novel lissie eustace and lucy morris lizzie shows cleverness that with scope given for its honest exercise would have made her as useful as she is clever but being poor aad having no other trade than marriage open to her she becomes only a becky sharp squanders all her wits and leads a very foolish and mischievous life lucy is as sweet and simple as a daisy but daisylike she runs a chance of being trampled down altogether and all because conventional restraints have made her unfit to hold her own against the stronger will and more selfish fancy of her lover frank greystock frank greystock the yet more unheroic hero is as useful as are the two young ladies in showing what poor sorts of persons are i produced by the orthodox arrangements of society and the unfortunate inequality of the sexes that now prevails and is as injurious to men as it is to women but the novel also points to other and kindred morals i within the figure and frame and clothes and cuticle within the bones and flesh of many of us there is but one persona man or woman with a preponderance either of good or evil whose conduct in any emergency may be predicted with some assurance of accuracy by any one knowing the man or woman such persons are simple single and perhaps generally safe they walk along lines in accordance with certain fixed instincts or principles and are today as they were yesterday and will be tomorrow as they are today lady eustace was such a person and so was lucy morris opposite in their characters as two poles they were each of them a simple entity  and any doubt or error in judging of the future conduct of either of them would come from insufficient knowledge of the woman but there are human beingswho though of necessity single in body are dual in character in whose breasts not only is evil always fighting against good but to whom evil is sometimes horribly hideously evil but is sometimes also not hideous at all of such men it may be said that satan obtains an intermittent grasp from which when it is released the rebound carries them high amidst virtuous resolutions and a thorough love of things good and noble such menor women may hardly perhaps debase themselves with the more vulgar vices they will not be rogues or thieves or drunkardsor perhaps liars but ambition luxury selfindulgence pride and covetousness will get a hold of them and in various moods will be to them virtues in lieu of vices such a man waa freak greystock who could walk along the

another husband by help of the fortune that she now possesses aa estate in scotland worth 4000 a year for life besides this however sha claims as her own property some splendid diamonds worth 10000

with him frank nearly yields to her fascinations and to the charm of her fortune and is accordingly very neglectful during more than two volumes of lucy morris the governess whom he really loves though he shrinks from marrying any one who has not some of the money that he sorely needs to help him on in his scheme of ambition nothing could be much better in its way than mr trollopes working out of frank greybtocks character shown in his flirtations with lizzie eustace in his honest lovemaking with lucy and in all his other actions throughout the book like persons goodhearted and even generous yet vacillating and in the main very selfish mr trollope has already described in great numbers but he always excels in this kind of portraiture and frank grey stock is equal to the best of his sort of course frank has enough distinguishing characteristics to justify his appearance in  the eustace diamonds and as long as such persons exist in real life and when will they cease to exist they can hardly be laughed at too often especially with such kindly laughter as slr trollope knows exactly how to arouse many of the minor persons in  the eustace diamonds are as carefully drawn as the principals especially lord fawn the dilletante undersecretary of state who regrets his engagement with lizzie very soon after it has been made yet is at his wits end to find some means of breaking

school of a great and original painter he has his reward too for he has caught much more than the mere trick of style by no means difficult to imitate and has succeeded more nearly than any other writer we have met in entering into hawthornes psychology with its half morbid and entirely weird conception of life we incline to think  the madonna of the future  the most artistic of his tales though that which gives the title to his book is most fully worked out and is very subtle in treatment recalling here andi there the  septimius  of his model there is one blot in the book the material ghastli ness of the endingof one story the romance of certain old clothes which is more like poe than hawthorne and which we think the author will feel on reflection would have gained in impressiveness by the omission of the last detail and the substitution of a mere look of frozen terror on the dead face the incident as it stands mars the whole conception of perdita with which it is entirely out of keeping eglantine makes no advance but rather retrogression in its authors literary work for it is by no means so good a novel as any of its three precursors there are tokens throughout of too much facility in mere production of copy and too little pains in reducing that copy to symmetrical form to say nothing whatever of artistic conscientiousness in detail which is not atoned for by the occasional introduction of clever sentences and paragraphs the story if it may be so called is an autobiographical mono logue with but little interest since the only attempts at special delineation of character depict types which are tediously common in the modern novel such as the gracious and insincere matron of society and the mature young lady who affects gushing childishness and in these days of realistic painting it is not too much to ask even a lady author to be correct in details meant to give local colour and finish the daughter of a great scientific philosopher of wide general learning as the narrator of the story is supposed to be would not again and again cite the differential calculus  as the tremendously abstruse subject which her fathers distinguished visitors habitually discussed with him they would be just as likely to discuss the rule of three nor would she include gibbons english history as forming along with the decline and fall part of the favourite reading of her model coastguardsman at least it was inconsiderate if such were the case not to make the learned mr leslie seize on the book hitherto unknown to bibliography and give it to the reading public which would only too gladly welcome such a discovery it may be carpingly minute criticism to say that the st bees hood which the model broad church parson of the book wears and of which the author who attempts dutch painting makes a good deal is not purple but a wonderful combination of red and white but that a writer wlio has evidently a turn for marketing and cookery with a hearty relish for her victuals should give as a proof of the utter imbecility of her gushing lady that young persons belief that eggs arc or ought to be sold by the pound strikes us as showing very little grasp of the economical bearings of the subject would it surprise her to hear that more than one american legislature has recently enacted that all eggs are henceforth to be sold by the pound and that the average dozen must turn a given weight on the ground that the present system of selling by mere number irrespective of size is unfair to the purchaser and a permanent discouragement to careful breeding since no advantage is now gained in the market by the farmer who brings the finest and heaviest eggs for sale over his competitor who looks to quantity alone several other questions social and religious are settled in the book just as decisively and with exactly the same amount of intelligent understanding as this one and we would cheerfully give all the judgments and the longwinded reasons for their formation in exchange for a little more life and movement in the somewhat wooden puppets of the tale  jocelyns mista7ke derives its interest almost wholly from its central figure which is a very good study of character mrs spender has not sought to devise novel situations for her plot and has contented herself with using materials which have served many authors before but she has employed them better than usual the main situation in the book for example is not very different from that in a once popular story e laiu wyndham yet there is no likeness at all in treatment so that the sense of triteness does not strike the reader mrs spenders english is unusually good and she has learned the art of working her opinions on men and things into the web of her story in stead of merely intercalating homilies after the fashion of too many of her sisters with the certainty of having them skipped by the judicious reader who desires in the emphatic language of a schoolboy uttered in the present critics hearing more story and less jaw the jocelyn of the book is very skilfully drawn an impetuous wilful passionate imaginative woman in whom the perceptive faculties are far more matured than the reflective who feels but does not reason and who is from temperament what frenchmen call tate montee and americans high falutinc in season and out of season the chief success of the book is the manner in which the author conciliates the sympathies of her readers in favour of the very defective heroine and makes them understand how she could win and retain the affections of two men of exceptional mark and power though of different types and that without her having brain enough with all her imagination and fluency to appreciate the best qualities of either one particularly happy touch quite true to nature is that where jocelyn spoils her application for the post of governess by springing on her hobby at a chance word of her proposed employer and delivering a lecture then and there on the development of woman mfore we think might have been made of the contrast between the fiery and courageous heroine and her vacillating brother but where it is brought out at all it is well done finally the toile of the book is entirely high and sound and though it does not belong to the small first rank of novels that will live it rises in type and diction far above the ephemeral stories of the season olt of society is a commonplace and rather dull book written in a style which is alternately fine and slipshod gorgeous in adjectives and hazy in grammar it belongs to the school of transpontine melodrama according to which hardness selfishness and vice are habitual characteristics of those who move or try to move in refined and wealthy circles while generosity and virtue must be souglht among those who are out of society that a life of much ease and little responsibility is unfiavourable to loftiness of aim and energy of action is doubtless true enough but mrs pulleyne must know very little indeed of modern engrland if she imagines that the line can be drawn as she draws it the artisans who refuse to associate with labourers or even to use the same houses of call the shopboys who rob tills to pay gambling debts the working men who correct their wives with iron clogs are on the whole not more admirable citizens than mrs pulleynes aristocrats and are real flesh and blood while her characters despite of the dedication of her book to a lady of princely rank are clearly evolved from a not very vivid imagination and do not by any means convey the impression of being studies from life and personal contact especially as she has not mastered the somewhat intricate system of english titles of rank robert forrcster is the work of a very inexperienced hand and the best counsel for the author is to attempt a play and to put the manuscript into the hands of some practised manager or actor in order to see how much and what would be cut out curiously enough there is a chapter in the book wherein the heroine by her frank criticisms induces a lady friend to give up novelwriting as not possessing the necessary faculty and being unable to see what is expedient in a book meant to win public approval the actual story in robert forester scarcely occupies onefifth of the volume and the remainder is entirely taken up with digressions sometimes on scenery and more often on what the characters could should might ought or would have thought or done while their actual doings are compressible into a very small bulk indeed thus in one chapter of the book two persons engaged to two other persons meet for an avowal of their preference for one another and nearly twelve pages are given to a chapter which immediately follows this whose whole contents consist of the fact that their conversation was overheard by one of the other pair and that she did not like it ten words in the chapter whiich describes the meeting would have been enough and this is just the place where an experienced manager would have ruthlessly cut down the copy were it a play nor are the descriptions of scenery vivid enough to be worth the space they occupy we have three living novelists who can write of scenery so as to delight their readers air black perhaps first mir blackmore a good second and amr george macdonald third though if his admirable poetical vignettes of landscape be taken into account he might be assigned the highest place it aliss thompson will read any of these writers and endeavour to analyse their method in

that in one of his latest books we find hun saying  i find the burden and restrictions of rhyme more and more troublesome as i grow older there are times when it seems natural enough to employ that form of expression but it is only occasionally  and the use of it as the vehicle of the commonplace is so prevalent that one is not much tempted to select it as the medium for his thoughts and

B7858,['8848985'],  the deluge an historical novel of poland sweden and russia by henryk sienkiewicz translated from the polish by jeremiah curtin 2 vols dont  co weare glad of the attempts which are now being made to familiarise the english public with the writings of henryk sienkiewicz the most eminent of living polish novelists some time ago the first romance of his great historical trilogy 4 fire and sword  was reviewed in the columns of this journal 4 the deluge  forms the second and we hope messrs dent will give us the third 4 pan michael sienkiewicz appears to have led a wandering life and was for some years in america but resides we believe at present in warsaw like count tolstoi he loves to put a great many figures on his canvas which is crowded with pictures of battle and adventure he contrives also to introduce the leading historical personages of the period and following the example of the late anthony trollope carries some of his imaginary characters through a whole series of novels thus in 4the deluge we have the reappearance of pan zagloba a thoroughly falstaflian individual whose adventures are legion and his bombast and selflaudation inexhaustible the history of poland is so little studied in this country that the facts upon which the novel is based will be familiar to few we must therefore go a little into detail the period of 4 the deluge  is that of the reign of john casimir in which poland suffered from all the ills of foreign and civil war an amiable but weak man he ascended the throne in 1649 and married his brothers widow marie louise a woman of beauty and spirit in his reign the swedes invaded the country and took both cracow and warsaw and he was obliged to fly into silesia their success would not have been so great had not the entranceinto the country been made easy by the treachery of opalinski the palatine of posen and radziwill the hetman of lithuania karl gustav the swedish king meditated parcelling out the country giving portions to the elector of brandenburg the hetman and others but the swedes were driven out polands hour had not yet come in 1668 john casimir abdicated all these characters figure in the picturesque pages of m sienkiewicz opalinski who wrote some venomous satires on the universal corruption of mankind is brought before us with all his odious characteristics radziwill appears as the evil spirit of the story and dies in great suffering he is portrayed as a gloomy ambitious man and is made additionally odious on account of his calvinism which stands in strong relief to the fanatical roman catholicism of his countrymen the hero is a gallant young polish noble who is desperately in love with a charming girl panna alexandra or in its pretty abridged form olenka he is induced at first to take the side of radziwill but when ho discovers that he is a traitor he deserts the cause of the powerful hetman it is this change of front that gets him into trouble after hairbreadth escapes he contrives to make his way to the king in silesia his devotion to the cause of john casimir is profound he distinguishes himself in many engagements and finally receives the hand of the young lady of whom he is enamoured olenka meanwhile has not been without her perils but we will not forestall their interest there is no lack of vigour in the authors style but the bloodshed may pall upon the gentle reader in the words of byrons criticism on dr polidoris tragedy all stab and everybody dies these nobles as represented by m sienkiewicz are certainly brutal enough in spite of their occasional airs of chivalry as for the wretched peasantry they seem only to exist to be pillaged turned into soldiers and killed by the rival factions we have old poland before us in the pages of our novelist and a sad country it is at best m sienkiewicz puts additional colour into his picture by his accounts of the swedes and their armies many scotchmen also figure here we almost wonder that he did not include the renowned patrick gordon afterwards the friend of peter the great this fine specimen of the scotch younger son and mercenary soldier of the period has told us in his diary how being frequently taken prisoner he passed from one party to the other now fighting with the swedes and now with the poles it only remains in conclusion to say some words on mr curtins translation he has long since won his spurs as a worker in slavonic fields he is accurate almost to baldness and we think that on many occasions he might have given a footnote for we cannot imagine what the english reader will think of some of the expressions left unexplained eg the snitch to adopt the translators spelling so also to interpret the polish for constantinople as the city of the tsar cargrad is rather confusing it would have been better to say the city of the caesars the many americanisms are of course in the natural order of things whatever our translator gains in accuracy by his phonetic spelling of polish names he seems to lose in the hideous form which he communicates to all the native words we do not think our polish friends can possibly be pleased with these transformations he might by the way have given tylsa its

with affectation and sentimentality  that few readers will we fear have the patience to read to the end or at least they will nkip all the fine  writing and confused dissertations on social evils and social reformation the sister of charity is j a vory ambitious book and deals with all the social  and political questions now going on in a style of frank compendious rashness and a sublime ignorance of the hindrances and friction which ways ami means bring with them in the actual world the authoress has evidently listened to good conversation on most of the social topics of the day  and in the novel before us she has endeavoured to dramatise what she has heard and to reutter what she has learnt but she has not jwrfectly grasjied the ideas nor has she thought them out for herself consequently her oracle is a graceful murmuring babble in which it is difficult to detect any specific meaning beyond a general tendency of good intention vagueness and diffuseness are the chief sins in the book the authoress can write something mach better if she will only condescend to the virtue that lie in  plainness of speech beatrice lester the heroine is miss florence nightingale with variations  and after heroisms and selfsacrifices innumerable she finils at last love marriage bridesmaids and belgravia all lying in her path of duty a a matter of taste we rather object to patting

regeneration must be assisted by the women such is the creed sought to be illustrated and enforced ir the sister f charity we will say nothing to damp the ardour of the authoress we  were once quite as enthusiastic and as trusting as i mrs clhallice  but the experience of nigh fifty years has wrought its usual disenchantnients by i teaching us that the world is infinitely less honest and vastly more kindhearted than in our young days it appeared to us and it is pleasant to greet now and then a mind that still is what ours i was  for certain it is that time will too soon l substitute the sad and sober truth for the glad and gorgeous vision what inen and women ouylit to be rather than what they are will be i seen in these pages which have the attractions i of some excellent writing unexceptionable son 1 timents and an admirable purposequalities i which will go far to excuse the absence of two other desirable features in a novel a good plot and originality of character both of which are wanting here mirs challice has however made a promising beginning and a little more practice of her art and further experience of life will doubtless supply defects which are the comwon failings of young authors ood in everiything is designed to teach the moral that none of us know what is best for ourselves that the darkest hour of the night precedes the dawn that seeming misfortunes often prove to be blessings it is an old truth preached by philosophers in all ages and it forms one of the most useful articles of the christian creed but it is not always received as trustingly in practice as in precept it is very hard to reconcile ourselves to a positive present pain or inconvenience in prospect of some future benefit the strongestminded of us men or women cannot but turn longing lingering looks backwarl upon disappointed hopes fiction might fairly be called to the aid of philosophy in such a cause a story evolved before our eyes much assists the argument it is that teaching by example which is always so much more effective than precept mrs foot has set before herself a useful and not a difficult task she has plunged her heroine into misery that she might prove how a kind providence will show a way of escape to those who put faith in gods love the story is shortbelow the conventional standard of novels but in these two volumes mirs foot has condensed as much incident as is usually expanded over three the plot is original ingenious complicated and very interesting some of the scenes as the deathbed marriage at the opening of the second volume are described with unusual power the character of mrs truman is well sustained altogether it is above the average of fictions and we hope soon to give the authoress another welcome mr platts smothers and sons has this faultthe author seems to think that to be natural lie must set down in his dialogues all that in real life persons say to one another however worthless unmeaning or disconnected with the story this is a mistake not peculiar to mr platt a dialogue in a fiction should not be like a pennyaliners report where every word and incident are transcribed for the purpose of spreading the story over as many lines as possible for instance the following is not artistic however iprecise a copy of a talk between a father and his child s 0 merev there again what was that  exclaimed esther  that was more than a common thinderclap 0 my head susan and hanuah say its a sure sign lark  stuff antl nonsense what matters what susan and hannah say the noodles a sure sign  yes to be sure it isno doubt of itthe wiseacresa sure sign enoughwho dont know thatof a brighter day tomorrow i any number of volumes might be filled with such dialogues as this but the object of dialogue in a novel is either to advance the story or to develop character whatever does not one of ithese things is simply impertinence and waste of ipaper and a trial of the readers temper mir platt has we fear been trying to imitate mir read in his recklessness of phrases and audacity of description but lie wants mir readcs powerful conceptions which alone can justify such rude ilancvuage as is usual with inferior writers lie iimitates the mannerism and thinks ie is copyingi ithe maln there is no greater mistake genius is inimitable and a sensible writer will always try to say somethingnew or if he cannot do that i to say old things in some new way instead of trying to write like somebody else who has made a reputation it is not only in authorship that this i absurdity of imitation prevails it pervades i society let a man strike out a new path in any direction and succeed and instantly a multitude of others endeavour to follow in the same path instead of seeking a new one for themselves and they fail because the ground is preoccupied mr platt has a wealth of words if he would only use them judiciously and he has a fertile fancy if he would but trust to its own flights instead of striving to follow after those who have already soared if m11others and sons were to be weeded as it should have been of all superfluous dialogues descriptions and words it would be reduced to one half its present bulk but it would be twice as readable as it is its faults outnumber its merits although these are not few but there are sins against good taste and good breeding which cannot be so readily forgiven there was no need to repeat in the dialogues the oaths which a coarse man uses in his conversationthese at least might be left to the imagination but here they are paraded in all their vulgarity we have counted do

B6990,['3257501'],  tryphena in love surely dialect in fiction like onion in a salad is best when it lurks halfsuspected yet animates the whole not when it intrudes its plebeian presence to the destruction of more subtle flavours nor unless we chance to be philologists are we chiefly concerned that it be pedantically exact indeed the truer impression is more often given by a somewhat conventional vocabulary such as mr chevalier permitted his costers to employ than by a phonographically accurate record mr raymond never a noticeable offender in this way has in this book been still more reticent in obtruding nonfamiliar idioms his dialect subtly pervades the whole storyin the impersonal passages as well as those uttered directly by the chief actors yet you are never driven to a glossary nor forced to read phonetic passages aloud to gather their meaning from their sound this seems a very artistic use of dialect for fiction is not merely a mosaic of local phrases and idioms and the art that plucks these wild flowers of speech and sets them before the painters figures and background is nearer akin to the craft of the panorama maker who fills his realistic foreground with dyed ferns and dead branches than to that of the painter who translates all essential details to be represented harmoniously in the one medium at his command this course seems more than ever admirable when home rule for novelists is a popular cry and the novel of locality finds a warm welcome it is encouraging to see that the wide district of somerset has been appropriated by so good a storyteller as mr raymond who loyal as he is to his chosen county never forgets that he appeals to a cosmopolitan audience and gives enough local colour and no more by this he makes the reader feel for the time a genuine resident in the district he has selected neither a cockney tourist bent on manufacturing stage pastorals from prosaic peasants nor a scientific visitor keen to discover how much of the kelt or saxon survives in the yeomen and yokels his is the best wayyou open  tryphena and forget everything except a vague sense of halfforgotten country scents blowing round youand the vivid planes of sunshine and shade so unlike the lowtoned harmony that faces you in town from the first word of the prologue to the last of the epilogue far too briefly traversed you are the unseen spectator of an idyll that is carefully selected from real life it is indeed a piece of genre painting of the highest order a pastoral comedy where tragedy pathos humour and above all love sway the actors in most human fashion yet as you read you forget to analyse and enjoy the artlessness of the telling unhindered by any critical purpose so mr raymond witches you and reveals the true secret of the raconteur that of hypnotising his audience to perfect sympathy the story itself might be told in a sentence it has but four characters mrs joshua pettigrewneither mrs poyser nor an aunt of maggie tulliver nor a relative of bathsheba everdene or any wessex housewifethe least important yet one who lives and moves a genuine creation her somewhile crippled son prisoner in the chamber where the king hid tryphena the almost innocent cause of the accident which has made him helpless straight and bright as the poppy docks she sometimes brought in from the hillside  and miss mervin the new comer at the hall who

fashion of the complex personalities of the problem novel they are as actual as the villagers you met during your last holiday in the country if the novel of locality bring us books of this order books   tryphena in love by walter raymond the iris library zs 6d net london j m pent and co we may place near cranfurd with no sense ot unworthiness then indeed might the novel of locality accomplish much but on rereading you discover it is the art of the story that really satisfied you its mere form is a thing worth analysing t prologue repeated with slightly changed modulation for the epilogue is in as classic a form as bachs famous chaconne where the great sequence of chords repeated with a final major close gives at once the text and the peroration of the work this difficult form mr raymond wields as lightly as mr bret harte used his chorus of children in cressy a chance reader would not suspect the arbitrary plan underneath the fantasy so the dramatic unity is accomplished with perfect symmetry and yet retains all the vitality and freshness of an improvisation mr walter raymonds  mistertons mistake read half a dozen years ago has left passages fresh in ones memory still  gentleman upcotts daughter young sam and sabina and  love and quiet life show his gradually progressing mastery of the material more certainty of touch and more reliance upon style the difference between thomas hardys wessex and mr raymonds somerset is not greater topographically than in their books yet he who would compare the two or judge one county superior to the other deserves to lose both it is because mr raymond is so clearly defined in his aim and so sure of arousing interest in the subject that appeals to him that one sees in  tryphena in love a genuine novelist who is young

drunkards perhaps find it not very easy to understand how mr matthew arnold came to write a sonnet to the artist the bottle is scarcely a work of art it has indeed a central interest but that interest is a moral purpose and no one can say that the picture of the crowds of boozy and bulbous figures is one that gives pleasure to the spectator  say what shall calm us when such guests intrude like comets on the heavenly solitude   asks the poet and the reviewer may be allowed to say that mr jenkins story the devils chain on which he has no intention of writing a sonnet is more a moral comet of the bottle sort than a work of art indeed mr jenkins admits that he has not tried to write a pleasing work of fiction his aim is  to exhibit in rude stern truthful outlines the full features of the abuses he would humbly help to remove the abuses are those that spring from the traffic of drink  mr jenkins finds men dining comfortably and voting steadily in utter disregard of their fell disastrous and diabolical effects he  cannot acquit himself of having too long done the like one hopes that mr jenkins will continue to vote with his wonted steadiness  it would not however be easy for a sensitive person to dine comfortably immediately after reading his devils chain the devil8 chain is a tissue of horrors the first link shows us a woman of bad character and of about fortyfour years of age entertaining a secretary of state and a young gentleman who had left balliol at the age of nineteen after a distinguished career with brandy sherry and champagne this is bad enough but the secretary had scarcely time to tell his precocious friend that their hostess was a mrs hurlingham sister of their acquaintance captain conistoun when she leapt out of the window and fell dead at the feet of her husband who was staggering past in the last stage of drunkenness but one on beholding this spectacle miss lucy merton a virtuous grisette fainted and was entertained by a young man a total stranger with the refreshment of hot brandy and water an unpleasant episode follows about which we shall merely say that the christian name of the total stranger is singularly illchosen meantime the secretary of state had wrapped himself up in a large cloak which he wore for purposes of disguise when pursuing his nefarious pleasures and had retired with the balliol man from the disastrous scene mr jenkins may have borrowed the cloak from pericles prince of tyre act iv scene 6  here comes the lord lysimachus disguised a coroners inquest was held on the dead woman and mr jenkins points out with very great force and truth the wretched results of the unseemly habit of holding coroners inquests in public houses at the inquest the drunken husband is brought forward and a letter is read which had been addressed to him by his deceased wife why did she call him henry when his name was lucius why did mrs merton p 167 call her husband john when his name p 155 was william  or do people change their names when they take to drink joseph cray becoming john cray in part of the narrativeas they do when they enter religion  but mr jenkins has not aimed at artistic results the coroner elicits the facts that lucius or henry hurlingham was a man of family and wealth that his wife took to brandy and other sins that he had followed her example till he sank with a life of gindrinking and that the pair had a daughter whose education was conducted at the expense of mrs hurlingham business being over the coroner described as a gentleman goes and gets drunk with un nomme bugby described as a newspaper reporter and leaderwriter do coroners get drunk  do journalists of standing attend coroners inquests do reporters of inquests write leaders  let us next follow the fortunes of the balliol man he was the son of a rich scotch distiller named bighorne he had done well at eton which he must have left at about fifteen and at the university but in three fatal years this promising boy was morally ruined by  constant visits to the tastingroom  in his fathers distillery bighorne peer had sent him into the business where he grew too fond of the paternal gin as confectioners apprentices do of pastry henry bighornes sister is a study of the brighter side of life  the oval sweet yet firmly featured face with that noble wealth of original hair wreathed up in plaits and curls upon the symmetrical head in grecian fashionthe slightly aquiline nose exquisite mouth and chin the skin mantled with a complexion purely and gloriously englishall this made miss emily bighorne bother her patronymic and may she soon exchange it for a better a subject of admiration which could well endure the rivalry of the artists who had showered their works upon the home of the wealthy distiller of british brandy and gin this heroine had a very natural hatred of her fathers business for as she worked among the poor in westminster she knew that the paths of ginmaking lay hold upon hell but she could not even rescue her  brother who borrowing some money from her fled away and hid himself for fear of compromising the reputation ofthe secretary i of state and so bringing down the govern  ment of the hour the place where iiq fled to was the hut of a drunken prizefighting j scoundrel employed in ironworks near j burslem this man bill knowsley got j drunk on the money given him by bighorne j kicked his wife to death and killed all his i six children in this scene mr jenkins has i painted with great power a kind of event which is perfectly familiar to all of us from report and which probably has never been common in any savagery or in any civilisation except that of happy england to be brief henry bighorne dies of fever and exposure in the house of a curate  the daughter of the hurlinghams runs away heaven knows why with a drunken sot of a middleaged parson and we last see her in a musichall a few other characters here and there including the drunken clergyman and a dissenting tradesman die of drink and the secretary of state his disguise not availing him leaves england in a ship most of whose crew are intoxicated and is lost in a fire at sea being last seen in the act of throwing his famous cloak over a halfnaked girl perhaps we should be grateful to any writer who keeps before our eyes the condition of our civilisation perhaps the sermon against taking alcohol in moments of exhaustion cannot too often be preached it may even be allowed that fic tion is a good medium for morality but one fails to see how the heaping up of so many thickcoming horrors in one small volume can awaken any useful feeling this is the weak point of all stories with a purpose in novels dated about 1786 we know that the virtuous peasant will suffer in one day all the woes that are spread over the whole history of the villein and in temperancetales we look for the horrors of a year crushed into a few weeks and we are not disappointed mr jenkins does not attempt to prescribe the purge for the evils he catalogues and it is not likely that his book will arouse any one to the sense of these evils who was not alive to them before it is a shameful thing that the trade in liquor should be  forced  by advertisements and by public houses started by distillers it is a wretched thing that society should be based on forms of labour which disfigure the body and that the labourer should find his only consolation amusement and culture in the pothouse if mr jenkins book could hasten by one hour the time when society shall have a new conscience and a new aimpossibly

stokeshill place have been already given but we like  ethel churchill better than any of them the reflections which abound in this work are instructive and judicious at the same time that they are dictated by experience in the world and sound sense the epoch at which the tale commences is fixed in the reign of george ii and thus miss landon has been enabled to introduce the reader to lady mary wortley montague pope gay swift and walpole and to make him famili arly acquainted with the reigning wits and literati of the age this scheme is somewhat in imitation of portions of mr bulwers  devereux  but the whole is admirably executed and evinces the perseverance and research which miss landon must have used to render herself so intimately conversant with the minds manners and peculiarities of the learned or remarkable individuals she brings upon the stage lady marchmont is well drawn but the character is we hope somewhat unnatural in fact her atrocious deeds are the only objectionable portion of the work which we discovered during an attentive perusal the personal appearance and morale of lord marchmont a peer of those times is admirably described lord marchmont was about thirty years of age and what is generally called a finelooking man his figure was good so far as his height and proportion went but his movements wanted ease and consequently grace and there was

superior to any other of miss landons prose productions  ethel churchill or thc two brides reviews by miss landon 3 vols colburn we find in though prose writings of miss landon the same warmth of feeling as in her verse the language only is changed the genius that prompts it is the same but the qualities that have established her fame as a poetess occasionally interfere with the full development of her powers as a writer of novels in all we admit there are fine and noble thoughts beautifully expressed lier personages think wisely tenderly or romantically as suits her purpose they speak eloquently and wittily but they seldom act her novels in fact are more records of feelings than narratives of events instead of giving her full attention to working out a character or unravelling an artfully involved plot she pours forth from the fullness of her own heart a profusion of deep and eloquent reflections which though excellent in themselves do not assist in thc progress of the story but readers must be more critical than we are disposed to he if they find much fault with a habit from which they derive so much pleasure these episodes indeed are the characteristics of miss landons style  and we confess we would not exchange them for an improvement in the mere machinery of a novel  ethel churchill contains many examples both of the beauties and the defects we have noticed in such an abstract of it as we could find room for we could not do justice to its merits and we shall therefore not attempt any account of thc plot and yet as we are anxious to give a specimen of the style of ethel churchillwe must inform the reader that the real heroine of the book is a certain henrietta countess of marchmont whose character of a gay beautiful leader of fashionable life full of wit and with a recklessness of manner which fails to hide even from herself the pangs of a too sensitive heartstands in admirable contrast with the stiff pompous and selfconceited nothingness of her lord and master this lady soon after her marriage becomes acquainted with lady mary wortley montagu pope jay and the other wits of the period who are brought very vividly before us and has proceeded to such lengths in follies and flirtations that she fears a rebuke from her husband for the levity which she is conscious cannot have escaped his observation on the death of poor constance courtenay which is very pathetically described the countess had paid her friends memory the respect of wearing black clothes av bile mourning over the melancholy fate of

i and 1 observe that your ribbons are black thia i morning tears started in though countesss eyes but she repressed them and forcing a smile tait  i am glad to find that it is not my conduct but my dress that meets your disapprobation i thought replied her husbandand the event proves that i was right in so thinking that you would only laugh at what 1 should urge but women aro incapable of a

bestowed though highest finish and which j she has traced through all its fortunes with j the greatest care is that of walter maynard j in the possession of high talent and filled with i the purest feelings the young dependant on literary exertion soon linds that the acquisition of fame must be purchased by the loss of happiness poor and friendless he has to struggle with a world where any degree of reputation seems only to incite the attacks of malevolence and at last sick and pennyles every prospect blighted he dies the picture of walter may j nard we hope is too darkly coloured yet it is on the distresses of the aspiring author that the deepest sympathies of miss landon are bestowed we sincerely trust that it is not from experience that she speaks in the following passage   how constantly has mortification accompanied triumph  with what secret sorrow has that praise been received from strangers denied to us by our friends  nothing astonishes me moro than the envy which attends literary fame and the unkindly depreciation which waits upon the writer of every species of fame it is the most ideal and apart it would seem to interfere with no one it is bought by a life of labour generally also ji seclusion and privation it asks its honour only from all that is most touching and most elevated in humanity what is the reward that it cravesto lighten many a solitary hour

B1941,['6724682'],  the deemster  a romance by hall caine in 3 vols chatto this book would be welcome if only on the ground that it is well worthy of the author of the shadow of a crime in shifting his scene of action from the hills of cumberland to the isle of man mr hall caine has left behind him none of his three great gifts of imagination pathos and humour and he has found a people even more distinct than  cumshire folk with characters as well suited to exhibit human passion in its simplicity and a dialect as rich and racy as any in the north of england in addition he has found a story of intense terror mixed with intense pathos readers of focsle yarns will not be surprised at the attraction of the isle of man and its people to the writer of romance and will be glad that the field has been entered by so capable an author as mr hall caine it is to be hoped that the deemster himself is not a character common in the island for he is the incarnation of all that is most mean and despicable in human nature selfish cruel crafty and cowardly he is the evil genius of the piece and is drawn perhaps more thoroughly and carefully than any other of the characters it is he who manages to draw to himself in his fathers lifetime all his fathers property and turns his defrauded brother out of doors it is he who buys his wife of her father the archdeacon and breaks her heart with his infidelity in the first years of their married life it is he who cultivates the evil in his nephew dan and invents the lie which brings about the death of his own son ewan all through the book from the beginning to the welldeserved misery of his death he acts as a subtle malign influence poisoning the air little he gets by it except his barren position of power and the hatred of ail utterly without religion but superstitious to extreme his time is spent in doing illdeeds and striving to bribe providence to avert punishment one of the least adroit and most ridiculous of villains the evil he tries to do is always rebounding on his own head and the devil himself must have laughed when after haranguing the people and the bishop his brother as to the illdeeds of the bishops son and declaring that he will not lift a finger against the man who killed him he turns round to find that the corpse which was the subject of his oration was not that of his nephew but of his own son ewan the fact that the evil done by the deemster is not generally the exact injury contemplated by him but the casual action of a spirit of evil emanating from his infernal disposition is characteristic of the book it is not by themselves only and their passions that the fates of the principal characters are determined  and it is this which distinguishes the deemster rom what are usually called  romances the term serves to distinguish it from the novel or picture of modern life and manners but despite its narrativeform the spiritual grandeur of its conception and the tremendous character of the forces engaged raise it to the region of tragic drama among these forces the passions of though characters no doubt play the greatest part but above beyond and around these are the unseen if not supernatural powers of accident it is not without the aid of a network of circumstance woven by superstition and misconception and a thousand other impalpable devils that the noble natures of dan and ewan are brought into collision and dragged down to death and hell what mr hall caine calls the perfidy of circumstance is the great motor of the drama and dreams and presages second sight and curses superstitious terrors and evil thoughts all of them giving wings as it were to diverse spirits of evil which make a havoc of noble characters and lives of fair promise perform for him much the same office as the loves and hatreds of the gods with their emissaries of fates and furies dreams and omens for the poets and dramatists of greece it is this that raises the deemster into the rank of highest art and makes it not so much a romantic story of a few human individuals as a tragic poem of human life and fate yet the manner is that of a simple tale the characters are not complex they speak plain unconventional unpoetical english often the homespun of manx of analysis of character there is little the narrative if singularly vivid and abounding in remarkable incident is told without strain  fine  as the writing is in the best artistic sense there is not a word of what is usually called  fine writing to use an epithet once in favour with critics the method of presenting the facts to the reader is objective everything is described as if seen the characters are left mainly to reveal themselves by their deeds and the speech born of occasion the reader is a spectator not a confidant in describing the childhood of dan and ewan and mona the author employs anecdote mainly to distinguish character and even with regard to the deemster the most subtle of all the charactew we learn more by watching his deeds and listening to his words than by explanation of the author mr hall caine however mikes us know his men and women as well as if he told us all about them taeir presence their gestures the greater motives of their being are clear to us it is no minute and detailed portraiture but it is complete so far as is needed to distinguish one soul from another in force dan mylrea the bishops ungovernable son stands out clear from the resta being of intemperate will and passion beyond control but noble and honest withal capable of falling deeper and rising higher than ordinary mortals a scapegrace and prodigal on a grand scale gifted with the splendid health enormous strength and generous nature which made him a hero to his inferiors with the worst part of his nature j encouraged by his uncle the deemster and the best part of it but weakly attracted by the saintly example of his father the bishop he spends a youth of riot and instead of entering the church becomes the proprietor of a fishing smack after drinking away with his men the years earnings of the boat he pays his crew with a bill on which he forges the name of his cousin  the pazon as security ewan saves him from disgrace hy acknowledging the signature but his father casts him off and ewan while permittiog him to live in his house withdraws his friendship and forbids him from intercourse with his sister mona now the love between ewan and dan had surpassed the love of women and mona had been his dearest playfellow so was dan cut off from all the good influences of his life  they are taking the wrong way with me said dan dan does not improve he ruins his father by mismanaging his farm commits numerous excesses and the relations between himself and ewan become more and more strained one day a vile story is told to ewan by his father the deemster and maddened by the belief that dan has seduced mona he seeks him with a murderous heart pride and passion forbidding explanation they fight like devils and ewan reels and falls over the cliff far from this being the end of the story the events that follow are even more original striking and terrible and reveal more completely the genius of the author the truly tragic scene between dan and mons in which mona declares her love for the slayer of her brother the attempt of dan and his crew to bury the body at sea when it slips its weights and sails away to land the return of the boat the surrender of dan and his terrible expiation under the sentence of his father and the final scenes of the sweating sickness and the part dan played therein are all grandly conceived and grandly executed no doubt much fault might be found with the book while calling itself a romance it aims at such an appearance of literal truth that we cannot help asking ourselves if oil crist mylrea was really the bishop of mw at the beginning of last century and was brother to the deemster and our confidence in its realistic veracity on the one hand and our acceptance of the romantic illusion on the other are both weakened the book is too full of extraordinary incidents the curse of mrs kerruish is fulfilled so fully and literally the secondsight of kerry is so terribly accurate the story proceeds by such a constant succession of marvels that it is only the singular skill with which they are introduced and the convincing manner with which they are described that prevent faith from halting but after all these are small things compared with the undeniable grandeur and beauty of this work of art cosmo

ravensboe will be apt to fancy that mir kingsley has taken to  scamp illg work we have his own authority for saying that if a man can write well or paint well he will get quite as well paid by the  trade  as ever he was by any prince whio ever lived but the worst of it is that the trade pay so well that there is a temptation to  scamping work9 we fear the temptation is only too strong it is for instance an unardonable offence in a real master of english to adopt a slipshod colloquial style of narrative and to shirk the trouble of writing carefully by availing himself of the lazy device of taklirg his reader into his confidence and talking to hin in the same strain as that in which the owner of the puppetshow in don quixote addresses his audience and we may also add some of the epigrams in old margaret are by no means good but simply as bad as they can well he why for instance should we be told that in this last painful and horrible year it is perfectly obvious that a german has only to come into one end of a field to make a frenchman run out at the other in the first place the statement is not true in the second place even if it were true it would not be funny in the third place even if it were ever so funny it would none the less be in very questionable taste taste however is not mr kingsleys strong point indeed he seems to be much attached to what lie calls the  coarse manners of the age of whicch he writes and does not forget to assure us twice at least if not oftener in his first two hundred pages that in those days all men slept nakeda fact which lie brings home to us with pecua liarly vivid pictorial effect an rest we are not disposed to find fault with either mfr kingsley or his tale there is it is true a certain sameness in all the characters especially in all the men which is partly perhaps due to the fact that they all discourse in epigram worthy of monostich dialogue in a greek play and partly to the fact that an element of the authors own personality enters far too perceptibly into each but ghient and the glientish habits of life are sketched very vividly if not very truthfully the outline is firm the colour is bold the whole picture is in its way a wellpreserved van eyck among swashbuckling fireeating swordsmen cruel murderous princes ruffianly italian bravos and keen sententious old statesmen mr kingsley is in his element more

political inforniation is rather scrappy but what there is of it is fresh and to the point evidently miss dowie regards politics as uninteresting and indeed out of place in describing a happy country where the peasants own their land and where persons of the landlord class are not to be found  oppressions rackrentinig and evictions were unknown evils of that i was assured  and beyond this i felt that a political condition is not a bad one if you hear nothing of it the fortunate peasant proprietors of galicia printipally belong to the rithenian the pole and the luzul nationalities  the huzul

loopold von lacher masoch the hungarian novelist p 193  it may be held with some show of reason that at the great wandering of the earths peoples when the slays were inl the van the ihuzuls were easily driven across the plains and pouned in the karpathians while their neighbours of the plains were split up broken and intermixed with the germanic races and later with huns hungarians tartars mongolians and turks thus the hluznts safe in their karpathian faistnesses preserve their haracter the the slav or if you vill admit it the caucasian character free pure and warked to this day no falcon can live caged so runs the proverb no ihuzul in bondage miss dowio was not much thrown with this wild and warlike people but consorted more with the ruthenian of the plain and the pol whose ancestors conquered and colonised the country however beauty and picturesqueness are the creation of the eye and the mind and a traveller so richly endowed as miss dowie would write an attractive

flippancy of tone franzos is generally admitted to be one of the two great living authors of south german y the son of a doetor in a little galician town the ilarnow of his stories franzos is par excelnce the hilumlorist of galicia yet miss dowie in writinlg of the coumntry refers to its greatest ian of letters only in slighting terms the ruthenian peasant appears to bec a pagan in everything

unclean it gradually dawned on our authoress that she was a christian and therefore in a technical sense indubitably unclean she accordingly bought the plate and slipped it into her sack the loss of her property which had been purchased at its owners valuation was again too much for the innkooper who upbraided her guest both as a christian and a robber the treatment she received from the ruthenian peasants and the polish gentlemen with whom she stayed was very different aliss dowios book is proof if proof were wanting that an accurate and picturesque account of a people can be written by one ignorant of their language in a country not five thousand miles away from galicia the queen of england was some years ago represented by a very able diplomatist who reckoned among his many accomplishments a knowledge of the native language although the press of the country was an open book to him the people of the country remained an unsolved mystery le did not like them lie misread their characters their aspirations and their hopes happily for all concerned this very able and amiable man for lie was both got the promotion which he deserved le was followed by a gentleman who though unable to read their newspapers liked the connon folk and sympathised with them in their hopes and aspirations le therefore knew the country and its inhabitants a thousandfold better than his more learned but less sympathetic predecessor as with diploiatists so with travellers the key to a good book of travel is sympathy with the people among whom you travel miss dowie has struck this note in every page of her book we have referred to the cynicism which crops up now and again but in truth this cynicism is not more than worddeep miss dowio describes with profound insight the poor ignorant peasantry she has far too much humour to be a severe judgo even her verbal cynicism disappears when she enters cracow  suddenly a choir of trunpets breaks out into a chorale from the big

reign of catherine the second it is certain that none of her predecessors had ruled the people with a more iron hand or crushed them into ignobler bondage yet it may be questioned if any did more to raise the status of the empire in the eyes of the world to improve its social condition or to sow the seeds of that progress which has been steadily devel oping itself it is matter for surprise indeed  that this critical epoch in russian history has j not attracted far more attention than it has two facts are perhaps the best explanations  that can be given of the neglect one is that little as the rest of europe knows even now j with any certainty of what is going on in the  great eastern country our information today  bears a greater proportion to the information attainable then than the news of english i papers bears to the news of a hundred  years ago the other is that it is only within  the memory of living men that russia has begun to be included even in the range of civili ization much less regarded as a country capable  of anything better than spasmodic changes and unsystematic vagaries whatever the causes however the period from 1762 to 1796 is undoubtedly worthy of vastly more notice than has been given to it and from the pages of levesque mannstein and villebois at least enough can be got to reward the pains of reading them the story and character of catherine alone form a romance by themselves a comj parative parvenue beside ninetenths of her ooort intoxicated by suddenly finding herself rife of a man whose weakness and debaucheries yjrtually transferred an empire to her hands possessed of a clearheadedness which prevented even her intoxication being more than a useful ally of an ambition which disdained the thought of any restingplace of a heartlessness which stopped at nothing and of an intellect before which the most unmanageable bowed trusted by nobody and hated by all and hardly recognising such a consideration as personal expediency  this medley of profligacy good taste selfishness and generosity eclipses in our eyes her more famous predecessor peter this characterthe patron of art science and  education the originator of a methodical administration of justice the introducer of vaccination among her subjects the founder unless we are mistaken of the second foundling hospital in the world and the inpersonation of cruelty aud vice  mr grant has chosen for the foundation of his hst historical novel it is not often that we have to complain of novelists that they do not make their books long enough but we cannot  help thinking a mistake has for once been committed in the present case better materials than catherines entire reign we need hardly  say nobody could have had at handall the  better for a work of fiction by reason of the frequent absence of certainty as to minutia mr grant however though he has studied his subject has selected one little incident one of the darkest amid a crowd of dark ones and contented himself with moulding it into a onevolume tale the incident is this on the death of anne in 1742 her grandnephew ivan the sixth styled by mr grant ivan the  fourth had succeeded to the thronean infant less than a year oldonly however to be deposed and imprisoned within a few months by elizabeth when elizabeths successor peter the third was in his turn deposed and imprisoned by his wife catherine the latter found ivan now a youth of about twentyfour a dangerous obstacle to her security  and on the discovery of a conspiracy to restore him to his rights at once had him privately put to death in his dungeon out of this it is that the volume before us is constructedthe secret dispatch being the empresss order for the assassination sent to the governor of the state prison by one of the many british officers then in the russian service the perils he went through in carrying his charge from novgorod to st petersburg the chapter of accidents by which he became betrothed to the sister of the chief conspirator and the eminently disagreeable complications to which his loveaffairs led interwoven with a few pictures of russian society are the sumtotal of a book which might with advantage have been three times as long as to what there is we have no hesitation in saying it is worth reading probably indeed it gains in interest about as much as it loses by want of substance a little lovetale of only three years scope if it is well toldas this is just melancholy enough to enlist ones sympathies ending just happily enough not to bring on the blues and keeping the sentimental part of ones nature on perpetual tenterhooks by all sorts of lifeordeath tossups has something pleasant in its very sound and as a novel of this kind it is undoubtedly the most successful the author oas produced as an historical one we have already expressed disappointment on one ground and on another point we wink there is a want of sound judgment history put into the persuasive form of fiction ttght not to be altered more than is absolutely requisite for the purposes of art not only do all such unnecessary changes prevent a book being of real use but they are apt to do positive harm by causing it to leave wrong impressions behind why then should mr grant have gone out of his way to represent the incident on which the whole of his story turns differently from the fact  it would have been just as easy to mould his plot on the true account of mierowitzs mad conspiracy as on a purely imaginative one while no interest whatever is added by the gratuitous inaccuracy of representing the conspirators attacking ivans prison from without instead of according to unanimous authority taking advantage of their position as the garrison of the fortress itself in minor details such as mierowitzs social grade the actual origin of his animosity towards catherine and in others of little or no importance the romancer is fairly entitled to his licence but the best principle on which to go from step to

him that if he will attempt to force three volumes on the public every year that he will soon be without readers except such as contract with a circulating library and make a point of gulping every thing published under the name of a novel or a romance it is now some fifteen months since mr boggy published his  three perils of man a work with which we were at some pains to make our readers acquainted we did justice to the interest of the narrative and to the vigrour of some of the descriptions while at the same time we pointed out some glaring absurdities and expressed our regret at

modesty and good breeding w1 e confess we have read the three perils of woman and indeed mr hogfgs former romance to some disadvantage on account of our imperfect knowledge of the barbarous jarcron he so copiously introduces in the novel before us he has puzzled us sadly and never was our jamieson so thumbed or our glossaries so frequently consulted to enable us to translate the  three perils of woman for our own right understanding and gratification and not for that of our family to whom we soon found we must make it a sealed book we have heard it remarked that our english readers affect to admire the wxaverly novels in proportion as they do not understand them  should this be the case with m1r hloggs romance his  three perils will be the most popular work on this side of the tweed that

B4396,['5901188'],  constance herbert by geraldine e jfwsbuuy 3 vols london  hurst and blackett 1855 it seldom falls to our lot to take up a novel in which the writer has contrived to engage and interest the feelings of the readers more completely than in the one now before us miss jewsbury the authoress has in the present instance dealt somewhat largely in madness and sudden death and the rewards bestowed upon the virtuous appear rather meagre when contrasted with the punishments allotted to the wicked nevertheless the general feeling which is likely to result from the perusal of so many terriblo events is not one calculated to leave a morbid impression upon the mind since the 44 morale  of the book is sound and the chances are that most persons would return to the history of their own lives with increased satisfaction after contemplating upon paper so much wholesale miser in the second volume we have a glimpse of aunt margaret endeavouring to console the heroine constance herbert in the midst of a terrific affliction by reciting to her the still greater woes encountered by herself in earlier days we presume on the principle of larochefoucauld who tells us 44that in the misfortunes even of our best friends there is something not altogether displeasing to us at the conclusion of the aunts story the heroine with great naivete is made to express her astonishment that people ever should succeed in living to the age of eighty  indeed we fully under such circumstances agree with the heroine in her doubts and can suggest no moro practical expedient for struggling through such a weight of calamity than a box of parrs life pills the male characters in this book are by no meads pleasing specimens of the  genus homo charles herbert the father of the heroine who turns out eventually a wretch possesses in his early life a degree of credulity and trustfulness that is quite refreshing in these days of doubt and scepticism for instance he falls in love with though daughter of  a respectable yeoman who is a refined superior young woman failing to obtain the parents consent to the marriage be departs for india where shortly after his father informs him in a letter of kate hathertons the superior young womans marriage with somebody else the way hi which the news is received by charles herbert we give in the authors own words  charles herbert suffered keenly after this destruction of his hopes but he knew kate hatherton better than his father did and his faith in her was not shaken by her marriage with another man and his affection for her continued as strong as ever on his return home after a lapse of years he finds his ladyelove a widow the meeting is accidental and unexpected he greets her in the following style   kate my kate they grasped each others hands and it was as though they had never parted in the mean time that matters may be complete he has proposed to another lady miss wilmot who has given him her affections and fixed the wedding day this little affair does not appear to give him much uneasiness having as he tells us acquainted miss wilmot of his early attachment he irnagines that now that he has not only found his kate but found her free it does not appear that he over exerted himself in his 6earch miss wilmot is to resign him as a matter of course the abrupt manner in which he acquaints her of this rather startling change in her destiny we quote from the volume before us 441 am come to ask you to dissolve our engagement since this morning i have seen kate hatherton whom i never thought to see in this world again i give you my honour i did not seek her i did not know even that i still loved her till she stood before me in that place you left me this morning i cannot see what good it would do you to marry me knowing what you do for i told you all that kate hatherton had been to me and i tell you now all that she is thero would be no honour if i kept my engagement when the first sight of her made me forget youand myself too if i had been conscious of the hold she had over me i would never have spoken a word to you or to any other woman but it is too late to go into all that now 44 then were you quite indifferent about me  did you never caro for me   gasped miss wilmot 441 tell you sarah that i did not know my own heart i was not indifferent to you i cared for you more than any other woman i ever sawexcept one i loved her before i loved you and i shall love her till i die it is because you are a good woman and because you were my friend before i ever thought of you as my wife that i ara come in this way and because i thought you would see and feel how all this bas befallen miss wilmot sat completely stupefied with the weight and suddenness of the blow that had come upon her but in all wounds the great suffering does not follow immediately and she waa astonished to find how little pain she felt after a dull pause during which she pulled off the riug he had given her when they became engaged she said 44 you are free charlesquite free here is your ring again will you tell my uncle or shall i   44let me tell him said charles 44 and then if he thinks it needful to blow out ray brains he can 41 he will scarcely feel called upon to do that replied miss wilmot with a slight bitterness  charles herbert looked at her for the first time since the interview had begun his eyes had certainly rested upon her but without any personal consciousness that he saw ber sarah i hope with all my soul that i have been a coxcomb and that you do not really care for roe so much as i allowed myself to fancy you will get over it and no one who knows you can believe you to have been slighted a spasm of painful indignation passed across miss wilmots face  charles herbert said she rising  it is because i love yon it is because i was your friend before i was your affianced wife it is because i understand your nature better than any one else in the world is likely to do that i do not blame you for what you have done this day now leave me there is nothing more to say between us in this scene the authoress shows a knowledge of human nature miss wilmots mind is wholly unprepared to receive this cruel intelligence contrary therefore to the usual practice of authors in such cases there is neither immediate fainting nor hysterics but afterwards when her mind has digested all that has taken place she suffers severely enough there are other passages in this book that we might have selected showing the dramatic powers of the authoress to perhaps greater advantage but we abstain from quoting them for fear of diminishing the interest of the story we shall therefore limit ourselves to saying how heartily we concur in the sentiment uttered by aunt margaret  who says the more ones life resembles a novel the more uncomfortable it is and we feel we cannot too strongly recommend our friends to be cautious how they let their lives resemble this one

B7384,['8725978'],  seonee  or camp life on the sat pura range a tale of indian adventure by lt a sterndale frgs sampson low fc co this narrative of indian life was written the author tells us mainly for the benefit of the younger followers of st hubert whether they be bound for india or not with the laudable intention of inculcating that love of nature which will open to them to many fresh sources of enjoyment and make the mere destroying of wild beasts a secondary object but he also hopes that some of the traits of animal character and notes on natural history scattered through his pages may recall pleasant memories of the past to many an old shikari the incidents related have all occurred either within his own experience or that of his friends but to escape the appearance of egotism and pedantry and to impart his information in a freer and more conversational manner the author avoids the first person altogether and introduces the reader to two imaginary personages whose daily life and adventures during several months residence in the central parts of india form the framework of the book the characters of these two fiiends are pleasantly drawn and well sustained and thus although subsidiary to the plan of the book command our interest both are sportsmen  the one a manly unaffected youngster has come out on a visit to the elder a military man but in charge of the district the latter is a somewhat ideal specimen of a classhappily never absolutely rare in india though producible by no known system of examination one who by studying in a sympathetic spirit ae feelings and traditions of the people acquires without blinding himself to their faults a hearty interest in them which is repaid by confidence and unlimited respect in such a district as that under review he has to hold the balance between the simple aboriginal nonaryan races the more astute hindu cultivators and the warlike pathans and others legacies of the moghul and of the mahrattarule and he succeeds by sheer force of character and by a combination of qualities not as yet equally prominent in the bengalgraduate whom the laputan element in our councils threatens to substitute for him  our hero is a bold rider fond of sport as a field for skill and endurance and for the acquisition of fresh knowledge for he is a keen naturalist and holds a study of the nature and character both of animals and plants to be an essential attribute of the true sportsman accordingly in these points he hardly yields to the hereditary skill and knowledge of the native shikari the character of more than one of these men the indispensable companions of the english sportsman on terms often necessarily more intimate than his other followers is drawn from the life many curious instancesare related of their skill knowledge and patience and of the courage they display the author very properly reminds us that  we talk much of our exploits with our doublebarrelled rifles and elephants but our deeds are often put to shame by the shikari with bis single arm and rusty matchlock it is singular that in some parts of india as for instance in sind the shikari belongs to  degraded caste the above sketch of major fordham whois the mentor of his younger friend and the chief speaker throughout the volume will indicate the tone in which our author deals not only with matters connected with sport and natural history but with the higher interests of angloindian life both its pleasures and its duties have a keen attraction for him although his story closes in the great mutiny he is entirely free from the pessimism so widely and only too naturally engendered by that catastrophe and which seems with many not only to have darkened their views of indian humanity but to have rendered unattractive even the fair face of nature herself the district of seonee is part of a great upland tract in the heart of the peninsular some 2000 feet above the sea having the nerbudda river on the north and the territory of nagpore on the south its climate is equable and excepting in the three autumn months tent life is pleasant throughout the year the landscape is varied  scenes of rich quiet beauty alternating with others of rugged grandeur  nothing can exceed the beauty of certain portions of the nerbudda river where it flows in long deep coollooking often winding reaches between high banks covered near the waters edge with short grass and crowned with magnificent old trees of all description which overhang the water under which sic you see herds of spotted deer and flocks of peafowl feeding of the greater fauna m the lordly bison haunts the bambooclad slopes of the satpura range and interferes not with his un wieldly neighbour and cousin the buffalo who keeps to his grassgrown plains the red deer herd in the fertile valleys watered by the halone and the bonjar the sambur and the axis the stately blue boll and the tiny toylike moose deer all have their haunts in the forests that are spread over the undulating plateaux there are the rocky ravines for the bears and the stony plains haunted by antelope and bustard the grim tiger roams over thousands of square miles and the stealthy panther scruples not to carry off his prey even from the heart of a station the mode of life the character of the country and of the sport in this favoured district are all pleasantly described page after page is filled not only with sporting stories of the ordinary type but with curious facts in natural history with quaint touches of native character in various classes of the people and with bits of tradition or legend brought out naturally in conversation during the different expeditions foremost among the objects of the chase is the tiger to whom as to the more wily and treacherous panther great numbers of human beings yearly fall victims one notorious maneater in the district was credited with some four hundred deaths thus the visit of a sportsman on these occasions is a real advantage though it may be feared that the destruction of crops by deer and other animals already great will increase as those checks on their numbers are removed the inhabitants of a village are often personally acquainted with the tigers of their neighbourhood each of whom has its idiosyncrasies they will tell you that such a one is daring and rash that one is savage and morose another is mild and harmless brave as the native shikari is he is not proof against superstition  in one district the whole population was prostrated with fear of a panther who was said to be something more tlnn he seemed being in reality as the story went on chinta a fellow of bad character and who had the power of turning himself into a wild beast on one occasion being hungry he told his wife who had hitherto doubted bis powers that he was going to turn into a panther and kill venison and he gave her a root which when he returned in panther form she was to give to him that he might regain his human shape he accordingly retired into a jungle whence she saw a panther issue and kill a deer but on his returning toward her all blood  stained she threw down the root in terror and fled her husband in despair after failing to find the root tore her in pieces and became a maneater however having baffled all the shikaris english and native he was at last killed by a starving gond who had tempted fate in hope of earning the government reward we have not space even to allude to the many varieties of shooting which may be enjoyed in seonee there is fishing to be had also but the

extraordinary and highlyinteresting events in his life from 1733 to 1749 as written in his own diary edited by miss j porter 3 vols 12mo tlhis is truly a  romance of real life and in point of interest and even of detail realizes and more than realizes the imaginations of defoe it is the selftold tale of a young man who with his wife and a little dog was wrecked on a reef of rocks enclosing and protecting two small unoccupied islandsand of his residence there for ten or twelve years mr seaward left england when about twentythree as the supercargo of a vessel bound for the bay of honduras in 1733accompanied by his newmarried wife three or four years younger than himself the vessel was driven by a storm upon the rocksthe crew took to the boat which was swampedand seaward and his wife who adhered to the wreck were the sole survivors the return of the tide lifted the vessel off the rocks and enabled him to get it into a creek and thus secure it against future storms with the stores of the vessel they were in no danger of starving and in a spirit of thankfulness for their preservation they quickly bestirred themselves to provide as far as they could for their personal security and comfort the island was very small but they were the lords of it and had no conflicting interests to contend with iguanas peccaries and armadillos were the only animals they met with the first their little dog killedbut the peccaries made fight and gave them some trouble the shore supplied them with mullets and crabs and turtle abounded the stranded vessel was their home and on the island they sowed and planted and domiciliated the ducks and fowls and goats which they had on board seaward laboured hard with the planks which fortunately had formed part of the cargo at building a house and making enclosures for his fruits and corn and stock fondly attached as were seaward and his bride their lone situation drew the chords of affection the closer and the island in a blissful climate was their paradise it is impossible for the coldest heart to read and not melt at the details of their attachment in the island they found a cavethe retreat of large flocks of pigeonswhere their attention was one day attracted by the appearance of artificial brickwork they removed the bricks and discovered a mass of treasuredoubloonsto the extent of forty or fifty thousand pounds with vessels of gold and silver in great abundance chiefly church plate though apparently all this was of no more value to them than the diamond to ajsops cock they carefully closed up the aperture and after some scruples resolved to appropriate the prizethey might not stay there for ever at the end of about six months a boat with five negroestwo men and three womenrunaway spanish slaveslanded and being kindly welcomed proved themselves faithfully devoted to their service seaward was thus relieved from severe personal labour and had nothing further to do than direct the willing industry of his new friends a few more months rolled away when an american vessel appeared off the rocks pursued by a spanish guardacosta seaward and his negroes assisted in repelling the spaniard and in the american which remained some weeks for repairs he finally took a passage for himself his wife and the treasure to jamaicaleaving behind him the negroes with directions till his return at jamaica he took measures for securely transferring his doubloons c to a london banker with a prudence and caution quite exemplary instead of following his treasures he had resolved to return to the island and purchasing a vessel and fitting it out with a cargo of useful matters and a crew of negroes and labourers and a naval officer to commandfurnishing himself also with a commissionfrom the commandant at jamaicahe soon reached again the new settlement soon some relations from england joined them more negroes were obtained from jamaicahis plans prosperedand he resolved to go to england to visit his friends and make preparations for extending the colony in england he found his money growing at perry and childs the bankers and mrs child introduced the wealthy strangers to her fashionable society for which neither seaward nor his wife had much taste intent upon his purpose seaward lost no time in opening a negotiation with the government for the lurchase of the twio islands of which he had himself taken possession for the crown but met with great and apparently insuperable difficultieschiefly as it turned out from not understanding the ministers particular mode of transacting business lie did not readily comprehend the necessity of contributing to sir roberts bribepurse a curious scene of ministerial tactics is laid open for which we have unluckily no space meanwhile mrs seaward had employed mrs childs marituamaker and shown her some beautiful gold stuff quite unparalleled in england mrs childs mantuamaker happened to be the queens also and the tale of the gold stuffs quickly reached the royal ears a visit from the mistress of the robes lady sundon followed mrs seaward presented the stuffs to the queen and was introduced to the royal presence the adventures of herself and husband became naturally the topic of conversation the queen was delighted with the story and with the simple manners of mrs seaward and all difficulties in the husbands negotiation vanished like lightning his demands were granted and himself knighted to the amazement and vexation of sir robert who could not comprehend the manceuvre the queen was at that time regent 1736 all impediments being thus removed the new knight accelerated the supplies for his colony engaged a surgeon and a chaplain and took under his protection a dozen german families recommended by the queeninvesting before he set out a portion of his money in the purchase of the hartland estate in gloucestershire where he established his sisters c then returning to the colony he prosecuted his purposes with activity and both islands were soon in a populous and thriving condition at home however sir robert walpole had not forgotten him and took ample revenge for the mortifications he had sustained lie employed seaward in troublesome negotiations with the spanish commanders on the spanish main and finally singled him out to apologize in the name of the government for some injuries said to have been committed by british vessels this was a perilous service isle refused to accede to the humiliating demands of the spanish commander was thrown into prison and only rescued by vernons capture of the fort again returning to the settlements he found every thing prospering but soon finding himself involved in more business and conflicts than was agreeablethe same necessity no longer continuing and perhaps he himself wearyinghe finally quitted it for his estate in england a gap here occurs in the ms but a few closing pages have escaped which contain his spirited remonstrance with the government relative to their cession of the two little islands to the spaniards the dialogue with the duke of newcastle is most characteristic of that addleheaded but obstinate personage sir edward was compelled to submit and accept of a very inadequate compensation for himself anl his friends this was in 1749 and  now my dear edward said his beloved eliza at the close of this decisive interview with the duke of newcastle  let us return to hartland and finish our days in peace the excellent lady died a few months after sir edward survived till 1774 the ms was placed by his representative in the hands of miss j porter by

serious faults  sir edward seagers narrative of his skipwreck and consequent discovery of certain islands in the caribbean sea with a detail of many extraordinary and highly interesting events in his life from the year 1733 to 1749 as written in his own diary edited by miss jane porter 3 vols post 8vo we have heard that two men the only inhabitants of the eddystone lighthouse quarrelled and never spoke to each other for months the anecdote is mentioned as the most perfect known instance of sulkiness as they could converse with no others in the book before us we have a specimen which better suits the human character before the fall we have a sort of a mr and also a mrs robinson crusoe in reality though not in name who live like adam and eve in paradise loving and beloved with perfect happiness though only by themselves and we solemnly believe that two amiable people however ennuyes may live together in honeymoon style through having no resources but in themselves it is certain too that persons who have the stores of a whole vessel at command shipwrecked upon a fine uninhabited island in a tropical climate and who are also young and healthy may lead a very patriarchal and agreeable life for such a circumstance attaches to the history of pitcairns island and as necessity is the mother of invention so that son may turn out a very handy bustling and useful fellow such a narrative is now before us and considering it either as a romance or a history it does great credit to miss porter we find in it all the resources of aladdins wonderful lamp  the phraseology however is not in keeping with that of the year 1734 without any supernatural aid it further teaches us that in almost any situation there may be happiness where there is reason and virtue not passion and vice and that civilization under the former circumstance may be of speedy growth the book is also an excellent study for missionaries inasmuch as it teaches them their trade and the uses of their tools as well as inculcates a piety and philanthropy so productive of reason happiness and good conduct as to exhibit in a most attractive view the real blessedness of sound religious principles the work being however composed wholly of practical details we shall not make any extracts only in conclusion observe that it is one of the best books which we ever saw for instruction in the establishment of colonies and one that with particular singularity shows how pleasantly adam and eve may have lived in paradise at least till a doctor was wantedbut where there are children old people accidents and epidemics physic is an indispensable necessity nevertheless animals do without doctors but they are instinctively good herbalists and have their own pharmacopoeia,biography_contra

and co thoroughly genuine and unaffected these memoirs display the whole mind of a woman who was well worth knowing and relate a large part of her experience among people with whose names and characters the world will be at all times busy a true woman and a keen observer indoctrinated in all the prepossessions of the old nobility yet superior to most of its prejudices in the secret comers of her heart a little superstitious not at all exempt from little vanities and weaknesses that rather grace her sex firmly affectionate in nature and by position thrown in the high places of the world the countess doberkirchlanele as her bosom friends tenderly called herwas the very woman to write memoirs that would interest future generations we commend the volumes before us most heartily to every reader they were written by the baroness in the bloom of her own life and health and though they narrate many experiences of life in a corrupt court everything comes to us on her pages through a mind so pure and true that we are never shocked while at the same time the whole narration is so fresh a transcript of what seemed most interesting in the writers own experience that we are never wearied that is to say of course if we skip all the pedigrees the baroness esteems birth very highly  and when she speaks of any one for the first time if he should happen to have a father and a grandfather she thinks it due to state the fact and mention who they are all this however adds to the character and charm of the whole book the baroness does not mystify herself her weak sides are patent enough but they are pleasant little weaknesses belonging to her period and to the station that she held in her first chapter she frankly says i may perhaps have lingered a little too long over these accounts of my family but i do not regret it in the first place i wished it to be distinctly known from what race i have sprung i feel it to be a conscientious obligation and besides i find a pleasure in relating these particulars i have the weakness if it be one to esteem what the heroes of the present day call trifles and i ask in my future soninlaw if providence should tend me one in the midst of the chaos which surrounds us and which seems about to swallow up ali social order i ask i tay in my soninlaw only high birth there it a remedy for every defect but the want of that at the same time there ara aoattered through her book little expressions of fatigue over the ceremonials of courts of intense enjoyment of the ease of nature of a love of flowers and of other things which show how faithfully the woman a heart waa beating under the constraints of an absurd etiquette nevertheless aha can stand upon her dignities right royally witness a seana like the following in which aha meets

to think of him and i acknowledge now in all humility that i had no cause to repent having always had a passion for the marvellous hit eminence contrived at the end of about ave minutes not without some opposition on my part as well at on that of m doberkirch to make the conversation general he had the tact not to name me had he done to i should have instantly risen but he contrived to manage the conversation to that his protege sometimes addressed ut aad politeness obliged ut to reply cagliottro all thia time continued to stare at me my husband made me a sign to come away but i felt the glance of these deep mysterious eyes enter mv bosom like a gitnblet 1 can find no better comparison to express the effect they produced upon me he suddenly interrupted m de rohan who par parenthese was overwhelmed with joy and said to rae abruptly  madam your mother no longer lives you have scarcely known her and you have one daughter you are the only daughter of your family and you will have no more children i was so surprised that i looked round rae not supposing it possible that he could have the audacity to address a lady of my rana in such a place and such a presence i thought he was sneaking td somebody else and did not answer  reply madam said the cardinal with a supplicating air u my lord madame doberkirch speaks upon such subjects only with those with whom she has the honour of being acquainted replied my husband in a tone that was almost impertinent i feared thal he might forget the respect due to the bishop he rose nnd made a haughty salute i did the same the cardinal accustomed to find flatterers in all who approached him was embarrassed  he did not know what to do  however he drew near to m doberkirch cagliostro still staring at nie and addressed him in wordi so soothing that it was impossible to resist their influence  m de cagliostro is a learned man  we must not treat him as an ordinary person added he  remain a few moments my dear baron allow madame doberkirch to reply  there is neither sin noi impropriety i assure you and even if there were have i not the power of absolving in reserved cases  i have not the honour of being of your flock my lord interrupted m doberkirch with some slight remains of illhumour  i know that but too well sir and am sorry for it you would do honour to our church baroness tell us whether m de cagliostro has been mistakentell ut i pray you  he has not been mistaken as to what concerns the past i replied not being able to refuse to bear testimony to the truth  and i am aa little mistaken in what concerns the future said cagliostro in a tone so metallic that it echoed like the sound produced by a trumpet veiled with crape i will candidly confess that i felt at the moment an intense desire to consult that man arni that nothing but the fear of annoying m doberkirch whose aversion for all these mummeries i knew well could prevent me the cardinal stared openmouthed he was evidently under the control of this skilful juggler as he has since too well proved that day will remain for ever engraven on my memory it was with difficulty that i tore myself from a fascnation which 1 cannot yet comprehend but whose influence i could not deny 1 have not yet finished with cagliostro and what i am about to relate is at least as extraordinary and more generally known than what 1 have narrated he predicted the death of the empress maria theresa and even foretold the hour at which she should expire m de rohan told it to me in the evening aud it was five days after that the news arrived in looking over these pages for a few selections that will illustrate our good opinion we are bewildered among riches they are a perfect magazine of pleasant anecdotes and interesting characteristic things the baroness in her youth became a house friend in the little court of montbeliard from which proceeded the wife of the unfortunate grand duke paul the heirapparent to the throne of russia the future grand duchess was the bosom friend of the baroness and the more than sisterly affection was retained by them both until the last paul and his warmhearted beautiful wife travelled from russia under the names of count and countess du nord and remained some time in paris whither the baroness doberkirch was taken by her husband that she might rejoin her friend life in alsatia at strasburg and montbeliard is therefore succeeded by a chronicle of life among the court circles the poets and philosophers the balls and theatres of paris in 1762 afterwards there is a further account of residence in paris during the years 84 and 86 when the authoress was taken thither by the duchess do bourbon the amiable grand duke paul and his wife are in these memoirs depicted with a completeness that imparts extreme valma

interapsmd  with pedigrees that will be found extremely edifying we will omit however as we have not space for them the verses of the poet in honour of the occasion a marriage took place in that october of thit year which was considered a legitimate subject of conversation for everybody the prince of nassau saarbruk married his son who waa only twelve to mademoiselle de montbarrey who waa eighteen years of age bverybedy was astonished at this alliance not because he waa protestant and she catholic for mixed marriages were very common in that country but because of the age of the prince the young princess wat to return to her parents immediately after tnt ceremony and to remain with them until her husband should be of age mademoiselle de montbarrey ia daughter to the ancient warminister tnt count de st germain had appointed him his assistant in this office in which he succeeded him as he was very clever he profited largely by hie position he was created prince of the holy roman empire grandee of spain knight of the order and grand baillie of haguenau hie wife had been n great beauty she had a most exquisite complexion pearly teeth a captivating smile soft dovelike eyes and caressing mannerall of which made her one of the most charruing persona in the world she haa been accused of having had a too tender heart but she waa beloved and has enjoyed with taste and grace the position of her husband this marriage of the prince de nanausaarbruk with mademoiselle de montbarrey waa a very grand affair the comte de saarbruk as well as that of saarwerden was ceded to france with a number of j dependent lands and lordships in 1681 by an article of the trenry of westphalia to indemnify the ouiit de naeaausaarbruk the emperor by letters patent raised him 4th of august 1688 to the rank of prince of the holy roman bmpire the bridal pair received congratulations and compliments in every possible form i have preserved a copy of some verses addretsed to the princes by a drawingroom poet and which were read with great j avidity during the bridal festivities these verses are very stupid  but i quote them because tbty amused us exceedingly when we considered that this husband  possessor of your charms and who  to loves enchanting bliss shall wake was a child of twelve years of age who wept from morning to night frantic at being made an object of universal curiosity flying from his wife and even repulsing her with the rudeness of aa illbred child and having no desire to claim a title whose signification he did not understand mademoiselle de montbarrey belied ber ordinary good taste in making a display of these verses it would have been better to conceal them m de dietrich who had purchased in 1761 the seigniory of reis boffen near haynenau had the castle rebuilt in 69 thia was confiscated property of the prince de vauderaont and bore the name of an ancient family of alsace now extinct the reigning prince of nassau saarbruk gave brilliant fetes in this castle upon the event of tke marriage of his son with the princess maximiliana de montbarrey all the province was invited thereall the neighbouring courts everything was on a scale of the greatest magnificence the hunts feasts and promenades lasted three daya m doberkirch and i were present i met several persons of ray acquaintance both french and i german during the ball the bridegroom would on no account consent to dance with the bride he was at length threatened with a whipping in case of further refusal and promised a deluge of sugarplums and all sorts of sweetmeats if he complied  whereupon he consented to lead her through a minuet though ht showed so great an aversion to her who had a legal claim upon his attentions he manifested a great sympathy for little louisa de dietrich a child of his own age and returned to ait beside her aa soon as he could free himself from the ennutjeuse ceremony of attending on hie bride thit was the  husband wh southeast  rapt embrace  awaited

imeeting once more her beloved grandduchess who was then making the tour of europe also in the company of her husband this portion of the work is very interesting for the baroness gives us a much more lifelike sketch than we possessed before of the haut monde at the period immediately prior to the revolution the reception accorded by the court of versailles to the successors of the czarina was as might naturally be expected very splendid indeed  and madame doberkirclr as the intimate friend of the grandduchess was not excluded from a full participation in them the severe laws of etiquette were even abated somewhat in her favour for the royal family dispensing in her case with the tedious formula of presentation admitted her at once to the freedom granted to distinguished foreigners the grandduke and duchess made their european tour under the title of the count and countess du nord and a few words of explanation as to the cause of this will not be misplaced as giving some idea of the extraordinary rigidity of french etiquette which since the days of louis xiv had become so severe and unbending that the court refused to recognise at all the rank of foreign princes before the imperial majesty of france all ranks though never so illustrious mingled indiscriminately with the common herd and when it so happened that visitors of royal rank were favoured with an invitation to dine they could not be allowed the honour of touching hands on this account it became the custom of such foreign magnates as desired a closer inspection of the glories of versailles to appear there under fictitious names by making which sacrifice to the dignity of the french throne the laws of etiquette were somewhat relaxed in their favour and they were admitted as a matter of grace to familiarities which under their proper titles they would not have been permitted to claim as a matter of right immediately on her arrival in paris the baroness lost no time in paying her respects to madame bertin the famous court milliner of the day of this ladys inflated ideas of her own importance many amusing anecdotes are related on one occasion a provincial lady of some importance applied to her for a headdress when the milliner having eyed her from head to foot and appearing satisfied with the result of her examination turned with a majestic air to one of her assistants saying  show this lady the result of my last conference with her majesty the impressions produced upon the mind of the baroness by the splendours of versailles appear to have been of the most lively description she attended the reception of her friend the countess du non and was present at an entertainment subsequently given in honour of the illustrious guests after dinner the entire court assembled in the saloon de la paix where there was to be a concert there were places in the gallery for persons who had been presented but had not received invitations from the queen the palace was all brilliantly illuminated as on days of high ceremonial a thousand chandeliers depended from the ceilings and every bracket supported a branch holding forty waxlights the effect was magical it would be impossible to give an adequate description of the splendour and richness of the decorations of the magnificence of the dresses or of the matchless beauty of the queen who lent a grace and charm to everything around her  one of the most striking coup deils that i have ever seen is that oif the royal family at a ball when all the court is assembled there is a gracious majesty in the bearing of the queen particularly in her airs de ttme which is peculiar to herself the kindness and affability of the king are extreme their majesties are followed by madame elizabeth and all the princes and princesses all attended by their respective suites the effect is magical as well by the quantity and splendour of the jewels as by the gold and silver embroideries and the richness of the stuff those who have not seen this tabeau ricant can form no idea of it alas alas but a short period of years and these airs de the what were they before the pitiless undiscriminating edge of the guillotine the literati of paris were of course not at all backward in paying their court to the heir to the empire of the czars and foremost among them came m de la harpe of whom the baroness does not appear to have entertained the most favourable opinion his excessive and ridiculous selflove says she was unbearable no amount of compliments could satisfy him he was become a burden to us all an anecdote she relates of him is very happy indeed one day soon after the appearance and damnation of his tragedy the barmecide he happened to be walking near the carriage in which were seated the baroness and two other ladies of faishion when a man passed by crying  who will btuy my walkingsticks a la barmicide walkingsticks  la barmcide said one of the ladies  that ought to interest you m de la iiarpe allow rue to present you with one of these canes in remembrance of your great success the man was accordingly summoned to approach the carriage and presented three or four canes with very ugly ivory balls on the tops why do you call the in a la barmecide  said the lady  you shall see madame said the man with a very knowing air and taking off one of the ivory balls he showed that it concealed an immense ratcall the ladies had the cruelty to burst into laughter and as for poor de la iiarpe le could as beaumarchais said have shed tears of bile in spite of the previous declaration of her willingness to play the part of a mecena8 her aristocratic predelictions caused the baroness to hold the school of free philosophers then springing up in the greatest horror and detestation she speaks of them constantly in almost a prophetic spirit as  those gentlemen who have caused and will yet cause us so much evil rousseau she appears to have held in especial horror that she should visit the sins of the times upon the poor philosophers and spare her favourite nobility is somewhat as if one were to pardon those who wilfully set fire to a city and punish only those who raise the alarm her strong gorx sense does not appear to have saved her from a tendency to superstition to which indeed she confesses a natural predisposition several clairroyant stories and a ghost story imposed upon her credulity by the grandduke of russia in which the ghost of peter the great is summoned from the world of spirits would have been better bestowed in a collection of marvellous tales than in a work assuming the credit of authenticity in may 1784 m doberkirch visited paris for the second time and underwent the ceremony of being formally presented to her sovereign the strictness with which the examination into the respectability of applicants for this distinetion was conducted may be inferred from the fact that the testimonials of noble descent were required to date from the year 1399 and even then loutis xvi reserved to himself the power of accepting or refusing the testimonials and of deciding in all doubtful cases the officer upon whom the duty of verifying the testimonials of descent devolved was ciierin surnamed on account of his flexibility in this respect the incorriptibh it was in reference to this dignitary that chamfort said when nature wishes to make a virtuous man or a man of genius she does not go to cherin the baroness however passed happily through the ordeal and she complacently indulges us with an enumeration of the various advantages consequent upon the honour titled ladies such as duchesses the wives of spanish grandees and those whose families possessed the hereditary honours of the louvre took on their presentation the privilege of the tabouret which was an imperial of crimson velvet bound with gold to be worn on their carriages and they might have a dais erected in their drawingrooms the king also had to kiss them when they were presented to him but this is said to have been a ceremony very disagreeable to louis xvi his two predecessors possibly did not find it so during this visit to paris as one day she was walking in the palais royal with her husband mie doberkirch happened to tread upon the toe of the celebrated dancer vestris the rebuke of the great man was characteristic  madame said he  you have escaped putting all paris into mourning for a fortnight this dieu de danse used to say that in his day there were three great men in europe himself the king of prussia and m de voltaire some anecdotes of lady craven and her connexion with the margrave of anspach will not be without interest to those who study the annals of our aristocracy and a transcript of the confessions of the celebrated duchess of kingstoir supplied to the baroness by the duchess herself will be read with very great interest when the bastille fell the baroness donenkircii set a period to her story for worlds she writesfor worlds i would not

family the daughter of a baron von walduer and early united to an estimable man madame doberkirch yet seems to have lived hardly so much for father kinsfolk husband or child as for the dear dear princess the latter married the archduke paul of russia and the august pair travelled as the count and countess du nord this affectionate and admiring friendship on the part of madame doberkirchwhich was warmly reciprocated by its objectis the pivot on which the interest of these memoirs turns neither of the two contracting parties exhibits any force or originality of character  neither is described as undergoing any painful amount of vicissitude but they pass along through shows files journeys and state receptions  chatting about fashions dresses singers and dancers and every now and then enjoying a little innocent scandal  though madame doberkirch takes frequent pains to assure us that she was behind or before her time in her discouragement of double entendre or of evil report besides the countess du nord madame doberkirch had a friend and confidante the duchess of bourbonby whom she was tempted twice to paris enough is now told to give the reader an idea of the argument and the character of these volumes and to make him understand that we do not warrant all the stories which they contain this premised we need only add that the baronesss social philosophies were of the school then trembling on the very verge of that rude shock from which it has never recovered the privileged aristocrat breathes over all her pagesnot very offensively it is true because the tone is so visibly the communication of a vicious education to a mind of the very commonest class to the apprehension of those by whom she was surrounded  order implied merely the ascendancy of their own order madame doberkirchs dwarf mind could not look over the low artificial barriers which were set up from childhood around it and which the coming tempest was to sweep away from her youth she wore aristocratic blinkers and nothing in her mind ever suggested their throwing off early in her volumes she formulates her own moral blindness and judicial littleness i have the weakness if it be one to esteem what the heroes of the present day call trifles and i ask in my future soninlaw if providence should send me one in the midst of the chaos which surrounds us and which seems about to swallow up all social order i ask i say in my soninlaw only high birth there is a remedy for every defect but the want of thatthat is the keynote of her volumes an introduction to the cardinal de rohan at strasburg brought madame doberkirch into momentary relations with one more famous than the cardinal a very interesting conversation then commenced in which i took a real pleasure the cardinal being both wellinformed and wellbred when we were suddenly interrupted by a gentleman usher who opening the foldingdoors announced  his eminence the count de cagliostro   he was not strictly speaking handsome but never have i seen a more remarkable countenance his glance was so penetrating that one would be almost tempted to call it supernatural i could not describe the expression of his eyesit was so to say a mixture of flame and ice he attracted and repulsed and whilst he terrified inspired an insurmountable curiosity two portraits have been painted of him both very good likenesses and yet each widely different from the other he wore attached to his watch chain and upon his fingers diamonds which if they were what they appeared would be worth a king ransom he pretended that they were his own manufacture all this frippery revealed unmistakably the charlatan scarcely had the cardinal perceived than he ran to meet him and whilst he saluted him at the door said something which i did not try to overhear both approached us i had risen at the same time as the bishop but immediately resumed my place not wishing to allow this adventurer to believe that i would accord him any attention i was however soon forced to think of him  and i acknowledge now in all humility that i had no cause to repent having always had a passion for the marvellous his eminence contrived at the end of about five minutes not without some opposition on my part as well as on that of m doberkirch to make the conversation general he had the tact not to name mehad he done so i should have instantly risen but he contrived to manage the conversation so that hsprotig sometimes addressed us and politeness obliged us to reply cagliostro all this time continued to stare at me my husband made me a sign to come away but i felt the glance of these deep mysterious eyes enter my bosom like a gimlet i can find no better comparison to express the effect they produced upon me he suddenly interrupted m de rohan who par parcntlttee was overwhelmed with joy and said to me abruptlymadam your mother no longer lives you have scarcely known her and you have one daughter you are the only daughter of your family and you will have no more children i was so surprised that i looked round me not supposing it possible that he could have the audacity to address a lady of my rank in such a place and such a presence i thought he was speaking to somebody else and did not answer  reply madam said the cardinal with a supplicating air my lord madame doberkirch speaks upon such subjects only with thoee with whom she has the honour of being acquainted replied my husband in a tone that was almost impertinent i feared that he might forget the respect due to the bishop he rose and made a haughty salute i did the same the cardinal accustomed to find flatterers in all who approached him was embarrassed he did not know what to do however he drew near to m doberkirch cagliostro staring at me and addressed him in words so soothing that it was impossible to resist their influence  m de cagliostro is a learned man we must not treat him as an ordinary person added he  remain a few moments my dear baron allow madame doberkirch to reply there is neither sin nor impropriety i assure you and even if there were have i not the power of absolving in reserved cases  i have not the honour of being of your flock my lord interrupted m doberkirch with some slight remains of illhumour i know that but too well sir and am sorry for it you would do honour to our church baroness tell us whether m de cagliostro has been mistakentell us i pray you he has not been mistaken as to what concerns the past i replied not being able to refuse to bear testimony to the truth and i nm as little mistaken in what concerns the future said cagliostro in a tone so metallic that it echoed like the sound produced by a trumpet veiled with crape here are a few paris fashions for 1784  after the opera we went to the tuileries then the fashionable promenade but as the parisians do everything through caprice they selected one alley and would not take a step in any of the others all were suffocating some persons almost fought the buttons of the gentlemens coats carried off thc lace trimming of the ladies mantelets falbalas were torn by the pommels of swords and flounces of point lace were sometimes seen dangling from the end of a scabbard gentlemen began about this time to go about unarmed and wore swords only in full dress the humbler classes imitated them and fashion was more powerful than authority could have been   it is now the fashion to dine at three oclock and the time for dinner is very short of which the gastronomists and cooks complain sorely it seems as though the folk nowadays eat only for the sake of nutriment and wish when they have satisfied their appetites to fly from table the old people say that such conduct is not dignified the cooks are in open rebellion  people swallow said the cook of the duchess de la valliere they no longer taste i am dishonoured    ten is the hour for supper and the rapidity of execution at this meal is not less than at dinner the repast is not now announced to the lady of the house when dinner is ready the butler appears and the lady rises the age of gourmandise is past but our tables are not less elegantly laid the luxury ofthe i present day is alarming the men have scarcely j time to eat and drink  some of them have essayed j to be very engaging very gay even gallant hoping  to detain the ladies longer endeavouring possibly by these means to secure themselves a little time for j digestion i know one gentleman who commenced j a very interesting story after the first course interrupting himself every momentbreaking off his narrative by questions replies jeux de mots and various other artifices hoping thus to make it last a considerable time he succeeded in prolonging his history and keeping the attention of his auditors awake until after the fruit appeared and his appetite had been fully satisfied he practised this manoeuvre every evening and always succeeded   this blessed 6th of june she awakened me at the earliest dawn  i was to get my hair dressed and j make a grand toilette in order to go to versailles whither the queen had invited the countess du nord for whose amusement a comedy was to be performed these court toilettes are neverending and this road from paris to versailles very fatiguing especially when one is in continual fear of rumpling her petticoat and flounces i tried that day for the first time a new fashionone too which was not a little gtnante i wore in my hair little flat bottles shaped to the curvature of the head into these a little water was poured for the purpose of preserving the freshness of the natural flowers worn in the hair and of which the stems were immersed in the liquid this did not always succeed but when it did the effect was charming nothing could be more lovely than the floral wreath crowning the snowy pyramid of powdered hair and here are one or two fashionable personages of the time u i had been invited to a morning concert at the count dalbarets he is a rich piedmontese who has musicians in his own pay who live in his house and do not go out without his permission isle is passionately fond of music he has a large hall for the use of musicians where they practice all day for this reason his concerts are admirable  they are reputed the best iu paris that is easily understood a perfect harmony must exist between musicians who always practice together m dalbaret possesses a great deal of talent and writes very pretty verse he is a virtuoso in all the arts he is the intimate friend of madame de la massais and of madame de la rcyniere   m dalbaret often took a part in theatrical pieces with mesdames de montesson and de genlis he was the friend of both which was strange considering the cordial hatred they entertained for one another when i say he was their friend i mean that he was an acquaintance of both hut he did not like them  and i have heard that he gave very striking descriptions of each and not at all flattering madame de montesson had the airs of an upstart commoner and they seemed as natural to her as her mothers milk she sweated pride1 said la har pe and he ought to be a judge of the sentiment her life was a continued scene of domestic

roses and in ermined robes with slipshod heels and cotton stocking said one day the duchess of bourbon to whom the mention of her stepmother caused a nausea it was she who most strongly resisted the

duchess of orleans inpartibus alas said the duchess of bourbon  we can no longer acid infidelium as she is well marriedthat madame de montesson in short should enter into the convent ofthe assumption

madame de genlis  the tutor showed itelf in a different fashion i do not wish to enter into particulars i did not like her spite of her accomplishments and the charm of her conversation she was too systematic she ls a woman who has laid aside the flowing robes of her sex for i the culottes of a pedagogue besides nothing about her is natural she is constantly in an attitude as it were thinking that her portrait moral or physical is being taken she attaches too much importance to her celebrityshe thinks too much of her own opinions one of the great follies of this masculine woman is her harp

his disorderly career and his credit being quite exhausted he was forced to return like the prodigal son to the paternal chateau he arrived unencumbered by a second coat a largo party had been invited to dinner but as our hero expected the company to be rather stupid he wished not to appear giving his toilet as an excuse monsieur said his father  i will expect you to join this dinner party i should feel much pleasure but you see it is impossible this coat wear another i have not got it you have not one  after spending sixty thousand livres with tailors and embroiderers that would have been a

thousand livres from usurersmon dieu monsieur i do not mean to contradict you but the crowns have followed the coatsm dc louvois raised his eyes and arms to heaven uttered an exclamation of anger and

that i forbid you to appear there in the coat you now wearthe chevalier was stunnedembarrassed he knew not what to do the paternal mandate was positive and he had no hope of future assistance from his father if he did not obey him now isle called his valet a second scapin and they put all their wits to work to find some means of getting out of this dilemma but in vain human invention seemed unequal to the task the chevalier was distracted  he paced his chamber in dismay when casting his eyes upon the hangings which represented the marriage procession of alexander and statira a sudden thought struck him ah  said he  i know what i will do go into the village and bring me the tailor with all his implements immediately and tell him to prepare to spend the night here but m le chevalier go immediately and do not replywhen the valet had left the room lie proceeded with the greatest coolness to take down though curtains off his bed and laying them on a table marked out the figures he admired most the tailor was broughtcome my man said he you must make a coat vest and culotte out of this be sure to choose the handsomest ladies for the front nnd this high priest with his long bearii will do very well for the back the valet and the tailor thought and with very good reason that their young master was losing his senses but he was so determined that they were obliged to obey the suit was finished in time and fitted extremely well the chevalier was very well pleased and having completed his toilet descended to the diningroom which he entered with an imperturbable countenance he was received with shouts of laughter his father was very angry but this public disgrace obliged him to open his purse for his extravagant heir who with fresh funds returned to paris he became very intimate with mademoiselle colombe an actress at the italian comedy and in a transport of gratitude he one day asked her what he could do that would give her pleasure send me some chatons precious

as a novel  darkness and dawn is not indeed even so much as an historical novel for there is next to no construction of plot outside the grim narratives derived from tacitus seneca and their contemjoraries to connected narratives and otters dr farrar has added a multiplicity of materials from the literature of imperial rome at and after the close of the first century with vast labour and perseverance he must have ransacked the satires odes and epigrams as well as the longer works of the most polished latin authors in that most dissolute and demoralised age he has thus put together for the older and younger readers of a sensationloving age a record of deliberate refined and accumulated criminality of murder and lust and cruelty such as would scarcely be found in any other printed book easily accessible to young and impressionable minds though it is true that the author has somewhat softened down the crudest details of neros more ghastly crimes and has avoided altogether the worst features of the age dr farrar has painted this lurid picture for a definite and intelligible purpose in order to exhibit the golden vein of christian faith and profession running through the dense mass of pagan vice and bloodthirstiness and his story ends with the bright refulgence of that dominant faith which was to vanquish the empire of the world considerations of reticence and fastidiousness not to say of exact chronology seem more than once to have given way before the craving of the artist for an effective contrast and certainly it would be impossible to secure a contrast more sharp and striking than that which is here drawn between the ecstasies of the early christian faith and though stews and bloodpits of neros rome mr robertson also deserves credit for a manful effort to restore the historical novel could any man do so with success he would be a benefactor to the age but the aspirant must contend with many difficulties when the greatest of historical novelists aroused the interest of two nations and then of the world he had the benefit of the absence of the scientific historian and of the presence of a vague national pride in though past in our days every boy who has passed the fifth standard is a sworn cosmopolitan and our writers have agreed to bless humanity that they are rid of the dark days of old yet the popular ignorance of those days

eirinn  foundation of knowledge on ireland of geoffrey keating finished in 1629 and read and transcribed in every irishspeaking part of ireland during the two succeeding centuries is the latest literary summary in irish of the historical tales traces of which are to be found in irish books for many previous centuries leabhar na huidhri an existing manuscript written about the year 1100 shows that many of these tales were prevalent before that date the glossary of cormac the composition of which may be attributed to the tenth century is evidence that in the year 900 they were part of literature the irish manuscript numbered 1395 in the library of st gall carries them back to the eighth century and as they were then part of common knowledge it is easy to believe that they were well known two or three centuries earlier it is therefore a justifiable hypothesis that they were in existence at the time of the introduction of writing into ireland from italy had they when first met with been attributed to any one great author it is probable that some indication of this attribution would have survived such is the nature of the evidence which justifies the belief that these historical tales of the early history of ireland are older j than the fifth century and the introduction of writing into the island how much older they are is unknown but the remote period to which they can be traced and the study of their development and elaboration lead to the conclusion that they were the foundation of irish literature they present considerable variations in detail but are constant in certain particulars thus three races in the same orderthe firbolg the tuatha de danann and the gaedhelare always represented as the successive rulers of ireland each associated with particular topographical features and particular names of illustrious men that all this whatever its origin is to be regarded in its existing form rather as literature than as historical narrative is shown by the fact that it is difficult to trace in the accounts of these races any distinctive linguistic or social characteristics they have tribes and kings and administrators of laws and hereditary artificers resembling those of the irish of the early middle ages and not a single sentence of any speech but irish is j put into their mouths when the gaedhel j or as they are often called the race of miledh are established in the land there are further developments of historical tales a great series of which the centre is the famous tain bo cuailgne relate to the times of king ailill and queen medhb the exploits of cuchulainn and his friends and foes the heroes the character of the adventures and the general style of these tales are uniform another series deal with events in the days of a later king cormac mac airt and of heroines and heroes of his timegraine and finn oisin osgar and caeilte they too have their proper characteristic epithets and are associated also with topographical features in all their adventures these heroes never fall in with those of the time of ailill and medhb and their histories are related in a totally different style from those of cuchulainn and his contemporaries both series are joined on to the period of the introduction of christianity into ireland but in different ways for the survivors of the court of cormac mao airt are represented as talking on earth with st patrick in the agallamh na senorach while in the siabhar carpait cachulainn is called up from hades by st patrick to prove the power of the saint and thus help to overcome the doubts of the pagan king laeghaire the stories of the heroes of king cormac mac airts day are of a higher degree of literary ability and show more true poetry and less mere marvel than those which tell of the reign of ailill and medhb and they are more closely connected with later irish literature such is the scope of the tales of lady gregorys book they are all interesting and most readers will agree with what dr butcher is quoted as saying about a story of cuchulainn  it opened up a great world of beautiful legend which though accounting myself an irishman i had never known at all many of the tales are taken from the silva gadelica of mr standish hayes ogrady it is a pity that some of the other contributing translators and lady gregory herself have not followed his example of translating good irish into equally good eoglish it is a harmless affectation of dr douglas hyde to make believe not to know enough english to translate irish and to prove his irish patriotism by writing broken english prof kuno meyer appears to think that obsolete english words express the meaning of simple irish better than everyday modern words and thus his heroes fare instead of going and reach their steads instead of their homes and employ a wright to work for them instead of a carpenter an eastern proverb says the words of kings are kings of words but lad gregory prefers to use an intentionally illiterate method of expression at the court of the king of tara because in a cottage at kiltartan she heard a sad story of the death of kings so told but the cottager meant to tell the tale in the choicest language he had and he would like to hear a story in english such as goldsmiths rather than in this artificial language a graver fault is that to support an untenable historical hypothesis lady gregory has tampered with the text of some of the tales and left out such great names as those of cormac and of art but these are critical objections to a book which is not meant to be critical and which will do good service by encouraging the reading world to make the acquaintance of irish literature  gods and fighting men the story of the tuatha de ts   1mnaan and of the fianna of

her devotion to her design of utting into an intelligible english form the traditional iterature of the irish fireside we must warn her of the dangers of overrapid production as it affects both the quality of her own work and the heartiness of the welcome accorded to it certainly she has had much encouragement in such inspiring compliments as that which she records as coming from president roosevelt who after reading her last book  sent for all the other translations from the irish he could get to take with him on his journeys but even so it is better that we should wish for more than that we should get too much it is perhaps ungrateful to welcome thus churlishly a volume of legendary tales which are new to most of us in substance as well as in form and which have so much of the freshness which only extreme antiquity can give but the manner of lady gregorys work leaves something to be desired she tells us that she has  found it more natural to tell the stories in the manner of the thatched houses where she has heard so many legends than in that of the slated houses where she has not heard them but since most of the stories come not from the cottage fireside but from an irish text authenticated by manuscripts in great libraries this is hardly a sufficient justification for the preservation of irish idioms in an otherwise colloquial english version nothing is gained by writing 4it was what sreng said  for  sreng said or  it was nuada was king  for  nuada was king a more serious objection is involved in lady gregorys choice of a title and her substitution of a divine for a historical motif for many of the legends irish legend is vague enough without attempting to represent its historical personages as the divinities of a hypothetical mythology because she has found it impossible to date the legends historically lady gregory has in support of a purely speculative theory 44 left out such names as those of cormac and art and other more or less historical personages in doing so we take leave to think she has robbed the stories of much of their interest half of the charm of unreal things lies in the doubt whether they may not after all be real what should we say to the editor of the arthurian legends who should leave out arthur ,biography_contra

shrewd coarse nature and could at times be bitterly hard especially when there was a choice between withholding payment of a just debt and spending the money on some unrighteous pleasure at such a crisis he was proof against any pleadings and took spiteful delight in feeling his sovereigns between bis finger and thumb in his pocket while solemnly swearing to a distressed tradesman that he did not that day know where to turn for five shillings though he should be in ample funds next week   then he went to parishe talked french by the way with a very pure and bold english accent like some of his bettersand as he combined a coupte of tastes which do not harmonise advantageously for the pocket especially in france namely playing high and drinking hard he scarcely could be said to visit the continent for retrenchment at home his rooms in halfmoon street were open to all comers in the days of his prosperity and even when it became expedient to see who knocked as it soon did he still held hospitable orgy for any one who had no claim upon him but it was a queer set that the captain liked to have about hima bad set in facti do not mean on the mere score of its members being remarkably goodfornothinga qualification which would suit some very good sets we all knowbut in point of taste isle liked what is called the artistworld but then he was incapable of comprehending either art or its noble professors and patronised any rattling scampish raurienif foreign so much the betterwho dressed like a guy told profane or immoral anecdotes or both sketched a caricature blew a bugle or

were good enough not to mind at all and indeed rather to like and sometimes to make the evening glided very pleasantly into night and the night into morning and wilmslow was happy contributing his wine his loud laugh and sometimes his bad joke to the happiness of his respectable friends these were not play nights the artists of wilmslows set have not much to lose and if cards came out it was

written no less than four other novels we regret to say that up to the present time so great was our ignorance of contemporary literature that we were wholly unawrare of his existence after reading the lawyers daughter we are by no means sure that we have any great cause for rejoicing at the enlightenment it affords us what is to be said of an author who gravely and without apology introduces his readers to venice in the seventeenth century and to all the paraphernalia of cloaks and swtords masks and daggers which have been the undisputed property of the london journal since the days of monk lewis  there is a melancholy helpless heroism about the action which at once commands our respect and moves our pity how little appreciation of the time in which he lives must an author have to whom the historical novel seems still a fitting vehicle for amusement or instruction we could scarcely have been more surprised at being asked to read a new  grand cyrus or a fresh chronicle of amadis of gaul than at finding an author as yet unknown to fame and we venture to presume young offering to a public that feeds on mudie a story which uses again all the devices and machinations familiar in the days of anne radcliffe or g p r james quite oblivious of the oftenquoted advice of corinna to pindar about sowing with thc hand and not with the whole sack mr trolloxe calmly reproduces in one single work all the stage effects of an entire literary generation bloody tyrants shameful murders vows of vengeance missing documents entrapped maidens duels and combats of six incessant hairbreadth escapes bravoes outlaws monks all these and other familiar machinery are to be found in the lawyers daughter virtue triumphs over vice too in thc end in the famous old fashion but even this attraction will not wtc are afraid ensure to mr trollope a large number of admiring readers were mr trollope a much better writer than he is he could not force the british public to an interest in this sort of thing now elsewhere it is different oeeasionally if georg ebers likes to devote himself to the manufacture of old egyptian and carly christian novels he knows that in scholastic germany he addresses a larg circle of readers who will like him all the better for thc fact that there is no one else living who could combine the ability to tell a good story with such appalling erudition if on the other hand m xavier dc montepin or paul feval likes to drop back a few centuries and to clothe his  hollow puppets  in some more graceful garb than ours  if the eighteenth century delight m amadce achard or the sixteenth ponson du terrail these authors know their pappenheimers and they possess so strongly the art of storytelling that they must always be vivacious and readable  their characters wear well the garments of aa ancient epoch and if they do not differ much from the parisian of today they move about with thc theatrical easo and grace which he can wear so well either before the world or at the bal de it opera but we in england must frankly admit ourselves inferior to france in storytelling to germany in erudition  in other words we want nowadays both the qualities which best excuse the historical novel as well as the willingness to read it our writers of the present day will not take the trouble which is essential to such a work  they will not labour like scott or thackeray or bulwer lytton and they do not produce a  quentin durward an  esmond or even a  last days of pompeii they are not of course to bo blamed for doing the work that suits them best and we should be very sorry to think that england boasted a miss mulbach among her novelists the epoch of the historical novel is as far as we can see passed away in england and  the lawyers daughter is scarcely likely to succeed when  romola  failed yet there is not wanting a certain feeling of pleasure in an age of robertson and jules verne of teacup and saucer and the fairy tales of science in finding some one bold enough to take delight in the good oldfashioned elements of romance and naive enough to hope for a sympathetic and attentive audience one quotation will be enough to give an idea of the work presently

assertion should it bo my fate to die i wish you gentlemen to observe should theso be my last words that as i hope for salvation i do most solemnly belie vo the assertion i have made to be most true while the marches spoke there might bo seen a slight degree of nervous agitation in the features of the count de st felix he seemed to press hia lips hard and though hand that held his sword was slightly agitated however as the marchese ended he said in a sharp tone  let us waste no moro of that chaste ladys light pointing to though moon  for in ten minutes she will bo behind though campanile

though swords crossed this sort of thing ought only to make its appearance now in the weekly instalments of some obscure periodical were it as veil written as if it were by the elder dumas himself it would not go down but when it appears in a threevolume novel by an evidently inexperienced writer the anachronism is only too glaringly absurd wc should like to warn mr frank trollope that nobody now cares about old venice or the doge or the council of ten about moonlight squares and sombre streets about mysterious appointments desperate duels and the fierce hates and fiercer loves which charmed our grandfathers and grandmothers neither the melancholy lover nor the wicked baron would be tolerated now for a single instant thc lantern jaws of the one and the buff boots of the other will not meet even with the kindly respect due to their dignified antiquity but only with ribald laughter or unconcealed indifference no one now cares to walk in that imagination street where thackerays j j

B1050,['8902161'],  i the power of a lie by johan bojer i translated by jessie muir heinemann we have seldom read a novel in which the psychology of selfdeception is so strikingly presented as in this grim little study of human nature the story is simple knut norby a welltodo norwegian farmer becomes surety for henry wangen and on the latters failure is ashamed to admit the fact though the sum in question is inconsiderable at first he treats the affair with reticence then half involuntarily allows it to be supposed that his signature has been forged and so by gradual stages comes to the acceptance the assertion and finally the genuine conviction that this supposition is true the power of the lie over norby himself and its effects upon the various other characters brought within the sphere of its influence are shown with an incisive i force that must impress the most casual reader and the sternly impersonal method of narration employed as it is with admirable skill produces an almost painful sense of reality mr hall caine contributes a somewhat inept little introduction to the book criticising the  morality  of its teaching,biography_contra
B1237,"['8673696', '8502457', '4384134']",  in silk attire new novels by william black 3 vols tinsley brothers allowing for the improbability which lies at the root of this novel and which leads to some minor faults of the same kind we say at once that in silk attire is thoroughly pleasant and readable marked by much and varied cleverness mr blacks plot is not in itself a new one the unavoidable rivalry between two girls who are in love with and are almost equally loved by the same man has often been treated but in the present instance the contrast is not so strongly felt as usual both girls are worthy both are unselfish each seems to wish the other to win it must have given mr black great pain to have to cut the knot if we cannot fully sympathise with him that is owing to the way in which the opening improbability is brought back again at the closeand has an air of bringing down the curtain perhaps mr black would urge in excuse that with an actress for his heroine stage effect is allowable he would add further that his heroines mother was an actress and that what is bred in the bone will never come out in the flesh the episode of annie brunels birth and infancy which serves as a prologue to the story has of course been put in for the bearing it has on this side of her character and makes the transformationscene at the end less abrupt but even this does not reconcile us to it wholly and with all mr blacks skill we never quite get over the beginning and the end of his story all we can say in their favour is that the author never loses sight of them they have their effect on the whole conduct of the plot if we forget them now and then and if we enjoy the book most when we do forget them mr black has not set us the example he is consistent throughout and is alike true to what is natural and what is unnatural the faults of the story swell the success of the artist when we dismiss from our minds this aspect of the novel we find that in other respects there is a want of absolute freshness and originality pleasant as the characters are and clearly as they are drawn they are only variations on the old types count schbnstein for instance the man who has made a fortune in business and bought a german title without being able to speak the language is merely new in his surroundings we think mr black ought to do better ought to be able to strike out something new in itself instead of contenting himself with placing things in a new light so too mr anerley the father of the hero is intended to be a likeness of the modern materialist and he is great in the scandal he causes to the clergyman of the parish in the difficult theories he inflicts on womankind in the goodnatured sarcasm which is infused into all his words as naturally as smoke is breathed from between the lips that sustain a pipe mr anerley is capitally drawn and we delight in his paradoxes  only we know him already we made his acquaintance in days when materialism had not yet laid its icy clutch upon him when he still went to church or was kept at home by a slight return of his old complaint when he did not suggest that it was a sign of imperfect development in a scotchman not being born with a macintosh here again we think mr black might have done better we have no such objection to make to his two heroines of the two we prefer dove anerley partly because she is more complete in herself partly because mr black so cruelly sacrifices her the change which is wrought in the character of annie brunel when she conies off the stage and mixes with other people is in some sense significant of her part in the novel we know more of her as an actress than as a woman yet mr black professes to show her to us as a woman and only to tell us what she did as an actress we must take her great artistic powers and success more or less upon trust and if they seem to us exaggerated we have no means of testing mr blacks account of them but the woman is brought nearer to us and we are called upon to judge her from our natural point of view here we confess dove anerley shows to greater advantage though mr black will hardly see it he may not take it as a compliment to be told that his minor characters do him yet more credit but we are far from intending this to be a censure the distinction that may be drawn between his fulllengths and his miniatures is that in the one we miss either novelty or power in the other we are able to do justice to cleverness and observation when mr black sketches the surface of life the daily occurrences when he pictures the retired teabroker acting as country gentleman in kent and still more when the counts foot is on the soil with which he bought his title nothing can be pleasanter the days shooting in the black forest is a perfect scene what with count schonsteins bad german and his general awkwardness what with the fine figure of the tall keeper and will anerleys accident our interest is fully excited and we share the regrets of all the party at the necessity ofa return to england but there are scenes in england which are worthy of being named by the side of this one and english characters by no means inferior to the counts faithful but unintelligible germans all that concerns mr anerley himself is as good as all that concerns count schonstein with the same abatement as to the principal characters and with one grave exception the ruin of the anerleys and mr anerleys last interview with the count are a blot on the novel and the more so that they are alien to the usual bent of mr blacks ability at least no other part of the story can be called poor whatever else may be said against it  in silk attire a novel by william black in three volumes tinley brothers a strange wild story of our own times very subtly told a young marquis marries an actress of great talent and high popularity she does not care to face his noble friends and relations he srinks from introducing her to them so they go abroad avoid english society and settle at thun wheu their only child is four yea old the husband suddenly tyres of his bnient and longs for london life pleads business takes leave of his wife affectionately and hurries away sending his man of business after the lapse of a few weeks to offer her whatever income she may desire she covers her broken heart with a mantle of pride and refuses to accept more money than will suffice to carry her to new york where she resolves to resume her profession for the maintenance of herself and her daughter  those whom god had joined  become utter strangers to each other but after a few years the marquis lying on his deathbed repents of the wrong he has done his wife and makes the only reparation now in his power by bequeathing to her and their daughter the whole of his property his executors who hardly knew of her existence have much difficulty in discovering her abode for her theatrical reputation is not now worldwide as it had been in her early days the old fire had gone out when trouble fell upon her when the lawyer waits upon her to announce her good fortune he is astounded by her renunciation of the proffered wealth he begs her to reconsider her decision urging the advantage to her daughter of being placed in the position of an english lady she replies that her daughter has been brought up in total ignorance of her birth and thinks it best that she should remain so she feels acutely how muuch happier her own life would have been had she never passed beyond the bounds of her profession and desires that her daughter should know nothing of the outer world however she will give her the lawyers address and tell her to apply to him should she ever find herself in distress this introduction to the main story for it is the daughter who is the real heroine is improbable in fact and questionable in taste it seems to us a mistake to have opened the book with it calculated as it is to produce an unfavourable impression on the readers mind it would have been better first to have excited an interest in the wonderful annie brunel and then to have gratified the readers curiosity by accounting in some measure for the strongly developed features of her remarkable character in telling the strange story of her birth and the sad tale of her mothers sufferings and wrongs let the reader open the book at the fourth chapter and he will find the orphan girl in london at the zenith of her fame as an actress her juliet is a complete success and we will venture to say as to our authors conception of the character that it is certain be cannot have seen the part so played we must unfortunately go back l to theatrical traditions for such an impersonation of shakespeares betwitching creation l suddenly there was an extraordinary commotion throughout i the house and a burst of that fine strong thunderous music which artists love to hearand then dove saw advance a girlishlooking creature with a calm somewhat pale and interesting face i and beautiful black hair she was only girlish in the slightness i of her figure there was an artistic completeness in her motions and a selfpossession in her bearing which gave her something of a queenly look she wore a magnificent white satin dress the train of which lay in splendid masses behind her and down over this white and gold fell a black lace veil partly hiding the rich i hair and enclosing the clear beautiful dark face dove was spellbound by that face it somehow suggested italy to her and blue skies and music and the passiona artistic warmth of the south nor was the illusion destroyed by the low chestvoice with which the girl replied to the questions of mother and from that moment dove thought no more of mliss brunel and wills friend 1 she saw only juliet and followed her sad story with an aching heart anl trembling lip during the matchless balconyscene will saw this intense sympathetic emotion growing upon the girl i believe it is con e sidered to be the proper thing for young ladies to be able to turn l round and smile compassionately to each other when the traic sadness on the stage is making the women in the pit sob bitterly and raising great lumps in the throats of the mei it is a pretty accomplishment in its way and may be indicative of other l iualities which these young persons arc accused of possessing doves emotional tendencies had never been educated however  and in this balconyscene as i say size watched the lovers with a painful interest which wrote its varying story every moment on her face the theatre was still as death the scarcelyuttered l tendernessesof juliet were heard ts distinctly as if they had been i breathed into ones ear and the yes of the audience frank in  the trembling lights and shadows ot her girlish passion with an unconscious delight and admiration elie abandonment of her affection the reluctant declaratioirs the coy shrinkings and piteous playful tender apologies were so blcnded as to niakc the n scene an artistic marvel and dove sat laughin maist like to greet as the old scotch song says tnii cd she scarcely knew t whether to laugh or cry with the delightthe absolute delight which this piece of true art gave her and wheti at last juliet had forced herself to the partingtis almost morning i would have thee gonc r and yet no farther than a wart nis bird t who lets it hop a little from her hand like a poor prisoner in his twist gyves and with a silk thread plucks it back again so lovingjealous of his liberty  i when lingeringly and sadly she had withdrawn from the t balcony dove rose suddenly and with a halfchoked sob in her voice sad  oh will i should like so much to see herandxd  kies her she had nearly said but thinking it might be ridiculous she stopped  its against the rules dove said will with a smile  be sides that isnt miss brunel youve been looking at tat s b juliet both are very nice ladies bus they are quite unlike eah other a  a a  just as the curtain fell upon the scene in friar lawrences cell at the end of the second act mr melton conducted dove and will down a tortuous little stone stair into a narrow passage from which they entered into the wings a noisy and prolonged reca1 was thundering throughout the house and miss brunel was being led on to the stage by romeo to receive renewed plaudits when x she returned and passed under the glare of the jets in one of the 3 entrances will went forward to shake hands with her  i have to congratulate you again he said  thank you she said simply there had been a pleased smile of welcome in her eyes when r they met and yet it seemed to him that there was a strange intense expression in her look which was not natural to it once or twice before he had seen her in the same circumstances and invariably this unconscious mesmeric intensity was present in her i eyes he explained it to himself by supposing that the emotional idealism of her assumed character had not quite died out of her i yet then she turned and saw dove standing with mr melton will r begged to introduce his sister and the brief ceremony was sufficiently singular for a moment the dark lambent eyes of miss brunel were fixed upon the fair young girl with a sort of s hesitating lookan inquiring apprehensive look which will never forgot then all at once she frankly extended her band l dove a little frightened approached and shook hands with her  mr anerley has spoken to me about you said annie brunel i and dove was conscious that the darkhaired girl before her knew 3 her secret how singular it was to hear herself addressed in those low rich tones which a few minutes ago were addrcssing romeo in the r moonlight dove almost felt herself enchanted and could have ri believed at that moment that she herself belonged to the old sad e sweet play which seems to contain everything that was ever uttered about mans love and womans devotion e i must go down to my dressingroom now said miss brunel f to dove  will you come with me if you are curious to see r the place  i will send some one round with you to your box afterwards  will saw that dove would like to go so he settled the proposal by telling her not to be in miss brunels way and then he and 0 melton returned to the front of the house i while she is on the stage she ceases to be annie brunel  and becomes for the time the character she represents 3but this heavensent actress is mortal she loses her heart i and as the woman developes the actress dies out she begins to feel a loathing for her profession she has become lselfconscious she sees the people who are staring at her i she resolves to quit the stage and then there comes the ivery serious question how to live it is only as a last resource that she applies to the lawyers whose address her mother had confided to her the reader who has followed her thus far who has rejoiced with her in her professional triumphs who has pitied her misplaced love and felt for her in her distresses will be quite prepared to sympathise with her in her prosperity and admire the true nobility of her character equal even to the severe test of sudden unexpected and almost unimaginable wealth indeed the tale would have been more believable had the property been less enormous the rank of her father rather less exalted the ideal actress is admirably contrasted with the real actress a very pleasant kindhearted little lady a staunch friend in adversity though at times addicted to frivolity the lover is a welldrawn sketch of a thorough englishman very well meaning but rather weak in purpose who being engaged to a very tender sweet girl allows himself to fall desperately in love with the brilliant actress and has not the tact to keep his secret his efforts to bind up the broken heart are very commendable but the great truth that it is a mischief past repair is very forcibly and pathetically told the picture of his family circle is a truthful home scene of english country life and life in london amongst theatrical people is admirably sketched there ale pleasant views upon the rhine with its quaint old cities and majestic breadth of waters ruined towers and vineclad hills and some highly picturesque and characteristic scenes in the black forest where the vulgar millionaire of the tale who persecutes poor annie with his addresses has bought an estate which gives him the title of count his attentions to miss brunel are very far from being so disinterested as he strives to make them appear when he urges his suit with the promise that s she shall walk in silk attire for he happens to know who she really is and has a clear intention of claiming her property if he can only cajole her into becoming his wife the pretensions and the soliloquies of this purseproud retired teabroker are very absurd yet we cannot call the character overdrawn the many touches of his apparent generosity in which a reference to the promotion of one or other of his pet schemes may always be detected are very skilfully thrown in and his notion that all the world is bound to do his bidding and help forward his plans is a clever exemplification of the views of many a prosperous mana persuasicf which has probably aided him in achieving his prosperity we wish the book the success it deserves it possesses much originality it is agreeably written the characters are thoroughly lifelike and carefully thought outcertainly the heroine is almost too good to be true we have spoken of her as an ideal for though such an artiste may not now exist it is an accepted fact that such have been and there certainly is no reason why so perfect an actress should not be as perfect a lady as noble as generous as sensitive as truehearted as lovable as teachable as pure we much prefer the creation of so glorious a being to the representation of a mere ordinary mortal those who are not of our way of thinking may find in dove anerley a young lady more suited to their taste  in silk attirm the three first chapters of this story which form a sort of prologue introduce us to annie napier a distinguished actress who while in the height of her fame is wooed and won and married by harry ormond marquis of knottingley who carries his wife to switzerland dreading to introduce her to his family lest they should decline to recognise her or otherwise make her life miserable after living with his wife several years on the shore of a swiss lake during which time a child is born to them harry ormond takes a longing to revisit england which he does leaving behind him both wife and child whom he never again sees arriving in england he thinks it better or is induced by the influence of relatives to think it better not to return to his wife any more but to live apart from her the grounds of his conduct being the alleged impossibility of introducing to a family so exclusive as his own one who had been an actress though she is now his wife and therefore the lawful marchioness of knottingley declining a separate maintenance which he offers her the marchioness retires to new york where under the name of brunel she once more goes upon the stage to which she also trains her daughter annie brunel whose histrionic genius excels that of her mother at the death of the marquis ten years after his will discloses the fact that he had made what reparation was then possible by  acknowledging the claims of his wife as sole heiress to his whole property of this however she refuses to avail herself choosing rather to live by her profession and she arranges with the english lawyers that even her daughter who knows nothing of her real rank shall only apply to them in a certain eventuality when she may learn her position and claims thus far the prologue the story then follows the fortunes of annie brunel the young american actress who has captivated the heart of london by the brilliancy of her genius we get the first glimpse of her at a little supper after the playthe party consisting of mr melton the manager miss brunel with several other members of the company a number of critics aparvenu count the graf von slchonstein will anerley a friend of the count and others who figure in the tale this is among the first glimpses we get of annie brunelslight in figure and somewhat pale and dark there was nevertheless a certain calm dignity about her features and a stateliness in her gestures which gave an almost massive grandeur to her appearanoe then her magnificent black hair lay around her clear calm fiae which was rendered the more iutensly spiritual by large eyes of a deep tender grey they were eyes under those long eyelashes capable of a great sadness and yet they were not sad there seemed to play around the beautiful intellectual face a bright superficial unoonsciou activity and she herself appeared to take a quite infantine interest in the cheerful trivialities around her for the rest she was dressed in a gleaming white vtoird with tight sleeves that came down to her tiny wrists and there ended in a faint line of blue and through the great braided masses of her black hair there was wound a thick cord of twisted silver which also had a thread of blue cunningly interwoven with it the artistic possibilities of her fine face and complexion were made the most of for she wams an arist one of the few true artist who have been seen upon our modern stage  for once unanimity prevailed among all the critics who were worth attention and they said that the new actress was a woman of genius who could doubt it that had witnessed the utter meltabandonment of her impersonations p on the stage she was no longer mistress of herself her eyes deepened until they were almost black her face was stirred with the white light of peasion and her words were instinct with the tenderness which thrills a theatre to its ore when the sudden intensity died down when she resumed her ordinary speech and dres she seemed to have come out of a trance not a trace remained of that ore and those intonations which were the result of uncomsious cration her eyes resumed their serene happy indifference her face its pleased childlike expression swif bive dexterous she was full of all sorts of genial marry activities that kindling of the eye and tremour of the voios belonged to the dreamlife she led elsewhere this is annie brunel the actress and unknown to herself marchionese of knottingley holding in herself many poesibilitits of romance some of which soon force themselves into fact for it is hardly possible that the secret of such a grand prize could remain closed for ever the story of her parentage is known to count von schonstein who has it from his brother a member of the firm which is the depository of the knottingleybrunel romance and that is the reason why the count is present at the supper after the play having met mis brunel before in ia sin atty a novel b wilim bla author of i love or mariage thm vols losdom  tiniey i america he renews his acquaintance with her in england and with the knowledge of her parentage resolves to marry her if he can expecting by that means to get into aristocratic circles which he finds to be impossible with hit purchased patent of nobility one can feel of course that the count cannot be the man and as the result proves in spite of the bold though not altogether honourable push he makes he fails but the count does not fail wholly through personal unfitness but because a better man is bound to succeed and that man as the prophetic instinct perceives can be nobody but will anerley yet one is puzzled at this for several apparent impossibilities bar the way of such a consummation in the first place there seems no necessity for it then although as annie brunel and will become acquainted they grow to like each other liking is not exactly loving besides she has been taught by her mother neither to marry nor expect to find happiness outside her profession while he is practically engaged to marry a young lady a distant relation of his own dove anerley who has been brought up in his own family down at st marykirby in pleasant kent in spite however of these apparently insurmountable reasons to the contrary though one thing that grows and looms clearer and larger through the obscurity is the fact that somehow the destinies of will anerley and annie brunel are steadily converging towards each other and will finally become one in the mean time there remains the difficulty of dove anerley whose portrait is thus suggested it was one of those rare faoes which tantalise you in the eryact of admiring them there was nothing in it of that mature vigorous definite beauty of form and complexion whioh a man may calmly observe and criticise in the faoe of a woman but a tender uncertainty a halfsuggested and shrinking loveliness whioh made one vaguely conscious that this frail and beautiful smile of nature might suddenly vanish from the fine features it was not that the girl samed unwell or in any degree fragile but simply that one in looking at her face could not help regretting that her loveliness was not les delicate and more pronounced that there was not more life and less sensitiveness in her large violet eyes this is the lady who has been the companion of will anerleys youth whom he loves and to whom he has been spiritually if not formally affianced long before he encounters annie brunel but that encounter is the beginning of a subtle change in physical and mental structure will who is the son of a country gentleman is a thorough englishman and is above treachery and deception he does not deceive and desert dove anerleybe does not even cease to love her but his love for her is slowly and unconsciously overshadowed by a passion more intense and profound inspired by the young actress who is capable of reaching depths in the human heart unknown to the gentleminded dove it all seems natural and inevitableand as inevitable too that annie brunel should fall in love with will anerley the two are thrown much together during a trip to count schdnsteins residence in the black forest in germany and on wills return to england dove notices the change in manner and her prophetic heart attributes it to the right cause yet as if foreboding what the end is to be she hardly resents the change in her lover a change also comes over annie brunel remembering the teaching of her mother she conceals her passion for will feeling that she ought not to think of loving any one outside the circle of her profession and even when their mutual affection is confesed they agree and endeavour to suppress it for the sake of dove anerley whom wim is bound in honour to marry the impossible game of suppression goes on for some time when a deep feeling of repugnance to her profession comes over the actress the power of genius seems to die within her in the light of her strong passion the idea of a higher life dawns upon her she sees and feels that the stage is no longer the place for her and leaves it almost penniless if not friendless at this time too the anerleys me ruined by the collapsing of the bank in which their fortune is lodgedan event which will and his philosophic father take almost with a jest worse than this to them is the fact that dove having somehow been smitten with cold is now dying of consumption suddenly in the midst of their wellborne distress fortune shines upon them from an unknown place this is the cause of itmiss brunel having at length been reduced to her last shilling and remembeing the injunction of her mother that in some such event she is to apply to a cdtain lawyer does so and there and then discovers that she is the daughter and ole heiressofthemarquisotknottingley although for a time quite stunned by the revelation annie brumnel soon masters the situation and she is the source of the sunshine which is secretly poured upon the anerleys but dove is dyingend from death there is no escape and she knows it but she sewe eager to get mrried to will before she d joa to have the honour and feel the rapture of being his wife for this purpose she gets will to buy a wedding ring and to write a sort of betrothal contract in these words we two loving each other very dearly write our names underneath in token that we have become husband and wife and as a pledge of our constant love this however remains qnsigned and meanwhile dove getting gradually worse desires to see annie brunel whom will finds in her poor lodging attired in a simple black dress for her great secret is still

B5364,['6709241'],  literature the roots of the mountains by william morris reeves  turner although the characters in mr morriss new romance are set among very archaic surroundings they appear to be essentially of a mediaeval type the men of burgdale are a people of german blood though many of their customs appear to differ from those described in the germania inhabiting a town or thorp in a valley  amidst the mountains and hills and falling streams of a fair land situate apparently somewhere in the southern tyrol the village or little markettown was set in a fortified pass shut in by cliffs and protected by a wall and towers on a knoll near the brow of the cliff the men of old times had built a strong and great watchtower and therefrom the thorp had its name and the whole valley also and it was called burgstead in burgdale there was a space of about fifty acres betwixt the wall and the wandering stream  and therein we are told lay burgstead in a space of  the shape of a swordpummel the houses were all of stone  with much fair and curious carved work of knots and beasts and men round about the doors or whiles a wall of suchlike work all along the housefront the dalesmen were as expert at stonework as their upland neighbours the woodlanders were at carving runes and patterns on their oaken beams the shepherdfolk higher up on the downs lived a ruder life in scattered homesteads and were not very curious in their houses and halls the three folks were united in the bonds of kindred and friendship and formed in fact one rustic state governed by one alderman and meeting in the same folkmote the men of burgdale were great producers of corn and a good red wine which was bought by the foreign merchants they were very successful in goldwashing but the silvermines in the neighbourhoodin silverdale across the mountainshad been seized by a dusky tribe of mongol or hunnish affinities with whose defeat by the dalesmen and their allies the story is principally concerned the men of the dale also sold weapons of such fashions as were used in the westland  and golden cups and chains and fair rings set with mountainblue stones and copper bowls and vessels gilt and parcelgilt and mountainblue for staining the woodlanders brought down woodcarvings and peltries and the shepherds  such fleeces as they could spare from the daily chaffer with the neighbours the marketplace was wherever anyone cared to pitch a booth but we are told that for the most part this was done in the wide street between the gate and the bridge the gradual growth of a commercial town from the trademeetings of countryfolk and foreign chapmen the  nundinae barbarorum of classical description is indicated with great force and precision there is a particularly interesting account of the visit of the men of shadowy yale a murky region into which the wolftribe had been driven by the hunnish savages to the great springmarket at burgstead  gay was the show for the booths were tilted over with painted cloths and the merchants themselves were clad in long gowns of fine cloth scarlet and blue and white and green and blaok with broidered welts of gold and silver and their knaves were gaily attired in short coats of diverse hues with silver rings about their arms and short swords girt to their sides people began to gather about these chapmen at once when they fell to opening their dales and their packs and unloading their wains there had they iron both in pigs and forged scrap and nails steel they had and silver both in ingots and vessel pearls from over sea cinnabar and other colours for staining suoh as were not in the mountains madder from the marshes and purple of the sea and scarlet grain from the holmoaks by its edge and woad from the deep clayey fields of the plain silken thread also from the outer ocean and rare webs of silk and jars of olive oil and fine pottery and scented woods and sugar of the cane the headman of the merchants brings news of a great invasion of dusky men who had overthrown the armies of the cities in the plain and how they had piled up skulls into great hills beside the city gates  and how because of the death and the rapine grass had grown in the kings chambers and the wolves had chased deer in the temples of the gods the prince of the tribe from the murky vale arrives in glorious array with his sister the sunbeam whose courtship by goldmane of burgdale otherwise called faceofgod gives a romantic colour to the story and relieves the readers mind from the gloom of the guerilla war and murders grim and great and the tumult of the long battle in which the felon tribes in rosedale meet their wellearned doom folkright the prince of the wolfrace is a kind of robin hood who only robs a skinflint or occasionally holds a merchant to ransom and it is to be observed that he pays for the purchase of a dagger and a  web of gold and silk as well as a fine for robbery set upon him in the folkmote with the treasure of silver rings wbich his soldiers had taken from their dusky enemies the character of the princess is finely drawn she seems likely at first to be the bringer of strife and misfortune like another helen on the peaceful children of the vale but the threatened evils are fortunately turned full upon the horde of invaders the valiant and beautiful bride who loses her  goldmaned  chieftain is consoled with a new love for folkright and a happy life in the purified halls of silverstead there are plenty of songs interspersed with the story and some of the best are sung by the bride others are sung by an amazonian  bowmay  to the music of woodwonts goodly fiddle and goldmane is called upon for the song of the ford telling how the warriors returned to their cloverfields and meads of mowing grass after a wild battle upon the hills  in haytide through the day newborn across the meads we come our hauberks brush the blossomed corn a furlong short of home another fine poem occurs in the description of a journey to the fotest for mickb that would quarter best for bowstaves the brethren of the house of the face go forth at the aldermans bidding and find the bride waiting for them we have only room for a portion of the description which is noticeable for its extreme simplicity and directness  so came they to the yewwood and the brethren fell to work and the bride with them for she was deft with the axe and strong withal but at midday they rested on the green slope without the yewwood and they ate bread and flesh and onions and apples and drank red wine of the dale and while they were resting the bride sang to them an ancient song of the coming of the murdercarles no man can tell how many they be and the voice of their host as the thunder rolls the men of a little peaceful settlement hear the true story of the coming danger but determine to defend their home against all the world  it was summertide and the month of hay and men and maids must fare afield but we saw the place where the bowstaves lay and the hall was hung with spear and shield  when the moon was high we drank in the hall and they drank to the guests and were kind and blithe and they said come back when the chestnuts fall and the winecarts wend across the hythe  come oft and oer again they said wander your ways but we abide for all the world in the little stead for wise are we though the world be wide  yea come in arms if ye will they said and despite your host shall we abide for life or death in the little stead for wise are we though the world be wide  so she made an end and looked at the fairness of the dale spreading wide before her and a robin came nigh from outof a tbornbush and sung his song also the sweet herald of coming winter and the lapwings wheeled about black and white above the meadow by the river sending forth their wheedling pipe as they i hung above the soft turf there is no space to quote the account of the gathering of the host in burgdale the bowmens battle on the edge of silverdale and the onslaught of the men of the steer the bridge and the bull and all the other banners of the united kindreds the reader will find plenty of homeric fighting with the victory inclining always to the right side the felons are massacred and peace returns to the desolated valleys the kindreds became one folk  for better or worse in peace and in war in waning and waxing meeting together in shadowy vale as a holy place when converse and council were needed and so in the words with which the book concludes  no more as now telleth the tale of

this has been accomplished in priests of progress and with conspicuous success apart from the subjectmatter the story is thoroughly interesting the characterdrawinig is exceedingly well lone and altogether it is a good book on the question of vivisection mr colmore gives us in an apendix chapter and verse for all his charges against that school of surgeons to whom inoculation anl experiment are of chiefest importance frankly opposed to the methods of the vivisectionists and scientific experimentalists  mr colmore has taken every pains to avoid exaggeration or anl misrepresentation of his antagonists he gives us the case for vivisect on and scientific research with the inevi able cruelties these things involve as it is fairly stated by its advocates and he goes to the root of the matter but  priests of progress  is a book to be read and wse do nct want to choke off the lover of good fiction by emphasising too strongly its controversial character humanitarian and provivisectionist and the general reader alike will fins good stuti worthy of the fullest considerationand good entertainment tooin mr colmores remarkabley powerful and thoughtful book  priests of progress cupid and aesculapius by g colmore stanley paul and uo 03j the propagandist who delivers his opinions in the form of a novel the title of which gives no indication of the peculiar nature of its contents crosses the swift river of failure by a narrow plankbridgeif he crosses it at all and needs uncommon wariness to compass the double result of holding the attention of the specialist and at the same time compelling the interest of the ordinary reader to achieve bothto weave a clever lovestory into an investigation of the pros and cons of vivisection as the author of this book has doneis somewhat of a triumph in most works of this description we find that the  characters  are very characterlessmerely puppets in fact into whose lips are put interminable monologues and lengthy diatribes with the natural consequence of ineffable boredom to all those who do not happen to be students of the particular theme under consideration  priests of progress  offers us a pleasant contrast whether the reader be a vivisectionist an antivivisectionist or treads neutral ground he cannot fail to be warmly interested from the very beginning the discussion of medical affairs is hardly congruous with the objects of the academy so we may say impartially that mr colmore shows himself strong on the  anti side without offending by violence of language or imprudence of detail he is graphic certainly  a little too poignant once or twice for our taste  but he does not know how to be dull and dullness is a bite noire not easily avoided in a book of this type the story is that of the love of the hero gale a medical student holding the orthodox creed for the daughter of a noted physician miss  david lowther she is wooed by a man who has already reached fame and won from young gale under a specious promise of wealth whereby she shall be enabled to pursue her artistic proclivities her disillusionment comes years after when unknown to him she is a witness of her husbands operation on a deg there is a scene and she secedes to the other camp of the death of her husband and gales final success in his lasting love for her the latter part of the book tells in a way that leaves little to be desired the dialogues of the students are very fresh and humorous and there are several neat passages which hit off the poorer class of london landlady and her rooms better than pages of detail could do he rang the bell and asked to see mrs crouch mrs crouch came expectant and slightly anxious she hoped it wasnt fleas  but if ever a bed had been disinfected careful that bed on the first floorbut gales first words reassured her  mrs crouch said he with an attempt at indifference  im going to give a teaparty mrs crouch was instantly affable certainly sir how many guests

gale  thats splendid  no ladies couldnt drink their tea more refined in their own houses said mrs crouch nor stir it than what theyll do here the quality of good writing as distinct from fine writing is well shown in a paragraph which comes at the climax of the struggle of davidnow mrs cranleychancewith her former convictions  a struggle and a conclusion which involved the certainty that her house would be divided against itself she has a little invalid child vi in vis room she found no consolation for vi was in pain restless and unhappy she was able at last to give some ease to the poor little

attribute calm it still was but there was movement too and besides the street sounds a low soft pattering a thin rain dropped  a faint wind wandered  the night was full of sighs while we consider that the province of the novel is more to present life or aspects of it impartially than to take sides on any particular question or controversy we can congratulate the author of this book on the skilful

fertility of invention and vivacity of style are indisputable  than this quite alone is unpleasant from the predominance of odious people to whom it introduces us blunt the heroine lilys father is one of those disgraceful men of pleasure who delight in flinging themselves down headlong ruining every one that touches or trusts themand whose death as it were on a dunghill excites more disgust than pity the diabolical french amazon who is blunts lawful wife their marriage not being the most explicable transaction in the career of one so licentious may be true to reality so far as her sensuality

baronet old enough to be her father another man of profligacy and pleasure redeemed in part by his loving recollections of the child who had once sat on his knee during a greenwich orgy belongs we fear to the genus black swan re pulsive however as are many of the people jost enumerated mr sala nevertheless contrives to make us know them all and when he has finished his story in his own way he

round and which bears his name as the author was not entirely written by him when he left england last november twelvemonth as the special correspondent of the daily telegraph quite alone  was about half inished and he counted on being able to complete it in due timethat is to say within four or five months from the date of his departure comtmay to their ordinary rule the conductors of au the

with a hard lead pencil upon slips of carbonised paper placed upon tissue i was obliged to manifold my manuscript to guard against the uncertainties of the post they were written at intervals of many days and of thousands of miles they were written in a hammock in cuba on board steamers in railway cars in hotel verandahs in the midst of noise confusion smoke cursing and swearing battle murder and

to send home every week from six to eight columns of matter to a london newspaper to those who may accuse me of idleness or carelessness i can only plead that i was the correspondent for twelve months in the united states and mexico of the daily telegraph it is hard to quarrel with a man who tells you that he has broken down under the thirteenth labour of hercules we think however that mr sala would have done better had he finished his work in accordance with his own design before allowing it to be given to the public in its present form even though there had been some delay and his publishers capital had been left to lie dead for a few weeks or even months longer not that we imagine he would have succeeded in making a perfect novel of quite alone  but his readers would at least have had the authors own conception worked out with more or less completeness as a book of sketches quite alone is interesting enough to charm all mr salas habitual readers as a novel it can we conceive give satisfaction to very few of his admirers his method of treatment is obviously impracticable he appears to have a positive dislike to write about his story and hence writes about anything and everything in preference that most of what he thus writes is admirable we need hardly say but here the subjectmatter is out of place and fatally overlays what should be the legitimate interest of his work so far as he has unfolded it the story of quite alone  appears to be of the slightest texture and whatever may have been the plan he had  mapped out  for himself he has certainly not followed it many steps beyond the outset from first to last the heroinewhose mysterious isolation suggests the title of the novelis the character of whom the reader is permitted to see and know least though it is expressly in explanation of the causes of her appearing settle au monde that the author proposes to write his three volumes we reject the denouement invented by the gentleman who was called in to wind up the story in all the year round mr sala invites us to do so in fact promising that if a second edition of the book should be called for he will himself finish it according to his original intention as the story at present stands the readers curiosity is raised in the first chapter by the introduction of the heroine a young woman who has strongly attracted the attention of the west end

B5072,['8751522'],  the algonquin legends of new england b charles g leland sampson low  co when mr leland offers from the mic mac a tale partly in blank verse as far as form goes and in plot a mixture of the french tale of the bears son and the conclusion of the scotch 4 nicht nocht nothing one feels at first as if things were not all as they should be in mic mac this story is styled  the three strong men  pp 311 323 in the narrative comes a sevenheadti devil one of the beings so familiar in slavonic miirchen then the critic turns back to p 207 where mr leland tells him that  this srheaded son  of hymer in the vafthrudnismal reappears as a demon in the passamaquoddy tale of  the three strong men whatever may be the case in passamaquoddy certainly in mic mac the demon is sevenheaded then rises the question why should the seven  headed or sixheaded in passamaquoddy demon be the sixheaded son of hymer of the  vafthrudnismal why indeed  we cannot answer the question though we feel certain that the mic mac story is a compound of two stories which are european though also found more or less in malagasy mr leland himself admits part of this the story consists of a very old indian legend mingled with a european fairy tale drawn through a french canadian source but what part of the tale is very old indian  the original mr leland says  is from beginning to end a song or poem that is why we presume he has rendered so much of it into blank verse printed as prose in the tale the hero loses his memory and forgets his bride when his hand is licked by a black dog this is the celtic idea of the man who was to let no one kiss him and who lost all memory of the past when  kissed  by a dog we fail to see what is indian in the whole tale except perhaps mention of wigwams and the like now if this tale be so notably european though already converted into a kind of chant by the mic macs and if the norse identifications p 207 be so far from convincing to a moderate scepticism the rest of mr lelands collection is also not likely to be accepted without shyness he is perhaps chiefly interested himself in the resemblances between the tricky lox of passamaquoddy and the tricky loki of scandinavian myth the resemblances are often strong but would be stronger if for example mr leland offered p 271 any proof that  the fellow who played the trick a trick very like one of lokiswas lox he says  we may very easily detect the hand of lox the mischiefmaker in this last incident but lox has never been mentioned or hinted at in the tale mr leland may he right but every one must decide for himself as to the plausibility of the conjecture mr leland thinks that a good deal of eddaic lore has filtered through the eskimo to the algonquins and certainly many curious coincidences in eddaic and indian folklore may be accounted for by that hypothesis though we are not yet convinced of its accuracy perhaps for complete proof other examples of indian institutions dress weapons gear of every kind derived from norsemen might be adduced they would certainly strengthen the hypothesis one story which represents  master rabbit as originally the possessor of a long tail will at once suggest  brer babbit did the negroes borrow this incident from the indians or the indians from the negroes or did both invent it separately or did both derive it from a common source  these are questions which it is all but impossible to answer many of the negro rabbit tales have been brought from africa where they were told about a beast not very unlike a rabbit superficially perhaps others have been borrowed from indian sources on all these points it is hard or rather it ought to be impossibleto dogmatize at present we confess that after reading all mr lelands talesvery good tales very well told  we are slightly inclined not to believe in scandinavian influence on the algonquin legends the evidence and inferences are evenly balanced and perhaps it is only the hardness of the mythological heart that resists in any case mr lelands book though we wish he had avoided blank verse is extremely interesting and valuable both in itself and in its probable effects other american collectors of the red mens legends will be encouraged we hope to publish them as literally as possible this is the great point already we knew from schoolcraft and others that the red mens tales resemble and in fact are variants of the european marchen how much of this likeness is due to scandinavian and more recent french and english influences that is precisely the question which at present it is impossible to answer but which many readers of mr lelands book will reply to by voting for an infiltration of the edda only he himself can state his case at sufficient length and with his own evidence so to algonquin legends we send the mythologist no abstract can or should satisfy him,biography_contra

is like the maiden speech of a new member to which the house is bound to listen with an indulgent ear it is not on the watch to mark what is done amiss  and whatever germs of merit mayr appear will be welcomed as an earnest of better things to come but when though new member rises a second and a third time he must expect to be judged with a stricter impartiality the prestige of novelty is over he has taken his place in the ranks and then if he fails time after time to catch the speakers eye or if having obtained a hearing he has to encounter signs of impatience instead of courteous attention or worse than all to waste his words on empty benches it is but the fair lort uno of war if the squires legacy bad been a first attempt we should have said that it contained much promise for the

previous convictions ave are not now dealing with an untried author but with one who has had the training and experience of two or three j earlier stories and wbo cannot therefore present a previously blank sheet to disarm criticism i now there is this peculiarity in the work before us that then is too much plot in it tins is at all events an original fault for most novelists cry out in despair over  thc difficulty of finding any sort of prop on which to hang their fancies and their characters miss mary cecil  hay however has a speciality for plots so that they j crop up on all sides and get entangled one within another therefore whether we admit that the story j is well conceived or not it certainly does possess that j unusual feature o a substratum which so many novels j are without there is so much mystery so many characters and so much complication that it would j have been really kind to have given us a bradshaws guide to the principal stations in the book but thero is not even any heading to the chapters for onr direction we are allowed at the beginning a brief glimpse of the old squire upon wrhose legacy the main foundation of the story rests  but the real hero is his son and heir scot monk ton who is introduced to us as young and handsome and  with hair almost the colour of though old bronze velvet cushions  upon which he is wont to recline as he rehearses his favourite airs on a silver cornet there are marble steps to the door of his house picture galleries containing priceless works of art vast suites of lofty rooms luxurious meals a retinue of many servants and the usual splendour with which a lively imagination can so readily surround us the highbred calm and repose which all this wealth is supposed to engender is one day unpleasantly disturbed by the arrival of one monsieur philippe sourdet a frenchman who asks leave to be allowed to visit the picture gallery bringing a note of introduction from a cousin of the squires scots keen eye detects at a glance that this man is not a gentleman but his  innate courtesy  leads him to show sourdet all his family portraits himself and also to invite him to join the  midday meal  in the diningroom at kingswood which we are told was  a scene of luxury and pomp which caused the frenchman a feeling oddly compounded of both envy and selfgratulation  and minute after minute his manner grew more painfully obsequious while the welltrained servants wondered curiously why this strange man had not been left to lunch alone why indeed  monsieur sourdet professes to hold a family secret which he wishes to sell before revealing it for 10000z and as scot refuses with manly scorn to have any dealings with him he becomes the bete noire of the family in conjunction with a detected poacher who owes the squire a grudge the heros obstinacy is overstrained but the more commonplace characters are pleasantly drawn miss hayr succeeds much better with her wellconducted people than with her villains aunt michal for instance is often rather amusing kenneth the fevered poet and playwriter though an improbable character is interesting sometimes and well conceived whilst the little heroine 1 doris egerton is really very pleasant and natural with her flowers and her two attachments though we must protest against two sets of lovescenes with the same interchange of affectionate epithets from the same heroine to her two successive lovers there is material enough for two or three ordinary novels in these three volumes the first plot gives us the mystery of the frenchman and the family secret the second the story of the real heir to the estate and of his little boy willy who is on the whole very prettily described though quite an impossible child in real wic then there are some country neighbours a mr and miss chamberlain who have also a mystery which does not appear to us to have the slightest bearing upon thc rest of the story but to be thrown in by the wa as an evidence of superfluous force this is surely wanton waste for the author could easily have woven another threevolume novel out of this mere episode there is also a family of leveys who do not seem to have any business at all and are only in the way but whose income house dress habits and conversation are given us from time to time with unflinching perseverance throughout the book in spite however of many drawbacks there are stirring incidents well described a railway accident a storm a fire and very many more miss hay possesses remarkable fertility of invention and crowded and entangled as it is 4 the squires legacy is better worth reading than threefourths of the novels which we arc expected to order the tone of thc book is highminded throughout and however improbable some of the characters may be there is no  trail of the serpent over them all but an artless and genuine belief in the triumph of goodness sooner or later which is refreshing in an age of scepticism,biography_contra

half or wholly dead after the girls have changed their tumbled and dusty clothes the dance of death and resurrection begins lt is executed as follows a tree is planted at one side of a danciiigtloor in the open air and upon it is fixed a burning candle in a lantern the size of which is determined by the will of the groomsman or by the state of the weather in the centre of the dancingfloor stands a table with a few chairs upon it for the musicians all the young men and girls who have taken part in the festivity assemble round the tree where the newly married pair also stand the music strikes up at a signal from the groomsman who dances with the bride they are followed by the bridegroom with the bridesmaid and then by all the other couples in succession the walt tune proper to this occasion is plaintive languishing and quaint at every third turn the dancers change partners that is the man stops leaves his partner and otters his arm to the next following girl while his partner passes on to the young man immediately preceding her only the bridegroom must on no account dance with his bride when her turn comes he makes her a bow and passes on to the nest nor may any one dance faster or slower than tue rest because usually various objects such as watches kerchiefs and the like are the prizes of the couples first in due succession this dance continues under the control of a strongfisted master of the ceremonies until the taper is burnt out the purpose of this dance is that the married couple should now for the last time dance with others the moment the taper goes out the leader cries  dead  the music ceases and the partners bow and curtsy to each other a gallopade strikes up and the bridegroom kisses his partner three times as often as they pass the tree the bride is treated in like manner by her partner after a certain time the tune suddenly changes the biidegrooin embraces bis partner and the bride is embraced by hers and both couples bid each other an eternal farewell and this is to be the last kiss that man or wife are ever to receive from strange lips the kissed pair that is to say the lucky youth who was dancing with the bride and the girl who was waltzing with the bridegroom when the taper went out are attended to their homes by the company and the music  and it frciucntly happens that they really become a pair by marriage in due time this is the dance of death to which i shall have occasion to revert at the close of my tale we must content ourselves with the merrymaking just described the subjectmatter of these stories is less to our

attempt upon greenwich observatory one seems to remember with a casabiancad corpse and if you look at the fine portrait in the book you will see that brain at work behind the triangular eyes thinking it all out so logically and so clearly that its realism is exactly lifesize in its dispassionate exactitude or if not dispassionate with only the cold passion of intellectual contempt extraordinarily interesting yes but in a play you need somebody to love or to hate or at least to wonder at and as a written document the secret agent has none of these things the defective boy whom the sister loves and for whom she half sacrifices herselfthis central motiving figure needs conrads descriptive interpretationah how splendidly he could do itor a player of superhuman power to make one care tuppence about his fate a cruder mind could not have resisted the temptation to make the heroine a veritable lily of holywell street instead of an acquiescent and rather calculating young woman conrad must go to the grand guignol and old drury and learn the road to dramatic successfancy doing the assassination offhes as bad as sophocles but quite seriously england is not up to this standard yet and the worst of it is that nothing short of a comedy franfaise cast could begin to do justice to a cumulation effect of tenseness dependent upon perfect character impersonation and the subtlest of reflections and gestures whilst in leaving these to the player the author has omitted the living essence of conrad it is to be hoped that the publisher will do youth or lord jin in this ere perenmnus manner or indeed an entire edition of the works for  the play this time is not  the thing  new novels the secret agent by joseph conrad methuen  co that mr conrad should describe his latest book in a subtitle as  a simple tale  is of itself evidence of the remarkable character of his mind there is reason to believe that he applies this description to  the secret agent in all good faith yet as a fact the book is far more than a simple one even for the expert while for the average reader of novels there is nothing simple about it no good judge is likely to accuse mr conrad of intentional obscurity in any of his fine work but his temperament and mind are remarkable and rare the fact has enriched english fiction during the past decade to the extent of a dozen stories of singular merit it also has carried a penalty for mr conrad the subtlety of his mental processes the keenness of his artistic senses have placed him further away from the great reading publicif infinitely nearer to the select few who have trained faculties of literary appreciationthan many a writer of far less worth for the most part the reviewer finds it impossible to regret this for the reason that the very mental attributes which may hedge mr conrad about with barriers where the crowd is concerned are the qualities which make his work a permanent delight to the few and a real addition to literature but admitting all this as we do we yet find some legitimate ground for regret in the case of this book and of say  nostromo the writer of a  simple tale  ought to show some regard for the simple reader if not in the essentials of his story certainly in the details of its construction mr conrads lordly disregard of such an element as time for instance is a little unkind to the simple reader two leading figures in the book are carrying on a highly interesting conversation a dialogue vital to the story in the midst we are stopped abruptly and treated to twenty pages of retrospective digression before the conversation is resumed again a catastrophe occurs  the lurid horror of the event is pictured for us by a master hand the skill of the writer hurries us on but only as though for his amusement to run our heads suddenly against a blank wall in the dark  now wait there says the author in effect  and i will tell you about a whole lot of things that came before the catastrophe the writers craftsmanship is such that the critical reader excuses such odd construction but what of the good soul who sets out to read for the story alone as many will  in short we think mr conrad apt to be too arbitrary yet in view of the excellence of his work which regarded against a background of average fiction has the quality of a fine diamond lying among shingle we advise the ordinary reader not to be discouraged by this  the secret agent is a tale of life among foreign anarchists in london and deals with a remarkable incident in which a foreign embassy to the court of st jamess deliberately provoked a dynamite outrage through a secret agent of its own by way of furthering its policy in this country it is a masterly study the raw material of which would have been turned into crude melodrama by some writers mr conrad has made it the vehicle for some of the most telling characterization he has accomplished his english is usually so scrupulously true and sound that our attention is drawn by a couple of curiously unfortunate phrases in  the secret agenton p 311  at any rate he risked consciously nothing more but arrest for him   and on p 315  4i a youngish composer in pass of becoming famous but there is hardly another sentence which is not calculated to charm the reader of discernment  the secret agent bv loseph conrad 6is privatelv printed werner lauriej  dullness is not in mr conrads power and in his stage version of  the secret agent he has presented us with yet another fascinating novel as a play its interest is relative rather than absolute a bad play in short but a good yarn whose proper interest is reinforced by that of seeing a master craftsman tackle a new form in which he is heavily handicapped his books are subtle and leisurely they deal in atmosphere rather than situation very often their narrative is retrospective here in his greater urgency for exposition mr conrad involves himself in a series of duologues which succeed one another couple following couple in a soundproof sequence to the last curtainfall one feels that all his people share michaeliss complaintthey are  not used to seeing many faces at once and the plays jerkiness is emphasised by the introduction of two whole scenes and several characters which are dramatically superfluous all this was almost a foregone conclusion for of all novelists techniques mr conrads is least adaptable to dramatic requirements what is more strange is his departure from credibility one believes instantly in his seafaring men but one cant quite believe in vladimir of the embassy visiting his backstreet agent in the full warpaint of grosvenor square nor in the anarchist professor who strolls about bomb in hand daring the police to arrest him and yet the professor is great fun he and michaelis both quite irrelevant to the plays plot somehow contrive to be its most significant and provocative characters their scenes are more vivid than the rest of the play despite its

the hierarchy is an accomplished fact he need no longer be read in the blunt type and blurred pages of murphy and chalmers nor in the pale ink and yellow paper of original editions nor in the dogsears

classics in the language with so much to praiseand justly praise it seems ungraceful to condemn the edition has been projected on so opulent a scale and is in certain ways so complete and honourable a success that to find fault with it at all is to run the risk of appearing hypercritical and even unjust on reflection however it is impossible to reject the conclusion that the enterprise is remarkable rather for liberality and enthusiasm than for taste and judgment to begin with the size of the volumes raises objections and objections that are neither to be gainsaid nor despised fielding is before all things else a writer to be studied he wrote for the world at large and he wrote to the end that he might be read and read continually his matter his manner the terms of his philosophy the quality of his ideals the nature of his achievement proclaim him popular like scott like cervantes like shakspeare he claims not merely our acquaintance but an intimate and abiding familiarity he has no special public and to be only on nodding terms with him is to be practically dead to his attraction and unworthy of his society he worked not for the boys and girls of an age but for men and women of all time  and both as an artist and as a thinker he commands unending attention and lifelong friendship he is a great inventor an unrivalled craftsman a perfect master of his material his work is the record of a lifetime of varied experience of keen observation of unwearying intellectual endeavour the types he created are vigorous and sound with an intellectual flavour peculiarly their own his novels teem with ripe wisdom and generous conclusions and improving examples he has as mr stephen remarks the undeniable merit of representing certain aspects of contemporary society with a force and accuracy not oven rivalled by any other writer not to have studied him is to be without a knowledge of the most important documents of contemporary history it is evident that such a writer is not one to be skimmed and laid aside and that it is doing his admirers doubtful service to present him in any but the handiest of forms now this is exactly what has come to pass in the present edition it is sumptuous but it is unwieldy it is inaccessible without a readingdesk and a library chair to peruse it is to engage in the performance of a literary solemnity we consider it with a respectful admiration and we think with a mixture of envy and regret of the editions of alphonso lemerre and the delightful bouquim produced by jouaust at the librairie des bibliophiles what was wanted was a fielding that could be comfortably held and easily perused and that while an ornament to the shelf would not on occasion have proved impossible to the pocketa fielding with whom the reader might converse at odd hours of the day or night with the affectionate freedom that is his due what has been achieved is a fielding to be superbly bound and gilded honoured with a prominent place in the library and venerated for his appearance a fielding to be revered at a respectful distance like a colossal pharaoh or mr addisons celebrated tragedy of  cato another point on which we regret to find ourselves at variance with the publishers of the new fielding is the illustrations it is at all times difficult to understand why the library edition of a great writer should be held incomplete without pictures and the difficulty is increased tenfold when the great writer enjoys such a position as is henry fieldings in the first place it is not doubtful that if fielding wrote for any class of readers in particular it was for readers who were interested in his work not as a vehicle for illustrations but primarily and essentially as literature and that could we suppose him to have been consulted in the matter he would be mortified to find that after over a hundred years of popularity his novels are held to stand in need of adventitious assistance again tom jones and  jonathan wild and amelia have been classics for many years we know them intimately and we have formed as definite a conception of the appearance of their heroes and heroines as we have of the men and women of shakespeare and cervantes themselves and it is certain that the artist who essays to improve upon our imaginings for us or to thrust them out to make room for imaginings of his own is doomed in advance to failure moreover and this is perhaps the strongest argument of allthere is a gap between the present and that part of the past which it was fieldings lot to represent for us between the convention of today and the convention of a century and a half ago between the age of gladstone and the age of walpole that is for all practical purposes as impassable as styx itself the present is an epoch of sentiment its ideals and ambitions are mainly emotional what it chiefly loves is romance or the affectation of romance passion selfconscious solemnity and a ertain striving after the picturesque in fieldings time there was doubtless a food deal of sentimentality for his geneation delighted not only in western md trunnion and mrs slipslop but in pamela and clarissa and the pathetic lie fevre but for all that it wasat all wents in so far as it was interesting to fielding and in so far as fielding has pictured ita generation that knew nothing f romance and was keenly interested in lommon sense and took a vast deal of honest pleasure in wit and humour and a rather ruculent type of satire it is evident that such possibilities of sympathy and understanding as exist between a past of this sort and such a present as our own must f necessity bo few and small their importance too is greatly diminished when we reflect on the nature and tendency 3f certain among though essential elements of fieldings art and mind the most vigorous and the most individual of these is perhaps his irony the next is that abundant vein of pure intellectual comedy by the presence of which his work is exalted to a place not much inferior to that of such work as the  tartuffe  and the  ecole des femmes these rare and splendid qualities are distinguishing features in the best and soundest part of fieldings work of irony he is probably the greatest english master of pure comedy the intellectual manipulation and transmutation of what is spiritually ridiculous in manners and societyhe is both in narrative and in dialogue the greatest between shakespeare and mr george meredith and with both our sympathy is to say the least of it imperfect in no small degree ave have learned to be sentimental and selfsufficient with rousseau to be romantic and chivalrous with scott to be emotional with dickens to take ourselves seriously with balzac and george eliot there are touches of feeling in our laughter even though the feeling be but spite we have acquired a habit of politenessa tradition of universal consideration and respect and our theory of satire is rounded by the harmless generalities of mr du maurier on the one hand and the malevolent respectability of mr w s gilbert on the other a consequence of all this is that in attempting the illustration of  tom jones and  jonathan wild the modern artist enters on a task for which he is indifferently prepared and in which he can at best achieve but an imperfect success this is what has happened to mr small he is probably as good a draughtsman for wood as the publishers could have selected in picturing the aspects and emotions of his contemporaries he is usually successful he has the true sentiment of black and white his invention is varied his design expressive and sound yet of the forty pictures he has contributed to the new fielding there is hardly one that does not seem inappropriate to his matter and that does not act as a barrier between his author and his authors readers it is not that the illustrations are bad in themselves on the contrary many of them are excellent but they have little or none of fieldings spirit and they are in no sense in harmony with fieldings work in thackeray or in messrs besant and rice in  denis duval or  the chaplain of the fleet they would be well enough in  amelia and  joseph andrews  they appear misplaced and their affect is discomforting they have faults f their own as for instance a certain inlecision in invention which has resulted in the production of two or three westerns half a dozen joneses several jonathan wilds and a strange variety of amelias ind sophias but their chief fault is that they do not illustrate fielding mr small has left his comedy to shift for itself and has endowed him with picturesque and romantic qualities altogether foreign to his art and to the epoch in which it was produced he ignores lady bellaston and miss matthews and mrs ellison  he only shows us col bath as a defeated duellist and sergeant atkinson in though act of saving his masters life to him capt blifil is but a body to be carried upstairs and jones a slim young gentleman to be presented under the influence of violent emotion  he has made nothing of partridge nothing of the ordinary and next to nothing of mr abraham adams and for one picture of lady booby conceived in something of the right spirit he has given us half a dozen of sophia which are merely pretty and clever and accomplished and just as he has suppressed the element of comedy so has he exaggerated the element of incident his picture of joseph andrews stripped and abandoned has the gloom and the terror of a design for  eugeno aram he has drawn us three or four duels as many bouts at fisticuffs and a couple of highway robberies his sketch of jonathan wild picking the counts pocket might illustrate a melodrama in a strand theatre his presentment of booth in prison is like a page from a modern novel in the manner of  oliver twist his designs in one word are suggestive now of a fielding who wrote for the adelphi and now of a fielding who lived at bedford park the impression as may be imagined is peculiar to this may be added that though fairly well engraved they are on the whole ill printed for the reproduction of such trenchant contrasts as those in which mr small indulges such a medium as india paper seems improper it is soft and spongy and it absorbs and spreads the ink so that an impression is often produced of vagueness and indecision it is probable that a better effect might be obtained with ordinary platepaper which is hard and glossy and permits of a great deal of clearness of outline and transparency of darks and shadows for the selection of wood engraving in preference to etching as a means of illustration the projectors of the edition deserve a great deal of praise and we cannot but regret that their venture should be unfortunateas in certain ways it undoubtedly is in addition to all this it must be admitted that the editing of the new fielding is by no means so scholarly as was to be desired the arrangement is entirely arbitrary  the text save that in  amelia a few suppressed passages have been reprinted appears to be mainly that of arthur murphy of annotations and explanations which are absolutely indispensable to a correct and complete understanding of fielding and which judiciously supplied would have gone far to make the edition final there is not one in all the ten volumes that these are defects and grave ones will readily be granted they are blemishes too that were hardly to be looked for in such an elaborate publication as the present to the absence of critical and historical annotations we have just referred  and we shall add no more than that in our opinion it does away with any pretensions to finality the edition might have been supposed to possess scarce less noticeable are the vices of arrangement tom jones

volume with joseph andrews appears though  journey from this world to the next which first appeared in the second volume of the  miscellanies published in 1743 while the fifth volume is composed of

the interlude and the essays on  conversation character and nothing 1743 and the  clear state of the case of elizabeth canning and the  case of bosavern penlez which appeared full ten years later the seventh volume opens with the  voyage to lisbon which is a posthumous publication  passes on to the  charge to the middlesex grand jury  and the  inquiry into the causes of the late increase of robbery which date from 1751 and 1753 respectively and after presenting us with the early prefaces to  david simple and the  familiar letters continues with the  translation of the second olynthiac and the  poems included in the  miscellanies in 1743 and concludes with the translation of juvenals sixth satire which is one of fieldings first performances the last three volumes are devoted to the plays and include  very properly  the two pieces first printed among the  miscellanies it is to be noted that the dates of production are not always given and that the editor has very wisely prefaced each play with a statement of the cast where much is wanting one is apt in the nature of things to feel grateful for little of mr stephens introductory essay we can speak in terms of almost unqualified approval it is not so hearty and cheerful as the excellent note on fielding contributed to one of the series of hours in a library it repeats unquestioningly the old old story of the fielding portrait it comments upon lady marys estimate of fielding and horace walpoles malevolent historiette as though the ladys literary weaknesses and walpoles fondness for decorating his gossip had no existence and were not to be taken into the writers calculation and it errs a little in electing to consider its hero according o the canons of modern morality in showing i trifle more interest in the religious inluences that made him what he was than erhaps they deserve and in declining to give i detailed opinion about fieldings relations vith his contemporaries and particularly vith his innumerable posterity but when all is said it remains a piece of singularly good and able work and one of svhich even its author may well be proud lt bears in every sentence the stamp of acute intelligence and great literary tact it is full of wit and humour of excellent criticism and of kindly and generous feeling it abounds in happy phrases and in just and pointed remarks on lifo and

B4407,['6752459'],  the history of a slave tr xi rpi by h h johnstone kegan paul trench  co the happy thought of allowing the native to tell his own tale in his own way if not originally suggested was at all events first worked out in a satisfactory manner by mr churchward in his blackbirding in the south pacific mr churchwards hero john king bruce who draws such a vivid sketch of the horrors of the coolie traffic in the south sea islands finds a worthy rival in mr johnstones herp abu1guwah who paints a no less vivid picture of the horrors of the slavetrade in the dark continent both writers have that personal knowledge of their respective environments and especially that familiarity with the social conditions which are indispensable elements of success in this branch of halfimaginative halfrealistic literature hence both works stand on nearly the same level of excellence in their general treatment of the subject and both are about equally successful in conveying to the reader under a somewhat fanciful form a correct idea of the actual relations in their respective spheres of action where mr johnstone yields the palm to his predecessor is perhaps in the dramatic truth of his personation at least it can scarcely be aid of abu1guwah that either his language or his observations are always quite consistent with the character of an average sudanese negro as when he exclaims what curious people you europeans are you ask so many questions and you want to know so much about things that do not concern you but it should be stated in extenuation that abu1guwah is something more than an average negro for at the time he meets his european interlocutor at tripoli ho has a terrible tale to reveal of his experiences during the many years of his enforced wanderings from his native land near the western seaboard to the mediterranean shores the first thing he clearly remembers was playing as a child with the skull of one of a neighbouring hostile tribe who had been captured and eaten by the young men of his village one of the last events he has to relate is the death of his wife on the verge of the thirsty desert attracted to her destruction by a mirage which she takes to be  the great sea of bornu here in her distraught mind she fancies she sees her mother and the house she used to live in  but after  running a little way she throws up her hands and  falls down in a heap then his companions all runaway slaves like himself perishing of hunger and thirst amid the trackless sands  run up and throw themselves on her and cut her throat and greedily suck her blood presently they fall in with a caravan of fezzan traders bound for murzuk and so escape a lingering death in the sahara at the cost of their freedom the narrator entering the household of a powerful sherif in whose service he ultimately finds his way to tripoli his tale of woes and adventures filling up  the intervening years is skilfully told in such a way as to embody  a realistic sketch of life in the western sudan the impression being heightened by uniform fidelity to the local colouring and by the tact with which many incidents actually witnessed by the author have been interwoven in the general narrative especially characteristic of existence on the borderland between islam and heathendom is the story of our heros capture by a band of ruthless slavehunters who raid his native village spreading havoc throughout the district and wasting life out of all proportion to the number of wretched victims actually carried away into bondage for ever we know from nachtigais account of the state of things prevailing in the region stretching south from lake tsad that the evils of african life are intensified in many parts of this border zone where the aggressive mohammedans are brutalised by daily scenes of plunder and murder and where the pagan populations are reduced to the last stage of degradation compatible with the existence of human society remembering the scenes described by nachtigal among the arboreal inhabitants of kimre wo may well believe that there is no exaggeration in abu1guwahs graphic account of the destruction of his people by the slavehunting fulah and haussa subjects of the sultan of gashka who led him away into captivity  they captured most of the runaway party who had been concerned in the death of their brothers and brought them into the open place where we were lying chained they tied the men to stakes and tree trunks and lopped their limbs off one by one and then beheaded them they ripped up the women and lifting up the children by the feet they swung them round and dashed out their brains on the stone seats in the open square where our elders used to sit under the shade of the big trees while these things were being done a small body of the fulbe were busy burning the town and cutting down the plantations of bananas and setting fire to the dry bush outside the town so that the whole place might be laid bare and afford no hidingplace to such of our people as might have escaped all through that day some in the sun and some in the shade we lay chained together in the open square of our town and so we lay all through the night while the fulbe made big bonfires and roasted our sheep and goats then follows a picture which should be taken to heart by those who speak so complacently of the mildness of domestic slavery throughout mohammedan lands in north africa every happy slave in a moslem household represents at a moderate estimate at least ten lives and an incalculable amount of misery and atrocities  early the next morning they passed in review all of us whom they had captured which i suppose amounted to onehalf of our townspeopleperhaps some five hundred all such as were aged or deformed or weakly were separated from the others and put on one side their chains were taken off and they were told jestingly by the fulbe that they might go where they pleased but when the poor simpletons began to slink off towards the bush the fulbe with shouts of laughter began firing at them with their guns and riding them down on horseback some of the fulbe horsemen would stop for a moment and tie a rope round the ankle of one of these fugitives who had fallen down and fasten the other end of the rope to his stirrup and then ride round and round the square at full gallop till the man he had dragged with him was simply a shapeless mass of blood and bones    all we slaves whom they had selected to take away with them were marched in twos and threes to the river where we were made to wash and drink here several who were mad with grief jumped into the river though they were chained together and tried to swim down the stream but they all sank to the bottom and were seen no more nor does abu1guwah find things quite so pleasant in the households of his moslem masters as might bs supposed from certain roseate descriptions of domestic slavery in sudan and mauritania in one place he gets into trouble over a somewhat romantic love affair is tied to a stake flogged till he faints and left the whole night tied by his wrists to the stake until released towards dawn by his inamorata elsewhere he is lashed with  a greaf whip made of hippopotamus hido whereupon lowering his head ho charges at his master like a bull butting him full in the stomach and avoids a very mauvais quart dheure by making off and enlisting in the army of a neighbouring potentate and so getting tired of this happy slave life after sundry and diverse bloodcurdling adventures he plunges with others into the desert and at last reaches the fezzan frontier under the circumstances above described the horrors of some of the scenes in this part of the work almost exceed the limits of good taste and the detailed account for instance of the sultan of zinders atrocities with the doings of his executioner at the  tree of death might perhaps have been treated somewhat more summarily without much loss to the lesson these things are intended to teach otherwise there is little fault to find with the book on the score of accuracy though the student of arabic may be puzzled to know why the heros name abulquwwat as correctly inscribed under his portrait facing the titlepage should be translated abu1guwah the note at p 140 to the effect that air or airi is the name of the people of azben seems also

must surely be another side to the medal  and on that hypothesis i solemnly dedicate my life to its discovery all thisand all we have left unquoted is excellent comedy what follows is as good or even better in his next chapter mr oliphant introduces though two most natural and complete of all his world of characters the californian heiress stella walton and her bosom friend mattie terrill they

noted that she falls at once into the background of the story and that moreover she grows less and less interesting as she advances towards that spiritual perfection which her author wills to depict and cannot inseparable from altiora is aunt hannah  rough and racy of speech abounding in good senso and the sweetest humanity  touched with peculiar mysticism gifted with peculiar powers a grotesque for some hundreds of pages of uncommon merit in conception and in execution alike but developing at the last  such is the wickedness of novelists even good ones into an abnormal species of monte

to say from mr oliphant as a writer of apostolical romance it is possible as wo have shown to differ pretty vigorously with mr oliphant as an artist in dialogue as a social satirist as a painter of men and manners it is impossible to do other than agree there is his j real strength there is his truo success there are dull passages in  altiora peto  j thero are touches ot extravagance traces of j

siugulur originality  and independence and of such qualities aa wit and humour as good breeding and good temper as knowledge of the world and command of character as elegance of style and clarity and expressiveness of diction it contains enough to equip a score of ordinary novelists for the production of a 6core of extraordinary novels  alt iota peto by laurence oliphant blackwood piccadilly had just enough of sketchy carelessness and improbability to pass for originality and to lead many people into thinking that the author could do much greater things if he liked how far altiora peto has complicated or dispelled this notion it is impossible to say though it is said to have been favourably received we are therefore the more bound to confess at once that we have found it entirely dull and uninteresting both in detail and as a whole the book is an attempt to expand the highclass scientificphilosophicalducal and nethermost west endsociety sketch into a regular novel this is done by now and then wedging in some fragments of a theatrical plot which before it is well developed feebly takes fire and expires in a tedious smouldering fashion the whole thing is of a clumsiness whereat the veteran ouida will haply smile still worse is the sideplot of the young californian belles one rich and plain the other poor and pretty who on their european campaign change names in order to baffle the affections of the men after a tiresome round of forgery and personation and numerous offers of marriage related in detail it merely ends in their undeceiving their lovers and nothing more comes of this confusion which is indeed so perplexing that the author is forced to adopt the borrowed names in speaking of the ladies adding very often such useful reminders as only of course she was really stella or stella all the time being really mattie this kind of business is more effective in farce than fiction both these damsels are supposed to be very remarkable hightoned specimens of the west they merely impress one as dull chatterers there is also a new england aunt hannah a curious caricature after the dickens modelindeed her portrait in the illustrations reminds one strongly of mrs fs aunt she is apparently gifted with prophetic and other supernatural powers which in due time become useful in bundling the plot together the final windingup and liquidation however proves a protracted business being delayed by a not very startling dynamite episode trivial and usually wearisome conversation makes up most of the book much space is also occupied by the ruminations and excursuses of the heroine on faith morals love heredity and herbert spencer much of them we were forced to skip miss peto herself is a good creation but can hardly be said to be even sketched in as it is all we can safely say about her is that she had a mamma who really was not her mamma at all and that instinct always thwarted her earnest efforts to love her however she loves plenty of men but which she finally marries we forget for in order to multiply proposal scenes seven or eight couples are constantly interchanging their lovers there is the usual fashionable bit of financea count fosco baron and much talk of bubble companies and amalgamations most will prefer to read the city article at first hand after searching diligently and anxiously we really cannot find a single thing to praise in this book unless it be the grammar and spelling and the big print and thick paper but all that is a poor compliment of course one feels that mr oliphant is a practised writer and a man of ability and culture and that there is nothing to reprobate or make game of in his work all the same it is as clear as his print that he has no more idea of what a novel should be than a mummy and that he never can and never will write a novel worth yawning over people may say they like it and so critics may think well to pretend to like it and a good many honest souls we dare say really may like it after their fashion because they love to pore over the holy page that tells of duchesses and right honourables aud they have heardprobably trulythat the author has the entree of the most exclusive dens and constantly sees the lions fed any news from the lionhouse is always welcome and if as here it is of a rambling vague and slipshod sort we take it as it comes and for want of a still more inappropriate name call it kindly satire the author is presumably familiar with london society we are in joyful ignorance thereof but not without some stray lights upon poor human nature generally while therefore we allow that his personages have a certain resemblance to the gentlemen and ladies one meets in the best houses in london mandalay and squashville they are dreadfully unlike anybody one is ever likely to meet in or out of doors anywhere under the sun because they are not mortals but parts and fragmentsa limb or two and an idea or so and the rest only talk mr oliphant may know but he cannot describe his london society as we gather it from his hazy fragments is a society which cannot be for it is a house divided against itself thus we are asked to believe in the very superior firstclass virtue of his young ladies yet these virgins and their virtuous mothers are for ever discussing what is to be done for dear lord sark the most eligible parti of the season this ghastly bore is cohabiting with a woman of illfame whom the virgins speak of as  the cly mer not only are they intimate with mrs clymer but they alone or abetted by their mammas hold nauseous conferences with his

sanctified hypocrisies that surround him and the solemn background of romantic interest which frowns from the old ruinous castle of wolsterholme are an introduction in most exquisite keeping with what seems to have been the intention of the writer of the novel but the work can hardly be criticised as finished in any part there are good scenes here and there never well connected and the blanks of incidents and characters altogether unfinished will be detected by the most eoreless critic we must quote a part of the sketch of mr manesty 54 mr manesty was about three or four and forty years of or

dealings were upright his engagements punctually observed and though in doing business with others who were not so punctual or so solvent as himself he had no scruple to enforce his claims in such manner as the law allows and the court awards yet the very greatness of his transactions precluded him from being in general mixed up with needy or embarrassed parties and his wealth often allowed him to display the semblance and perhaps the reality of generous and kindly dealing towards the fallen or broken adventurer in trade  at five tea followed by an hours indulgence in smoking his only luxury and conscientious scruples occasionally reproached him for indulging in this slaveraised weed brought the merchant again to his books a bread and cheese supper sometimes relieved by a glass of hot rum and water followed and ten oclock consigned him to his bed thence to rise at six oclock the next morning and repeat the labours of the bygone day in reality this staid merchant is a villainous pirate and his enormous fortune is the growth of a series of bloody atrocities on the slave coasts of africa a curious point seems to have been aimed at in the character which we can but guess at now it is left so entirely unworked mr manesty connected with what is called the iassemblv of the gifted believes himself to have been once in a state of grace as one of the elect and acts in the persuasion that he who has once been in that state can never fall from it or at any time by any means so sin as to bring down the divine punishment mr manesty might have sustained himself in this fatal doctrine

he lost and what with one bet and another his lordship got my fivepencehapenny out of ine that was a cross joe said lord randy honour bright my lord it was not replied joe qrickly for 1 was reared by

B3610,"['8945648', '6834014']",  i the infinite camcitu the storm of a i genium by cosmo hamilton hurst  blackett many readers will feel that a straitwaistcoat would have been most fitting for a genius with such lack of restraint as the man here pictured not realizing perhaps that there has not yet been invented a spiritual strait  waistcoat that will serve as a deterrent to such irradi cably sensual natures whilst leaving the spiritual force unfettered the present story of the devastation brought about by the genius lacks balance being unrelieved by compensating signs of the real uplifting of any one as a result of his violinplaying and we are thus entitled to question whether his is not such an extreme case as to make him a monstrosity rather than a human being and therefore not of much account as a character study for men and women  the infinite capacity by cosmo hamton hurst and blackett 6s mr cosmo hamilton has presented the reading public with a volume of infinite capacity it is the story of a genius who cannot claim to be a human being except in so far as his genius leads him into monstrous excesses a son of the people he was raised above the people by his genius but in every point except one when his genius slept or was dormant he was not only a son of the people but a son of the worst type of the people the man ai6 commenced his career in obscurity as a member of the orchestra of a low class cafe in paris his genius as a violinist came to be recognised the man who was less than nothing was immediately worshipped as little less than a god huge and extravagant sums were paid for the privilege of admittance to the concerts where he was to perform rich and fashionable women often the most foolish class to be found metaphorically kissed the ground upon which he trod the man himself was wholly indifferent to this worship his fleeting affections were usually bestowed in the lowest quarters of paris such affection as he had to bestow appeared only at intervals and was apt to be rapidly forgotten indeed outside o his art the mans mind was more often than not a blank one day he was entirely oblivious of the actions which he had performed on the preceding day the fact that he found it hard to remember his engagements which had to be carefully noted for him by an absurd little person named zosime was not remarkable as many intellectual men are similarly afflicted the real transition of the story to something more than ordinary occurs when ai6 visits beever park on the invitation of lady elizabeth greenfield who is married to a pompous liberal politician who in consequence of wearing the nonconformist conscience on his coatsleeve has achieved the position of colonial secretary lady elizabeths union with this liberal monstrosity has of course proved uncongenial and at one stage of her career nearly involved a catastrophe the son and pat the daughter were brought up in inevitably uncongenial surroundings their mother was always acting a part and their father spouting platitudes from bhe leaflets of the liberal central office in this unfortunate state of circumstances lady elizabeth fell under the spell of ai6 with the result that she invited him to beever park to take part in a concert to raise funds for a local o4ject a manly young fellow harry steynor had long been in love with pat and had at this very moment put an important question to her which pat had undertaken to answer in a few days the mountebank and his violin appear on the sceneomne ignotum pro magnificopat tired of her mothers acting and her fathers

slowly than could be desired evidently a semiclimax has been reached greatly as i admire the work i should like to see more swiftness from this point up to the climax pat in consenting to run away with ai6 did not fully realise the import and the tendencies of the step which she had taken thoroughly imbued with the uselessness in his political work of her father the colonial secretary she had conceived the notion that it would be a grand thing to do some useful work in the world ai6 told her he needed her she knowing the utterly irresponsible creature that he was fancied that she could be

i resemble both in eyes and spirit she learned in her youth to be a wicked young lady probably like the undersigned and knew nothing more amusing than to have some tricks in hand which set people a staring or laughing or else frightened them sadly she had the most magnificent long light hair that anybody can imagine and no little renown did this beautiful hair get among the relations and no little waa said abouthow when she was a bride this hair would become her plaited like a crown upon her head but when on the morning of her wedding they came to dress this beautiful hairbecause she was to lie married in the forenoon at church and when they took off her nightcapbehold there fell the beautiful golden plaits of hair to the ground with the cap and there the bride sat with her head round as a turnip and with her hair cut short and she was ready to die with laughter to see the consternation of those who saw it and how they could hardly refrain from screaming in horror the bridegroom however laughed with the bride at the joke and they two were a happy couple although she continued many of her peculiarities which were not altogether womanly thus she always wore mens clothes and was fond of manly occupations such as hunting riding turning on a lathe and even occasionally smoking a pipe but with all this the odd little lady was so truly gentle and kind and cheerful that she made everybody happy around her so that everybody cordially liked her and became attached to her uncle herkules went to live with her when he was twelve years old after the death of his parents and was brought up on her estate together with her six sons these young gentlemen lived together in a large parlour called  the lions den and there was merriment and noise enough  still from their very earliest youth they all assembled to family prayers morning and evening the little countess was the very best of mothers to these lads alike prudent nnd kind and nothing pleased her better than to get up a hunting party or some sort of amusement which would entertain them they were at the same time happy and merry young men and never thought of doing anything which was wicked or unjust as a widow

B7890,['9213546'],  st ives being the adventures of a frenth prisoner in england by robert louis stevenson heinemann tnis is a rattling touchandgo tale of adventure of a somewhat ordinary type yet relieved by some fine but slight studies in characterization that it will not add to stevensons reputation is clear from this description as well as from his own doubts about the book already published to the world in the  vailima letters whether it was altogether wise of his executors to publish it admits of some doubt yet after all it will not lower if it will not enhance his reputation and it is of course far above the average trade novels that pour forth in such increasing floods from the press perhaps the most remarkable and significant thing about the book is the skill with which mr quiller couch has supplied the last bu chapters which both in style and briskness of treatment bear an astonishing resemblance to the preceding thirty it was a dangerous and difficult task that mr quiller couch undertook and to some it might seem of disputable taste but he has come out of the ordeal triumphantly and for once a patch has proved to be not altogether a botch take for example the following passage in which the hero is forced for a purpose to simulate drunkenness  doubtless by my uncovered head and gala dress he judged me an allnight revellera strayed bacchanal fooling in the morrows eye prompt upon the inference came inspiration i must win to the centre of the crowd and a crowd is invariably indulgent to a drunkard i hung out the glaring signboard of crapulous glee lurching hiccoughing jostling apologising to all and sundry with spacious incoherence i plunged my way through the sightseers and they gave me passage with all the good humour in life this has the true stevensonian accent the unexpected adjectives the double accusatives the metaphoric signboard all are just in stevensons style as for the matter of the supernumerary chapters they appear to have been supplied from the memory of mrs strong stevensons amanuensis and their episodical character is merely on a par with the rest of the work the tale as its subtitle indicates tells the story of the adventures of a french prisoner in england and scotland just before napoleons first downfall but the viscount anne de st yves de keroual the french prisoner in question is of somewhat curious upbringing he had had an english nurse and ample opportunities of learning english which he talked with scarcely perceptible accent but the training in english seems to have gone somewhat deeper that the mere language for it is only occasionally throughout the book that he remembers that he is a frenchman and a french soldier to boot and altogether he is by no means convincing in his title rdle he is a dandy and is curious in waistcoats yet there is something raffish about his bearing a quality which he shares with his cousin the elder viscount de st yves who is the rather pinchbeck villain of the story altogether it is difficult to believe that a hero such as this could have won the heart of a highspirited scotch girl after two or three interviews the fact is this book bears the mark of a fggel aiinl on almost every page of it it is largely reminiscent of other works of the same writer the interview which the heroines brother has with the hero resembles closely a scene in  beau austin the escape from edinburgh castle has its counterpart in a similar escape in  the black arrow the villain viscount is a faint copy of the master of ballantrae the counting up of the treasure recalls the last pages of treasure island the fight with the drovers is a similar incident to the attack by clunys men in kidnapped rowleys flageolet takes the place of the penny whistle of the carrier in  the wrong box while the friendly relations of the hero with that burly villain burchell fenn had previous existence in the pages of  the wrecker and so throughout the majority of incidents recall similar passages in stevensons earlier books and prove that while be was occupied in writing st ives his mind had lost its power of fresh combination that the loss was only temporary that vigorous fragment  weir of hermiston is more than sufficient proof little fresh as are the incidents they are even less well considered and connected the story is practically of an escaped military prisoner who travels from edinburgh to his uncles place in the south and then returns to the northern capital the motive for the return is supposed to be an invincible desire to see the loved one but the coxcomb tone in which the fair one is wooed does not make this return at risk of death any the more probable stevenson may possibly have felt this as he props up the motive with a somewhat trumpery charge of assault in which others might be implicated for the heros sake but even this is only brought in as an afterthought for it could not have been made the principal motive or else the attractive power of love would have been so much diminished when st ives gets to edinburgh again where he is wanted for an alleged murder really the result of a duel he naturally falls into great dangers from which he ultimately escapes by the most mechanical of methods a casual balloon that wafts him away to the bristol channel altogether the book regarded from the point of view of plot is a panorama of improbabilities nor on the character side is there much to attract we have already referred to though unconvincing nature of the heros position as an angloscotch frenchman the heroine is somewhat of a lay figure more care has been taken with the villain but he is after all merely a lath that is not even painted to look like iron and in the relations of the hero either to heroine or villain there is nothing inevitable nothing that could not be otherwise yet unsatisfactory as the book is both in construction and characterization it has an interest of its own to the student of stevensons art previous to this book his studies in characterization were somewhat forced and he had clearly to content himself with but a few figures on the stage he characterised with deeficulty but here at last he began to show himself a compeer of the masters in that quality in which they specially proved their mastery what distinguishes fielding scott dickens thackeray and even charles read to a certain extent is the ease and fecundity with which they create minor characters it is possible they crowd their canvases too much but the total result is to produce that effect of bustling life which it is the peculiar function of the novelist to reproduce here in  st ives stevenson for the first time came to his own in this respect it is crowded with subordinate figures the majority of them alive and some of them uproariously kicking there is major chevenix the heros rival a dry stick but a gentlemanly the heroines aunt miss gilchrist is crabbed and caustic but goodnatured at bottom rowley the boy valet is scarcely the success that the pains devoted to him would warrant but he is certainly alive one of the minor characters a french colonel who had broken parole in order to reach the deathbed of his only daughter sounds a note of almost tragic intensity but whether it be a postboy demanding blackmail or a runaway bride who is sorry she has run away or an attorneys clerk who has touches of patriotism or an edinburgh buck who is professor of nonsense in an imaginary universitywhether they are portrayed in fewor in many linesalmost every character introduced has the tang of individuality stevenson must have felt some of this increased capacity himself for he has been so greatly daring as to introduce as one of his minor characters no less a person than walter scott himself the passage in which he appears is short and slight but may be here quoted as an instance of perhaps the most characteristic thing about  st ives the evidence it gives of the capacity of indicating character by a few traits   our encounter was of a tall stoutish elderly gentleman a little grizzled and of a rugged but cheerful and engaging countenance he sat on a hill pony wrapped in a plaid over his green coat and was accompanied by a horsewoman his daughter a young lady of the most charming appearance they overtook us on a stretch of heath reined up as they came alongside and accompanied us for perhaps a quarter of an hour before they galloped off again across the hillsides to our left great was my amazement to find the unconquerable mr sim thaw immediately on the accost of this strange gentleman who hailed him with a ready familiarity proceeded at once to discuss with him the trade of droving and the prices of cattle and did not disdain to take a pinch from the inevitable rams horn presently i was aware that the strangers eye was directed on myself  and there ensued a conversation some of which i could not help overhearing at the time and the rest i have pieced together more or less plausibly from the report of sim   surely that must be an amateur drover ye have gotten there the gentleman seems to have asked sim replied 1 was a young gentleman that had a reason of his own to travel privately well well ye must tell me nothing of that i am in the law you know and tace is the latin fora candle answered the gentleman  but i hope its nothing bad sim told him it was no more than debt   oh lord if that be all  cried the gentleman  and turning to myself  well sir he added i understand you are taking a tramp through our forest here for the pleasure of the thing i  why yes sir said i  and i must say i am very well entertained   i envy you said he i have jogged many miles of it myself when i was younger my youth lies buried about here under every heatherbush like the soul of the licentiate lucius but you should have a guide the pleasure of this country is much in the legends which grow as plentiful as blackberries and directing my attention to a little fragment of a broken wall no greater than a tombstone he told me for an example a story of its earlier inhabitants presently after giving us a cigar apiece scott bade us farewell and disappeared with his daughter over the hills and when i applied to sim for information his answer of  the shirra man  abode kens the shirra  told me unfortunately nothing the incident is slight enough in all conscience but every touch tells and the whole impression is one of life it is perhaps worth while mentioning that the word cigar is here spelled otherwise than in the rest of the book where it has the old spelling segar there are also some anachronisms of fact and tone and what is probably a misprint on p 92  usuriousness for uxoriousness these discrepancies would doubtless have been removed if stevenson had lived to revise the proofs but no amount of revision could have made up for the want of cohesion in the plot the inefficient colouring of the chief characters it is needless to say that in speaking in these somewhat slighting terms of  st ives wear judging it by a high standard whether destined to be classic or no there is no doubt that stevensons work stands out markedly from the ruck of machinemade fiction and this very book with all its faults shows that he was slowly maturing to a mastery of his art which might have raised him to an equality with the greatest of the past,biography_contra

remembered horror as they pass from abuse to abomination recorded in this book but in its own words  no ordinary men leading ordinary lives can form any notion of such a life as this hideous with realistic ghastlinessesnauseous with detail of barbaric torturings scarcely relieved by any touch of tenderness it reiterates a nightmare of iniquities to the end the deportation of convicts to tasmania and elsewhere from these islands has happily ceased the abuses of that obsolete system are contained in minutes and bluebooks of which a tempting array is given at the end of the story it is ostensibly to prevent the extremely improbable return of a similar failure that an extract of all its choicest outrages is here served np as a threevolumed novel it is a work of much power but more horror the hero condemned for a robbery which he did not commit and on which he is heroically silent to conceal his fathers crime and his mothers shame for twenty years suffers unspeakable agonies as a convict is always escaping is always thrown back into a deeper abyss has always some fresh ingenuity of physical or moral torment invented for his benefit then thrown in for divertissement we have a rechauffee of the tichborne conspiracy an incipient adultery floggings to death sundry suicides for very loathing of life and hero and there a climax of cannibalism the story opens with a passion which culminates in the family tragedy and though invective by the way is powerful throughout the defoelike minuteness of the genealogy is surely unnecessary though scenes on board though convictship aro drawn with a strong hand but how is the authors purpose or how is the development of his characters served by his detailed descrip tion of two mutinies  they would have been more at home in some book of hairbreadth stories for boys so too of his homeric single combats and his description of  the bestial boohoo kept up between decks and the hideous phantasmagoria in the evilswelling twilight and the hideous commonwealth whose only order of nobility is the halter all this is very vivid and is held up for our execration and very justly too but after all why kick a dead dog  from the convictship the llydaspes is seen on fire it explodes and in it is supposed to perish richard devine the preconvict name of rufus dawes the hero for such a belief dawes to conceal his sacrifice had created in a letter to his mother he and his bastard halfbrother john rex dawes by the way is a bastard too and does not know of his relationship to rex and frere his cousin an officer are all of course on board the convict ship and all ignorant of each others personality and we find them together again and again still always thrown together as the sufferer and the plotter and the bully after some years of agony at macquarie harboura cheerful place bounded by foetid exhalations and the seaand when the settlement is being moved elsewhere there is another mutiny which is this time successful frere and the wife and daughter of captain vickers and one or two others are landed by the convicts and left to starve but dawes who had previously been exiled to a desert rock for insubordination and had drowned himself once but rescued by an accidental log had wandered away in search of settlements till death had stared him in the facereturning in despair to  hells gates finds the convicts gone but the outcasts starving and he builds them a marvellous coracle of goatskins stretched over logs having caught his goats with springs and salt and what wronder  for  he could fell trees without an axe bake bread without an oven and build a waterproof hut without bricks or mortar and so he becomes their preserver and even the bully frere yields a surly deference to genius and after ten days at sea and of course just as the cruse of oil is on the point of failing they are picked up and frere gives up daws as a runaway and himself usurps the credit of their preservation and mrs vickers dies and on sylvia the child a blank forgetfulness of just that crisis falls and the other two men who might have told had killed each other and so daws is not believed but his last state becomes worse than the first then as the years go round sylvia is married to her supposed preserver frere from gratitude and not for love and ho and she and daws are always being brought fruitlessly into contact and frere is always breaking dawes spirit or someones spirit by fifty or a hundred lashes administered to daws or by dawes with details of weals and groans after the original horror in  uncle toms cabin and so on till the blood boils ten convicts wander off and ultimately eat each other and that for several pages north a drunken parson but a very good fellow appears on the scene as a friend of daws and sylvia but he ends by running off with the latter to sea only that dawes by changing clothes with him forestalls him and so in universal shipwreck the curtain falls meanwhile john rex who had escaped had imposed on the heros mother by his likeness to her son and had lived in splendour till after betraying himself he only survives as an idiot it is a sickening and desolate story all thc crimes of a system are crowded on to the head of one innocent man just as a missionary magazine will concentrate with pentecostal plenty all the concessions effected by the finance of twenty years into a pennyworth plum of touching narrative the plea for the book is that these effete abuses are in fact in course of reconstruction in new caledonia  and no doubt for we have chapter and verse all its horrors are authentic but why send them round in three volumes and in un elegant cover to startle boardingschool young ladies and fire the molluscous imagination of novel readers with auttsdafv on paper and all the tortures of nero  those who sup on horrors know where to go and those who take any useful interest in convicts are more likely to be reached by other means than these the author of his natural life might write a capital book of adventure byfield and flood  or he might acquaint himself with the latest accounts of khiva and tashkend and expand in narrative veracious and vamberesque or he might outboucicault melodramatic tragedy orand herein is another bone to be picked with himlie might write a really good novel of character drawing for his incidents on ordinary life and avoiding the ghastly and the curdling improbabilities  escapes in bluefire down a bottomless precipice unravelable family mysteries a finale only attainable by a universal massacre ti la hamlet are the stock tools of ordinary sensational novelists the author of  his natural life shows us by hints and glimpses that he is capable of better things hia characters though their development is overcrowded with incident contain elements of a power that would well repay practice dawes a brutalised prometheus is simply an incarnation of suffering  but frere the goth who develops by unrestrained exercise of power into the ruthless tyrant and who slowly but surely chokes his springs of good is a character touched in the description by many delicate suggestions he is as it were a teutonic and ruffianly tito his patronising air with the child sylvia and his blank incomprehension of her when she is his wife and his clumsy passion for such unwonted purity are all finely touched sarah parfoy the wife of john rex and mistress of frere is a hard and unwholesome subject but truthfully drawn  she was the sort of girl of whom women say it is a pity she has no mother and men it is a pity she does not get a husband and who say to themselves when shall i have a lover   mr meekin as the apotheosis of a canting parson is perhaps overdrawn  but in the description of north the drunkard there is a vivid power and the crown of the story is sylvia delightful as a queer and irrepressible child and well if far too slightly touched as a loving and unsatisfied woman her childish sayings are many and all good though drawing a little too much on the belief of a reader with average experience of children  will danny wear his yellow jacket in heaven or go as a free man   and it is the one touching trait in the martyr dawes when through all his misery he worships the memory of the child whom he believes to be dead we shall look for another work of the same author either on gorillahunting and maneating or a pleasant and wellelaborated study of character he has it in his power to give us either but we should like to know which it is to be the present story is neither nor

one from le sae the great change that has taken place in manners it is true renders that which twas broad humour too coarse for modern taste and even the wit of le sage is occasionally too gross for cars lolite our translitor who apleairs to be a clever young author has forgotten to soften down a fewv of the too signlificant parts  but in every other respect he has produced a very entertaining version of the roguish adventures of that prototype of adventurers the chevalier guzman  the history of guzman dalfarache was written originally in spanish by mateo almana contudor le rcsiltas to philip it a situation of high rank in the royal accountaants office and was rapidly translated into several languages upon its reception by all polite nations says the tranislator i have already remarked and it is significant that the author in testimony of his great genius was called the divibswhard a as in his ilistory of guzman a professed rogue he had toi describe necessarily predicaments and adventures of a nefarious character that they might produce the proper effect a dissuasive from evil lie accampauied each with moral reflections too enlightened to be slighted and too impressive to be easily forgotten ini ngil n circumstances aud reasoning so adroitly together that entertainment and instruction the utile et mhee are blended in the most effectual mauner and while the one excites admiration the other as forcibly not only counteracts evil example but impresses the mind fully with the vanity of folly and the turpitude of crime we are not quite sure of this but still we cannot refuse our assent to the proposition that the narrative is replete with droll incident guzman goes through all the phases of beggary robbery intriguing and swindling some of his tricks are immortal and most of them we fear are even now in daily practice thus far their description may be useful and to show howv closely allied the cheats of our great grandfatthers days were to those of our own we pass the history of our hero to give a sample of a1e laws of 4ibas beggars of every nation are distinguished from each there by their different modes of imploring alms as the germans beg by singing and in troops the french by their prayiung the flemitigs by their respectful bowings the bohemians hy fortunetelling the portuguese by their cryinz the italians by longs harangues the english by abusing and the spaniards by their haughty growlings we hereby command thert all to observe the following statutes under pain of our heavy displeasure  1 we forbid any lame or wounded beggar of whatever nation he be to appear in the quarters frequented by others full of health and vigour on account of the advantage they still have over the latter ve also ordain that all such as are in perfect health form no manner of connexion with blind men fieldpreachers mountebaniks poets musicians redeemed captive nor even with old soldiers that have escaped from a rout or seam a saved froin a shipwreck for although it is generally allowed that all these must subsist by imploring charity their manners of beggins being different it is necessary that each society keep to its own particular rules i 2 wve ordain that beggars have certain taverns assigned them in every country where shall preside three or four of their ancients with staves in their hands as emblems of their authority which said ancients are hereby empowered to canvass in the aforesaid taverns all the affairs of the world and to give their opinions as freely as there please at the same time we permit the other beggars to relate their own heroic exploits as well as those of their ancestors and even to illustrate the conversation by boasting of battles they were never in  3 we command that every beggar carry a good cudgel in his hand with a spike at the end of it if possible to be provided against emergencies lest they repent of their neglect  4 that each beggar take especial care never to presume to wear any thing new that all his clothes be worn out torn or patched nothing bringing more scandal on the profession than begging in good clothes be it however well understood that if in the exercise of his professional duties a beggar chance to obtain somne new garment he is at liberty to deck himself out in it for that day but no longer we positively will and command that he dispose of it the following morning  5 to prevent any dispute that may arise between comrades for certain posts we ordain that the moor e ancient possessor prevail and take precedence without regard to persons  6 it is permitted that two infirm or sick persons beg in company if they please and call each other brothefs provided they beg by turns and in a different toue the one beginning where the other leaves oti tlhey are to keep opposite each other on different sides of the street each singing his own misfortunes they may afterwards divide their profits as they please 7 it is permitted that a beggar wear an old dishclout round his head in winter instead of a bonnet that while he is protected from the cold he may at the same time appear an invalid they are likewise at liberty to walk with crutahes or to have one leg tied up behind them  8 every beggar may have a purse and a pocket but must receive alms in their hats only  9 we command that no beggar be so indiscreet as to divulge any of the mysteries of our trade to any but such as belong to our society  10 should any beggar be so fortunate as to discover any new trick in the art of begging le shall le obliged to communicate the same to the company which ought to enjoy in common the benefit arising front the genius of any of its members as a recompense however to the inventor and to stimulate his genius to new discoveries we decree that lhe have an exclusive privilege to make the most of his device for three months during which time we peremptorily forlid any other belonging to our fraternity from interfering with his practice under pain of confiscating to his use all the profits that way be derived tmnerefrom 1 we exhort the memlberq of this society freely atond faithfully to make known to each other all the houses where they know that either private or public alms ar likely to ie dispensed  especially thobe inl which vanri ug or courting is gwing forward for in such places large receipts are certain  12 we command that no beggar pre sume to keelp or lead about with him any hunting setting or other dogs  blind meni being allowed to be conducted by a little cur with a string round its neck this pro hibition is not meant to extend to such of our fraternity as may chance to possess dogs of talent these may be allowed to exhibit their performances as usual by making their dogs dance or jump through hoops but they must not presume to take their station at a churchdoor where other beg gars of the society may be assembled on account if the great advantage they will have over them  13 we command that no beggar ven ture to buy meat or fish in the market on his own account except in a case of extremne necessity very ill consequences way arise from so doing 14 we permit all such beggar as ha4ve ni children of their own to hire at malty as four to lead about with them into the churches onl fostivals  these should not be above five vears old and if possible should appear to he twins if a female conduct themn she should never fail to have one always at her breast and if a man he must lc sure to carry one on his arm and lead the next by the other hand  15 we command that those beggars who have any children instruct thein up to thie age of six years in the best mode of making collections in churches  that after hniving taunght themn to ask charity for their father and niotler who lie on their beds at horme most dangerously ill tieyv a1llow them to go alolle though it were better not entirefy to lose sight of them as soon however as these children shall have attained their seventhi year we conmind that they be letft to shift for themselves as being already imijors and that their parents be content to restrict anid comnel them to return hone at stipulated hours t1 beggars of the old stamp who conxider it a point of honouir to valk in the footstops of their ancestors who have trained themn to the profession of begging will never allow their children to take any other trade than their own nor to degrade themnselves by entering into the service of any one  and it these children wish to he thouight worthy of their parents they will hold  eery other condition in alhorrence  17 although idleness is the principal divinity worshipped by us beggars we neverthfiless think proper to lprescribe certain hotirs of rising every one should dreis atnd turut out by seven oclock in winter and by live in sumimier

who lltut har hand a cavalicr of gome called dorido a young man of an illustrious family an engaging person and great bravery fell in love with a young lady of the name of clorinia who was about seventeen years old virtuous beautiful and of equal rank the relations of this charming girl brought her up with so much care that they would not allow her to make any connexion by which her virtue might be at all endangered she was hardly ever suffered even to approach her latticed window lest some misfortune should be the consequence as no one could gaze upon her extreme beauty with impunity either her father or her mother or her brother valerio attended her every where and watched her every action some months ago dorido having accidently obtained a sight of her became violently enamoured  but could declare his love by no other means than by casting empassioned glances towards the window of her chamber when she happened to be there as he passed by the house if the homage of his eves was not always remarked by the object of it at least it was sometimes noticed  at all events it was practised often enough to produce the wishedfor effect  clorinia at first was satisfied with looking at the cavalier without being seen but soon she felt a wish that he should see her also without knowing why she wished it and answering by little and little to his amorous looks she at last conceived a passion in the same way in which she had inspired it i mean by appearing at her lattice dorido soon guessed that he had made on her all the impression he desired and since he was denied more indulged himself in the transports of believing himself beloved nevertheless lie sought to reap a more solid satisfaction from his conquest lie contrived to form an acquaintance with valerio and succeeded so well as to attach him in such a degree that they were inseparable a valerio could no longer live without his friend dorido they were always together sometimes at one house sometimes at another this gave iorido an opportunity of sometimes seeing his charmer aid even speakingg to her but never alone thie eves of the lovers alone communicated to each other the secrets of their hearts this state of affairs however did not last for ever clorinia mdle her maid scintila the confidant of her passion  this old woman wlho had wit and wished to serve her mistress called uipon dorido and having met with him  noble cavaliet said she  you need not attempt to disguise the truth from me i know tile state of your heart you love clorinia and i am niuch mistaken if your love is not returned you are both dying with impatience for an interview and i cannot see your situation without pity i shall never rest till i have procured you the satisfaction you both so ardently desire the lover transported with joy at these words thanked the dtuenna for her good will assuring her that she should not find him ungrateftul if she succeeded then making use of so excellent an opportunity he wrote a very passionate billet which he conjured her to convey to the amiable sister of valerio scintila returned immediately to her mistress to acquaint her with the step she had taken and presented her with loridos letter clorinia blamed her for taking charge of itbut soon forgave her nothing was now thought of but how to manage the interview with the lovers the lady raised so many difficulties that she would have relinquished it altogether if the old woman who was more ingenious had not hit upon a plan they both approved of scintilas ledelhamber was on the ground floor and adjoining to her room there was another which was filled with old and useless furniture this room was lighted only by a small window defended by two strong bars of iron through which there was only room sufficient for a hand to pass this window which was about five or six feet from the ground looked into a lane or blind alley quite uninhabited and the place appeared exactly suited to lovers who were satisfied to limit their happines to conversation only the old woman as soon as she saw her young mistress disposed to speak with jorido through this little window hastened to inform the cavalier who on the ensuing night at eleven oclock placed himself at a convenient spot lie approached the bars where he found scintila expecting him she requested him to wait patiently until the servants were gone to bed lie did not languish long in suspense the wishedfor moment soon arrived clorinia came trembling to the window at which her lover presented himself in speechless agitation as they both now loved for the first time they were agitated at the sight of each other and the excess of their feelings at first prevented them from speaking but love has more than one language the lady passed one of her beautiful hands between the bars of the window and the lover clasping it with ardour covered it with a thousand kisses at last by degrees they broke silence and indulged in passionate protestations of eternal love their souls were so entirely occupied by the pleasure of seeing each other that they would have suffered daylight to find them together if the old woman had not interrupted their conversation to warn them that it was time to seplarate before he would retire dorido entreated his mistress to allow him to return the next night at the same hour to the window and the lady could not resolve to refuse him this favour at last they separated equally delighted with the conversation they had just had with each other and filled with impatience for another interview lorido especially was too much agitated to be able to take any rest or to speak more correctly he was miserable until the time of his reiurn to the window you may easily suppose he did not fail to be punctual his mistress finding no obstacle to her design appeared again at the same place and their meeting was the second time less embarrassed by timidity than the first the cavalier who had a great deal of wit said a tliouialtld fine things to his mistress who replied to them in as lively a manner this conversation lasted for three hours and tfleir discourse was mingled with innocent caresses  so that the second interview pleased them both as much as the first che prudent scintila was again obliged to separate them again and again they accused her of cruelty not reflecting that though she disturbed their pleasures it was only with a view to render them more lasting for in fact they continued to enjoy their stolen interviews with so much secrecy and good management that not a soul livjiugt knew of them but the old woman and one other person t this other person was a young man of rank namded horatio a native of this city lie also loved clorinia having by chance seen her at her lattice and had revealed his love to her by signs  but finding them very badly received he concluded that he had a rival wsho was mole happy and judged that rival to he lorido as he was united in so strict a friendship with valerio to clear upi his wellfounded suspicions he sought out dorido who was one of his friends to vwhom lie spoke in these words  aly dear dorido i am come to ask a favour of yno and i conjure you not to refuse me my happiness depends upon it you are cointinually with valerio  you very often visit at his house aid i cannot help thinking that vou ale in love with his sister  if i ami mistaken in my conjectures oblige me by declaring it y ou are too well deserving the heart of that lady for me to venture to dispute it with you  you love clorinia then exclaimed iorido a little ruffled i i confess that i am quite charmed with her replied ihoratio  but nevertheless i do you justice and agree that you dese rve letter than i can the happiness of being her husband  lhet us speak without flatterv interrupted dorido  i should doubtless consider myself highly honoured in hecoiningr the husband of clorinia but  frankly eonfess to you that i have no designi to marry her  is it possible cried horatio eagerly  that you do not mean to mnarry her all i my friend how different are my intentions from yours aly highest ambition is to unite my fate with hers  your views should yield to mine  sacrifice the mad hopes you have conceived i expect this effort from your friendship and your virtue  you might add said dorido  that i owe it to the family of lorinia yes continued lie  i will leave the field open to you and if valerios sister should accept your addresses and consent to give you her hand i will cease to be your rival i vill do more i will speak in your favour and i assure you that in that case it shall not be my fault if your wishes are not fulfilled horatio was so well satisfied w ith this speech that he testified his gratitude to iorido without thinking that his promise ivas only conditional and therefore that he ought to mistrust it lie made no reflection of this kind but even requested dorido to use his good offices in his behalf with clorinia dorido could not but be touched at the frankness of horatio and being generosl ellough to prefer the huippiness of his friend to his own inclinations as his views were purer he resolved to do all in his power to wean his affections from this lady in fact the very next time he saw her he addressed her thus  you are not ignorant madam that horatio is added to the ntinber of your slaves lut i am doubtful whether you know how truly he adores you learn then that he thinks only of you and that to receive your hand is the only wish of his heart  i am chairmed to hear it replied clorinia  my reception of him shall convince you how little i wish for any lover but dorido   well know replied the cavalier  the value of a preference so glorious for me but i should think that i abused your goodness if i wvas not capable of some selfdenial  horatio has inany good qualities and when you know him better you will not be srrv perhaps if your friends should second ils wishes  how l cried the lady  to hear you is enough to make me believe that you wish to make me miserable is it possible that you can wish me to reply to the tenderness of horatio i i never answered dorido   i have no such thought i only wished to convince you that if you feel any inclination for lloratio and your friends approve of his addresses my heart would in vain rebel  that i would sacrifice mnselfto the happiness of my rival to show you how entirely devoted i am to all your vishes  i fear replied she  that the victim would be as submissive as you represent him and that your love for me is not quite so sincere as you profess it to be but continued she  i do not pretend to put you to the trial dorido shall be my first lover and my last upon this assurance you may rely let horatio persevere as much as he pleases in his love for me he will never be more successful i will confess to you that i was acquainted with his passion which i learned from his gestures before my window and have been so little pleased lb it that i have conceived a dislike for him which almost borders on hatred  after these words iorido did not dare to mention hioratio again as he perceived very plainly that the topic was extremely disagreeable to clorinia lie changed the conversation for the rest of the time they were together and the night was passed in mutual lrotestations of eternal love on the next day dorido received a visit from horatio i well my friend said the latter i have you seen clorinia  did any thing fall from her lovely lips which could be interpreted in my favour  i am very sorry replied the other  that i cannot give you a very flattering account you have but little room for hope 1 extollrd your merit i pointed out the splendour of the alliance i represented you as much more in love with her than perhaps you really are  but the cruel beauty silenced me by declaring that she could not reply to your love and that the soft bonds of ilymen should never unite her fate with yours at these words lioratio turned pale and fell into a profound reverie  while uorido symathising in hlis grief like a true friend pointed out to him that he ought to reliiiilnih his pretensions rather than attempt to constrain the incli nations of clorinta and that there were in room many other ladies equally amiable who would do more justice to his merit  to conclude my dear horatio added he  i am sure i have given you no cause to be dissatisfied with me i would willingly have yielded the sister of alerio to you provided she had been at all inclined to fiavour your passion i would have made this sacrifice to friendship can you now refuse to abandon a conquest that you are by no means sure to gain  horatio theit broke silence and replied to his friend far from reproacling you i must consider myself under a great obligation to you tor the service you have fruitlessly attempted to render ine in pleading my cause i confess that it is more reasonable i should renolunce mily pretensions to a hand which 1 am not alble to obtain than that you should relinquish a heart which you already ossess0 farewell iny triend i will spare no ains to enable me to profit by your advice and formi an attachiment elsewhere lle liittel dorido as lhe concluded these words land with an air vhichm persuadeld him that struck by the force of his argunments lie illtetiled to employ his utmost enleavours tou conpuer his pa ssion for a woman whose illgratitude convinced him that lie loved liter too well but his intentions were fiar diil ferent lie looked upon iorido as a traitor lle is a false friend said lie to himself far from saying any thing to clorinia in ny ftavour he has only spoken to my disadvantage however he that as it may i am resolved to persevere i will ask her in marriage through my father who will le more ready to serve me than my rival was thus i lrntio resolved to imlart his passioln to his father who approved of hi choice anl promised to interpose in his behalf undertaking to speak to clorinias father on tjid subject which he did soon afterward rhe twy old inen had a long conversation togtether  and the result was that a narriaze was agreed upon provideled that the lady should show no repugnance to it as her father was resolved not to constrain her inclinations but as sooii ais a nmarriage with horatio vas proposed to her she tetified so much aversion for that gentlemiall that they lost all hopes of lher ever beeing more favourably inclined towards iimii alld every thing was consequently brokeln oil how pitiable is the situation of that mali whose love tyrannises over his reason  lioratio seeing that his passion was despis d and his rival triumphant felt all his love clained into hate  lie now coniqidr o tlorinia only as an object of detestution and

requested him to accompany him to the surgeon but jorido refused saying to him with an air which showed the fury that began to animate him  no no valerio i shall employ my time better there is no occasion for us to engage ourselves both on the same errand when there is so much more to be done do you alone undertake to conduct the surgeon to your house while i seek for the barbarian who could commit a crime which no one can hear of without trembling if i can discover this perfidious wretch let him expect a chastisement worthy of his treason in a word added he  leave me to revenge you i feel as acutely as you the misfortune of clorinia upon this the two friends separated ldorido returned homewards vowing to listen only to his anger in the revenge which he purposed to take upon horatio for he could suspect no one but him of having committed this action as soon as he arrived at home lie shut himself up in his chamber that he might freely lament the loss of his mistress  my dear lorinia cried he  my rival envious of your love for me has deceived you in darkness of this fatal night you have mistaken him for your iorido i am then the unhappy cause of the misfortune which has happened to you were it not for me you still would have been living in perfect peace with your father it is i who have assassinated you but your death shall but little precede my own no sooner shall i have sacrificed horatio to your ashes than i also will join you in eternal darkness oh i that it were permitted to thee to see and rejoice in the just vengeance whichi will intlict on the wretch who has dared to deprive thee of thy innocent hand thuiis did iorido bewail his mistresss fate until daybreak when lie repaired to her house where every one was in the greatest distress and agitation valerio and his father seemed to be doubly afflicted at the sight of him and they embraced each other almost drowned in tears  oh dorido my son said ihe old man  my daughter is at the point of death having lost so great a quantity of blood as alone would be sufficient to terminate her existence was there ever so unfortunate a father who can have been capable of committiug so horrible an act  what punishment can console us under our present affliction  sir answered dorido  suspend we our lamentations for a while and let us think of one thing only which concerns us all the author of this misery must perish i will inflict on him an adequate punishment but before i execute a revenge on him which shall astonish and horrify posterity i must make myself what i now am not receive me therefore for your soninlaw it will be more for the konotir of us all that it should be said that clorinia was avenged by her husband than by her fathers friend  both fattier and son accepted doridos proposal most willingly in fact it was very honourable towards them and very necessvy to prevent the disadvantageous reports which might be circulated respecting their misfortune the old man went
