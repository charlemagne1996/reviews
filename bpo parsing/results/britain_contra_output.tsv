B4896,['8662539'],  warp and woof or the reminiscences of doris tlttcher by holme lee 3 vols  smith elder  co from the pen of holme lee this book is a disappointment the warp and woof are woven into a web sad in colour and of a minute and monotonous pattern doris fletcher relates a series of misfortunes very erettily no doubt and intersperses her own istory with very just and true remarks on life in general and the relative positions of men and women iu particular but we do not want to iv ad for our amusement and relaxation a catalogue of calamities which happen to people every day and may happen to ourselves before we die for aught we know there is no use in studying the subject of ruined fortunes broken hearts crippled limbs povertyscandal illnature from those of our own household and resentment and faithlessness in those we love and trust the most it is all true enough that thee tilings do constantly happen in the world and will continue to happen as long as the world lasts but let us bide our time it will not make our own miseries less bitter to know that it is only the common lot of man and that after all other people have been quite as unfortunate as ourselves or that a fabulous doris fletcher has been through more than wo have and yet born it very patiently in taking up a novel we hope to forget our little personal griefs and wrongs for a time at least we wish to be taken out of ourselves and amused and cheered and not to have the melancholy fact thrust back upon us that no one is to be trusted that women are persecuted injured beings who are not allowed to earn even an honest livelihood that our purest motives and our most innocent actions are sure to be misinterpreted and misrepresented  and that in short we have only to do our best and prepare for the worst it may be all very true but it is dishearteniug doctrine to preach and more likely to enervate and enfeeble than to strengthen and encourage the youthful novelreader and elderly people do not require warning and as a rule never read melancholy books  they have had too many troubles of their own to take much interest in  doris fletcher or any other heroine of romance  but a good joke or a cheerftd anecdote would b  pleasant to them we begin the story ofthe fletchers by finding them bankrupt and ruined the father irritable and querulous the sons emigrating the mother heartbroken doris the daughter by the first wife mourning her lover who though true to her died just as he ought to have married her and made her happy ursula the eldest daughter of the present mrs fletcher is odious and unnatural and connie is rather a silly little beauty who is petted by every one except ursula and perfectly worshipped by her halfsister doris who only wishes to be to her  as a special providence that she may guard her from all the evils and temptations of this wicked world on finding themselves ruined the fletcher family retire to a small village on the seacoast called redcross where they fall in with the usual amount of elderly young ladies and widows and doctors and clergymens families and go to tiresome little teaparties and dorcas meetings and picnics c just as people always do in country villages doris is quiet and demure and takes pleasure in seeing connie happy but ursula is fine about it and is bored to death and gives herself airs and grows jealous of connie ursulas character is overdrawn and as must sometimes happen in autobiographies the narrator is very onesided in her views thus doris gives us to understand that ursula had not one good or pleasing quality in her she cannot move look or speak without being guilty of some mean or spiteful action whereas connie is just as incapable of having a fault or a failing in the eyes of doris at least it is another version of cinderella and the cruel sisters but it is not true to nature they are both commonplace women to be met with every day the one sweetened by beauty and affection the other soured by adversity and thc consciousness that she is not appreciated at home in spite of herself doris gives ursula some fine traits and it is a decided mistake to make her refuse a good offer of marriage for herself and yet pursue constance with such vindictive and relentless spite because she also has a lover very poor and very disagreeable whom she does wish to marry and whom we are distinctly told ursula certainly did not love herself yet no other reason would account for her dislike to her young sister or for the very strong measures she took to sever her from dr julius eden who was but a harsh suspicious man after all and not worthy of all the wretchedness and illhealth the little one bestowed upon his shortcomings as for doris she hates ursula fully as much as ursula hates connie and judges her quite as hardly and a more uncomfortable family party can scarcely be imagined and yet one sees how it might be true if it were not so exaggerated and so partially delineated ursula is at last determined to stand it no longer and takes a situation in a noblemans family in the neighbourhood where we are led  to suppose she has every discomfort under though sun only she is too proud to own the fact and chooses out of spite to say she is very happy as indeed she probably might have been if doris could have believed it possible being out herself ursula cannot rest till she hunts o  connie out as well and she accordingly finds a mrs tom claridge a forsaken wife who wishes for a nursery governess dr julius is furious because old mr fletcher will not consent to his marrying connie till he has enough to live upon and still more irate at ins future wife  being a governess and finally when connie hastily comes home having been insulted by mr tom claridge and gone through a scene with his jealous wifejust at the very moment when her fiance should have stepped forward and guarded her from all evil reports and unpleasant stories dr julius cuts her dead sends back her letters without a word and breaks off all communication with her family and only because she did not in a letter tell him the whole particulars of her leaving the claridge family so naturally enough redcross and ursula begin to  talk  and to suspect connie must be to blame connies illness and nervousness and despair and ursulas cruelty are all related at great length and with painful minuteness and though the quarrel is duly made up at the end of the book and ursula is forbidden the house of her brotherinlaw we cannot help thinking connie must have had rather a trying time of it with her hard uncompromising doctor then there is another mistakedoriss heart being supposed to be buried in the grave of her true lover she thinks she is justified in setting up a iifrimdna dangerous amusement  but we have some pages of reasoning upon the injustice of the world in not allowing men and women to be friends without being  talked about doris is very devoted to her friend an eccentric and maundering kind of man and she goes to see him and his old mother and he comes to see her and they tell each other everything till at last one day doris sees him walking with another elderly young lady a mutual friend to whom it seems he was once engaged many years before doris declares and protests she was not the least  in love with mr westmore and we suppose we are in duty bound to believe her yet why if he were a mere friend need she turn so faint and blind and dizzy that she stumbles over a precipice in going home and so becomes a cripple for life i never loved mr westmore she says as my friend i prized himand as my friend only the sting of it was that he would want me no longer since he had found his earliest and best sympathiser in the woman he had been attached to formerly some persons seem to think thero is no jealousy except in the passion of love but friends can be very resentful of an intruder between them it would be rather inconvenient however miss doris if all women were to take the marriages of their  friends and their friends onlyso very much to heart as not to be able to walk straight or to see their way home after hearing of them what are they to do when they are in love if this is a specimen of pure friendship  if though friend had been a miss westmore would doris have cared either doris is not true to herself or the story is grievously  out of

sir walter scott a mine of wealth and the rehabilitation of the heart of midlothian may be traced to the fortunate circumstance of his accidental purchase of the volume which contained that and several other kindred pamphlets of the day miss strickland follows somewhat in his footsteps in using up the  diurnalls  and merculries of the early period of the great parliamentary struggle with king charles for the supremacy but miss strickland tells a storya clever story it is true she does not write a novel her  lives of the queens of england anid her queens of scotland have so fixed the narrative style as her medium of communication with her readers that many of the scenes in  how will it end  instead of standing out in the boldness of a drama with the stir and pulse of life and a marked individuality of characterthe truest test of the novelists powerare but the representations of what the author has witnessed not the scene itself to which she wishes her reader to accompany her take for example this description of chester and its inns at the time of the opening scene of the tale lady woodville and her daughter the heroine of the story are on their way to westmoreland and have to pass through chester then one of the royalist strongholds the coach drove to the edgar then a very large imposinglooking inn but it was full to overflowing  to the bear and billet with no better success george lawton rode up to the coach wvindow and reverentially raising his cap to lady woodville said  madam your ladyship can have quiet comfortable quarters at the old pilgrims iun corner of st werburghs lane lady woodille though the widow of a distinguished cavalier commander was the daughter of a puritan family and strongly imbued with the prejudices implanted by her early training she turned pettishly away exclaimingg ii will have nought to do with saints pilgrims and papists  tat  my lady exclaimed george bluntly there are not many saints here i trow though belike a few papists but as for pilgrims they be clean out of date but there used to be a sort of them and the inn whereof i speak was built on purpose for them in the good old times it still bears the same name and is much frequented by the cheshire clergy which proves it is all right and its kept by jane tuffkyn a godly widow who goeth daily to early prayers in the cathedral with her maidens and the house goeth on all the better for it so with your leave my lady ill tell the coachman to drive you and my young lady there h old  said lady woodville are there none other inns in chester   two score and upwards ill warrant you my lady replied george who was himself a chester man  there is the golden falcon the pied bull the red dragon the black lion the pig and whistle the legs of man and many more but they are all full of the wild irish and welsh recruits  horrid outlandish papists who come to england to cut protestant throats  shrieked lady woodvilles maid margery sure my lady we are not going to shut up doors with the like  oh me my lady what is to become of us poor maidens ejaculated millicent hill altheas damsel but she was instantly silenced by her young mistress bidding her hold her peace and not increase their trouble by her folly then turning to lady woodville althea entreated her to permit them to proceed to the inn recommended by george lady woodville signified her consent by an ungracious inclination of her head and george gave the word to the coachman to proceed riding himself at the head of the horses to lead the way it was with difficulty they pierced the crowd that had gathered round the each during the stoppage caused by lady woodvilles dialogue with george it was marketday to and the country people who had brought their produce into chester for sale eagely beset the coach inspired with hopes of cusom boding up betches of carrots kail lee and ropes of onions and clamoously enfrjg th ladies to buy in a dialect wholly inteligble to them george lawton at length i i i succeeded in clearing a passage for the coach and it drew up before an antique house of entertainment with open galleries to the first floor supported by carved oaken pilasters surmounted by cornices or bargeboards whereon were represented in rude sculpture various episodes in the legendary history of saint werburga the fame of whose alleged miracles had during the mediaeval ages been the means of attracting crowds of pilgrims of all degrees to pay their votive offerings at her shrine those who are satisfied with the narrative instead of the dramatic novel may probably like miss stricklands delineation of character the language on the whole is smooth and the incidents possess considerable interest but the characters are simply marionettes and the voice of the showman becomes even when musical too monotonous to rivet the attention of the listener for the length of time during which the performance lasts lady woodville is the widow of sir lionel woodville a staunch royalist knight of lancefielci court in the county of salop althea their only chiid is heiress to large property but not being yet of age colonel briggs the puritan nephew of lady wvoodville is appointed by her mother as her guardian after quitting chester the ladies proceed northward but lady woodvilles illness increases so rapidly after crossing delamere forestwhere the party are stopped by clubmen or rustic banditti and rescued by major robert philipsonthat she is compelled for the time to make the little inn at churchtown garstang her home here she remains some days in anxious expectation of her  pious nephew bartholomew briggs of calgarth hall who with his sister mrs kezia briggs dwells there wielding much of the power of a courtbaron of feudal times but this briggs is an unmitigated scoundrel and holds calgarth against the rightful owner robert philipson another relative of the woodville family who possessing some of the beautiful islands in the lake of windermere upon the borders of which calgarth hall stands harasses the life of briggs by incessant raids and skirmishes until the colonel is obliged to keep the hall in a state of perpetual defence

briggs hurries althea to calgarth and crossima the lancaster sands in illadvised haste loses his way the coach in which althea is travelling suddenly becomes fixed in a bed of mud and water the postilions cut away the traces and the coachman sliding down from the box mounts a leader and is gone before colonel briggs is aware of his design this brave and pious gentlemanperceiving that there was no hope of extricatingr the coach from the channel into which it had sunk he opened the door and cried  step on the wheel and scramble up behind me on my horse take a hard grip of my belt sit firmly and i will try to save youif you will promise to become my wife  your wife  gasped althea time is too precious to waste in trifling said briggs  answer yes or no  no  cried althea vehemently i would rather die i stay where you are then perverse woman and sink to the depths of  the conclusion of his speech was lost in the burst of passion with which he turned away striking his spurs into his charger he rode off at furious speed never had the love of life throbbed so powerfully in altheas bosom as at that momentlife which one short hour previously she had regarded as a weariness and a burden too joyless to be borne she now made a last effort for her preservation by calling on antipope and the two footmen who were busily employed in detaching the three remaining horses from the coach to save her i  our horses will have enough to carry single replied antipope  every one for themselves  and goa for us all rejoined daniel the footman looking back compassionately on althea as he mounted if i could help you i would but this mare is a kicker and you could not keep your seat two minutes so you are safer where you are specially if you can climb to the roof of the coach and sit there coach will turn over when twaters rime observed the other if her time is not yet come the coach mat float like an ark and then shell take no harm said daniel farewell mistress i cried antipope who had now mounted you will have time to pray and if you heartily repent you of your sinful vanities grace may abound ay wrestle in prayer till your lamp be trimmed and mayhap it may burn brightly before the waters be upon you  said daniel  and may the lord have mercy upon your soul poor maiden   amen  amen  sobbed althea who with the sound of their retreating horses hoofs which fell like a knell upon her ear lost the last spark of hope and with hope departed the agonising desire of life which had a few moments previously impelled her to supplicate so piteously for aid the hard selfish

handicap has produced a story of vivid realism and grim humour concerning the lives of some avorkingmen who with himself were associated with a firm of house painters and decorators in a provincial town in the course of a aolume extending to nearly 400 pages he shows us the sordid lives of these men their opinions of other sections of humanity  their attitude towards politics in general and their views of socialism in particular we follow the author with interest as he faithfully records the hopes and fears that animate his comrades their fatalistic philosophy of life and their dull round of toil displayed in the avorkshop and by their relations with the  boss  and the foreman a zolaesque character nicknamed  old misery the struggle of the women is also depicted and thc tragedies

arrives home dispirited and tired to find the household budget disorganised hythe accumulation of debt resulting from his periods of enforced unemployment his avise has struggled hard and bravely but the crisis has mastered all the strategy of poverty and she explains to easton iioav matters stand he listens and then in ignorance rather than anger taxes her with carelessness and neglect  the woman did not reply at once she was bending down over the cradle arranging thc coverings which the restless movements of the child had disordered she was crying silently unnoticed by her husband  for months pastin fact ever since the child was born she had been existing without sufficient food if easton was unemployed they had to stint themselves so as to avoid getting further into debt than was absolutely necessary when he was working they had to go short iii order to pay avliat they owed but of what there was easton himself without knowing it always had the greater share if he was at work

robert trossalf housepainter and signwriter who recorded his criticism of the present scheme of things until weary of the struggle he slipped out of it and that her task has been merely to cut away superfluous matter and repetition she has not done either duty satisfactorily repetition has not only escaped her pruningknife but there is also at least one apparent hiatus which rightly or wrongly we have debited her avith in the interests of novel  readers to whom the subject is little known it ought we think to have been explained that the descriptions deal with men masters and conditions of work and life far below the average and we feel a measure of sympathy with the impatience that his fellowworkers expressed at the authors socialistic discourses there is a measure of truth in the latters contention that they are not informed as to the rootcause of poverty the nearest ave get to it is that it is the outcome of private monopoly today it is too much the fashion to shelter the individual behind the system it is at least open to question avhether if workers secured control there avould be safetysecurity of decent life and fair avagesin numbers alone and no one can be blamed for questioning also avhether the more educated vorkingman should not educate his felloavs better before the majority take control nevertheless ave commend this work to the sociologist and the politician alike  while the general reader will find its pages a document of compelling interest and tragic stress it is a book that by no means should be overlooked or ignored  the ragged trousered philanthropists by robert tressall grant richards 6s net although this socalled novel is said to be the work of a deceased socialistic housepainter we strongly suspect a dual authorship the story of the bitter struggle of the poor painters who work for a slavedriving firm is terribly realistic the complete knowledge of the miserable conditions under which they lived is certainly firsthand the dialogue is of the kind not likely to be overheard loose jests oaths and curses with a perpetual use of the forbidden word it is a painful and possibly only too true picture of labour under its worst conditions but the real purpose of the book cannot be mistaken it is merely the repetition of wornout attacks on christianity and the exploitation of an impossible and utopian scheme of socialism in the form of speeches and lectures put into the mouth of the painter owen in a style and manner quite different from the rest of the bookin fact a rather weak essay on socialism laboured into the rough and ready dialogues of the workmen this weak and obvious device whether the work of the original author or not tends to spoil a book which at least has the merit of giving a remarkable glimpse of conditions of life which call for urgent reformation,britain_contra

delivered out of affliction further than this we are told that the person of the poor should no more be respected than that of the rich should be honoured and while it is sinful to oppress and a duty to assist so also to the poor that will not hear rebuke their poverty is their destruction while the father gets more and more involved in chartist plots mary engages herself as an apprentice to a milliner in a little street leading off ardwick green and where she is seen and admired by harry carson son of the opulent millowner the interest of the rivalry of the workingengineer and the young

follows up one refusal by another and loses both lovers at the same time she is the more confirmed in her resolve in respect to henry carson as he intimated that his intentions had not at first been

B6991,"['8803684', '6658503']",  chun tikung his life and adventures chinese stories by claude a rees heinemannstories connected with china have appeared of late in considerable numbers and the adventures of individual chinamen have been described with more or less verisimilitude from almost every point of view though instances have it is true occurred in real life in which chinamen have married english wives the experiments have not been successful and so far as we are aware in every case the lady has met with bitter disappointment on her arrival in china though only known instance in which a wife of the english race has found chinese surroundings congenial to her is that of an australian lady who is now living in the neighbourhood of foochow in perfect contentment with her adopted country and her pigtailed husband in the work before us the hero who is the son of a coffin maker is adopted by a childless uncle holding the office of taotai and after passing the necessary examinations with exceptional distinction he is appointed secretary to the chinese legation in london while here although already married in china he falls desperately in love with a miss nellie serjeant who strange to say returns his affection the proposed match naturally arouses considerable opposition in the sergeant family but in the end love triumphs and miss sergeant becomes in due course the second mrs chun the rest of the story is not a pleasant one while chun makes every endeavour to prevent nellie from becoming aware of the existence of his first wife she goes through the various stages of disillusionment until her chinese rival forces her way into the room where she is prostrated with fever and denounces her as a usurper in the affections of her husband frenzied with grief and shame she carries her newly born infant to the neighbouring creek and plunges into the tide the story is told well and interestingly and considerable pains have evidently been taken to make the incidents conform as much as possible to chinese manners and customs to say that in all instances they do so would be to say that mr rees has performed a miracle so few foreigners have ever penetrated into the inner life of the chinese that it is not to be expected that in the present volume in spite of a considerable amount of local colouring there should be a minutely accurate picture of native domestic scenes but enough has been done to make the book readable and the plot plausible a marriage in china by mrs archibald little a e n bewicke white  co is not the first work on china that we owe to the pen of mrs little  my diary in a chinese farm which lately appeared contained her description of a summer residence in the neighbourhood of the gorges on the yangtsze spoken of in the present work  but compared with that book this volume is of a far more pretentious nature it is a novel of 312 closely printed pages the scene of which is laid in china and the author has brought her long experience of chinese life and manners to add colour to her subject to all those interested in cathay the book will be welcome  but it may be doubted whether  the general public  will be deeply stirred by it the characters are not drawn with sufficient vigour strength and distinctness to make them generally interesting and in the plot there is nothing to fix the attention or to excite sustained interest the hero mr fortescue is a consul in china who has made a companion of a young chinese girl by whom he has two children while temporarily severed from his social entanglements he visits england where he makes the acquaintance of a miss grey who is residing with her aunt at northampton for this young lady he forms an attachment and finding it hard to struggle against his feelings takes to flight in course of time miss grey is left alone by the death of her aunt and falling under the influence of a mrs betterton a lady missionary in china she goes to the  flowery land  to make converts and as events prove to meet mr fortescue at first he thinks it best to avoid her but circumstances being too strong for him he falls again under her influence and offers her marriage the offer is accepted and the story ends by the fortescues taking charge of the two eurasian children and by the marriage of their mother with a portuguese resident mr fortescue is represented as being highly intellectual a sceptic as far as christianity is concerned and with a strong leaning towards taoism probably his character is the one which the author has intended to draw with most distinctness but he is after all too shadowy to make a strong impression and his strange vagaries in moments of repent a0ce and selfreproach are too erratic to be natural to residents in china some of the scenes will be very familiar and it is even possible to identify several of the characters as real personages in fact the book reads like a narration of actual facts but it is somewhat wanting ing an tne english is not in every instance all that could be desired such phrases ashe could not help but know i wished it in the mouth of the heroine and  what we bring the girls we say we love to  are awkward and some descriptive passages would be better for revision for example in the account of the struggles of the boatmen in the heroines passage through the yangtsze rapids we meet with such a passage as the following 44 evidently the boat must have been caught by one of those sudden geysers that rise up unexpectedly in midyangtsze like a waterspout creating a new whirlpool for the moment whatever it was there was the boat below turning and worse  over now  four of them in a confused knot the fifth caught with his hands at the edge of the cliff then was jerked and flung down after the others the sixth just saved himself by lying sprawling on the road  the rest by giving way a little going back with the boat then tugging with might and main seemed getting the boat out of the whirlpool when the towline gave and they were all thrown forward on their faces against the cliff the picture of life in china which the author draws is not an attractive one and we would fain hope that the climate on the yangtsze is not so unfavourable to european life that the mobs are not quite so aggressive and that the missionaries are not so unfavourably placed as she represents them chinchinjvaby charles hannan frgs constable  co is a volume of short stories two of which are chinese three indian and the remaining three european they are extremely light and as far as they go are well and amusingly told when looking abroad for his inspirations the author has not troubled himself over much to make acquaintance with the manners and customs of the people of whom he writes and probably he would consider such a study superfluous the book is of a kind that might while away the tedium of a railway journey or help to relieve the monotony of a sick room but it would seem to require the environment of boredom to make it really acceptable there is little that is new in the situations which are described and the stories want point and finish  chun tikung his life and

for comparison with chun tikung the tale of a model young chinaman whether however the description of chinese life and manners which is the object of the book will prove as acceptable or enduring as

picturesque largehearted writer so sane and virile is he so bent upon getting the maximum of interest out of every tale he tells that after all is his chief virtue his power of extracting the vital essences of a romance many modern novelists are so prone to give the story the goby and fasten rather on character jokai drives both along together the period of pretty michal is the latter half of the seventeenth century and the scene is laid principally at kassa the eily for which as it happens jokai sits as a member of the hungarian diet broadly tue story may be considered true the novelist at any rate found the skeleton of it among the citys archives the pivot of the book is the old hungarian marriage laws which were so strict as often to come into the most poignant conflict with nature

with peril from robbers henry and michal reach the headsmans house michal is put to bed and a terrible scene takes place between father and son recalling a somewhat similar situation in weir of hermiston but going far beyond it in grimness the father is enraged at his sons desertion and condemnation of him and accusing him of obtaining his wife by illicit means sentences henry to instant death this is part of the old mans speech   then you think it belongs to the eternal fitness of things that your father should be a headsman while you are a curer of souls that when you are dispensing

cast in the mould of  lady audley their popularity within certain circles was unquestionable the result of course was that there were soon many imitators who according to the law of their existence copied and intensely exaggerated only the faults of their leader indeed it may not be just to render miss braddon responsible for halfadozen lady novelists whose erotic flights and vagaries were so offensive as to generate a healthy existing reaction against either the hoydens or the matrons who were best fitted to herd with the unclean rabble at the heel of comus they have been put to silence if not to shame for some time to give mfiss braddon her due she is as wide as the poles asunder from this tribe her books never contain the pestiferous poison and mischief to be found in the debilitating atno sphere of the passionate school in which morality is only acknowledged in order to give a zest and a flavour to the violation of its precepts and still the early braddons dealt with topics fraught with peril to a writer we do not assert that in her variations upon murder and bigamy miss braddon has exhibited an ethical cultivation of the most exalted and sensitive quality but what we mean is that her coarseness where she is coarse is obvious and not malignant or infectious while the coarseness of the boorish sisterhood smacks of the paint the tunic and the tambourine of the gleewomen who hung upon the skirts of camps to amuse the soldiers and rob the dead in the middle ages we must give miss braddon credit for versatility as well as fecundity she has effected a change of front in the presence of her enemies the assaults of many critics all direeted at a single point appear to have told in the end we shall not repeat the old cant about sensation of which as far as miss braddon is concerned quite enough has been said miss braddon at any rate has attempted a new departure in novelwriting she has to a great extent abandoned the dagger and the bowl closed up wells for drowniu detrimentals and generally speaking has washed her hands of gore and offers to entertain the public without limelight or bluefire the effort deserves to e commondled no matter what may be the consequence of it in thi first place it is not easy to move out of an accustomed groove for miss braddon to float a novel without her conventional 1 corks  for the purpose must have been a hard intellectual task she must have been often tempted to summon to her aid the valuable detective or the unscrupulous blonde but the exigencies of her conversion necessitate a total abstinence from both constables anl furies with tow lhair then agan she has a perfect legion of competitors to contend against in her adloptled sphere the quiet novel is coming into vstie again we do not intend to

us that our authors 1 not content with competing with the small frv of roma2 cits she has clearly a loftier ambition it is not for us to place bounds to her possible future achievements we can only pronounce upon the evidence before us lost for love is as novels go a good novel it can be read without weariness and it is for the most part free from those strat3gems for winning attention which are so broad and patent as to be irritating to any adult intelligence then it is a thoroughly businesslike production it is admirably made in the sense in which we remark upon the structure of a pudding or the thames embankment there is little or no stuffing in it no beating about thie bush the story moves with a clockwork precision indicative of the skill with which it has been put together but then it is a poor story a trite thin story the musicalbox perfect as it is only gives us an exceedingly commonplace tune it is an idle job to go through it as it is to spend hours over any printed book which serves no purpose but to produce an incomplete distraction from personal reverie and which never arrests us with a scrap of food for reflection or a passage of writings bright and beautiful because of its wit its wisdom or its fancy yet we suspect that  lost for love will prove popular it is not loaded with scenes or adventures but it has enough of both to prevent it froin stagnating the most distinctly and emphatically drawn person in the book is an old woman who keeps a secondhand clothes shop we confess however that the allusions to tripe and onions and kindred culinary delicacies connected with the domestic arrangements of this establishment seem to us to impart an uncomfortable aroma to the whole story mr dickens and others have or are supposed to have succeedel in bestowing a genial and approving concern upon the frying of sausages and the consumption of muffins but our friendly suggestion to miss braddon would be never to allow a heroine within a mile of a yarmouth bloater people not at all sqeamish are not comfortable where cheese is prepared for toast instead of the mousetrap for the rest we can only repeat that lost for love is a sound lump of a novel which might have been written simultaneously with two or three others miss braddon could employ in full swing halfadozen assistants she has acquired a dexterity il her profession which demands admiration if not respect she has her recipes for exciting the emotions of deficiently instructed natures this gives her a wide range a range she has not yet compassed an audience vast enough to be pathetically impressive even when we contemplate it in imagination novels such as  lost for love are as ephemeral as confectionery and miss braddon earns our gratitude by using nothing deleterious in the composition of her later wvares,britain_contra

has she like bllwer abjured fiction  or does she desire to exhibit the inexhaustible fertility of the invention that could permit of the dismissal of a score or so of characters in the shape of brief

preacher teacher mamma or papawho dares not indulge in their perusal save by stealth at early mornings before the family is stirring or with shaded candle in the bedchamber when others are sleeping is it calculatel that the substance of a novel without the name might be acceptable to this great class and that sketches of english life might be placed upon tables from which an avowed fiction would be indignantly banished such might be a legitimate speculation with such views the publication before us may be a prudent matter of business but for the general readerfor the attraction of the authoresss

humorous story is a sum of twenty thousand pounds it illustrates how in the development of fictitious literature the character of the hero changes with that of the society which produces and admires him the hero of romance began his career well he was a head taller than his neighbours and had double teeth all round  for in the  struggle for life  he should always promise to be the  strongest struggler  to use the high scientific phraseology which a great novelist is just now making fashionable in the drawingrooms where it is necessary to discuss even novels in their relation to  protoplasm  and the  evolution hypothesis  the gianthero had it all his own way for a long time till some innovatorwayland smith perhapscame and invented for his special vexation all sorts of weapons and armour  cormorans  muscles then had to give way to jacks missiles and a few extra inches were found as deceptive as signs of any superior fitness for  surviving as the other endowment of extra grinders this  fitness  had now to be indicated by qualities of a more spiritual kind such as courage and cunning so our friend who had started in life as the jackdevouring giant now became little jack himself who by his wiles inveigles his stupid foe into becoming his own destroyer this went on till with advancing civilisation craft itself was found to be of not much account without what the lawyers call with fine emphasis  real property the heros peculiar fitness for surviving was now shown by his castles his lauds and the serfs who clothed them but society gradually became more complex and more knowing still and though wealth was recognised even more than ever as the indubitable sign of power it was found that castles and acres were not such indubitable signs of wealth as they had been for even acres may be seized and sucked dry by the devilfish foreclosureeven castles may and do succumb to the bumbailiff a far surer sign of heroic wealth therefore was found to be hard cash hence the first thing the novelist told the reader about his hero was the exact  sum tottle  at his bankers but even further mutations were in store for the hero and here again  evolution can explain them all  it is the great law of history says  drawingroom  science that the individual becomes more and more lost merged in society that in other words the role of the hero is in fact played out but the fictionist has thereby been merely driven to seek and find a higher and nobler hero still he is no longer the owner of the balance at the bankers he is the balance itself man the individualhis personality quite washed out of himis no longer fit for herohood instead of the strongest  struggler for life being as heretofore the hero of the novel the very principle of life itself in its most tangible embodimentthat is to say gold takes that place for though the scientific drawingrooms have decided that the physical basis of life is protoplasmprotoplasm is of course only the high philosophical word for money gold as the representative of all the good things upon which life must be continually drawing or dieis in the best sense the essence of all these good things and money has at last very properly come to be the allconquering hero of the storyteller as a lump of dough is thrown among the struggling bleaks in a river a certain sum of moneyten thousand pounds say representing ten thousand half ounces of lifeis thrown by the novelist among the human strugglers in the waters of his mimic world and he very properly takes far more care to interest us in the adventures of the bait which is being bobbed at than in the characters of the fish that bob this capital story of mr robinsons for instance might very well be called  the surprising adventures of twenty thousand pounds mabel westbrook an american young lady has come to england to redeem a solemn promise made to her grandfather on his deathbed that she would find out a certain family j named

has learned that the fraud in question was committed by his grandfather the very man to whom the restitution money is to be given then follow the bobbings for the twenty thousand pounds by the selfish characters of the story and the bobbings to avoid it by brian and mabel each of which is a strongly marked and living character and the adventures of the money its escapes and final triumphs make up three volumes of very amusing and often highly humorous reading though damaged evidently by being written for a magazine the story is well constructed but when a novelist has once a week to leave his hero or heroine confronted by some dire catastrophe it is hard to weave out of such materials a web that is not as fantastic as those nightmare tapestries that they say the  ogress dyspepsia  weaves for us after a lobster supper we remember being told long ago by a chubby kitchenmaid whom we discovered reading her bulwer at her sink that her idea of a really good story was that there should be a beautiful young gentleman in it and that he should be murdered suicided and married so as every think comes right in the end but when we asked this critic of a past generation how many times her hero ought to undergo these little experiences she laughed and said that once was enough for one11 now however thanks to the requirements of the weekly magazines the hero has to be  murdered suicided and married as part of his daily routine for unless lady mary upstairs or chubby mary at the sink puts down your story at some thrilling agonypoint why should they after the intervention of a busy week of balls and routs and dishwashings greatly care to take it up when they might just as easily and with more comfort to their souls be following in the same journal the triumphs of heroes more triumphant the afflictions of heroines more afflictedone of whom let us say is just doing his first murder hurling his ugly rival from the car of his own private balloon while another is doing his first suicide and is being just dived for perhaps by some heroic  johnson  from london bridge  while a third is just doing her third and last marriage and murder together exclaiming  thy blood be upon thine own head villain  as she leaves her seducer  weltering in his gore at the altars foot whom she has just pistolled with a beautifullyjewelled revolver no bigger than the lilyhand which held it the wise novelist bears these high requisites of his art well in mind and always contrives to keep a murder a marriage or a suicide running but here is the disadvantage of this latest development of narrative art when the artist comes to garner in his agonypoints in the accustomed three volumes his story is all agonypoints and a story consisting entirely of agonypoint3 makes a compound as indigestible even by the fine assimilative powers of mary herself as was the plum pudding all plums which little praying jacky  in the story prayed fora square foot of which he was only too willing at last to give to his wicked unpraying brother for a square inch of plain norfolk dumpling thus is the art of fiction progressing every day,britain_contra

arrowsmith 3s 6d tn this brief novel scarcely half the length of his more important works mr phillpotts has accomplished a curious and very interesting reversal of customary precedence as one reads the book one is more and more impressed by the fact that in the authors mind the good red earth loomed vast lovely and tragicinfinitely paramount while humanity inconsiderable and transient crept like insects over that immense bosom the story is first the story of the great apple orchards that lie between dartmoor and the sea of the lanes and hedgerows and the distant peaks of the moor and second it is a sort of fairy tale about men and women who lived in a village by compton castle fifty years ago mr phillpotts has deliberately emphasised the comparative unimportance of his characters in the general scheme when approaching an apple tree he becomes realistic austere and passionate faithful always to the most minute observation and to a singularly lofty conception of nature on the other hand his human characters move in a plot which if shapely and even exciting is conventional and pretty comprising as it does hidden hoards missing documents cabinets with secret recesses and mysteries of birth these mere people under the apple trees have the individuality and the quaint charm which mr phillpotts invariably puts into his rustics but he has obviously not attempted in their regard anything more than a quiet recital or to change the figure a daisychain of events here is a charming glimpse of his lovers then the boy rose and went home to his mother while the girl walked without speech beside him in the gloaming through dim vernal lanes by grassy hedgerows and the dewy cradles of spring flowers all the deep feeling the synthetic breadth of view and the dignity of an elaborate prose style are reserved for the good red earth and the flower and fruit thereof the sentience of growing trees this ia really what preoccupies mr phillpotts in the present book to him they are organisms consciously fulfilling a destiny in which beauty and usefulness have an equal share the procession of the seasons is a drama for him compact of obscure but profound significances we cannot quote an extract to illustrate exactly what we mean the spirit which we detect pervades the whole book without anywhere appearing salient but as a specimen of mr phillpottss treatment of the overshadowing earth we will give part of his long description of  the glory of the orchards  a notable pagan atmosphere marked the moment pomona moved invisible under the uplifted boughs while each gnarled and crooked branch whose fruit was nested in grey lichens each spray of younger wood that bent with graceful bow earthward under bossy weight of its coral and amber and orange streaked harvest made obeisance to the goddess every tree seemed at once a pillar of the temple and a worshipper therein the great orchard swam away into distance with all its mellow harmonics it retreated and faded and covered itself with haze until all the mingled colours merged into a cloth of pale gold laid upon the shoulders of the hills above silver stubbles were vanishing under the ploughs of the husbandmen red furrows ascended to the sky line and grain hidden there already felt the thrill of earth and waited only for the rain to pulse an answer boots swelled to their round maturity oak and beech scattered their harvests every hedgerow and dingle every river valley and forest dell teamed with their proper treasure of berries black and red of seeds that fell and down that floated of aigrettes and tassels and cup and cones all brimming with the store and profit of the year hidden in the lap of the mother the birds eyes brightened and the squirrel and the red mouse gloried in their garners under ten thousand apple trees and over miles of ruddy land man plucked or dug his produce with gladness hope reigned triumphant for the fleeting moment beneath this sunlit hour the cares and fears of husbandry were forgotten and the very echo of the coopers mallet on the cider barrel rang merry rather than melancholy for it chimed with the shout and laughter of happy children how far on

a volume the first story is a gem as perfect in its kind as anything he has written to read it is to feel at once aggrieved it was not ours long ago and delighted it has been kept back for our present enjoyment it is not easy to be grateful for the two others  the house on the beach  is dudl and improbable the case of general ople is rather funny but it is a hobbledeboy farce both are extreme instances of mr merediths habit in which only carlyle surpassed him of riding a joke to death tinmans wine that undermined the health of his guests is a wornout joke on its first appearance but it is served up again and again and again till the harmfulness of the wretched vintage actually tells on us who never once st at the rascals table so with lady campers lessons to general ople on the english language only grace prevents us adopting with vehement affection every one of the generals vulgarisms the extreme imurobability of the same ladys marvellous powers of draughtmanship is a minor sin but the improbability in the second story is vital a girl of intelligence and refinement will be ready to marry many kinds of villains but not a villain who is at once a patent fool and a pettifogger in rascality it is pleasanter to talk of chloe the first story begins in a tone of gentle satire with quaint reflections on amorous dukes in general and a particular description from his own lips of the early matri ithe tale of chloe the house on the beach the cam of general ople and lady camper by george meredith ward lock and bowden  mnonial delights of the elderly duke who married the milkmaid and who loving her to distraction has been persuaded to expose her to the perils of the wells that she may have the amusement she craves and the experience she lacks d a term approaches when the

cannot be done without repose i settle myself and i receive a worsted ball in my lace and i am expected to return it i comply and then you would say a nursery in arms the story never loses the tone of highbred comedy save when it takes you behind the scenes with chloe chloe who had given fortune and family and all for love and missed it she is one of mr merediths chosen ladies very loving muchenduring smiling for all her wounds gentle decorous distinguished the advent of the milkmaid duchess is almost simultaneous with the return of her faithless lover and hope for a little while mates with the love still warm in her breast but with the acuteness of sincerity she soon sees she is being duped and that the death of her own hope is not the only calamity in sight the duchess in all the selfishness of her youth and her newlyfound excitement is blind to danger will give up her duke and ruin herself recklessly so chloe chooses death in such a form that a ghastly sight may meet the eyes of the headstrong young woman at the moment when she proposes to make her rash elopement chloes plan does not fail the shock the stir the horror bring the duchess to her senses she goes back willingly to her duke sick of love in some cases where mr meredith has accepted a suggestion from history or traditionand we take for granted this is one of themfacts have proved stubborn things to deal with

B2302,['5077249'],  chinese novels translated from the originals to which are added pro  verbs and moral maxiws collected from their classical books and other sources the ivhofc prefaced by observations on the language and lite j rature of china rfo by john francis davis frs 8vo pp 250 london 1822 until the embassy of lord macartney to china an imperfect translation of a novel was the only specimen of chinese literature for which we had to thank our countrymen and we were in the utmost ignorance respecting a people with whom our commercial dealings were immense that embassy howml  ever cleared away much of the obscu mi rity which involved the subject not merely through the personal observations of those who composed it but also by its more remote tendency to awaken a general curiosityandadesireto know something concerning so singular a people since that time chinese literature has received considerable attention the penal code of china has been translated other illustrations of chinese manners and chinese literature have been made known to us by the labours of sir george staunton and dr morrison and now mr davis by his translation of a few chinese novels and proverbs has enabled us to become still better acquainted with the subject these novels are prefaced by a brief but interesting notice of the language and literature of china  the chinese says mr davis value themselves not a little on the mere antiquity of their literature and are disposed to look down with great contempt on the learning of all other nations they have some books such as the yeking which are not now intelligible without a verbal comment to natives themselves if that may be applied to a nation which is told of an individual they may be compared to the man who wept in his old age because e could not comprehend the productions of his youth  but if we should be inclined lo laugh at them on this score they may still assume grounds of superiority over us ith as much right at least as he who proudly said to his audience  gentlemen i have forgotten more than you ever knew  a student of chinese should be somewhat acquainted with these books because there are frequent allusions to them in modern writings but to confine himself exclusively to them appears to be a downright loss of time there are many excellent works of a later date which may not only serve as better models of the style of the present day but likewise convey far more information with regard to the present state of the empire and the character of the people and as has been before observed multitudes of amusing dramas and novels from which may be selected much curious matter what we now want is a little practical know ledge of chinese literature instead of speculative dissertations on the nature ofthe language this volume contains three novels entitled  the shadow in the water c the twin sisters and the  three dedicated chambers they are all much too long for our insertion but we shall take the commencement of the second novel  the twin sisters which will afford a good specimen of the general style of these tales  early in the reign of an emperor of the ming dynasty there dwelt in a city of the province of hookwang a merchant named siaoukiang who had the misfortune to live on very indifferent terms with his wife they were for a long while without any family until after a lapse of many years two daughters twins were born to them it is a popular remark that sons generally resemble the father and daughters though motlier but these two sisters contrary to what is usum ally the case did not inherit the features of either of theil parents and they seemed like the children of some other family neither was the difference confined to their persons for their dispositions were quite as dissimilar as the father and mother wore extremely plain and very stupid so on the contrary the daughters were very handsome and particularly clever after ten years of age they began to resemble fair flowers glittering with dew or fragrant herbs agitated by the breeze  and their beauty every day increased until having reached the age of fourteen or fifteen no one could behold them without emotion not only were the young men in love with them but even those ofa more advanced age when they beheld  aaa confessed the power of their chara 4 their dispositions were extremely docile but notwithstanding this they lia i loamed but little and the xvhole extent of their knowledge xvas confined to figures as to though use of the needle and other female accomplishments they needed but little instruction in order to acquire them their dress and ornaments were from their station in life coarse and ordinary but vet when these txvo girls were compared xvith the daughters of more wealthy   their father beni a mcichautd and dignified persons it was allowed by all that they need not change their homely dress and metal ornaments for the silks and jewek of the others  as they were so very handsome and engaging it naturally followed that the young men of fortune and family should seek them  the good man and his dame were more like enemies than husband and wif the former wanted to marry his daughters without the interference ofthe latter and his wife on the other hand wished to obtain two scnsinlaw without the know ledge of her husband with this principle of mutual deceit they each of them secretly engaged with their sepaiate friends  though the father was severe in his own house he was naturally of a kind and friendly disposition  not like his wife whose turbulence led her when provoked to make the neighbourhood ring with her violence people therefore said to themselves that it would be an easier thing to dupe him than her aid that of the two it was better to aid the wife than the husband hence it was that the latter was more successful in her adherents than the former and after a little while for each of her daughters a husband was selected a fortunate day wtas chosen for the marriage and they the bridegrooms were desired to send the wedding presents  but with a view to prevent her husbands disapprobation and rejection of the match he was kept in ignorance of the whole  there were some sensible persons who said that the propriety of a daughters marriage ought to be determined by the father and that if the mother would not consent the matter should be referred to the magistrate who would neversule with an obstinate woman nor put add the husband for the sake of favouring the wife these persons wanted to get somebody to make their proposals to the former hut unfortunately all those whom they asked proved to be as ready to deceive him as they were afraid of his wife and when inmr  vited to act against her they immediately made some pretext for declining they dared not to incur her resentment saying that if they offended the husband they had nothing to do but tt wait irntd he broke out and then reason with him  and if he was violent they might still go and complain to the magistrate but if they offended his wife and her anger was excited it was not fit for them to contend with a woman  and should she abuse and even chastise them they must bear it and could do nothing in return  thus it was that no one would consent to assist those who wished to make proposals to the good man and they were accordingly obligt d to open the subject to him in person isle had been very much nettled at seeing people in the first inst ince go to his wife without coming t consult him and therefore on the present occasion when the marriage of his daughters was proposed to him he echoed ln consent vdth great satisfaction and made not the slightest obj dion  lio suitors told him that every one was afraid of his wife and tiiat for this reason none would act as mediators what therefore was to bo done isle replied  when the parties are unknoxvn to each other it is necessary to make use of snell agents  but when 1 have already

that the error was accompanied by atl the noble characteristics which distinguish our country we will not affirm that a few of these companies were not formed for the purposes and uses exhibited in their prospectuses among a many surely some must be honest but we candidly and firmly state our opinion when we observe that the majority of these stock associations c were invented for the sole purpose of keelping alive a spirit of speclation and peculation which was at once individually dishonest and nationally degrading unnatural value was attached to these baubles men became intoxicated with the prospect of immediate gain legitimate sources of wealth were neglected and an i universal mania seized like a pestilence the trading commonalities of this nation many sehemnes exceeded it absurdity even their i famous predecessors of a century ago and t highsounding nonsense and elaborately  displayed advantages were sanctioned by l names and brought into the market by men  who have since shrunk from their share of  guilt and felt for the first time the know h ledge of a stain on their escutcheon recent1 events completely substantiate our present l oberations and the bereaved now

proof but his zeal in defending any other company save that to which he belonged must bte considered intemperate and injudicious  rwe shall now turn with pleasure to the i contents of this volume whicl is replete with interest the author was at edinburgh in the corps of engineers when it wvas proposed to him to take charge of an association the object of which was to work the gold and silver mines of the provinces of rio de la plata he accepted the offer and after a few days notice sailed from falmouth and eventually landed at buenos airs accompanied by two highlyrespectable captains of the cornish mines a french assayer who had been brought up by the celebrated vauquelin a surveyor and three miners i proceeded across the great plains of the pampas to the gold mines of san luis anrd from thence to the silver mines of uspallata which are beyond mendoza about a thousand miles from buenos aires  i then left my party at mendoza and from the mines i rode back again to buenos aires by myself performing the distance in eight days i there unexpectedly received letters which made it necessary for me to go immediately to chili and i accordingly again crossed the pampas and joining my party at mendoza we went over the andes to san  tiago and from thence without any delay we went together in different directions about twelve hundred miles to inspect gold and silver mines and on the night that i con eluded my report on the last mine we again set off to recross the cordillera and leaving my party in the plains i rode across the pampas to buenos aires and as soon as i arrived there i dismissed a proportion of r the miners and returned with the rest to  england 4 the sole object of my journeys was to  inspect certain mines we scent to the bottom of thein all and assisted by the indivi l duals who accompanied ine i made to the  best of my ability a circumstantial report on r each as the miners were remaining idle i and without employment at buenos aires it t was highlydesirable that i should go from c placeto place as rapidly as possible and for c upwards of six thousand miles i can truly t declare that i was riding against time f in these long and fatiguing journeysi captain head made many remarks which i are distinguished for excellent sense and i acute observation and throughout the work b there is perceivable a liveliness of spirit without which our author would not we so deem have been able to overcome those obstacles he afterwards so successfully spurnt ed we shall extract roughly and first r give the authors account of the state of religion in the countries he visited the religion which is professed throughout the provinces of rio de la plata is the roman catholic but it is very different in l different places during the reign of the spaniards the monks and priests lead every i where very great influence and the dimensions of the churches at buenos aires lucan i iendoza c show the power and riches l they possessed and the greedy ambition l which governed them it is a sad picture to see a number of small wretchedlooking huts surrounding a church whose haughty elevation is altogether inapplicable to the humility of the christian religion and one cannot help comparing it with the quiet village church of eugland whose exterior and interior tends rather to humble the feelings of the arrogant and proud while to the peasant it has the cheerful appearance of his own home when it is considered that the churches in south america were principally built for the conversion of the indians to the christa faith it is melancholy to think that the priests should have attempted by the pomp of their temples and by the mummery of candles and pictures and images to have done what by reason and kindness and humility would surely have been better performed but itheir secret object was to extort money and as it is always easier to attract a crowd of people by bad passions than by good they therefore made their temples as attractive as possible and men were called to see and to admire instead of to listen and to relents  the power of the priest and monks has changed very much since the revolution at buenos aires most of the convents have been suppressed and the general wish of almost all parties is to suppress the remainder oc casionally an old mendicant friar is seen dressed in grey sackcloth and covered with dirt but as he walks through the street looking on the ground his emaciated cheek and sunken eye show that his power is crush ed and his influence gone the churches have lost their plate the candles are yellow the pictures are bad and the images are dressed in coarse english cotton on great days the ladies of buenos aires dressed in their best clothes are seen going to church followed by a black child in yellow or green livery who carries in bis arms an english hearthrug always of the most brilliant w lours on which the lady kneels with the black child behind her but generaliy the churches are deserted cnd nobody is to be seen in them but a decrepit old woman or tvo vhisperingr into tile 11hink s of the confesxional box the sad conm1eqence of all thil j that at buenos aires thlere is very little rlcbqion at all at mendoza there are several ljewoile who wkih to 1tit dlown the priests  still however they have evidently cotosider able powver o once a year thle men and1 women are called upon to live for nine lays ih a sort of barrack which as a reat favour 1 was llowel to visit it is filled with little cells and the men anid women at diffierent times are literally shut up1 ill tlhese holes to fast and whilp themselves i asked sueveral peopi1e seriously whether this punishment was lwnidth perforined and they assured me thwart most of them whipped themselves till they brought blood one day ii was talking very earnestly to a person at mleloza at th1e hotel when a poorlookilln monk arrived with a little imagye surro anded w ith flowers  thi s imagte my friend was obliced to kiss an the monk then took it to every individluall in tile hotelto thle landlord lis servants adell ven to the black cook who all kissed it id fl tien of course paidl for the hlonour the cook gave the monik two eggs with the suprenacy of the spaniards it seems the infltuence of the priesthood lhas likewise vanished this is but natural  political tyranny is usually allied to intolerant bigotry anrd when they sunler the extinetioll of both is nigh at hrandl the method of travelling pursued by captain iead was aiventurous and hardy in riding across the pampas it is generally the custom to take an attendalt and yople often wait to acconmpany some carriage or else if they are in condition ride with the courier who gets to mnendloza in twelve or thirteen days in case travellers svisti to carry a bed and two smtill portnallnteaus they are lacedl pon oine horse nni hi ie either driven on before or by a halter tied to the postillions saddle tle most independent way of travrellingl is without bavgacre and without an attendnt in this case the traveller starts fromn butienos aires or tmendoza with a postillion who is clanged at every post lie has to i swiddle his own horses and to sleep at nplit upon the grounl on his saddle and as lie is rnable to carry anv irovsorns hie imust thiiow himself comipletely on the fee1ble resources of j the country and live onl little else thaii beef i a nl water i it is of course a biard life but it is so delihtfully independent and1 if one is in good riding condition so rapid a mode of travelling that i twice chose it and would always refer it but i recommend no one to attempt it lhss ie is itl irgod lieuti and conilition £ when i first crosscl the pampas i went wvith a carriarre and althionul i had been accistomed to riling all my life i could not at all ride wvith the peoris ind after glloppino five or six hours wlats obliged to get into the carriage buit after i had been riding for three or four months and lhad lived tipon beef and water i found myself in a condition wlhichi i i a11 only describe by saying that i felt no exertionl coullld kill 1me altliowhi i coistandtiy arrived so completely exhausted that i could not spieak yet a few hours sleep urpon my saddle on the ground alwvays so completely restored me that for a week i could laily be upon imy horse before sunrise cotl1 ride till two or three hours after sunset and have really tired ten and twelve horses a lay this will ciilairi the immllelne distances whichi leoile in south america are said to ride which i am confident could only be done on beef and wvater9 we quite agree with the authors remark that a man must be  in good health and conlition whilst perfornwin a task like this and we colngratulate hlim on the gifts of llygeia

tries to dodge and escape fiomi him for tile child turns with hsiml and always keeps close to him and it is a curious tact which i have often observed that a m1ounited horse is always able to overtake

purchase of them it happened that i had nothing but a quantity of fourdollar gold pieces and althotuh thevy were current all ov7er south america i found to my very great astonishment that no one here would tako them in vain i assured them of thtir v tnlie blit these poor people accus  i i i tomed to change gold for silver all shock their fingers in my face and in differenlt voices exclaimed  no vale niada  gold is nodegti nothing and amongr such wild 1lnountajin the great moral truth of their assertioii rushed very forcibly into my mind i i offered them the piece of four iollars for what they only asked two and three dollars but they would not take it and we had hardly silver enough among us to remunerate our landlord for the board and lodging whijh he had afforded us one of the greatest enemies to horsemnan shill is thle biscacho of which the captain gives the subsequent account the biscacho is found all over the plains of the pampas like rabbits they live ill holes wbich are in groups in every direction and which make gallopping over these plains very dangerous the manner however in which the horses recover themselves when the ground over these subterranean galleries gives way is quite extraordinary in gallopping after the ostriches my horse has constantly broken in sometimes with a hind le and sometimes wvith a fore one le has even come down on his nose and yet recovered however the gauchos occasionally meet with very serious accidents i have often wonlere1 how the wvild horses could gallop about as they do in the dark but i really believe they avoid the holes by smelling them for ini riding across the country when it has been so dark th1at i positively could not see my horses ears i have constantly felt hin il his gallop start a foot or two to the riglht or left as if he had trod upon a scrpent which i conceive was to avoil one of these holes yet the horses do very often fall and certainly in the few months i was in the panpas i got more falls than i ever before had tlhough in the habit of riding all my life the gyauchos are occasionally killed by these biscachos and often break a limb atgain  these aninals are never to be seen in thte dav but as soon as the lower litnb of the sun reaches the horizons they are seen issuing from their holes in all directions which are scattered in groups like little villages all over the pampas the biscachos when full grown are nearly as large as badogers but thleir bleadl resemheles a rabbit excepting that thtey have very larre bushy whiskers in the evening they sit outside theirlholes an they all appear to be moralising they aie the most seriouslooking animals i ever saw and even the younc ones are greyheaded have mustachlios and look thouightful and grave in thle laytime their holes are always guardedl by two little owls who are never an instant away from their lost as one gallops by these owls they always stand looking at thie strangrer and then at each other moving their oldfashioned heads in a manner hljiclh is quite ridiculous until one rushes by them when fear gets the better of their dignified looks and they both run into the biscachos hole in a country thus perforated the danger is of course the greater we are in consequence more surprised at the excessive speed with which long journeys are performied the fear of man inherent in animals although of the most ferocious description is thus exenmthe fear which all wild animals in america have of mnan is very singularly seen in the pampas i often rode towards the ostriches and gamas crouching under the opposite side of mly horses neck but i always found that although they would allow any loose horse to approach them they even wshen young ran from me though little of my figure was visible and when one saw them all enjoying themselves in such full liberty it was at first not pleasing to observe that ones appearance was every where a signal to them that they should fly from their enemy yet it is by this fear that  man hath dominion over the beasts of the field and there is no animal in south america that does not acknowledge this instinctive feeling as a singular proof of the above and of the difference between the wild beasts of america and of the old world i will venture to relate a circuinstance which a man sincerely assured me had happened to hinm in south america  he was trying to shoot some wilds ducks and in order to approach them unperceived he put the corner of his poncho which is a sort of long narrow blanket over his head and crawling along the ground upon his hands and kness the poncho not only covered his body but trailed along the ground behind him as he was thus creeping by a large bush of reeds lhe heard a loud sudden noise between a bark and a roar hie felt something heavy strike his feet and instantly junmping up lie saw to his astonishment a large male lion actually standing on his poncho and perhaps the animal was equally astonished to find himself in the immediate presence of so athletica man the man told me he was unwilling to fire as his gun was loaded with very small shot and he therefore stood his ground and the lion stood on his poncho for many seconds at last he turned his head and walking very slowly away about ten yards he stopped and turned again the man still stood his ground upon which the lion tacitly acknowledged his supremacy and walked of the mules are another useful race the services of which our author in more than one instance experienced isle relates several occurrences of their obstinacy somewhat ludicrous in one of whichthe mule is excited by a draught of brandyand thrashed into speed by the application of a dead horses leg rather a novel weapon of castigation we shall close our present extracts with the following incident which occurred whilst our author was proceeding through one of thle worst passes of the celebrated great cordillera as soon as the leading mule came to the commencement of the pass he stopped eidently unwilling to proceed and of course all the rest stopped also he was the finest mule we had and on that account had twice as much to carry as any of the others his load had never been felieved and it consisted of four portman teaus two of which belonged to me and which contained not only at very heavy bag of dollars but also papers which were of such consequence that i could hardly have continued my journey without them the peons now redoubled their cries and leanirinover the sides of their mules and picking tip stones they threw them at the leading nmiule who nowv commenced his journey over the path with his nose to the ground literally nsmelling hiis ay he walked gently onl often changing the position of his feet if lhe found the ground would not bear until he came to tle bad part of the pass where he again stopped and i then certainly began to look with great anxiety at my portmanteaus but the peons agyain threw stones at him and he continued his path and reached me in safety several others followed at last a young mule carrying a portmanteau with two large sacks of provisions and many other things in passing the bad point struck his load against the rock wvhich knocked fis two hind legs over the precipice ard the loose stones immediately began to roll away from under them however his forelegs were still upon the narrow path hie had no room to lout his head there but hie placed his nose on the path on his left and appeared to hold on by his mouth  his perilous fate was soon decided by a loose mule who came and in walking along after him knocked his comrades nose off the path destroyed his balance and head over heels the poor creature instantly commenced a fall wvhich was really quite terrific wvith all his baggage firmly lashed to him lhe rolled down the steep slope until he came to the part which was perpendicular and then hle seemned to bound off and turning round in the air fell into the deep torrent onl hits back and upon his baggage and instantly disappeared i thought of course that hie was killed  but up hie rose lookingr wild and scared and immediately endeavoured to stem the torrent which was foaming about hini it was a noble efvort and for a momient lhe seenmed to succeed but the eddy suidenly caught the great load whrich was uponi his back and turned him completely over dowvn went his head with all the baggagre and as hle was carried down the stream all i saw were his hind quarters and his long thin wvet tail lashing the wvater as suddenly however up his head came arain but he was now nweak and went down the stream turned round and round by the eddy until passing the corner of the rock i lost sihlit of him i saw however the leons with their lassos in their hands run dow n the side of e theorrent for some little distance but they soon stopped and after looking towards the poor mule for some seconds their eariest attitude gradually relaxed and when they walked towards me i concluded that all was over i walked up to the peons and wvas just oingr to speak to them when i saw at a distance a solitary mule walking towards us we instantly perceived that he was the piaeton whose fall we had just witnessed and in a few moments lie came up to us to i join his comrades lhe was of course dripping wet his eye looked dull and his whole countenance was de jected however none of his bones were broken he was very little cut and the bulletin of his health was altogether incredible with that surprising anxiety with which the miules all lhave to join the troop or rather the leadiing mule which carries the bell he continued his course and actually walked over the pass without compulsion although certainly with great caution the precedigt quotation certainly borders on the marvellous but in courtesy

B638,"['6778880', '6787603', '3159732', '9222286']",  two in captivity by vincent brown lane 3s 6d this is a strong and moving book it narrates the tragedy of two guilty lovers in search of ease how they would have fled from themselves but were withheld by fear of each other sheltering beneath sophism and stupefaction and excess until they could compass without physical pain their end stated thus the story may seem to be in need of justification but the justification is in the manner of presentation for mr brown is one that understands by a thousand little signs he ranges himself on the side of his wretched manytimespunished sinners and a novelist who does this is in a position to do more than relate events the two are lewis krehlartist sensualist egoist and hesitaterand kate lady bir his love the power to which they are captive is compact of sensualism moral anarchism pessimism guilt mr brown has taken an extreme case but it is full of strokes that tell home he has overstated but he knows trimmed of exaggeration this sad pitiful pair the product of an agnostic age are wofully real and credible and pitiful the book has faults there is throughout it a tendency to melodrama which might well be chastened lady bir is never fully realised by the reader and it is quite likely in real life that the law would have intervened and locked up the wanderers as lunatics but these are unimportant matters what is important is that mr brown has conceived a terrible moral tragedy and has developed it so bitingly that it dominates the mind we quote part of the scene following upon the death of lord bir to which though krehl did not actually cause it he was accessory lord bir lies dead at the foot of a long flight of stone steps krehl has sought out lady bir to tell her  no one can ever know  he exclaimed  kate oar hands are clean we shall be as one henceforth call the servants she murmured callthe servants she would not look at him in moments she seemed to grow old deformed  we must share the remembrance of this night kate on a sudden she slid towards the door but stopped and returning to the sofa reclined upon it in a fainting attitude krehl sat beside her he kissed her hands and her hair  all the future is ours kate but this will be with us always she muttered  no no he cried in emotional stress  you speak of slavery and we have done with that once for all the door stands open and love calls kate he said  i have made a discovery tonightthere is no such thing as conscience we must be natural and nature knows nothing of conscience it is one of the delusions that afflict humanity i could prove that to you and remorse remorsethat is another name for weakness his arms were about her  ahahwe shall be strong together i and they shivered in abject wretchedness she started up and ran across the room but she got no farther than the door there her face towards it she sank in a kneeling posture her head bowed low her hands on the floor krehl raised her tenderly led her back to the sofa  he was not fit to live kate  and now i must tell you the name he called youan adulterous rag   and he said  i meant to set her up as a gazingstook   her face assumed a shocking tranquillity she sat rigid and then the grimace of despair came to her features  now krehl said  i shall go to his room no one must know that i have been at bir tonight you will wait here till i return mr brown never loses this fast hold on his theme we commend to young writers the way in which he marshals his evidence and compels progression  two in captivity by vincent brown a subtle and searching analysis of the impress of guilt on two souls the story opens with unusual bluntness lord bir on an afternoon in june tried to kill his friend lewis krehl but it is not a sensational work  the interest is psychological lane 3s 6d  two in captivity by vincent brown 35 6d lane it is not mainly a question of literary style or capacity or material that distinguishes mr vincent brown from his fellow story tellers it is the revelation of the inner spirit of the writer his profound pity for humanity his own soul seems to rest on a definite faith and rule perhaps even an ascetic one but all his heart goes out to wandering sinners he is that very rare thing a healthy man who is connoisseur in the ills of mankind successes or not as stories all his books have a keen and delicate interest and next to 1 my brother   two in captivity is the most remarkable it is the history of two degenerates two lawbreakers who wander about the world without a compass seeking a higher life wearily and scorring the normal life for which they are not fit he faces all the possible degradations of their situationthe brandydrinking the loss of selfrespecting habits the hysterical substitutes for joy the petty hypocrisies before the world the abject melancholy fatigue yet he never shames the two he never cynically denies that they have ideals though unexpressed in the background you feel his conviction that their need is confessing simple obedience to common laws yet he does not deny in their tawdriness the reflection of some trailing clouds of glory and for their misery he has infinite pity besides the last degradation he does not put on them the two love each other to the unhappy end you will search far before you find so subtle so humanhearted a vindication of law as for the manner of the book mr brown uses modern circumstances not realistically but as if seen through an uneasy dream if maeterlinck were to write a novel it would bear strong resemblance one thinks to 1 two in captivity  two in captivity by vincent brown lane the abundant cleverness of this book is neutralised by the gruesome nature of its subject the bulk of the volume is a dialogue between two

literature at yale university has seized the opportunity to inform caution and put right american opinion upon the whole subject of russian literature his manner in so doing is unfamiliar to english readers it makes us feel that while we read we are like alice dwindling away in height by the end of the first page we are much too young even to attend a university  by the end of the second and especially when that tiny little joke is popped into our baby mouths we are of a size to spell out maxims at a learned knee  a novel is not great simply because it is written in the russian language nor because its author has a name difficult to pronounce or a slavishno pun intendedadoration of russian novels is not tself an indication of critical intelligence or a pessimist is not necessarily a profound thinker nor is unclean ness in itself a sign of virility but surely mr phelps exaggerates the extreme innocence of american literary opinion  he must surely be mistaken in not realising that it has long cut down these modest flowers of thought with its little hatchet nevertheless even kuprin is described in terms that remind us of those infantile dogmatics about the cat and the mat and  run fox run    he soars and he sinks  he is holy and he is coarse  he is sublime and he is flat between this introduction and the preface contributed by the translator mr pasvolsky who ls at naive pains to inform us when kuprin is at his best and why he is at his best the author makes a difficult bow but happily the first story which gives the title to the book is wonderfully successful and so the bow is a triumphant one  the garnet bracelet  is a story of hopeless love it tells how a poor official fell in love with the beautiful princess vera nicolaeyna for seven years he wrote to her and then on her birthday he sent her the bracelet at this her husband and brother interfered they sought the man out and he after giving them to understand that he fully realised the impossibility of the situation promised them to disappear next day the princess read of his suicide she received from him a letter written just before he had shot himself expressing his happiness in having loved her and begging her to ask someone to play for her in his memory the largo appassionata from sonata 2 op 2 of beethoven from this oldfashioned plot oldfashioned like the poor bracelet with its illpolished stones its green stdrie in the middle with the five deep red ones surrounding there come rays of deep quivering light and all that they reveal is linked together just for one moment becomes part of the tragic lifestory of the strangely simple man for whom  to love was enough  may nothing transient or vain trouble your beautiful soul he writes but the life of the princess is composed of what is transient and vain  the society in which she lives is transient and vain  real love could have no part in it but being woman her secret dream is of a love that shall fill her whole life  it has come near her and now it is gone for ever the other stories in the book do not approach the first  horse thieves  and  the jewess  are we imagine written under the influence of tchehov the first which is an account of a little boys association with beggars and thieves and contains a hideous picture of mob violence has many a touch which puts us in mind of the great writer but only to marvel before kuprins heaviness at the delicacy and surety of the other in  the jewess again it is easy to see in what soil the idea has been nourished but a sorry weed has grown coarse straggling with no flower at all for all the authors urging until at the last he has propped it up with an old stick of allegory which never for an instant deceives us a word must be said about  an evening guest in a letter giving a hst of the works he considers his most successful the author places it first this is very interesting as showing the extraordinary difference between the russian consciousness and ours to us  the evening guest  is quite impossible  it is very nearly absurd in its ingenuousness one evening somebody knocks at th writers door it sets him wondering who is there who might be there and how unknown is the future he compares life at great length to a game of cards and then imagines that some madman should hit upon the idea of a lottery of life on an appointed day there would stand an enormous urn filled with cards one of which we must draw and then what is life except this drawing of lots out of an urn of fate  and so on until he falls to wondering whether he will be able to make certain sounds to which that other person on the other side of the door will respond until finally when we are almost inclined to call it childish he cries  every time that i think of the vastness

B937,['8533490'],  cripps the carrier cripps the carrier by r d blackmore london sampson low and co  cripps the carrier is not so good a novel as  lorna doone but then  lorna doone  may fairly be said to rank amongst the very best of the novels of our day that fall short of being really great novels indeed since the last of the immortal waverley novels came from the busy brain and active hand which having fought so long were to be so soon silenced the class of writings which though not absolutely historical romances were yet laid in a time and among people different from our own have not been over numerous  lorna doone  may claim a good position among them not indeed with esmond or with barry lyndon the cause of so many tours de force most notably george augustus salas clever  captain dangerous nor with the virginians even but belonging to the school of these and not unworthy with  the cloister and the hearth perhaps fitter comparison may be made for if the story of erasmus father and margaret of the redgold hair be greater the feeling that invests john ridd and his surroundings is more closely akin to the time in which the tale is placed than is mr reades work to days mediaeval it must be at once admitted that as never before mr blackmore wrote so good a novel as his romance of exmoor so never since has he approached very near to it but cripps the carrier is a much closer approach than its predecessor  alice lorraine is indeed very greatly its superior if it possesses many of mr blackmores distinctive defects it also boasts of most of his distinctive merits mr blackmores chief faults are a certain vagueness in his grasp of a story as an artistic whole a confusion and apparent incertitude dependent upon this as well as a tendency to diffuseness  and worst of all perhaps a habit of bringing many of his characters before his readers as if he assumed them to be already well acquainted and therefore deemed it unnecessary to further enlighten them for this reason and because the chief charm of mr blackmore lies in his great descriptive powers and his sharp and sudden analysis of nature more than in his power of telling a story he is seen at his best when he informs some single subject when as in  lorna doone  and  the maid of sker he tells his tale in the first person either as the person most interested therein or as some keen observer the reason for this is obvious enough that he is compelled to hold himself together as it were cannot allow himself to be so carried off into perpetual fresh woods and pastures new as is his wont in other cases moreover no matter how many characters he may bring upon his stage he is compelled to govern their actions by the observation of a single person whereas when dealing with them by himself he seems to get so interested in eaoh one as it arises as to for the time being lose all consciousness of the others the story and indeed all things beside in his anxiety to follow out the feelings of the puppet whose strings he happens at this moment to be pulling suddenly he remembers that he is not writing an exhaustive analysis of a human character and he hurries back with a start  to some other of his creations and in the frequent repetition of this process so much time is lost that the chronicle is at last if not exaotly brought to a lame and impotent conclusion at least considerably hurried and confused in its ending it would be indeed difficult to dramatise one of mr blackmores stories because there is in them so little of dramatic completeness as stories they are incomplete and incoherent as studies of character they are too often marked with sameness but in spite of these defects and the perhaps still greater one that his women are little more than names the fact still remains that it is his power as painter poet and philosopherfor he seems to exercise each of these capacities in his writingsthat make his works so praisedeserving between  lorna doone his greatest work and therefore containing the greater portion of his merits and  alice lorraine in which his defects were most marked  cripps the carrier may take a middle place but if not fairly made midmost then nearer to the latter than to the former novel the story is complicated and apparently impossible in its leading idea which is however simple enough the scene is laid in oxfordshire close to the university town the heroine grace oglander is carried off from her family by the family lawyer and villain of the story luke sharpe and hidden in a remote cottage she believing herself to be acting in obedience to her fathers wishesa belief induced by means of forged letters in her fathers name which tell her that he has been compelled to go to demeraraand to be thirty miles from oxford and her home instead of close at hand the object of this forced abduction has been on the part of the lawyer that she may marry his son christopher who will thus come in for her fortune but who is a manly young fellow wholly guiltless of art or part in his fathers plan luke sharp causes squire oglander to believe that his daughter has been murdered a belief that nearly kills the old man  but in the end the plot is discovered on account of christopher sharpes refusal to be a scoundrel and carry out his fathers plans grace is rescued by cripps the carrier lawyer sharp blows his own brains out and grace marries her lover russel overshute who does not however play any very prominent part in the story because like ivanhoe he is ill throughout the greater part of the tale the probability or improbability of the story need not bo discussed it is the right of the artist if he chooses and if his strength justify it to do as he likes in this matter that chloroform was not invented at the time does not destroy the interest in the chief event in the  tale of two cities that joan of arc did not die on the field of battle that mary stuart and elizabeth tudor never met do not alter the merits of schillers two great dramas  all that is demanded is that it shall appear to be possible and this the plot of  cripps the carrier seems scarcely to be it is overcrowded with figures a fact

B2250,"['4372131', '9428028', '8485575']",  reviiws of books our mutual frien mr dickens has now been so long before the public and his name is associated with so many triumphs some of which were achieved before the present generation of young men and women was born that he has already obtained the position of a classic and we judge him by the standard of names consecrated by time he has exhibited a degree of productiveness rarely seen except in combination with a marked and melancholy falling off from the freshness and power of early manhood the collected editions of his works now spread over many volumes the characters he has invented would almost people a town and we might well excuse an author who has done so much if we found in him some slackening of the creative force which has been at work for such a length of time but mr dickens stands in need of no allowance on the sooe of having outwritten himselfl his fancy his pathos his hmour his wonderful powers of observation his picturesqueness and his versatility are as remarkable now as they were twenty yea ago in some respects they are seen to still greater advantage the energy of youth yet remains but it is united with the deeper insight of maturer years not that we mean to say mr dickenshas outgrown his faults they are as obvious as eversometimes even trying our patience rather hard a certain extr vagnce in particular scenes and personsa tendency to caricature and grotesquenessand a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic as if the author had been considering how the thiqwroulld  tell  on the stageare to be found in  our mutual fried as in all this great novelists productions but when a writer of genius has fully settled his style and maintained it through a core

affectd the development of two or three of the chief characters theind explanation is a disappointment the whole plot in which the deceased harmon boffin wegg and john rokeemith are concerned is wild and fantastic wanting in reality and leading to a degree of confusion which is not compensated by any additional interest in the story mr dickens seems to be aware that his tale is liable to this objection for in the very interesting  postscript in lieu of preface which he has appended to the second volume he says there is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction what are the commonest e eriences in fact therefore i note here though it may not be at al necessay that there are hundreds of will cases as they are called far more remarkable than that fancied in this book and that the stores of the prerogative office teem with instances of testators who have made changed contradicted hidden forgotten left cancelled and leftuncancelled each many more wills than were ever made by the elder mr harmon of harmony jail we do notfor a moment doubt that this is the fact and it is not to the terms of mr harmons will that we object but to the circumstances flowing from that source that the son john harmon known through the greater part of the book as john rokesmith should come baok to gland under the circunstances related should disappear as related should live for months at the house of his childhoods friends the boffins without being discovered and should then be suddenly found out without any sucint explanation that mr boffin should

her we venture to think that most readers will feel that the story loses in verisimilitude and interest by such a mode of winding it up the termination of mr dickenss novels is often hurried and such is the case in the present instance the complication of events does not work itself clear by a slow and natural process but is so to speak roughly tonne open and even before we are half through the book the mystery concerning john rokesmith is explained in an equally objectionable manner young rokesmith or harmon tells himself his own previous history in a sort of mental soliloquy in which a long series of events is minutely narrated evidently for no other purpose than to inform the reader it is surprising that so experienced a romancewriter as mr dickens could not have devised some more artful means of revealing that portion of his design yet notwithstanding these defects which we have pointed out with the greater freedom because such a writer demands the utmost candour from his critic the story of  our mutual friend is interesting for its own sake even apart from its treatment which we need not say is that of a master if we except these points already objected to we repeat what we said at the commencementthat in conception and evolution of character and in power of writing this latest work of the pen that has so often delighted and astonished us shows not the slightest symptom of exhaustion or decline perhaps the most admirable of the dramatis personw considered on artistic grounds are eugene wrayburn lizzie hexam bradley headstone and bella wilfer the first of these characters is a consummate representation of a nature originally noble degenerating under the effects of a bad education and of subsequent idleness into a laughing indifference to all things worthyinto a gay and sportive disbelief in itself in manhood in womanhood and in the world from first to last the conception is wonderfully developed and the change that is afterwards wrought in eugenes disposition is worked out without the smallest violence in strong contrast with the goodnatured levity of wrayburn is the stern selfcontained narrow yet within its contracted and mechanical limits earnest nature of bradley headstone the selfeducated schoolmaster liue hexam is the cause of bringing these two men into dangerous contact she is the daughter of a man who drags the river for anything he can getdead bodies among the restand who is sometimes suspected of having more to do with the dead bodies than he would like to confess the girl  however is a fine sensitive being handsome and of a deep tender nature and when eugene wrayburn sees her after the death of her father on the rver he takes an interest in her fate and has her educated his interest deepens into love yet he cannot brine himself to make an honest offer of marriage to one who comes of such humble and even questionable parentage bradley headstone also is in love with lizzie and the way in which his impassive artificiallyrestrained nature breaks up into raging fury under the combined influences of hopeless love jealousy and some pungent taunts which wrayburn gaily flings at him is exhibited by mr dickens with marvellous power and truthfulness the transformation of this pattern of all the decencies into a dark haggard selftormenting evil genius per tually dogging the steps of eugene wrayburn and at length making a murderous attack on hi in a lonely place up the river is one of the finest things in fiction bradley headstone is a psychological study of the deepest interest and we are peruaded of the profoundest truth natures like his originally cold and still further repressed by the routine of a dry and formal education are no doubt especially liable to outbreaks of ungovernable passion when some great emotion at length sweeps away the old habits of selfcontrol mr dickens has traced this with a sinjularly close and analytical eye and nothing can be more tragic and impressive than the culmination of bradley headstones wrath in the attempted murder of eugene all the preparations for that at and all the acoessories in the way of scenery and atmospherical conditions are managed in mr dickenss highest style and the mental state of a man about to commit the greatest of crimes has seldom been depicted with such elaboration and apparent truthfulness we are prepared to hear from a certain class of critics who can tolerate nothing beyond the civilities of everyday life and who seem to think that great passions are among those vulgar mistake of nature to which novelists should be superior that this carcter is sensational  but the genius that could conceive it has dothilg to fear from such objectors very touching and beautifsl the character of lizzie hexam but probably the greatest favourite in the book will beor rather is alreadybella wilfer she is evidently a pet of the authors and she will long r m the darling of half the households of england and america pererse petulant wil wrongheaded not a little inclined at first to be selfish and aneyloving she is yet a bewitching little creare and it is no surprise to find that in the end all the good in her impulsive nature bursts into efflorescence beneath the sunshine of a happy love of the less important characters of the book it is impossible to speak they are so numerous but reference shoeld be made to the lathetic sketch of betty higden and little johnny her gre andchild that the poor old creatures pod defince of workhouse charity is true to a large number of ourm glialower clam is but too certain from cases with which we are all familiar and the sketch is more especially interesting as having drawn from mr dickens in the final words from which we have already quoted a declaration of his views on the present administration of the poor laws  in my social experiences since mrs betty higden came upon the scene and left it i have found circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the poor law my friend m1r bounderby could never see any differenoe between leaving the coketown hands exactly as they were and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance and i have been called upon to admit that i would give poor law relief to anybody anywhere anyhow patting this nonsense aside i have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties the ote contending that there are no deserving poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather to the mercies of some relieving officers and some union houses the other admitting that there are such pcor but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do the records in our newspapers the late exposure by the lancet and the common sense and senses of common people furnish too abundant evidence against both defences but that my view of the poor law may not be amk or misrepresented i will state it i believe there has been in england since the days of the stuarts no law so often infimously administered no law so often openly violated no law habitually so ill supervised in the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution that shock the public and disgrace the country the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanityand known language could say no more of their lawlessnes we must also instance among the creations of this book the little deformed dolls dressmaker fantastic and semipoetical yet with a deep instinct of truth her drunken fathera sketch in which tragedy and comedy are mingled in a way wherein mr dickens is quite unrivalled bellas father a beautiful specimen of a truly loveable nature the podsnaps and veneerings and the crew of rapscallions and adventurers male and female by whom they are surroundedportraits admirable for the social satire they embody rogue riderhood and some of the other hangerson about the river we might almost mention the river itself as a character it plays a most important part in the story and always with great picturesqueness we cannot refain ere we conclude from referring once more to the postscript for the sake of its allusion to an event in whidh at the time we were all deeply interested on friday the 9th of june in the present year mr and do

afford to lose such a writer as mr dik a man of original creative genius dying in the fulnes of bis strength leaves a gap which nothing can fill and a regt which the memory of his past triumphs only deepens and embitter  our mutual friend by charles dickens with illustrations by marcus stone 2 vols chapman  hall a new novel by the greatest novelist living is not to be dismissed with a few jaunty phrases of rapture or of qualification for a simple yet serious reason those who with understanding as distinct from that wonderment which belongs to the foolish face of praise have followed mr dickens throughout his career of authorship cannot fail to have perceived that time and success have not made him carelesswhether as concerns his art his public or himself as little have they spoilt or dimmed or turned aside his quick sympathies his power of minute observation his keen desire to advocate what he deems right his wondrous force of hand and colour as a painter in words every true and conscientious man becomes increasingly solicitous on these points with time and success the boy may dash off a brilliant sketch as a matter of course the ripe artist will ponder over his coming picture but may he not ponder too long and oversolicitously  this question we fancy may be asked with respect to  our mutual friend only the other day ita author gave us that french story of little bebelle one of the most exquisite pieces of pathos in fiction the value of which will be best tested by comparing it with sternes shandyisms only yesterday out of a dingy street in the strand from no more promising place than a lodginghouse the artist by a touch brought to light a homely loving fellowcreature worthy to  sit above the salt among the best of the best mrs lirriperas real  a being of the mind  as mr pickwick as mrs gamp as the micaivbersas any of the long line of living creatures called up by the novelist whom we know intimately in all their strength and weakness and whose deeds and sayings have passed into household words if therefore we say that during its course of fragmentary publication  our mutual friend has raised more question than certain of its predecessors the circumstance arises from the nature of the story and not because the fountain of variety shows signs of exhaustion none of the series is so intricate in plot as this tale it would be wasted labour to detail or analyse a chain of events which every one has already handled enough to state our conviction that the closest attention is required to hold certain of its connecting links from the first number it was evident to us that the murdered john harmon was not murdered but had set himself down in the household of the wife allotted to him by a fantastic will for the purpose of testing her real nature the circumstances of the deed which led to his shipmate radfoot being mistaken for and murdered with himself are mistily revealed in the long soliloquy during which he determines on the renunciation of his identity some incompleteness referable to partial recollection may have been an intentional stroke of art on the novelists partmay belong to the nature of the catastrophe but it produces an impression of uncertainty then again the complications of the story may have necessitated sharp turns and surprises which bear unfavourably on some of the characters we fancy the conversion of bella wilfer the capricious beauty longing for wealth and emancipation from her portentous mother and shrewish sister to be somewhat too suddeneven though it did grow out of her dismal experience of the simulated avarice overgrowing mr boffin this avarice again however adroitly devised and minutely wrought out as a piece of masquerade leading to a final surprise for which no one can have been prepared has of necessity implied the introduction of some elements discordant with those of the character so forcibly conceived and broadly sketched the honest truthful boffin of the mounds whose simple rightmindedness virtually overruled his wretched old misermaster who had the fortune to leave might have been led by his desire to right what was wrong and to regenerate what was defective to connive in the scheme of amending the coquetries of bella the oddlydesignated bride ofthe great fortune but his inability to carry such a longdrawn piece of subtle comedy through we beg respectfully to our great novel ist to question and we are satisfied that bo greathearted a man should not on any excuse of plot or plan whatsoever or any desire to lead on a miserable knave to the full display of his greed and knavery have been submitted to the degradation of the scene with wegg after the discovery of old harmons second mil in the house of the anatomical curiositymonger that which belongs and befits a detective policeman apt at disguises as mr bucket of nevertobeforgotten memory sits ill on an honest ignorant affectionate creature such as he is and though we love mrs boffin the comfortable and instinctivelydelicate woman one of mr dickenss most genial creations with all our hearts we cannot but feel as if we owed her a grudge for her connivance truth and nature are here strained in subservience to the requirements of literary art we fancy that the necessity of conducting an unusually large crowd of characters through a maze of unusual intricacy has told on other of the personages of the story harmon its hero is by his position betwixt light and dark inevitably partially effaced bella the coquetish daughter of mrs wilfer the stupendous is capitally touched in the chameleon hues of her character and royally righted at last but during a large part of the tale she keeps us in a state of perpetual uneasiness hardly justifying the love she is described as inspiring then lizzie hexam though not precisely a sketch has not substance enough for the place she is expected to fill in the readers interest lastly we cannot conceive the possibility of a man so holy humble affectionate and beneficent as riah the hebrew on any grounds of compact obligation or sophistry lending himself one hour after it was known to the hypocritical wickedness of such a tyrant as fledgeby the usurer the meanest creature this is saying much as yet created by the hand that painted the moneylenders in  nickleby and brats and kroolc and fagin and uriah heep the explanation made by him at last to the little weird dolls dressmaker shows us that mr dickens has felt the necessity of some explanation which is insufficient to convince us we cannot but be reminded by it of an awkwardness somewhat similar in miss edgeworths  ormonda tale expressly undertaken by her in atonement for what had been represented to her as too wholesale a depreciation of a people against whom  every man has his hand thus much by way of qualificationor call it speculation ratherconcerning a novel which gains immensely by being perused without stop let or hindrance on returning to the characters that of bradley headstone the schoolmaster dogged sensual unreadyhis tremendous passions compressed by the responsibilities and respectabilities of his position takes the foremost place among them as an original conception frightfully though he suffers even though when he confronts wrayburn his pococurante rival there is a show of reason and of championship on his side there is no possibility of any ones feeling a moments pity on his behalf so utterly is the masterdesire of his life rendered unlovable by the forms in which it is clad there have been many murders and many pictures of remorse in novelsand none more powerful than the pages in which we were shown the wanderings of bill sykes and the slinking home of jonas chuzdewit after his bloody deed in the wood but mr dickens has exceeded even those in the scene where the wretched criminal tortured by the rebuking consciousness of his having failed in his diabolical design is dogged and dragged back to the fatal spot by his nideous confidant nothing can be mon masterly as a display of blank inevitable retri j bution and wretchedness redeeming touch  there is none about bradley headstone  even j the concealed love for him of the softhearted i prim little schoolmistress delicately indicated as it ia fails to furnish it to change the fancythe author of  pickwick never revelled among richer whimsies than are to be found in the comic parts of this talein the veneering household and the guests assembled by it the mistress of the man  sion and of the camels on the dinnertable with her readiness to weep her stupid sentimentalities about  bilby her inane admiration of the prancing gossip of that old mechanical harridan lady tippins because the same passes with her as a fashionable pearl of great pricethe

they say on the stage boots and brewerare all new people in print whom every dinerout has met every  week of his life in private the vivacity and  variety of this division of the novel are admirable but when talking of dinners in our mutual friend we nuit not forget the most  incomparable dinner of all that of the newly  married couple bella and john at greenwich for the sake of the sentimental waiter the young man on liking so ignominiously thrust aside by the archpotentate in waiting who conceived that he had alone a right to the solemn monopoly of the secret of the day j we must stop  though touchesand traits rise  on us hythe hundred justifying what has been said that our mutual friend is one of mr dickenss richest and most carefullywrought books if we demur to wegg and to miss jenny wren as to a pair of eccentrics approaching that boundaryline of caricature towards which their creator is by fits tempted wecannot recall anything more real more cheering than the sketch of the milveysclergyman and clergymans wife lxth so unconscious in their selfsacrificing virtue and goodness yet the two so capitally discriminated by the extra touch of zeal and briskness and suspicion of the jews on the womans part it might be suggested that too much space is given to the impostorcouple the lammles and their designs on podsnaps poor foolish little daughter but again how capitally thrown in to the womans part is its scrap of shame and of remorseful feeling her figure ere she quits the scene unconsciously sketching on the tablecloth with her parasol is not to be forgotten as marked by that attitude and occupation enough then has been said to indicate in what point of view we conceive this novel may be regarded and to prove that on its being read and read again every lover of types of human character every student of art in fiction every man who has  humour in his soul will find each and all enjoyment if as regards broad outline there are former stories by mr dickens which we preferif among his tales we rank the highest  david copperfield which includes so to say neither plot nor surpriseour mutual friend must be signalised for an accumulation of fine exact characteristic detail such as would suffice to set up in trade for life a score of the novelspinners wno give us situations without motives scenes without characters words without thoughts and the dialogue not of real life but of melodrama  the literary examiner our mutual friend by charles dickens with illus trations by marcus stone in two volumes chapman and hall latinised races accuse english writers of a disregard of unity in works of art and yet there is no great english work of imagination that does not recognise it in a far higher degree than is involved in acceptance of the classical formula for securing an external unity in respect of time and place and action we rightly hold the imagination capable of passing with ease over intervals of space and time and although we recognise even more thoroughly than our neighbours the demand for unity of action what we mean by that is not outward simplicity and singleness of plot but a wellharmonized relation of all parts to one central thought ideal unity that lies far deeper than any of those considerations on which the old triad of classic unities is based every great english work of imagination every good work of art all the world over is as it were a crystallisation of thought about some one central idea nowhere perhaps is the sense of this true unity so perfectly shown as in the literature of england in shakespeare grave or gay it is distinctly seen every turn of the light trifling in loves labours lost every character of the play blends with the rest in a poets graceful jest over the taste of his day for idle ornament in the plot nothing is done all the ingenious rhyming of the courtiers agrees with the state of don armado with the j brave outside who being called upon to strip to his shirt and fight owns that he has not a shirt to his back under all his bravery in the merchant of venice the play crystallises round the central thought of the relation between justice and mercy law and gospel in king lear earthly sovereignty breaks like a bubble on the wind as it flies through the stir of the grand forces of nature in julius casar the central thought is the problem of government the supreme sovereignty of caesar the philosophical republicanism of brutus the selfseeking republicanism of cassius and all other parts of the play show as it were the different faces of the crystal of which all parts have their harmonious relation to the single point of thought if we turn from shakespeare to fielding in tom jones broad as the canvas is on which that work is painted and crowded as it is with various incident there also we find every detail tending to ono centre the idea of the relation of man to society jones and biifil are types of the two opposite halves of the social world jones faulty but honest his faults open and incurring blame biifil keeping the faults of a worse nature secret giving a fair show to the worst acts and escaping blame in the relation of man with society open truth is contrasted with false seemiog and the episode of the old man of the hill is contrived to provide for the middle case of the man who cuts the knot of tiie social problem by avoiding conversation with his fellows mr dickens invariably fulfils in his novels this condition of deep seated unity which has been always recognised in english art all readers can feel that he does so and some readers who have paid little attention to good literature have raised thereupon arguments upon the propriety or impropriety of  writing with a purpose as tf any thing worth reading anything worth seeing anything worth hearing were ever produced or uttered without the purpose to express a distinct individual meaning of some sort there must be in every good novel play or poem one true thought for the mainspring that keeps all ita wheels in action and we must start from the mainspring if we would trace properly the movement of the works in this novel of our mutual friend the argument is of the soul of life smong the fictions of society we are shown in the first chapter lizzie hexam a truehearted girl in a position as degraded as imagination can conceive without stain to her inner purity she is bringing a pure heart to a revolting way of life ber father supports a wretched home among scum of the riverside by fishing for drowned men in this girl chiefly but not in her only we are as the story grows to see the radiance of the aoul of life we turn from her and the deep social degradation of her outward life at onoe in the second chapter to the other side of the books argument the fictions of society these are typified throughout by the friends collected round the dinnertable of the veneering the veneering themselves have their root in nothing being social jonahs

there is a great heap of money in the centre of the story made out of dust hy a dustman and treated as a dustheap in comparison with human truth and tender graces of the mind there is a bella wilfer whose character at every period full of light and shade is shown also in process of developmentour literature does not contain a happier study of light girlish grace advancing with no loss of charms into a pure womanly earnestness bella when young believes that she is sordid she has come out of a mean home into the daily relish of what wealth can buy is guest and friend of mr and mrs boffin social nobodies who happen for a time to sit on the gold heap with homely honest hearts that love of gold can never spoil then the boffins join with bellas lover to whom really all the gold belongs in plot for the girls education and the fetching out of the true soul of life known to be in her boffin covers himself with gloryand much mystifies the reader of the novel by appearing in the character of a man spoilt by wealth and turned into a greedy miser everybody knows how the story runs and so we need not describe at length or quote any of its passages we would only show that in this central plot also of our mutual friend as in the outlying incidents connected with it the inner thought of the book ia still the same is of the soul of life greater than all the fictions of society to this design belongs the sharp contrasting of such characters as mr and mrs boffin and mr and mrs lammle the story of the strong heart of betty higden who showed qualities of heroism in avoidance of the workhouse  the weak intellect with malice and greedy cunning in fledgeby the weaker intellect with love and the tender spirit of selfsacrifice in sloppy how full of a quaint generous humour again is the sketch of the dolls dressmaker little miss wren with her broken back and feeble frame her precocious wit sharpened by trouble in which the spirit of childhood casts its golden threads across the dull woof of her life of care and whose kindliness is at times touched with a malice as of childish playfulness familiar with bitter years of trouble nobody who reads this book as a whole can fail to be struck with the ingenious arrangement and skilfnl conduct of the story bead piecemeal it was satisfactory only to those who had faith in their author the secret of mr boffins little plot is so well kept that while it was in action they who believed their old friend to be shown to them ss really spoilt by wealth believed unwillingly and sometimes may have rashly supposed that here the masters hand had lost its cunning in fact if we look back to those scenes in which mr boffin enacted the part of a miser we shall be surprised to see how skilfully and freely the novelist scattered what with the key to it all in our possession we see clearly enough to be indications of the true state of the case the wealth of wit poured over all the pages of this book would be an intellectual harmons estate large enough to set on horseback every wegg of a literary gentleman with a wooden head we may say if we will that here we like and there we dont like any character or passage but far above desire to criticise by the small way of personal comparison between our individual tastes and opinions and those bf our author is the keen enjoyment of bis genius and after all there is the strictest justice in the heartiest appreciation of a liveliness of fancy that spends all its gaiety in quickening the honest sympathies of life of a pathos that derives ita strength from a firm hold on the realities of life a perception of character that seizes accurately types of men presents vividly their distinctive characters and all tinged with the observers humour that is to say with his own

B1199,"['8707249', '8646837', '8857654', '4455143']",  the gordian knot a story of good and evil by i shirley brooks with illustrations by john tenniel bentley this is a story of high mark in which the abundant fun is free from flippancy the manly earnestness is deep and genuine characters have been drawn with power and regard for truth care also has been taken with the writing of the book in which mr shirley brooks shows himself to be master of a healthy english style of the trials of mrs margaret arundel and of the marriage knot that was a gordian knot cut through by womans neverfailing love and truth the readers of this book will learn in a story of which the plot traverses much dangerous ground with perfect safety the illustrations to the tale by mr tenniel are as remarkable for more than ordinary truth and finish as the book itself novel readers accustomed to the conventionalities into which mr tiablot brown appears lately to have settled down as an illustrator cannot fail to receive as a fresh pleasure the excellent drawing and grouping the character expressed without caricature in mr tenniels pictures they are really pictures worthy to be received as illustrations of a volume written in the spirit of an artist not for their especial interest but as a fair example of the manner of the book and because they contain much of the temper and purpose of the story we quote a paragraph or two philip had broken the homespell so far as he was concerned and it was not impossible that he might ere long break the wifespell too at present there was no reason for this margaret was to him what she had ever been from the hour she consented to become hisgentle affectionate docile seeking only how she could render her self more and more acceptable to him she knew that she had received an education which though good was a provincial one and that he was naturally fastidious and she studied to correct anything if there were anything in language tone or thought that could annoy her husband she took his estimate of everybody as her own and without a pang resigned several opinions which she had learned under the roof of her liberal and dissenting uncle in favour of the more aristocratic arundelian politics there were only two subjects on which she could never be shaken one of these was religion this with margaret was no mere sentiment inspired by a fine organ and an impressive preacher and the stainedglass of a handsome church and about as valuable and as likely to exercise influence x on ones life as the sensation one derives from the last scene of  robert the devil it was a religion whose seat was in the heart and not in the senses she was no bigot brought up a dissenter she had unhesitatingly become a member of the church of england in conformity with the desire of her husbandif so grave a term should be applied to his observing on the first sunday tb3y spent 1 together that he supposed they might as well go to church as not but since that time she had been regular in her attendance there 1 when health permitted and if ever a shade of displeasure came over her face it was when philip who fancied himself a bit of a philosopher came out with a little morsel of voltairean flippancy or strausian neology and tried to shake her reverence for things that she i had been taught to hold sacred this style of attack annoyed her the more from its being new to her she had lived with those who would as soon have thought of arguing about the truth of revelation as a mau would think of arguing about the honour of his mother1l and when philip hinted to her that it was all very well to let charitychildren believe certain things in a bald vulgar way but that there was another way in which thinking persons could without rejecting the received stories bring them into accord with dhilosophical views margaret was shocked and wanted to know whets r the poor charitychildren had no souls philip had caught up a good many of the small arguments with which clever men especially men who smoke meerwchaums are in the habit of entirely smashing christianity but f arguments that ae quite strong enough for a party of men over wine and between double entendre will not always serve with an earnesti minded woman who is not ashamed to believe that her reason may  not be strong enough to teach her everything in this world and the next so with margaret arundel her other faith as has been intimated was in her baby save on these two points and really it is i not quite the worstthing that can be said of a woman that she loves t her god

author  the gordian knot a story of good and evil by shirley brooks bentley the gordian knot has been a long time on the stocks  but now that it is finished and launched we find it riding the watersa graceful and goodly vessel throughout the story the original design has been faithfully adhered to each of thc chapters containing something that shows the conclusion was from thc beginning to the end kept in sight and written up to there is however a difference between the opening and finishing pages the former are full of a broad humour and hearty spirit of caricature that recall the days when we first laughed over  pickwick while the latter are made up of those melodramatic effects of which mr shirley brooks is so perfect a master and of a few exquisitely pathetic scenes that will not fail to raise their authors reputation the leading plot of the tale is simple enough indeed were it not for the originality with which it is treated it might be called hackneyed the heroine the only child of a rascally officer of the east india companys service is sent home to be educated in england under the charge of an ayah who makes her appearance at various times during the course of the drama of which she is a picturesque and happilyconceived personage the young lady on reaching the english shores is passed on with no excess of ceremony to a quiet little borough town st oscars where she is taken affectionate care of by her unclea good country doctor of st oscars we are told the church was damp and one in which it was difficult to hear but the good vicar preached short sermons and bad ones so that we got away soon and lost little he did not like preaching that is a lamentable fact but he liked visiting the sick and helping the poor and seeing the children enjoy themselves the evangelical minister of the next pariah thought the doctors chances in the next world were indifferent but very few of us agreed with him and every dissenter put up a shutter on the day of the vicars

i observed him listening very tolerantly to an exceedingly fullflavoured anecdote told by the little doctor of the theatre  but perhaps i do the priest wrong for the doctor narrated in french and the other may not have understood him there were also some critics the name is eschewed nowadays and rightly when there is so little to bear res criticism and nobody to be swayed by it charm it never so wisely and it waa touching to see how the operaartists came up to them with enthusiastic reverence and showed gratitude for the advice and reproof which these gentlemen could have writtenhad they lived finally there was a uiningout wit who garnered a great harvest that day by listeningcontrary to his usual custom to other peoples stories and who i am sorry to hear has since lost his prestige through the fatal habit of putting greater names into his anecdotes of personal experience than is quite safe in a man who parades a bristol diamond and a birmingham h in such a scene does mr philip arundel bow the knee of homage to the lady who in due course he makes his wife how far the splendid young gentleman was justified by the state of his affections in taking the important step of marriage the following passage may show  should you ask me whether he had become under the magic of passion a mystery to himself whether he alternately felt that his own nature was changed and that all that was around him had changed its nature and valuewhether he seemed to himself to have suddenly sounded the depth of his own being and to have found himself miserably shallower and grandly deeper than ever ijeforewhether he became at once the most determined and the most purposeless of heavens creaturewhether he was at intervals proud of himself and intensely thankful to the providence that had led him to a glorious happiness and steeped in selfabasement and profane in his repining that he could but have a pisgahtop view of a bliss which he would never be worthy to attain whether all the world held but two objects as a centre for its revolution and of these two objects he was sometimes the one that was triumphant and ecstatic while the other was all sweetness and devotion sometimes the one that was rejected miscomprehended despised while the other stood apart a statue of coldness and pridewhether a strong mans heart leapt like a girls at the sound of a voice or the rustle of a dress and a strong mans nerves played him false when they should have been true and yet again heart and nerves were at times more courageous and more trusty than he had ever before found themwhether intense thought about himself what fool wrote that love forgot self for another became elevated from vanity to worship by the allabsorbing desire to please and to please worthily and whether in the very endeavour to be worthier he was checked by fear lest he should by any change lose the vantage ground he had been so favoured as to gain whether a presence was ever before him and around and about him pervading thought care hope and dream and was perhaps felt the least when the living and real deity was breathing and blushing and smiling before himwhether all these are among the signs that love delivers in the case of our friend i should answer i should tell you in the words of the courtier of whom his queen asks the trifling question whether there are not twenty thousand giants in the back garden madam shall i tell you what i am going to say i do firmly believe that there is not one philip lias not been long a proud lover ere he becomes a selfish disappointed husband it is an ugly word but it must come out philip began to neglect his wife not coarsely nor exactly in an unkind manner and assuredly not with any intention of hurting her feelings he was perfectly aware how good she was and when with her he retained more of his own old fondness than when absent he imagined that he felt he was glad too when he heard from her some cheerful little story about the way in which her evening nd been agreeably helped out in his absence that is to say that philip was a goodnatured gentleman but the goodnatured gentleman contrived to be away from home a good deal and that at hours when it is not the custom of solicitors to come rushing down the steps of the temple cellars with briefs and when philip was certainly not in his particular cellar reading the briefs which had been delivered it was the old story there was no particular hann in what he did he dined with his equals at a respectable place and if he drank too much wine it was not a great deal too much certainly not enough to make him forget anything except that he ought to go home no harm afterwards so far as one can see if he went to the theatre in most cases the deed carried its own punishment as he usually suffered from a bad performance and always from a bad ventilation i do not think he played mucha little whist with men he knew was no great gamblingand philip understood something about the game and once bought his wife a toiletbottle with part of his winnings his supper was usually a light one and oysters are exceedingly digestible fish and as for drinkingwhy if you will eat you must drink something and in regard to tobacco most men want either a sedative or a stimulant and tobacco has the ambidextrous advantage of being both and then when he was enjoying himself in any of these ways and the thought that he was a married man came across him when his eye fell on his hand he could hardly help being reminded of the fact by a ring his wife had given him he immediately choked it off if margaret were not tied to the house by that child i should be taking her somewhere instead of being here so it is not my fault that i am here and she is at home boxkeeper  things are in this state when alban cheriton reappears upon the scene indignant at the insult offered to his affections revengeful and unscrupulous he is determined to make his gentle cousin repent the time when she slighted his love and his rival rue the hour in which he won her hand a stern critic would condemn alban cheriton as too melodramatic a villain but he does his work well he gets into his hands an old mistress of philips named maria prescott a poor girl frantic at the loss of her first and only lover and anxious only to recover him to her armsnot to injure him by the use he makes of marias secret and the letters she has received from her betrayer and by availing himself of his position of medical attendant to margaret alban cheriton embitters the intercourse between her and her husband and eventually induces her to go down to hastings with her little boy under circumstances that make it appear as if she had ried from her home the means and steps by which this is effected form the bulk of the tale all is sorrow and dismay anger and perplexity when by a few skilful touches the clouds are dispelledphilip wakes up to a knowledge of his folly and sees in his wife a pure loving creature who has born his illtreatment uncomplainingly and never for an instant wronged him in deed or word or thought one of the principal agents in producing this happy termination to a story that errs in parts by being too painful is maria who on discovering the use that alban cheriton has made of her confidences is smitten with remorse and bravely makes her way to margarets friends to inform them of the part she has played in the work of evil just as the poor girl has made her confession she faints away and margaret arundel enters the room and sees her husbands discarded mistress on the ground it is her it is his childs mother but she is downshe is down repeated boosey in savage triumph down  ay and so was the great devil himselfdown trampled spurned for having dared for one single second of

chiefly varying from ten to fifteen and these were mostly dirty slatternly and impudent making their way on with that indefinite sort of pawing and pushing directed against no obstacle in particular which that class of females adopts to facilitate her progrtes through a crowd boys were also there some innoceutfaced urchins shaggy and shoeless othem comfortably dressed and bearirg the hard lines of premature vice and cunning many of these had short pipes and not a few had female companions of their own type but the younger ones ran in and out burrowing with their heads in the crowd and despite occasional cuffs and kicks getting well on in the moving mass with it went other lads with bundles of cheap newspapers whose names they incessantly screeched vendon of cakes lozenges and oranges a few soldiers whose uniforms aided to light up the picture a few bronzed sailors in high glee a good many trim policemen who glanced with much disfavour at the throng and occasionally made a dive and a plunge which sometimes caught a boy but more generally proved ineffective and a number of sturdy farmers many of them occupying more cubic inches of space than a unit has a right to in this limited world    gradually the mob grew denser and denser and it seemed as if several streams of a similar character had met in confluence round a common centre        suddenly the withdrawal of some large object perhaps a cart from the neighbourhood allowed the portion of the crowd that included spencer to press forward a few yards when it became as dense and rigid as before but that few yards had done the business in bringing limn past a corner which had shut cut the view of the o ject which had assembled the excitid ro ultitude taken for itself this object might seemn scarcely worthy of so much homage it was not a glittering t rophy it was not a statue to be unveiled it was not a rostrum for an orator it was simply a sort of platform of no great height erected in front of one of the 1oor0 of a large stone building and fromn which door a passage of several steps ascended to the platform the latter was surrounded by a slight chainwork on rails lest anyone should fall outside it the description is complete when we have added that two stout poles supported a crossbeam from which and over the centre of the platform there depended a short iron c lain and then after an interval of liusliing and shouting and jeering the last act of this featrfult drama is pla ed out as the minutes went slowly away a spectator would evtry 1o0w and then glance up to the clock of the church of the tonmb when that clock noted that about three minutes only were wanting to eight oclock an electric movement ran through the crowd and here and there a womans scream went up then in obedi ence to a general and peremptory call all hats went off then there was frightful silence unlike anything i hope that the majority of those who read these hines will ever be able to call to mind again a scream or two and a woman subsides in a dead faintfll she candotanid a strong arm in red cloth holds her up but the soldiers face is fixed on the platform and now the intense and awful silence is a thing that can he felt like darkness it could not be born long it is too unnatural for creatures to whoin god has given breaths and voices flae sweet grave sound of the bell is given out again anti mvrry

in black and they come upon the platform and ti certain appointed stations one of them holds a hool amid them is a man whom they have brought bits i them and whose legs tremble under him perhaps he would cling to one of his companions for support o his arms from the elbow upwards are pinioned to hui side but he can as you see clench and open ai again clench his hands in the extremity of his terror his face is very white but a shorter man advancef to him and turns him with his back to the church of the tomb we must upologise for the length of this ey 1 tended extract which must still run on to sustail and complete the interest of the subject the shorter man kneels on one knee before the pinioned man     it is to put some stout straps round his legs and fasten them together his legs can lardly tremble nuw but he might fall forward on 1ois face if an arm were not kindly put round him then they adjust the rope the other end of the rope is hooked to the chain on the beam and all the men in black save three havei retreated to i he passage leaving the platform to the three one of these produces a large white cap drats it quickly over the whole head of the pinioned man and

B7384,['8725978'],  seonee  or camp life on the sat pura range a tale of indian adventure by lt a sterndale frgs sampson low fc co this narrative of indian life was written the author tells us mainly for the benefit of the younger followers of st hubert whether they be bound for india or not with the laudable intention of inculcating that love of nature which will open to them to many fresh sources of enjoyment and make the mere destroying of wild beasts a secondary object but he also hopes that some of the traits of animal character and notes on natural history scattered through his pages may recall pleasant memories of the past to many an old shikari the incidents related have all occurred either within his own experience or that of his friends but to escape the appearance of egotism and pedantry and to impart his information in a freer and more conversational manner the author avoids the first person altogether and introduces the reader to two imaginary personages whose daily life and adventures during several months residence in the central parts of india form the framework of the book the characters of these two fiiends are pleasantly drawn and well sustained and thus although subsidiary to the plan of the book command our interest both are sportsmen  the one a manly unaffected youngster has come out on a visit to the elder a military man but in charge of the district the latter is a somewhat ideal specimen of a classhappily never absolutely rare in india though producible by no known system of examination one who by studying in a sympathetic spirit ae feelings and traditions of the people acquires without blinding himself to their faults a hearty interest in them which is repaid by confidence and unlimited respect in such a district as that under review he has to hold the balance between the simple aboriginal nonaryan races the more astute hindu cultivators and the warlike pathans and others legacies of the moghul and of the mahrattarule and he succeeds by sheer force of character and by a combination of qualities not as yet equally prominent in the bengalgraduate whom the laputan element in our councils threatens to substitute for him  our hero is a bold rider fond of sport as a field for skill and endurance and for the acquisition of fresh knowledge for he is a keen naturalist and holds a study of the nature and character both of animals and plants to be an essential attribute of the true sportsman accordingly in these points he hardly yields to the hereditary skill and knowledge of the native shikari the character of more than one of these men the indispensable companions of the english sportsman on terms often necessarily more intimate than his other followers is drawn from the life many curious instancesare related of their skill knowledge and patience and of the courage they display the author very properly reminds us that  we talk much of our exploits with our doublebarrelled rifles and elephants but our deeds are often put to shame by the shikari with bis single arm and rusty matchlock it is singular that in some parts of india as for instance in sind the shikari belongs to  degraded caste the above sketch of major fordham whois the mentor of his younger friend and the chief speaker throughout the volume will indicate the tone in which our author deals not only with matters connected with sport and natural history but with the higher interests of angloindian life both its pleasures and its duties have a keen attraction for him although his story closes in the great mutiny he is entirely free from the pessimism so widely and only too naturally engendered by that catastrophe and which seems with many not only to have darkened their views of indian humanity but to have rendered unattractive even the fair face of nature herself the district of seonee is part of a great upland tract in the heart of the peninsular some 2000 feet above the sea having the nerbudda river on the north and the territory of nagpore on the south its climate is equable and excepting in the three autumn months tent life is pleasant throughout the year the landscape is varied  scenes of rich quiet beauty alternating with others of rugged grandeur  nothing can exceed the beauty of certain portions of the nerbudda river where it flows in long deep coollooking often winding reaches between high banks covered near the waters edge with short grass and crowned with magnificent old trees of all description which overhang the water under which sic you see herds of spotted deer and flocks of peafowl feeding of the greater fauna m the lordly bison haunts the bambooclad slopes of the satpura range and interferes not with his un wieldly neighbour and cousin the buffalo who keeps to his grassgrown plains the red deer herd in the fertile valleys watered by the halone and the bonjar the sambur and the axis the stately blue boll and the tiny toylike moose deer all have their haunts in the forests that are spread over the undulating plateaux there are the rocky ravines for the bears and the stony plains haunted by antelope and bustard the grim tiger roams over thousands of square miles and the stealthy panther scruples not to carry off his prey even from the heart of a station the mode of life the character of the country and of the sport in this favoured district are all pleasantly described page after page is filled not only with sporting stories of the ordinary type but with curious facts in natural history with quaint touches of native character in various classes of the people and with bits of tradition or legend brought out naturally in conversation during the different expeditions foremost among the objects of the chase is the tiger to whom as to the more wily and treacherous panther great numbers of human beings yearly fall victims one notorious maneater in the district was credited with some four hundred deaths thus the visit of a sportsman on these occasions is a real advantage though it may be feared that the destruction of crops by deer and other animals already great will increase as those checks on their numbers are removed the inhabitants of a village are often personally acquainted with the tigers of their neighbourhood each of whom has its idiosyncrasies they will tell you that such a one is daring and rash that one is savage and morose another is mild and harmless brave as the native shikari is he is not proof against superstition  in one district the whole population was prostrated with fear of a panther who was said to be something more tlnn he seemed being in reality as the story went on chinta a fellow of bad character and who had the power of turning himself into a wild beast on one occasion being hungry he told his wife who had hitherto doubted bis powers that he was going to turn into a panther and kill venison and he gave her a root which when he returned in panther form she was to give to him that he might regain his human shape he accordingly retired into a jungle whence she saw a panther issue and kill a deer but on his returning toward her all blood  stained she threw down the root in terror and fled her husband in despair after failing to find the root tore her in pieces and became a maneater however having baffled all the shikaris english and native he was at last killed by a starving gond who had tempted fate in hope of earning the government reward we have not space even to allude to the many varieties of shooting which may be enjoyed in seonee there is fishing to be had also but the great mahseerthe  indian salmon socalled though he is one of the cyprinidse barbus tordoes not show sport in proportion to his size we have been seriously informed that he rises at the swallows as they skim the surface and may be taken by a hook baited with one but we do not endorse the statement among the characters to whom we are introduced is an old fakir the descendant of taj khan a former pathan ruler of the district whose story is well and touchingly told another story the  legend of the rajah chand sa and of the hundred headless horsemen is a good specimen of the still flourishing art of storytelling we have now probably said enough to show that there is much in this volume which will commend it to a wider circle of readers than that for which it was primarily

B6477,"['6813953', '8899837', '6820597']",  gordon keith by thomas nelson page heinemann us this is a very wearisome piece of fiction it is difficult to classify it there is so much of it that one might call the production a story of incident if the incident were not so overcrowded as to lose much of its interest and most of its point all sorts of things happen such as a mino explosion sundry murders an attack on the 6tage coach a fire in a theatre and so on but they merely happen and we do not feel that it would matter much to though story if they did not happen nor can we consider the book seriously as a study of character although it is cast in a form to suggest that the authors intention was primarily to present the character of gordon keith developing him gradually from a poor and friendless country lad into a muchsoughtafter new york financier here again however mr page seems to us to have failed for he has surrounded his hero with such a medley of minor characters that in attempting to keep their life histories distinct he has ended in obscuring that of his principal actor and the result is that gordon keiths development is occasionally achieved by leaps and bounds that do not convince us for instance the reader is quite unprepared to find this very honourable and upright gentleman as he is so often described suddenly frightening an unknown and pretty young lady in the street by speaking to her without an introductionan incident that would need very careful and artistic treatment to render it convincing again we have only the authors word for it that new york has such a detrimental effect upon his heros ideals for the processes of the change wrought in him which should have been interesting are hidden from us the same carelessness of treatment caused perhaps by the same error of having overcrowded his stage with players seems to have prevented the author from making his novel a picture of new york life which it might otherwise have been it is impossible really to construct a definite impression of anything from the maze of different impulses and interests that crowd the pages of  gordon keith  with so much apparent aimlessness and the one thing which might have condoned these various defects of treatment and construction the literary touch is entirely wanting the banality of the style is worthy of any east end melodrama villains speak with  muttered oaths lips curl with contempt eyes  snap with anger  whatever that may mean faces pale and  nostrils dilate and parthian arrows are shot at discretion i will unmask him says keith of the principal villain on one occasion  and we cannot help feeling that a hero who uses this sort of language has no place in the literary novel  gordon keitit by thomas nelson page i neinemann tnis book contains 436 pages of small type it is emphatically a story and its writer is beyond doubt a storyteller that is something indeed it is a good deal in these days of book making and of literary attenuation but the reviewer is bound to say he finds mr page over prolix at the same time there should be thousands of omnivorous novelreaders in england who find no story too long so it be all story and not mere slices of description padded out with moralizing and gordon keith is all story it is the biography of an american the son of a courtly southern gentleman whose childhood is passed in the afluence which pertained to large plantations before the war but whose life after childhood is one long battle for wealth and for recognition in the less restful society of the north the heros father at an early stage of the tale is acting as a sort of bailiff for the new york parvenu who has bought his mansion in the south the hero himself picks up his education at odd times chiefly through the generosity of old friends of his family and becomes in turn schoolmaster stagecoach driver mining engineer and financial magnate we hasten to add that the reader is given the full benefit of his various love affairs and that he was a catholic lover of the sex there are also vivid pictures of life in southern villages in newly uprisen cities among the mountains and in the select heart of the society ruled by the millionaires of new york there are even pictures of life in fashionable circles in england but here and here only the author is wisely brief and he does not show any particular knowledge of english society the best pictures in the book are those of more or less wild life but mr page handles the highflown sentiment of the south its romance and its courtliness with a certain broad effectiveness no doubt he is verbose and prolix but he undeniably has a great deal to tell altogether the circulating libraries might accord this book their cordial support despite the fact that its author has done much better work upon a smaller scale  gordon keith by thomas nelson page an unusually long novol by the author of in ole virginia the story opens before the war between north and south in america in which gordon keiths father lost his estates and ends with the recovery of the ancestral property the book is rather overcrowded with characters and has an oldfashioned air particularly where lovemaking is concerned it is however a careful piece of work heinemann 6s,britain_contra

describes the experiences of real life it is difficult to believe that the author is not recalling scenes through which ho has himself passed robert dalbys early days contain very similar incidents to those with which our street urchins are familiar but the interest of the story liesin the healthy and successful struggle of the boy with the difficulties of his position and in the love of art which prompted him to the effort narratives of this kind whether wholly true in fact or merely true to nature are always interesting and suggestive we like to hear of any boy who has fought his way upward in life and won distinction and we like especially to hear of one whose efforts have been lrompted by a passion for literature or art robert dalbys experiences are manifold he starts in life as a pariah gets his schooling from an old woman who when death overtakes her ii compelled to die in the tlar k biing too poor to afford a candle is employed by a dogfancier learns to read when a wh hatsboy oil a ropewalk becomes a swineherd then a kind of mudlark after which he is promoted by a relative and sells vegetables and tripe all this it will bel said is prosaic enough and so it would be if the story ran in the same groove throughout but dalby has an artists soul and in spite of this handtomouth lifo manages to cultivate his taste and to develop his genius there is poetry in the effort and the enthusiasm which urges him onward will attract the readers sympathy the boy lives for a long time upon twopence a day and eats his meals in the streets in one of the narrow lanes of the city which is no doubt intended for oxford lives an excellent french artist whose windows are filled with pencil drawings dalby has already tried oil painting and in the opinion of his critic the old woman with whom he lives has produced a poor melancholy daub the pencil sketches charm the boy and day after day it is his wont to take his meals within sight of them  i had given up painting in despair but i might succeed with the lead pencil notwithstanding intently i gazed on each sketch and anxiously noticed each peculiarity of style and the more i looked the more my interest increased and day by day the thought and hope of becoming an artist took stronger hold of me and became more firmly fixed in my mind one day to his horror ialby discovers a caricature of himself in the artists window  the resemblance was not to be mistaken there stood the little browncoat charity boy with an enormous piece of bread eating on both sides of his mouth simultaneously and forming on the whole the most ridiculous counterpart that could be obtruded on my conscious gsaze meanwhile the frenchman stands behind his screen to witness the boys amusement but he has mistaken the lad who bursts into tears at the sight the drawingmaster is sorry makes acquaintance with him and discovers that in heart at least he is like himself an artist so he invites him to his table and to his studio gives him pencils paper indiarubber and chalks and better still laid in my heart the beginning of that faith in goodness which has never since left me henceforth the boys career in spite of great vicissitudes is marked out as that of an artist and connoisseur in the course of it he learns the art of carving in stone and in wood he becomes a picture restorer gains the friendship of a print collector and acquires the secrets of his craft and at length having established himself as a picture buycr marries and settles in the hague and according to the custom in orthodox storybooks lives happily ever afterwards in passing through these different stages dalby falls into grotesque positions and meets with eccentric characters which are described with humour and graphic force the tale on the whole is real and lifelike but it has one defect robert dalby notwithstanding his associates and his education is represented as a youth of imnaculate virtue in the most trying circumstances he acts wisely and with moral propriety temptation never overpowers him difficulties never daunt him he makes no blunders and incurs no blame his acquaintances speedily became friends and almost every one who knows him is ready to do him good service there is something here flattering to human nature but is it natural no doubt there are many good fellows in the world and much true kindliness of heart no doubt too that genuine merit gains appreciation but robert dalbys world must be different from ours or he possesses the happy knack of overlooking his own foibles and the failings of his friends perhaps however i am forgetting that the book is thrown into the form of a novel and must not be regarded as a genuine auto biography joitx dexxis  robert dalby and his world of troubles being thejearly days of a connoisseur chapman  hall   robert dalby is on the whole a pleasant and wellwritten book its author does not quito overcome the difficulties which all taletellers must encounter who have a special object apart from the delineation of human life and character we take more interest in the life of robert dalby as a man than as an artist and sometimes feel that the narrative is arrested for the sake of developing the artprogress of its hero still patience is not too severely tried for the incidents in the book are numerous and though not overcharged are such as secure attention the style too is graphic and at times poetical without a tinge of exaggeration the rise of robert dalby from a condition of absolute want in the slums of oxford to comfort and independence as a professional connoisseur i3 told with great animation and with an effect all the more real because there is nothing about it ambitious or tricky the autobiographer thus sets out with touching and homely truth an

grandfather is very ill go to the grocers and get a rushlight what a thing it is not to have a bit of candle good god what shall i do  let the child lie in his bed said my grandfather  it will give

christmaseve the place will be crammed up to twelve oclock it was as my poor old guardian surmised the shop was full gathered about the counter stood a number of town people and college servants chatting with the grocer and his assistants who took no more notice of my order than if a cur had barked in the street oh that i had then possessed a little of that shrewdness which adversity has since taught me will any one believe me when i say it that it never struck me to go to another shop for my candle  but then i was only six years old with desperate efforts i made ever and anon for the counter and called out  a penny rushlight if you please sir au in vain i was elbowed by the fat college servants and gyps then would i shrink back in silence and endure for a time such agony of suspense as i have never since felt i tried the master i tried the dainty assistants i tried the porter all equally in vain large orders came tumbling in and i had in every instance to give way to my betters at length the clock struck twelve and the place became almost vacant only three old stagers remained determined to empty a bottle of brandy with the grocer before they sought their homes now again i rushed to the counter for they were rattling up the shutters and preparing to close at length my tremulous voice took effect the porter heard me  god bless my soul he exclaimed so as to be heard by the others if i dont believe this poor boy has been asking for a candle three mortal hours by the clock  a splendid order said the college butler  will cause a rise in tallow observed the grocers assistant  may be said the porter in an undertone to the foppish assistant  that the boy may prove as good a customer as some of the best of em tonight at least he pays for bis candle while some of your dons who order a cartload of goods take a world of credit and some of em never pay at allsaying which he handed me the candle after all the poor lad lets the candle slip from though paper

B1243,['6176712'],  the bride elect 3 vols newby this novel without any very great pretensions or lofty aim certainly merits perusal and that is more than can be predicated of the majority of the works of fiction that have appeared this autumn some indeed are so utterly flimsy that we have not deemed it worth while to honour them even with a passing comment the object of the authoress is to expose thc worthlessness and criminality of that most fri volous and despicable animal a male flirt there certainly can be but one opinion on such a subject consequently no amount of odium will be deemed too great to mark the infamy of such wretches fortunately however at the present day they are not found to exist in any considerable numbers mrs ashton the widow of a general had possessed great beauty which her three daugh tera inherited they resided in a pretty villa at kensington were well connected well introduced and enjoyed sufficient means to enable them to indulge in many of the amenities of life mrs ashtons income being however entailed on a nephew it was incumbent upon herin the phraseology of the worldto get her daughters married as speedily as practicable for her sake as well as their own three fair and accomplished damsels mixing much in society of course elicited considerable admiration and ashton villa was the constant resort of a number of danglersmen as we find them here designated of unmeaning attentions or pertaining to the detrimental race the only check upon these frivolous and injurious intimacies was found in a bachelor uncle a mr percy ashton who looking upon his sisterinlaw as a weak fool and his nieces as romantic simpletons was constantly taking them to task upon the subject the old gentleman estimating in its proper light the conduct of these idlers from having half a century previously occupied himself in a similar disreputable manner a beau of the old school mr percy ashton was a small man very erect and with a head so bald that his very large organs of selfesteem and combativeness stood out in alarming relief he was a very fair man naturally and the few hairs time had not thought it worth his while to steal were like his eyebrows and eyelashes snowy white  his eyes were of the lightest blue and of a keen phosphoric brightness  bis teeth beautifully white and even his hands soft fair and taper as the most delicate ladys and kept with a nicety almost feminine in its precision  for unless the halfmoon of each pink and filbert nail was clearly defined old percy ashton was in a perfect fidget in his dress he was as particular as in his person no speck of dust or mud was ever seen on his black dresscoat of superfine cloth his pantaloonsfor ho scorned trousers  or his glistening shoes his linen seemed as if it had been got up by the fairies so fine so white so clear and the plaits of his frilled shirt and small ruffles so even and minute he was very proud of a fine leg and a small and beautiful foot and with the singular whiteness of his face and hands his snowy linen and exquisite neatness and cleanliness his brilliant brooch and ring and his very courtly and aristocratic bearing no one could pass him unnoticed or fail to regret that so very few specimens remain of the london gentleman of the old school he was a constant visitor at the little villa and a great favourite with his pretty nieces penelope blanche and isabel each of whom had respectively for cavalier bernard brydges trevor templeton and captain beresford although extremely assiduous in flirtation none of these gentlemen are in any degree earnest in their attentions yet each poor girl fancies that her young affections are ardently reciprocated hy her pseudo lover and firmly believes that the all important proposal is only deferred on account of some temporary obstacle bernard brydges is a young man of prcpos sessing exterior fascinating manners small means and no expectations trevor templeton an undergraduate at oxfordthough a very bad specimen of his classresembles brydges in several respects but has the additional advantage of a wealthy uncle with a daughter and a rich advowson both from his earliest youth destined for himself beresford depicted with the ordinary conventional characteristics of that class of army men who have no intention of seeing service is besides a litterateur in a small way with an opinion of himself by no means justified by his successes as an author all three are vain selfish and unprincipled to a degree caring little what pain they may inflict on such hapless maidens as may fall in their way so long as they amuse themselves and add to the boasted number of their victims old percy well aware of the danger his fair protegees are daily incurring cautions them and their mother as to their conduct at a ball and at the same time takes occasion to inveigh strongly against that ungraceful and odious mixture of a jig and a hug the polkaa dance now happily all but banished by the good sense of the community to thirdrate coteries and casinos percy ashton loquitur the polka at the last ball i went toa fancy balla powdered beau of george the seconds time was polking with a pretty swiss peasant with braided black hair anda bunch of scarlet flowers in her bosom  her black hair was powdered too before the end of the polka and on his white satin waistcoat embroidered with gold the print of her scarlet flowers was taken as by transfer i leave you to judge what sort of a dance that must have been how the ladys and gentlemans heads must have come together and how close must have been the contact to leave on his breast the print of the flowers in hers oh its odious its degrading its indecent even and worse still its vulgar ugly inelegant a girl never looks so awkwarknever seems so littleas when shes being jogged along in the hideous innovation on all our national feelingsi will not say prejudices in england too its so badly done such a clumsy exaggeration such a caricature oh ive no patience with it it has been remarked that since the polka came into fashion matrimony has gone out spinsters are alarmingly on the increase and i dont wonder at it as the cleverest woman i know said to me at that same ballthe girls of the present day begin where we used to leave off i e with an embrace the severest thing that has been said yet well said isabel i quite agree with uncle percy and that is the reason i never will dance the polka the authoress is especially severe against this dance and on another occasion observes  i do believe that odious polka has put the finishing stroke to womans influence and mans reverence for the sex it has broken down the wild sweetbriery fence it is so much to beautys interest to keep unimpaired it throws her a cheap burthen into the arms of a succession of supercilious puppies and it is so very inelegant a dance that she loses caste not only with her partner but with all the men who look on to sneer but not to admire  well it is a vulgar ugly dance enough and ouch a bore i dont care how soon it goes out im no very devoted squire of dames and really i do not wish to carry a heavy girl in a sort of halfjig

more richly endowed in every way to be the partner of your fortune and the mistress of your establishment but i shall feel proud to be the wife of one so good and noble and henceforth my chief study will be to make myself worthy of the honour you have done me had mr addington been more experienced in womankind he would have known that this kind fluent and amiable language was not that of a fond weak womans heart but of a clever womans head there was none of the faltering confusion the fascinating tautology the fearful joythe fear the shame the bliss almost painful in its intensity the thoughts too deep for utterance the feelings all too delicate for words mr addington was far too much in love all banker as he was to have a notion at that moment except of his own rapture and his brides condescension he tried to take the hand she extended to him he tried to speak his gratitude but he was far too much overcome for eloquence and so after exclaiming  oh miss ashton iyouall the

residing at brighton she contrives and obtains more than one interview with the man who still holds undivided possession of her heart hoping that she may yet induce him to aid her in escaping from a fate in spite of its brilliancy becoming more odious the nearer it approaches she could bear that bernard should know she was going to marry mr addington she could not endure the thought that he should fancy she loved him she wished to be embalmed in his memory as a victim she could not tolerate the thought of figuring there as the contented prosperous affectionate wife of a middleaged banker and yet how could she undeceive him  had he not seen her weeping by mr addingtons side his arm round her waist her head on his shoulder what agony she felt at the idea that he would never believe that she had sacrificed herself it soon transpires however that brydges real object in haunting the same part of the country as his poor inamorata is not alas his love for her but a strong affection he has lately conceived for the shekels of miss addington a spinster of mature age frivolous disposition and very small personal attractions but with a reputed fortune of 70000 he contrives to obtain an introduction to the mother and an invitation to the same house in which penelope is staying poor miss ashton suddenly misinterprets the vile deceivers motives one day looking from her window mistaken motives she saw dora ridiculously overdressed and assuming the most jaunty coquetry of manner sporting about the lawn and along the shrubberies with bernard brydges she was followed by a little snowwhite french poodle that penelope had never seen before and which lier jealous heart suggested bernard had perhaps given but as she dressed herself in a new and elegant costume and as the glass reflected her cheeks hushed with emotion her eyes tull of passionate fire her form so proud and so perfect and the beauty over which love shed a lustre love alone can shed she contrasted her own exquisite grace and beauty with the little unshapen form gaudy attire sandy hair weak eyes and quaint absurdity of the figure ambling by bernards side and she felt ashamed of her own momentary jealousy had she in weighing herself and dora in the scale just put in seventy thousand pounds on doras sidethat sum in which bernard brydges whole soul is in reality wrapped uphow different would her

cupidity one of these epistles to bernard brydges in penelopes hand is at last discovered and causes a frightful catastrophe the unlucky missive insisted on a meeting and an explanation early the following morning miss ashton appointed the place and she had determined to impart to her quondam admirer her resolution to break off the match with mr addington and to insist on bernards leaving her for ever unless he chose to accept the sacrifice she was so eager to make and to elope with her himself bernard brydges had however arranged a meeting of much more importance in his eyes mr addington and his mother came to the trysting place instead the eclaircis9ement it was a summerhouse that overlooked the road to london she waited for some time in miserable anxiety and impatience and bernard brydges did not come she began to fear he had deceived her burning shame dyed her cheeks anger and despair lighted her eyes and fired her breast she was about to leave the spot when the sound of carriagewheels in though road beneath attracted her attention  a postchaise and four dashed by the blinds were drawn down but one was suddenly raised and the face of dora looked up at the summerhouse yes dora waved her hand triumphantly to the bride elect bernard brydges shrank back in the carriage and hastily pulled down the blind penelope did not see his face but she did see his hand his white

halfwitted heiressno no there could be no doubt hannah is in the rumble with some jeering valet and both look up aud both laugh yes she sees them both laugh as fixed like a statue of despair her hair

who generously allows the newlymarried couple 2007 a month to be paid to her so long as they lived happily together but to be paid to her alone if a separation should at any time take place between them we shall leave our readers to discover for themselves the histories of isabel and blanche together with the fate of their two graceless lovers merely adding that the respectable banker unites himself and his fortune to the amiable daughter of a poor clergyman the poor girl having long secretly entertained a passion for him the novel is written in an amusing style though here and there we detect errors not unfrequent in works of the class to which this pertains the more prominent attributes of the male characters in order that they may appear more striking are overdrawn and the language they are now and then made to utter is such as could never in reality have been used by gentlemen imagine for a moment any oxford man above the rank of a college  scout accosting the young lady to whom he is presumed to be paying his addresses in such insulting words as these  i say blanche whats the matter with pen  has bernard brydges moved off and has the old lady been kicking up a shindy  i could have told them bernard was no go ihe s not made for double harness and with all his pretence of love and sentiment tin is his idol and by jove he s righttake my word for it such expressions would hardly be tolerated in the servants hall at any rate no lady with english blood in her veins would ever admit a second time to her boudoir a brute who could demean himself thus grossly we might quote several other passages of a similar character but we shall content ourselves with one it is an extract from a letter of the same oxford man 441 say old boy dont you wish she may

there are however other perhaps somewhat more venial errors which should also be sedulously avoided on future occasions since they can only be attributable to the ignorance of the writer or the carelessness of the printers  reader the authoress in her dedication to her brother professes  a truly feminine reverence for his finished scholarship c c we think it would not be amiss were she the

B2843,"['6839920', '9460203']",  fiction et the roof fall iii by frank danby hutchinson i 6s we seem to remember that some time ago frank danby gave vent to her determination that she would never publish another novel fortunately like all ladies no sooner did she vow she would never do so than she at once sat down and began writing this extraordinarily fine piece of work what she has accomplished in it has not been merely making the book so interesting that once taken up it is impossible to leave it till finishedthat any firstclass journalist could readily have done what she has done is to give us food both for fruitful and useful thought rare qualities in a writerand to arouse and engage some of our finest emotionswhich implies the rarest qualities in particular there is a sense of pathos and of tragedy running throughout thi6 tale that again and again leaves even the male readers eyes in a moist condition to which he is often loath to confess it is a wonderful gift and quite a natural one it does not hit one in the eye like those effects we all know of brent harte which became after his earlier years the simplest imitable mechanism leaving a man not so much moved even as if he had taken too much english mustard with his beef since tolstoys resurrection no such good work has appeared in fiction there are pictures of a certain noinde which is not easy to describe semibohemian wholly wealthy hanging on to the fringe of the best company having shoots sprouting in the uppermost and possibly lowermost strata which is described by frank danby with a spirit and at the same time a contempt that are delightful both to brain and feeling it is brilliant to a degree we have both wit and humour presented for our enjoyment with a lavish hand let us enjoy them and thank whatever gods there be that there are such gifted beings amongst us at the same time it is just possible that people who recognise themselves or more likely are recognised under the guise of mr oscar paton mrs maltravers mr nat simons mr and mrs fred haxted and the rest may not feel quite as pleased however that may be there can be no question that  let the roof fall in  is grand work from every point of view it contains the most vivid descriptions of siam and the siamese mwwrs that we have yet read which is saying a great deal when we remember what admirable fiction has been written by mrs chan toon on that portion of the far east in fact frank danbys descriptive power is perfectly astonishing long ago did she recognise the important truth in lessings  laocoon that a description intended to convey any definite impression must be brief and contain only the indispensable essentials so with equal ease she describes steeplechasing or profound emotions society in siam such as it is or an elaborate dinnerparty in london the soul of an irishwoman or the inner workings of the jewish mind and here let it be said that our authoress has created no more lovable character than that of mossy leon we recognise we thinkwith such modifications and variations as she has thought fit to introduce into that character necessary in a work of art most oftenthe original and we think the original had he been now alive instead of being cut off prematurely would have laughed his most genial of laughs when he read frank danbys portraiture so far as it applied to him the love of brains apart from any other quality moral or immoral which is surely characteristic of the mysterious hebrew people is most typically exemplified in this figure there is indeed an extraordinary love not only of intellect and genuine emotion but also of humanity wherever it may be in siam or in ireland in the lowest and in the highest classes revealed in this most admirable book amid the ghastly provincialities and suburbanalitiesto coin a phrase if it may be allowedthat make a great part of english fiction unreadable at the present time except to suburban and provincial c0uls frank danby and mr frank harris are among the few to whom prejudice as such represents a horror and a hindrance to the development of our national art we need say nothing in this connexion about its being an absolute drag on our national life but is it not an amazing fact that whilst french novels however stupid from our point of view are read in the original or in translations in every part of the civilised world nobody except in america dreams of reading either in the original or in translation our english novels of the present day with very few exceptions why is this obviously because we do not appeal to humanity at large but why should we not when our writers have tried conclusions with any other writers in the whole wide world they have not simply equalled but surpassed them is the fault with the public or the writers let that most vital question of our national life be settled as it may authors like those we have already mentioned have long ago earned the gratitude of this country so far as

although several j of these tales are pleasant in themselves there is scarcely one of them which is not traceable in its elements if not in its concoc  tion the adventure of my uncle for instance is in character and locality a loan from the introduction to quentin durward  the german student is an avowed piece of borrowing and if we recollect aright the only thing not borrowed is a sneer at german mysticism and the destructive fervour of mind and fluctuation of principle prevalent at the era of the french revolution from the tale entitled the mysterious picture in this collection we expected something forcible in the development but it exceedingly disappoints and to say the truth mr irving is not a man to deal with the whirlwind of passionthose tempests of mind which strip human nature of its surface and discover the primary anatomy of the soul to say nothing of length and importance of mrs ratcliffe who did all that a woman can do in this department mn irving must not pretend to bear up the train by far the best piece in this commencing portion of the storytelling is  the bold dragoon related in the person of an irish captain of cavalry it is airy and pleasant in the extreme although from an author not so entirely on the right sideawe might suspect the purity of its morality tm materiel of the next division which is entitled  buckthome and his wends is

clinker as given by himself to his corps of reviewers it is pleasant in reference to a conversing and a curving partner in the persons of the bookselling firm who give this dinner but we can only say that if the lofty mr murray has told mr irving that he arranges bis guests above and below the salt in the form of a russian noblemans table at which the visitors at the lower end drink inferior wine while those at the head swallow claret he has satirised himself more than his said guests and his laureate and crispinusses more than his  poor devils the oftentold story of a vain young man of common powers coming to london with a manuscript in his pocket which is to make his fortune sinking finally into a hackney writer of all work is anything but new and possibly nothing can less resemble the origin of the existing class of inferior yet necessary retainers of the press than mr irvings tale of  the poor devil author a sketch by the way which does the heart of the author no very extraordinary honour was it even favourable to his head in point of fact the general verisimilitude of all this has gone by and for a very mercantile reasonthere is a more general demand in the market the history of buckthome a supposed mercenary of a higher class is in his character of a dependant on the press a perfect nullity and as to all the rest of him it is hammered out of the adventures of

B3969,['8613500'],  a pair of blue eyes a rair of blue eyes by thomas hardy author of  far from the madding crowd london c kegan paul and co the appearance of mr hardys first threevolume novel in a popular form may be made the occasion for another word of criticism on it mr hardys work is of that solid kind which bears and deserves repeated reading and repeated criticism there are no novelists of our time not excepting even george eliot who put more  brains more intellectual effort into their novels in the last resort all novelists must be paid by the interest of their results and a novelist like any other conscientious labourer may work very hard and yet not succeed in producing an interesting result it is for the general public to judge whether or not works of art are to their taste success is the test of that cardinal merit but there is another meritthe merit of setting up a high standard of artistic perfection and labouring dili gently to reach it the merit of earnest devotion to the higher aims of an art which deserves independent recognition and this merit mr hardy may fairly claim his novels may be said to have a narrower scope a more confined horizon than george eliots because hitherto at least he does not seem to have concerned himself with those problems of the influence of race creed or pursuits upon character which engage so much of the attention of the authoress of  daniel deronda and  middlemarch both novelists are intensely occupied with character but while george eliot studies chiefly the influence upon human beings of their  environment as the philosophers call it and chooses the setting of circumstance to illustrate this mr hardys object is rather to illustrate the influence of one human being upon another the interaction of characters without much regard to how those characters came to be what they are then too there is a vast difference in their way of presenting character to their readers the one is analytic the other is dramaticor rather perhaps we should say narrative george eliot finding her bands full with the exhibition of her various problems evades the labour of bringing out the manifold aspects of a character one by one as they appear to the personages of the story she takes the reader at once into full confidence as to the nature of an individual as soon as she introduces him or her perhaps this is necessary to enable ns to follow her subsequent keen analysis of the influence of circumstances at any rate it is an economy of strength it saves the artist many anxious considerations of construction now so far as an ontside critic can judge these considerations form a large part of mr hardys labours as a novelist ihe labours to make his personages say and do things which mark their characters so unmistakably as not to need analytic comment to make them clear he leaves the discussion of their morality and the philosophic exposition of their motives to the personages themselves arid to his readers and critics his analysis is not served up raw it is incorporated with the story  a pair of blue eyes deals with very simple not to say hackneyed elementselements as old as human nature itself it is only a story of a charming young woman who falls in love with a young man promises to marry him remains faithful to her promise for some time while he seeks fortune abroad but contracts in spite of herself a still stronger passion for a man of greater force and weight of character after a struggle forsakes the old love for the new and pays a terrible penalty for her faithlessness elfride swancourt is the daughter of a country clergyman of an oldfashioned type their church is to be restoredi  awnd a young architect stephen smith is sent down to nelestow to make drawings his appearance is prepossessing mr swancourt takes to him greatly during the few days of his stay at the vicarage leaves hlim much alone with elfride and invites blin back naturally the young people fall in love but before stephen a youth of twenty obtains a promise from elfride he considers it his duty to tell herself arid her father that lie is the son of a mason in their own parish this at once changes the aspect of affairs she still loves him and will marry him at any sacrifice bat the father who had proved to stephen out of the landed gentry that lie was one of the fitzmaurice smiths and of a very old county family will imot hear of the match the two wise young persons lay their heads together and conclude that tile surest means of ensuring mutual constancy during the years of separation that must elapse before stephen makes lhis fortune is to mnarry before they separate elfride after much hesitation undertakes a journey with stephen for that purpose but at the last monient she hesitates turns and comes back without having the ceremony performed stephen goes to india and that is the end of act the first in act the second mr henry knight appears on the scene a barrister and essayist and the act is occupied with hiis gradual substitution in the affections of elfride in place of the image of the absent stephen it is not withsout a struggle that this substitntion is effected and mr hardy traces all the incidents of the struggle with the most patient and unerring art our readelrs will rememberthe skillwitli which george eliot analyses the changeful impulses that sway her gwendoline in daniel deronda now in one3 direction now in another mir hardys analysis is almost more elaborate and not less plausibly true to nature although lie never appears to be analysing but lets us see the various impulses at work and all the i time he never lifts the poetic nimbus from the head of his heroine not a word or an action of hers is out of tune with the keynote struck by the quotation on the titlepagea violet in the youth of prinmy nature forward not permanent sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute no more no prosepoet ever excelled mr hardy in justifying the ways of women we do not blame elfride although in the ordinary and safe language of everyday life she would be called a jilt we pity but do not blame being made to feel how inevitable it was that she should act as she did that in spite of her sense of duty the stronger man should supplant the weaker in her love we admit the danger of the principle as a rule of life we see mischief ahead in its applications but we do not blame elfride besides she suffers tragically for her want of truth when mir knighta somewhat impossible monster a man of thirtytwo who has never kissed a woman in his life except his own mother and has resolved that he will never marry unless he finds some girl who has never been in love beforediscovers that elfride has concealed her little episode with stephen which she did out of pure excess of love and fear lest she should lose her hero he roughly casts her off she marries another in careless despair but only to die a few months after her marriage mir hardy with proper respect for art does not obtrude physiological considerations but at various points in the story he records without insisting upon certain consumptive symptoms and we are left to infer that the excitement of her troubled experiences of love were too much for her fragile constitution every chapter in mir hardys novels proclaims him a masterly analyst of character who does not wield a scalpel but resembles rather those daring pathologists of the middle ages who saw by direct vision into the interior of the human mechanism he possesses the negative quality common to all the greatest masters in our literaturethe absence of cynicism there is not a trace of cynicism in his novels lie can draw cynical characters but his own outlook is from a different standpoint even the cynic he draws with the same unfailing sympathy and tenderhearted consideration with which he regards the rest of the personages that lie puts in motion on his wellappointed

B9059,['9433186'],  1 kissing the rod a novel by edmund yates i 3 vols tinsley brothers the fourth novel which mr yates has published within one year and eight months kissing the rod like the three earlier tales sets forth the griefs and trials of a heroine who partly through her own fault and partly through the fault of others is driven to cry woe on the day when first she saw her destined husband without shutting our eyes to the existence of a great number of unhappy marriages we are inclined to think that mr yates exaggerates the dangers of matrimony and that by thus harping on one string he is likely to give false views to his readers moreover on the present occasion the compassionate defender of unhappy wives does not plead the cause of desolate and distressed ladies with his usual pathos and discretion the unhappy and runaway wife of  broken to harness  was ti veritable woman and her woe was all the more credible because it was mainly due to her own querulous and discontented nature the shamefullymisused wife of  running the gauntlet was a gentlewoman whose virtues were so excellently portrayed that our belief in her goodness helped us a good way towards belief in the brutality of her husband in  land at last the miserable wife evoked such strong abhorrence by her crimes and roused such strong sympathy for the victims of her wickedness that whilst the novel was being read she imposed herself as a barely possible prodigy of sin on the readers excited imagination but no one can believe in the existence of katharine guyon the heroine of the present talewho marries a rich billdiscounter without loving him who after the fashion of the heroine in  broken to harness first runs from and is then reconciled to her peccant husband and who like the wronged wife of running the gauntlet is freed from her bondage by the sudden death of her master the contradictions and inconsistencies that mark the delineations of all the persons who in any way influence kath rine increase the difficulties of the reader who conscientiously labours to think of her as a real human creature she is said to be the daughter of a man of fashion and to move in a very fashionable get of westend idlers but when the reader is introduced to her social circle he finds it a dissipated shabby debtencumbered clique of noisy fastliving people whose sole connexion with the world of fashion is their tenancy of bouses in a fashionable quarter of town it is a society in which israelitish moneylenders and uproarious brokers are received with open arms ned guyon the

billdiscounters and on selling his daughter to bob streightley an odious city man hastens to suck from his rich soninlaw the means for gratifying his grossly vicious tastes it cannot be that mr yates attributes  fashion to all persons who live west of regent street and are rich enough to give good dinners his haste with regard to  county society is not less remarkable having married ned guyons lovely daughter to a plebeian billdiscounter and placed them in an old county hall which bob streightley has obtained in the way of his business mr yates represents the young j s couple as being

in one way superior even to that delight of boyhood walter thornburys old stories retold for wherever the editor has been able the very words of the actors or spectators of forgotten and unearthed

his tale the histories which mr cable his saved from the wreckand his account of their discovery and verification is not the least interesting chapter  thus fall into two classes first and foremost those in which he reproduces an authentic ms and secondly those in which in default of such a treasure he has serged up an orally transmitted legend with his own sauce and garnish mr cable is himself the first to admit the greater value of the firsthand paperspriceless jewels all rough and uncut such as are not found thrice in a century and unlike stones of mere shining dust would only lose in value if tampered with by the lapidary but before these are noteed the three tales from mr cables own pen deserve honourable mention of  salome muller  the haunted house in royal street and  attalie brouillard the last is the best and the first as decidedly the weakest  salome muller  is loosely and lengthily spun ou end is hardly worthy of so skilled a practitioner as mr cable it also makes too heavy a call upon our interest in the extinct legal luminaries of new orleans fifty years ago too much is said about these phantoms and they are no convincingly reanimated  though the advocate christian roselius deserves his niche for his long duel in behalf of a most injured woman frankly what attracts us most in this and the succeeding stories is less the story itself than mr cables own combination of sympathies artistic sympathy with all the figures upon his canvas be they spirits black white or grey and personal sympathynever warping his artistic presentation but constantly shining through it with the millions of the victimised colour this note is sounded yet more clearly in the horrible story of the haunted house no one could soon forget the picture of the negro child flying over roof and stairway from the cowhide lash of its charming and accomplished mistress madame lalaurie till  there came a dull jarring thud in the paved court beneath  as a specimen of mr cables

complexion a dull clay colour spattered with large red freckles his eyes small grey and close together his hair not long or bushy but hesitating between a dull yellow and a hot red his clothes his own

half or wholly dead after the girls have changed their tumbled and dusty clothes the dance of death and resurrection begins lt is executed as follows a tree is planted at one side of a danciiigtloor in the open air and upon it is fixed a burning candle in a lantern the size of which is determined by the will of the groomsman or by the state of the weather in the centre of the dancingfloor stands a table with a few chairs upon it for the musicians all the young men and girls who have taken part in the festivity assemble round the tree where the newly married pair also stand the music strikes up at a signal from the groomsman who dances with the bride they are followed by the bridegroom with the bridesmaid and then by all the other couples in succession the walt tune proper to this occasion is plaintive languishing and quaint at every third turn the dancers change partners that is the man stops leaves his partner and otters his arm to the next following girl while his partner passes on to the young man immediately preceding her only the bridegroom must on no account dance with his bride when her turn comes he makes her a bow and passes on to the nest nor may any one dance faster or slower than tue rest because usually various objects such as watches kerchiefs and the like are the prizes of the couples first in due succession this dance continues under the control of a strongfisted master of the ceremonies until the taper is burnt out the purpose of this dance is that the married couple should now for the last time dance with others the moment the taper goes out the leader cries  dead  the music ceases and the partners bow and curtsy to each other a gallopade strikes up and the bridegroom kisses his partner three times as often as they pass the tree the bride is treated in like manner by her partner after a certain time the tune suddenly changes the biidegrooin embraces bis partner and the bride is embraced by hers and both couples bid each other an eternal farewell and this is to be the last kiss that man or wife are ever to receive from strange lips the kissed pair that is to say the lucky youth who was dancing with the bride and the girl who was waltzing with the bridegroom when the taper went out are attended to their homes by the company and the music  and it frciucntly happens that they really become a pair by marriage in due time this is

original in plot perhaps although the central dramatic point of a deliberate overdose of morphia given to put an end to hopeless pain is far from being commonplace the main interest of the story lies in the development of the characters of amherst and bessy and here there is just a point of criticism to be made bessy and amherst fall hopelessly in love with each other so hopelessly on her side that she is willing temporarily at any rate to sacrifice her own interests to the object of his life the improvement of the conditions of labour at her mills her nature is not strong enough to endure

order to achieve his social and economic ideals but mrs wharton does not we think mean this in fact she clearly hintsthat their marriage was due to love mainly if not alone amhersts attitude towards his wife is therefore slightly inconsistent and his character is weakened accordingly in justine we are also a little disappointed at first she is intensely interestinga strong and compelling picture

present day who have practised the worship of all things japanese with a devotion hitherto unknown and who have done their very best to live up to their blue china ought to be rejoiced to welcome a translation of a japanese novel it is all very well to rave about the artistic productions of china and japan most artistic people confuse these two countries together in the most delightful manner but any knowledge of the literature of either land is unfortunately denied to any but the very limited number of scholars who can decypher the fantastic characters in which chinese philosophers and japanese poets have enshrined their thoughts true the chinaloving world has always been more or less intimately acquainted with that most precious and perfect flower of all romances the pathetic tale which lives upon willowpattern plates and which mr andrew lang has lately put into verse that all higherculture folk should know by heart heres a pot with a cot in a park in a park where the peachblossoms blew where the lovers eloped in the dark lived died and were changed into two bright birds that eternally flew through the boughs of the may as they sang tis a tale was undoubtedly true in the reign of the emperor liwang but this tale does not fascinating though it is satisfy all the cravings of the literary mind it was a great epoch therefore for those who were suffering under the acutest form of the anglojapanese mania when mr mitford published his  tales of old japan which were exceedingly charming and deservedly successful amongst these tales was a story perhaps the most thrilling of all the tales called the fortyseven ronins a more expanded form of this tale translated by mr frederick dickins with the title of  chiusingura or the loyal league was published in new york about four years ago and it is this translation which has just been republished with the same curious illustrations which are perhaps the most interesting examples of japanese art we have seen as in most other romances whether in fiction or in real life from the siege of troy to the latest thing in society scandal a woman was of course the chief cause of all the strange and fateful events which are set forth in the history of  the loyal league if the great moronaho count of musashi had not been foolish enough to fall in love with the lady kawovo the wife of yenya hanguwan he would not have quarrelled with the husband as he did nor have compassed his death in so crafty and cruel a manner but love that was first and last of all things made as we have it on the authority of mr swinburne so overmastered the heart of the shiutto for such was moronahos august title that he picked a quarrel with yenya hanguwan had him committed to prison and so arranged it that the unfortunate yenya was sentenced to perform the  happy despatch which he did invoking vengeance upon his murderer as a consequence his clansmen and retainers became ronins that is to say clansmen who were no longer in the service of a master and who lived a sort of lawless independent life as the chief of these clansmen yuranosoke was known to be very devoted to yenya and to have been present at his death when he invoked vengeance on the head of his murderer moronaho felt some alarm lest yuranosoke should attempt to avenge his master but to the surprise of every one yuranosoke seemed after his masters death to forget all about the occurrence and to be in no way moved by thoughts of vengeance he lived a careless dissolute life in which wine and lighthearted loveaffairs played a prominent part and generally conducted himself with such devotion to pleasure and such complete indifference to the memory of his murdered lord that moronahos suspicions were quite allayed and he ceased to trouble himself with any fears of revenge on the part of yuranosoke this was exactly what yuranosoke had wished he had assumed the manner of an abandoned man of pleasure merely to deceive moronaho going so far as to speak with indifference of the unavenged yenya before some servants of moronahos whom the shiutto had sent to spy upon him but when he perceived that moronahos fears were quite lulled he collected around him all the ronins who loved their masters memory and who thirsted for revenge and they plotted together how to take moronahos life after many and careful preparations they succeed in entering his castle by stealth at night and after a desperate resistance on the part of his men they succeed in capturing and killing moronaho whose head they cut off in triumph their lord is avenged the loyal league of the faithful ronins has accomplished its purpose  for ever and ever thus the tale concludes  shall the memory endure of these faithful clansmen and in the earnest hope that the story of their loyalty full bloom of the bambooleaf may remain a bright example as long as the dynasty of our rulers shall last has the following tale of their heroism been writ down in the  chiusingura nothing is certainly told of the final end of the ronins but in the story of the fortyseven ronins which is practically the same narrative we learn that for a long time the authorities were perplexed to know what to do with them so great was the sympathy felt everywhere for the brave men who had avenged their chieftain but that they were finally condemned to seppiku that is to killing themselves in a body which they accordingly accomplished at the tomb of their beloved lord lthis curious and powerful story is told at a length that will seem rather wearisome to european readers but anyone who has the patience to go steadily through the story of the  loyal league will feel well rewarded at the end by the exceeding beauty of many passages and the lofty if somewhat misguided heroism which animates the whole purpose of the tale the language is often very poetic indeed and the similes which abound in it are frequently very felicitous what happier and more poetic

curiously lacking we have in either case to take the heros affection very much for granted and can hardly understand the motive or more correctly speaking the impulse leading to his action yet although somervilles character is hinted rather than portrayed we feel as the story progresses that there is unexpected cleverness in the superficial indication of the artistic kindly selfish temperament the book has little jretension to literary merit and the apanese words which besprinkle the pages are sometimes translated sometimes left in a whole sentence to the readers intuition in

their notice something a little novel in novels we have now before us a transatlantic tale a sketch of men and manners in america not caricatured by an englishman but a picture of life during the war etched by one of them selves the great contest brought out in strong relief the broad contrasts of character which naturally exist among the people of the great republic sprung from so many sources and actuated by such various feelings and interests the author has availed himself of the abundance of material which he found at hand to keep alive the interest of his book by placing before us a vast variety of characters all skilfully hit off each with a very distinctive individuality no two of his actors being at all alike and even the supernumeraries having their appropriate characteristics it is long since we have met with a book which has presented to us so many amusing people the author has the art of lavishing goodness upon his favourites without making them insipid while he justly gibbets the mean and the vicious and shows the weakness of vice the great events of the war contribute their quota of amusement and furnish abundance of incidents telling situations startling sensations without the necessity in any instance of having recourse to a strained effect or improbable adventure no doubt we look at all the circumstances from a loyal point of view but if a federal officer lends us his glass we must be content to see the objects in the field as he points them out  secession however has a fair champion in the lovely heroine whose  conversion  gives a name so the story this conversion is effected in the early chapters of the tale in what would be the first volume of a novel got up a lartglaise let us here note a slight preference for the one handsome volume in which this work is given to the world it dates indeed from her return to secessia the coolness with which she found herself received by her former friends in new orleans the social ostracism to which she was in fact subjected on account of her journey to the north first made her waver in her allegiance and the cowardly way in which her father was attacked on account of his proclaimed loyal sentiments quite shook her faith in her country and effected the miracle which all the arguments of her parent and her northern friends had been powerless to achieve we call upon the father and

pleasant natural style in which the book is written the doctor is a most delightful character so frank and hopeful so generous and highminded devoted to his daughter ever watchful for her welfare yet with an expansiveness which makes him seem the benefactor of mankind his conduct is throughout consistent the strength and weakness of his sanguine temperament are admirably worked out he cannot accept the colonelay of a black regiment because he has no idea of militazy matters i mst confess sid the doctor resuming his seat that this is a most attractive and flattering proposition i am vain

consciences to a decent degree of christian intelligence and virtue i would not exchane my good name for that of a paul or an apollos my only objection to this present plan is the colonelcy i should be in a false position i should feel myself to be ridiculous not that it is ridiculous to be a colonel he explained smiling but to wear the uniform and receive the pay of a colonel without being one ere is the satire now could not that point be evaded could i not be mad superintendent of negro labour without being burdeed with the miluay digmity i really feel some conscientiou scruples on the matter quite aside from my desire not to appear absurd i should be willing to do the work for less pay provided i could escape the livery but he is glad to obtain an appointment in the hospital with the pay of a captain and delighted when he finds the opportunity of making the experiment which terminates so fortunately of organising free black labour it must be understood that he is not a successful man but he is always happy and contented he cannot withhold his consent from his daughters union with the man whom she adores but he distrusts his physical strength breaks down when he discovers his utter worthlessness yet he rouses himself to support and watch over his child how tender is his care for her how devoted his attachment i how pleasant and how playful his manner yet

convalescence the chapter of hardships and privations the weary marches the fsae alarms and the constant watching which try the patience of an army in the field a regular army could hardly have afforded such portraits as were to be found in this volunteer force it required the peculiar circumstances of the time and case to make gazaway a major and to promote him to be lieutenantcolonel you know the secret history of his rehabilitation said he well there is one consolation in the miserable affair he fooled our sly governor you know it was agreed that after gazaway had been whitewashed with a lieutenantcolonelcy he should show his gratitude by carrying his district for our party and then resign to make way for the governors nephew major rathbun but it seems gasaway had his own ideas he knew a trick or two besides saying his bacon on the battlefield his plan was that he should be the candidate for congress from the district hen he found that he couldnt make that work he did the next best thing and held on to his commission wasnt it capital  it pays me for being overlooked daring three years in spite of the recommendations of my colonel and my generals there he is still lieutenantcolonel with the goverors nephew under him to do his fighting and field duty i dont know how gasaway got command of the conscript camp where he has been for the last year i suppose he lobbied for it but i know that he has tutned it to good account one of my sergeants was on detached duty at the camp and was taken behind the scenes he told me that he made two hundred dollars in less than a month and that gazaway must have pocketed ten times as much his poltroonery is as ludicrous as it is disgusting the doctors small attempt at soldiering is sufficiently absurd but the conduct of colbourn in that episode is admirable and the defence of fort winthrop was justly considered one of the most gallant feats of the war what shall we say of colonel carter i that he is a warning a man of great power exercising a strong influence over others mighty in command yet unable to control himself a prey to the meanest temptations unable to refrain from drink incapable of resisting the wiles of an artful woman no wonder he should find himself constantly at his wits ends and be driven to add to his other sins the ungentlemanly one of swindling we have not attempted to give an outline of the tale there is so much matter in it that a very imperfect summary would have exceeded our limits besides we think we shall be more likely to excite the interest of our readers and induce them to turn to the book itself by this slight sketch of some of the leading characters than by a bare epitome of the history i  miss ravenels conversion there is a pleasant franknesssometimes developing into pure  cheek in this book which lends to it a certain piquancy and freshness as a work of art it has few claims but the story is not uninteresting and many of the sketches of the american war are very vivid and striking it is withal very  yankee the  tall talk  is amusing on account of its very audacity there is a sort of unconscious heroism in a writer who makes his ideal womanthe heroine of his booksay that a certain thing is  right nice and tell her father whenever he displeases her that he is  addled for instances of yankeeisms the reader has not far to seek a man thus describes the bombardment of fort jackson i was in the rebel service sir an unwilling victim dragged as an innocent sheep to the slaughter and took a part much against my inclinations in the defence of fort jackson it seemed to me sir that the day of judgement had come and the angel was blowing particular hell out of his trumpet miss ravenel is the daughter of a new orleans gentleman who finding himself in some danger through his pronorthern sentiments seeks refuge at the breaking out of the war in one of the northern states unlike himself his daughter is a violent secessionist her prejudice being so far like a mania as to transform the gentlest of creatures into a termagant the author has of course a great liking for his heroine but loyalty to his country forbids his glossing over the unladylike speeches and acts of which she was guilty while yet unconverted on one occasion we are told of the effect which the news of the bull run defeat had upon her  miss ravenel the desperate rebel jumped to her feet with a nervous shriek of joy and then catching her fathers reproving eye rushed upstairs and danced it out in her own room this is certainly strange enough conduct but mr de forest renders it more inexplicable by not telling us what the  it was which she danced out was it her fathers eye which she had just caught  at another time a letter is being read to her in which the writer exclaims  how glorious will be that time now near at hand when our reunited country will be free of the shame and curse of slavery    miss ravenel spit in her angry pussycat fashion when her father read to her this passage of the letter but this was in her unconverted days the story proceeds to show how two men fall in love with her and how she married the least worthy of thema colonel in the federal army who is of a reckless dramdrinking impulsive and goodnatured disposition the other lover is a captain in this colonels regimenta model of modesty endurance and selfdenial dr ravenel and his daughter venture back to new orleans and the colonel and captain are with the body of men who made history in louisiana the operations of the federal forces in the southern state are most admirably described and the first attack on port hudson is detailed with such minuteness and graphic power as to render the reader almost certain of mr de forest having himself seen the progress and result of that unfortunate effort the colonel gets killed in an engagement shortly after his wife has learned of his liaison with another woman and she and her father again go north by this time she has become quite converted to federal principles and the end of the story is that she marries the poor captain who is as proud of his fate as george dobbins was of amelas hand the tale it will be perceived is slight and is rendered quite subservient to the chronicling of the louisianian campaign some of the reflections of the author upon the war are in themselves very interesting as the following passage will testify i such was the defene of fort winthrop one of the most gallant feats of the war those days are gome by and them will be no more im rases conversion from secwoin to loyalty by j w de forest nusw york harper brothers like them for ever at least not in our for erer not very long ago not more than two hours before this ink dried upon the paper the author of the present history was sitting on the edge of a basaltio cliff which overlooked a wide expanse of fertile earth flourishing villages the spires of a city and beyond a shining sea flecked with the fullblown sails of peace and prosperity from the face of another basaltic cliff two miles distant he saw a white globule of smoke dart a little way upward and a minute afterwards heard a dull deep pum  of exploding gunpowder qaarrymen there were blasting out rocks from which to build hives of industry and happy family homes bat the sound reminded him of the roar of artillery of the thunder of those signal guns which used to presage battle of the alarums which only a few months previous were a command to him to mount and ride into the combat then he thought almost with a feeling of sadness so strange is the human heart that he had probably heard those clamours uttered in mortal earnest for the last time never again perhaps even should he live to the age of threesoore and ten would the shriek of grapeshot and the crash of shell and the multitudinous whiz of musketry be a part of his life nevermore would he hearken to that charging yell which once had stirred his blood more fiercely than the sound of trumpets the southern battleyell full of howls and yelpings as of brute beasts rushing hilariously to the fray the longsustained northern yell all human but none the less relentless and stern nevermore the one or the other no more charges of cavalry rushing through the dust of the distance no more answering smoke of musketry veiling unshaken lines and squares no more columns of smoke piling high above deafening batteries no more groans of wounded nor shouts of victors over positions carried and banners captured nor report of triumphs which saved a nation from disappearing off the face of the earth after thinking of these things for an hour together almost sadly as i have said he walked back to his home and read with interest a paper which prattled of town elections and advertised corner lots for eale and decided to make a kidgloved call in the evening and to go to church on the morrow to those interested in that long struggle across the atlantic and who are notp we can heartily commend this booknot so much as a novel as a series of warsketches  miss rarentys conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest new york harper brothers mr de forests novel is perhaps not the less true to womans nature because miss ravenels conversion is effected by the wickedness of her secesh husband inspiring her with disgust for southern doings and is not brought about by the force of northern argument showing her the abominations of slavery and the sinfulness of rebellion but though we do not quarrel with the author for making his heroine change her politics at the instigation of animosity for her first husband and love of the man who follows him in her affections we can say nothing in behalf of the story which sets forth the ladys sentimental experiences and illogical doing as mr de forest has made previous attempts in literature it is only seasonable kindness to suggest to him that he should expend no more of his time and industry on an art for which he has no special

certain he will not be the least in their esteem although with some of them it is just possible that he may be the last the appearance of this volume conveys more than is superficially apparent its sombre garb is typical of sorrowthe gaudy label on its back cannot cheat us into any other belief it is the funereal glitter of a gilt plate upon a coffinlid no the fact cannot be concealed jack catch is no longer what he wasno longer the bustling active functionaryhis place is not of the value of a ropesendhis occupations gone the schoolmaster has filched his rod and he is now on the list with titled sinecurists and public pensioners how in this most unprosperous period must his recollection carry him back to the good old tory times when a mighty slender qualification made a man eligible for tyburntree  when the maladroit conveyance of a twopound note made him intimate with a halter with what an artistlike eye on a monday morning must he have surveyed the beam whereon some three or four of these fortyshilling freeholders were cooling their heels outside the debtors door for an hour at a stretch those were days of business jack catch had no time to write books then  the utmost he could do was to favour his friends with a line but sessions are long that have no endings the functionarys friends are again in power and jack catch may hope for the results the book is however a more pleasant speculation than the times and here we find the career of the author faithfully narrated from his earliest infancy down to the period when he takes office by succeeding his uncle to the important post of representative of the sheriff of london our hero first saw the light in the  darksome secrecy of rose and crown court and with an independence truly original does not claim hereditary respectability but says  let me not mince the matter for mincing it will not make the matter lessmy father was a thief isle was however professedly a waiter but his napkin was not large enough to cloak his little peculiarities and he met his fate at the new drop kindly assisted by his respected relative his mother his  sainted mother shortly afterwards laid herself open to a suspicion of not  accurately distinguishing the right of property and was commanded to  expatriate herself for life here then commences the career of our hero virtually an orphan by the laws of his country the entire code of which he declared open war with in his subsequent career morc we are obliged to confess from his natural tastes than from pious revenge for the wrongs of his parents it

she was cunning and changed her ground he pursued her changes with a jealousy equal to her cunning hit pride was fully awakened he fairly took the bit in his mouth and ran his own course with others he was sometimes forgetfully confiding but almost every connexion he made in one way or other diappointing him added fuel to his sensitive temfrper and brought on confirmed distrust before he was of

admiration and to assert his independence would have married lost as she notoriously was to a11 charatter the lady was one who had changed proprietors frequently and now accepted de libles protection as a matter of accommodation and to his surprise mortification and disgust left him as sooii as she found a change more agreeable this desertion had a most deciding effect on his after character and conduct on coming of age on the urgency of his parents he became candidate for his native county and the tricks and treacheries and venalities he witnessed inflicted another shock on the delicacy and sincerity of his sentiments and the losa of the election only added another rivet to the distrust which was beginning to extend towards the whole human race he was now without occupation and an object and with all his apparent strength of character the sport of every wind that blew his present indecisions ended in accompanying some friends one of them an invalid to the south and he seemed to be recovering an interest in life and society when both his friends perished one by falling into the water skating and the other by flying to his rescue and he was thus again left a lonely being without an object fir regard and without a wish for life the last sad events exasperating his general feeling of disappointment though not calculated to add to his growing misanthropy by this time a dissolution comes round again and he is once more involved in an election contest and being this time suc ceysful turns his thoughts and attention to paminentary matters and distinguishes himself as an able debater but refuses to take party the effects of this refusal force on him a conviction of the imbecility of individual and independent effort and he resigns his seat with disgust augmented and ready to overflow and inundate all with whom he comes in contact the lady however who had first charmed hill though she had jilted him so cauelely had still a hold on his memory and ven on his affections and hearing something of her accidentally and at a loss also for occupation he resolves to go on the continent in search of hernot so much with any view of renewing the intercourse as to ascertain why she left him and if she had ever loved him he succeeds in tracing her and gathers from her her whole history a history which is told with the most graceful vivacity and though the story be in itself full of improbabilities yet is it facile to the imagination and irresistibly attractive generally episodes are intolerable interruptions  but de lisles affairs are at the time so little

accumulated distrusts and disgust he was of a most kindly naturehe visited the grave and soothing the poor girl with his best efflorts reconciled her to life his hours were engrossed by her and in thus labouring to withdraw her from recollections of wretchedness he was led to pay her so much personal attention that the childs affections were passionately fixed upon him though his own were untouched she was preeminently beautiful confiding and de voted lie was now leaving rome and what could he do with his protigde  her fond trust and abandonment to himself embarrassed him she refused to live if he left her and though seeing the absurdity of her accompanying him the matter ended by his taking her with himand finally in her own ruin many months were now spent in travelling from place to place and at last when his return to england became imperative the thought struck him of placing her in a convent under the care of an abbess who was the sister of the friends he had lost some years before in a skating excursion and was well known to him the poor girl seeing the case inevitable consented mainly because it was his wish here she pined and finally on de libles letters

forced by his father into a marriage with another but she held herself still bound by her first engagements and some short time after de lisles declaration lord avonmores wife dies and he marries

by the disposal of a living to a friend of the parrys who marries a younger daughter this clergyman was a person who had seen the world was a gentleman by birth and manners and a man of sense and

B5860,"['6797323', '8842702', '3163024', '3451157', '6766105']",  evelyn innes by george moore fisher unwin we have an immense respect for mr george moore as a novelist tris patience his laboriousness his remarkable fidelity to the artistic light that is in him are rare and invaluable qualities in an age of facile production and ready compromise starting we should say with almost no initial equipment of genius for fiction he has worked his way by sheer dogged perseverance to a manner of expression and a point of view which though they may excite discussion cannot at least fail to rivet attention and enchain interest neither the expression nor the point of view indeed is or is likely to be in any ultimate sense personal to shake off critical preoccupations and to see absolutely for himself seems to be an impossible thing for mr moore but if you compare esther waters or evelyn innes whether for style or insight with some of the authors earlier work what an advance the student of human nature has acquired a real knowledge in some at least of the secret things of the heart the eye of the realist has been trained to discriminate and select to a perception of the significant instead of the obvious in the external shell of life and the pains devoted to mr moores style have not been without fruit verbal melody he generally misses grammatical correctnesssometimes there is no place in paris he will tell you  where you get abettor petite marmite than the ambassadeurs his sentences are frequently stiff and frequently jerky too short or too overloaded with coordination butand it is a big buthe has learned to paint to visualise to callup an image not of the outlines merely but of the atmosphere of a room of a garden of an environment here is one of fifty examples the broad walk was full of the colour of spring and its perfume the thick grass was like a carpet beneath their feet they had lingered by a pond and she had watched the little yachts carrying each a portent of her own success or failure the albert hall curved over tiie tops of the trees and sheep strayed through the deep may grass in arcadian peacefulness but the most vivid impression was when they had come upon a lawn stretching gently to the waters edge owen had feared the day was too cold for sitting out but at that moment the sun contradicted him with a broad warm gleam he had fetched two chairs from a pile stacked under a tree and sitting on that lawn swept by the shadow of softly moving trees they had talked an hour or more the scene came back to her as she sat looking into the fire she saw the spring easily victorious amid the low bushes capturing the rough branches of the elms one by one and the distant slopes of the park grey like a piece of faded tapestry and as in a tapestry the ducks came through the mist in long pulsing flight and when the day cleared the pea fowl were seen across the water sunning themselves on the high branches evelyn inns is an elaborate and minutely analytic study of the musical temperament the heroine is a singer of opera wagnerian opera she is one of those who as plato has it pipe away their souls in sweet and plaintive melodies her spiritual life is confined almost entirely to vague emotions and to such ideas as find their natural expression in musicideas very slightly intellectualised hardly raised above the level of sensations and emotions she drifts along through lifewith mr moore watching and studying her trying to disentangle and isolate the currents iii and out of a couple of liaisons and finally into the bosom of the holy catholic church precisely the same kind of mental processes determine her conversion as those which lead her out of the arms of one lover and into those of another this is the spirit of it   then to rid herself of the remembrance she thought of the joy she had experienced that morning at hearing in the creed that gods kingdom shall never pass away her soul had kindled like a flame and she had praised god crying to herself  thy kingdom shall last for ever and ever it had seemed to her that her soul had acquired kinship over all her faculties over all her senses for the time being it had ruled her utterly and so delicious was its subjection that she had not dared to move lest she should lose this sweet peace her lips had murmured au  our father but so slowly that the sanctus bell had rung before she had finished it nothing troubled her and the torrent of delight which had flowed into and gently overflowed her soul had intoxicated and absorbed her until it had seemed to her that there was nothing further for her to desire the interest of mr moores analysis is undeniable although we own to finding it a trifle too subjective and monotonous the young ladyjs fluctuations carry one rather often over the same ground and we fancy that a broader touch would have enabled mr moore to produce a really more vivid effect the background of the book is filled up with musical discussion skilfully designed to bring into contrast the two sides of music which attach it to the sensual life and the life of devotion respectively we do not presume to sound the depths of mr moores musical lore but we are not surprised that in dulwich  none remembered that dowlands was the name of henry the eighths favourite luteplayer surely his name was dowland and himself a contemporary not of henry but of elizabeth  evelyn innes by georsre moore fisher unwin  evelyn innes it may be remarked at the outset is the best novel which mr moore has yet written in grasp of character and in power of portraying an individual living being mr moore has advanced even since  esther waters of which the best characteristic was the presentation of the heroine but here still more one has the feeling that one is face to face with a reality and that evelyns actions have that inevitableness without which no interest is possible although this novel just as much as its predecessor is a novel with a topic music taking the place of betting as the phase of life on which the fortunes of the characters chiefly depend one is never made to feel that a single incident in the heroines life or a turn in her character is due to any desire on the part of the author to prove a point or elucidate a theory music is the real atmosphere in which evelyn and the other characters live and work out their destinies it is not as is so often the case in novels with a purpose the rarefied atmosphere of the philosopher making experiments on semianimate puppets to have studied music ancient and modern with the care and exactitude here displayed by the author and to have avoided the fault of allowing his subject to overpower his sense of character is in itself a great achievement and all praise is due to him for it but in awarding this praise one almost unconsciously stumbles across what spoils so much of mr moores work it is a great achievement but in almost everything that he does one is more impressed with the difficulty of his task and the labour required to surmount it than with the success great though it may be of his endeavours mr moore somewhere tells a story about himselfin the  confessions of a young man if we remember rightwhich seems to illustrate this characteristic in all his works when he first went to the louvre he tells us he saw no beauty in ingress  la source but manet or some painter whom he admired told him that it was beautiful convinced that his informant was right he went day after day to this picture to study it and find out wherein its beauty consisted until at last after a vast amount of conscientious study he really did find that the picture was most beautiful so in all his work one has a feeling that he is very often right and has attained to the end required but that it has cost him an unconscionable amount of trouble and study to attain it and he seems so proud of all the pains he has been at that he will not spare the reader any of the steps of the journey to his goal mr moore never seems to live anything if we may so put it he always studies it and learns it he has no intuition but he joins to great intelligence extraordinary laboriousbess which secures him the power of rarely making a mistake and as rarely enlightening by a flash of inspiration even with evelyn innes the most living and successful of his characters this may be observed she certainly is a living woman all her actions are perfectly right from her own nature but she is always an outsider a person to be observed not felt of all the greatest characters in fictionjane austens some of thackerays dickenss mr merediths it may be said that not only does the author seem to have lived them but the reader almost can identify himself with them and feel himself saying and doing what they say and do with evelyn inns mr moore may have been on terms of the most intimate acquaintance but he never felt himself in her and the reader also feels that what she does is quite natural from what he knows of her character just as he feels about his cousin or his aunt but he never realises her sufficiently to feel that he would necessarily do the same himself she is really living but she is not living in the most intimate way with though same limitations sir owen asher and ulick dean are wonderfully good up to a certain point they are people one would recognise immediately if one met them in the streetin fact one knows many like them but mr moores art adds nothing to our knowledge of them they are to a certain extent enigmas in life as all men are except perhaps one besides oneself and to just that extent and no less are they enigmas in the novel a consequence of mr moores inability to conceal his laborious methods is that however interesting in some respects his novels may be they are apt to become tiresomely prolix mr moor is crammed full of facts one may imagine him like zola studying for his novels from every available source as zola would have gone he has evidently been to bayreuth and to madame wagners house there he has studied the scores of wagners operas and wagner literature ad nauseam he has been to dulwich and to hyde park and kensington gardens  he has conscientiously paced every inch of the ground which he makes his characters cover but unlike zola he has not acquired the faculty of discarding unnecessary facts the frenchman knows as all frenchmen do that one of the first elements of art is to know when to be silent but mr moore will tell you that evelyn paid her hansom cabman when she left him he will weary you with discussions on wagner and bring in utterly irrelevant disquisitions on balzac in one passage he describes at some length a subscription concert got up by evelyn and in reading the description we wondered if he would add the exact amount secured by it for the charity and sure enough it was duly chronicled this is the reason why some reviewers cry out against disgusting passages in mr moores books now in this one there are some details which could certainly not be qualified as disgusting but which are absolutely unnecessary and which one would prefer not to have mentioned unless there were some very strong dramatic reason for doing so which there is not they are annoying here chiefly because they are so gratuitously unnecessary just as some of his long and inappropriate descriptions of scenes are tiresome they are only worse than the latter because they concern matters on which it is better to be reticent but their real fault is essentially the same that of irrelevance the book however which is worth criticising at such length just because it is so good as a whole and so admirably single in purpose and construction and so marvellous in the way in which all the interest is quite naturally focussed on the heroine must not be dismissed on a reproach the style though still a little lacking in nerve and decision is a great improvement on mr moores former writing and some of his phrases and jottings of character are decidedly pithy and poignant here is perhaps the best of them   lady ducklo appeared to her as one who had never selected a road she seemed to have walked a little way on all roads and her face expressed a life of many wanderings straying from place to place there was nothing as she said worth doing which she had not done but she had clearly accomplished nothing  evelyn innes when sir owen the artistic baronet begins evelyns education seriously in paris one of his first lessons is in balzac  there is a vulgarity he says to her  about those who dont know balzac we his worshippers recognise in each other a refinement of sense and a peculiar comprehension of life we are beings apart we are branded with the seal of that great mind you should hear us talk among ourselves further he says that each of balzacs fiftytwo volumes is a masterpiece now mr moores general methods in fiction do not forbid us to infer that through sir owens mouth he is expressing his own views at all events this personage does express views which mr moore has uttered in his own name such balzacian fanaticism one would hesitate to attribute to him were it not that his manner of working here and elsewhere convicts him of it for a dilettante baronet blind fanaticism is of no consequence but when one of the writingcraft forgets that the honour due to such an incomparable searcher of the human mind must be discriminate in order to be worthy the case is serious for imitation is bound to follow and it so happens that only balzacs weaknesses can be imitatedhis   evelyn innes by george moore 6s unwin formlessness his unjustified and unforgiveable loagxears his unrelieved monotony of manner the admiration for the masters genius has given to the native defects and misfortunes of mr moores talent the shelter and encouragement of a great name mr moore is sometimes reputed to be a dangerous writer but if he sins he does not sin lightly or insinuatingly let that be counted to his credit where it may he admires ciany french things and has learned some part of his craft in a french school yet never englishman was so deadly serious in manner at least there is not a smile anywhere in  evelyn innes not a vivaciousmovement not an unconsidered word but surely he must drive the most unsympathetic reader to unstinted admiration of the work he puts into his books when one compares the quantity and the quality with that which contents most of our novelists one is filled with the highest respect his ideal is that every character should be quite completely presented from the inner recesses of his soul xr george moore frous 4 pakinuis by maxet rproduced by kuxd permission oj musm waiter scott lal to the shape of his boots that of every opinion held by his personages he should be the historian and interpreter capable of writing a leading article on it that every scene should have the local definiteness of modern stage directions that every street or house should be precisely entered in a full catalogue or inventory and he hardly falls short of that ideal with magnificent patience and honest slogging endeavour is his task pulled through when he has to get up a subject he does so without flimsiness this latest novel for instance should be a mine of interest to students of the older music and to admirers of mr dolmetsch his wagner criticism is able and suggestive and of course very timely at the present moment unquestionably he has a rare and admirable respect for his work about the result there will be much difference of opinion to me his manner and method are unpleasing and the abnegation of all art and i feel it much more in  evelyn innes than ia  esther waters where the form and temper were more flaubertianand flaubert if a  little master is a safer guide for mr moore than balzac who tempts him to longwindedness but still he has only exaggerated the course which his kind of temperament his quality of vision must have forced him to take at his best lie is an unsurpassed photographer and as such should he be judged monsignor and his surroundings the wimbledon convent the intense and rather shabby audience at mr innes concerts are masterpieces of the camera only when he is forced to alter some important circumstance of his scenes and sitters le blunders the book is in some degree a romax a clef ulick dean will be widely recognised the ceavexaxces demand that some veil should be thrown over his identity and mr moore makes him a musician he is not 1 transposed  enough what has a musician to do with all those interesting imaginings and philosophies  and evelyn  sir owen told her she was  intensely balzacian very likely the creator of eugenie grandet might have made her comprehensible nothing could be more detailed and more superficially definite than her history as given by mr moore but she is a blur to one careful reader at least at the beginning she lives a shabby and obscure life without ambition though she knows she has a great voice then she agrees to a lse with sir owen a little for love perhaps not a little for fine clothes and fine living and a little for the sake of her voice sir owen gives her rationalistic instruction which does not enter deep into her system she becomes a great singer of great partsisolde kundry briinnhilde then she falls under the more spiritual influence of ulick but his mysticism does not satisfy her then with a thought to her soul she gives up the stage in the midst of her triumph in her convent retreat we think her fate is settled at last but no she comes out into the world again quite aimless what is she meant to be  one leaves her with the idea that she was very stupidbut stupid as are those sensitivists on whom scientific hypnotists experiment most successfully yet we gather that mr moore had some other intention in presenting herthat to him she was a rersonality something has missed his nervous subject fdgeted under the fire of the camera a m  literary bulletin books eviryx inure bv gforrf njoorf fishcer litwin s mr george moore is still a realist he still gives us too much detail and will not trust

senses it can only be maintained through an entire submission to authority and dogma and we are led to suppose that she finds an answer to her needs in the roman catholic church but mr moure leaves

part of it upon the perusal of the secret marriage we have cornplained on previous occasions o0 the author of  mary powell for that instead of trusting to her own genius she should have condescended to mere mimicry being capable of better things the endeavour to write a book in imitation of writings of an age long past is not new nor has it proved successful in other instances but in the present case there was no need for disguise tle authoress was perfectly competent to sustain a fiction avowedly her own as she has since provedl by tales in which she has thrown aside her self imposed fetters and revelled in her own freedom this is remarkably shown in errs larinda sinyuleheart in which turning aside from the path sihe has hitherto followed so pertinaciously she tells a story of home life in plain english and without any affectation of an extinct orthography or past forms of expression her new novel is exempt fromn these she tells her simple story sinply with exquisite grace in the

who writes a great deal miust write many things badly even the good homer sometimes nods  says the latin poet and novelists are not exempt from this human weakness mrs marsh has written some of the best novels our time has seen lbnt it must he admitted also that some of her fictions are not worthy of her fame it may be that sie writes too much the imagination is not inexhaustible as authors are too apt to suppose if continually worked it is liable to reproduce its own images and conceptions rest is necessary to the full exercise of i that faculty its creative powers flag if too often invoked as may be seen in the works of every writer of fiction who counts his novels bv two figures it is manifest in scott cooper james dickens and a multitude of lesser men it is visible in mirs marsh who hias brought forth a new novel almost every year not steadily iniproving by practice as might have been anticipated but beginning with her best work the i two old mlens tales then after an interval flhing upon us again with emilia wlyndham  then flagging for awhile  then proving her capacity by the prerisions of lady elyn and then falling back once more into comparative dullness we cannot say of the i1eiress of himywlaon that it is one of her best but certainly it is not one of her worst it is not the production of her happiest mood it was not thrown off in a moment of inspiration but it was not written as a wearisome task against the inclination the impression it has muade upon us is that the authoress wrote it as a matter of business three volumes were required and she set herself to i make three volunies and sihe applied diligently to the work andl put forthi her artistic skill to i make a plot and to tell a story and here it is this process of professional authorship is however a very different thing front that genuine inspiration whiel iproduces great works in such cases the author does not write because there is some external requirement but by the force of an internal impulse trhe imagination flashes upon him without his will thoughts come thronging words rush to his lips he must give them vent he sets them down to relieve his full mindl and the result is a work of genius amrs marsh has a written this with such an impulse of inspiration but she has also written mechanically and the fiction before us partakes more of the artist than of the creator rlie composition is excellent there is also her wonted beauty of description even more than her usual pathos and much briliant writing but neither in plot nor in character is any creative power shown the former is commonplace  the latter has been introduced to us oftentimes before by herself and by others albert and imogene eugene and laura the two couples who are made happy in the end after the usual variety of crosses are like all other heroes and heroines edward aubrey is the good sensible man of the story but he wants individualitv the only personage distinctly drawn is lady faulconer the bad person of the plot whose scheming it is the business of the three volumes to trace and to defeat sihe is well painted but still she wants originality we have met her before introduced by mirs trollope mrs gore and by mrs alarsh herself we thus freely criticise this latest performance of one of our best living novelists because i we tiink so higily of her capacitics she can do better than this and it is disappointing to find her riot doing her best hasty writing is as bad as hasty marriage it is a mischief to a reputation that cannot readily be undone it ra script1 nmaet too many will be inclined to judge the author more by her failures thani by her successes mrs marsh errs however in common with most of her contemporaries she writes too much and too fast timnc is not given for thought before writing or correction afterwarls hence the tendency with all of then to reproduce themselves in ldot character an1 expression hence the filling off so frequently i seen in their subsequent works instead of thiat improvement which experience maturity of nind and practice ought to produce we are desirous of directing the serious attention of our novelists to this besetting sin of theirs and we avail ouriselve of the example of one of the cleverest among them because if this error can thms affect the power of so accomplished an authioress asi mrs marsh how dangerous must it be with 1 those of lesser genius but though the ileiress f 1unooglifon is not of her best and worthy of her highest reputation it is nevertheless a work of great ahility aolt will be read with

B352,"['6172982', '5008917', '3161534']",  aurora leigh by elizabeth barrett browning chapman and hall we thank the authoress of aurora leigh for her christmas gift to usand with the less critical reserve because a book of purpose so noble and elevated bearing a name so known and honoured rather commands our welcome than demands our sentence for her who wrote the  romaunt of margaret and  lady geraldine the laurel crown baa long ago been woven what then can the charons of literature do when such come to his river but set them forthwith on their way to the elysian fields not that he who takes our poetess for guide will wander in elysian meadows or tread upon the asphodel her footsteps are on earth often in earths darkest and commonest ways her way lies through sorrows and battled efforts and useless hopes and yet perhaps he who reads  aurora leigh  as earnestly as  aurora leigh  was written may in some degree pass as did the florentine and his leader from the gloom of the inferno to the pleasant daylight of upper air the story of aurora leigh is not original in so far as love is not original nor heroic struggle nor disappointment nor death but it claims such merit in that the writer seems to draw her materials from a source open for such a purpose only to herthe records of her proper life if this be so much in the narrative which seems improbable may be simply true it is told like the tale of an jeschylean drama through the lips of some three or four speakers but its pauses are filled with a fullertoned chorus than the atheniansan underwail of human music with its strophe and antistrophe of suffering and hope the incidents of the book would have thrilled in a novelthe loftiness of the philosophy would have allured in a treatisetogether they compose a poem whose action criticism must allow to be as sustained as its scope is large and noble  aurora leigh the heroine inherits with the learning of her english father the warm blood of an italian mother and with such natal antecedents and some repression becomes naturally a poetess her neighbour and cousin romney leigh is a poet also but too practical for print by no means one who stands high upon the bank of theories observes the swimmers and criesvery fine but keeps dry linen equally rather a very earnest plunger into them and one bent upon setting a wrong world right by means of them  aurora counts up somewhat sarcastically his ends  to reform make trade a christian possibility and individual right no general wrong wipe out earths furrows of the  mine and  thine and leave our green for men to pluy at bowls with innings for them all at which  game it is needless to say that he must fail and does accordingly fail but  auroras  enthusiasm for art is at least as great as romneys for actionand between their keen intellects a fire is struck which lights up many a dark dialectic corner let those who care to follow such a light no ignis fatuus be it said turn to the volume they will find what  aurora has to say for the followers of her art thc only truthtellers now left to god thc only speakers of essential truth opposed to relative comparative and temporal truthsthe only holders by his sunskirts through constitutional grey glooms and how frequently she can praise her art itself o lifeo poetry which means life in lifecognizant of life beyond this bloodheat passionate for truth beyond these sensespoetry my life my eagle with both grappling feet still hot from zeus thunder who has ravished me away from all the shepherds sheep and dogs and set me in th olympian roar and round but om readers must believe that what we quote only excludes something worthier quotation the nine books are full of brilliant passages and they must wonder for themselves at the writers tide of thought running without an ebbat her affluence of ideas and opulence of illustrationgolden treasures these which never tempt her like atalantas apples to swerve from the straight course to the goal of her meaning yet sometimes it must be confessed this eagle of thoughtthough it be joves own bird sinks under ganymede hts flight is high still absolute truth sits higher but no tenderness can be more womanly and deep then aurora leighsif her philosophy reaches now and then short it cant be denied that she is a  bluebut then she wears her blue so chiefly in her eyes it comforts you cutirely for her fame and the reader will say as much with lady waldemar when the third book brings him to marian erle and her piteous history there the authoress with a womans right pleads against a womans wrong and we acknowledge many will with tealsthe righteousness of though indignation and the fitness of the compassion which storms or sighs through her passionate language our limit will not permit us to dwell upon this episodebut we make room for a remark upon a subject that will doubtless call forth many a one it is customary that virtuous women should preserve silence nay rather profess ignorance of that great sin whose innocent victim was the gentle marian erle through this coan veil of conclusion our authoress sternly strikes her hand she declares the protest of silence not loud enough to daunt the hand before the eyes not large enough to hide and she bids them flash forth with a light too intense for those sons of darkness to endure the subject is profoundly difficult and painful but it must be a timid and selfish prudery that could condemn the example of fearless ay and feminine boldness which the writer has in this respect not shrunk from setting we have touched but lightly on the plot and we cannot much dilate upon the purpose of the volume both deserve a separate and careful notice the conclusion that where we disavow being keeper to our brotherwere his cain is illogical but romneys efforts are generous if extravagant well intended if futile the keynote of the book is struck in the constant protest against his modern fashion by which we talk by aggregates and think by systemsand being used to face our evils in statistics are inclined to cap them with unreal remedies drawn out in haste on th other side o the itate these reformers say 1 have a pattern on my nail and i will carve the world new after it and  aurora is mainly right in reiterating that tis impossible to get at men excepting through their souls she exalts with great force the efficacy of art in such work in many a passage which presses for our mention we must leave the reader to learn how romneys failure marians fate and her lovers suffering teach aurora that art is much but love is more and the reader must for himself appreciate how splendidly and with what pathos the ninth book brings the volume to a close in a flow of unbroken beauty thus far we have not stinted our praise of this remarkable production justice and the dignity of our craft demand that we should find fault with the occasional extravagance of epithet and simile in which our authoress indulges it is harshespecially at this chilly seasonto blaine the general world for being a fullveined heaving doublebreasted age and she must forgive our wandering fancy for connecting with such a passage as the following the cruel yelhw morning pecked at her upou thc straw inside  the unavoidable idea of a hugeous  buff cochin china breakfasting voraciously we have baid that  aurora  is now and then indistinct and seems not only to  fly too high but to fly on sometimes with a tired wing in the story too there is an omission which seems unintentional and which the interest excited makes unpardonablean omission of any mention of marian eries subsequent fortunes we cannot help also saying that romney leigh acts throughout in very decided defiance to the adage which tells us its best to bc off with the old love before you get on with the new we present our readers with one or two final brilliancies taken with a hasty hand and of which the setting is frequently costlier than the gem the elegance of mrs brownings scholarship is conspicuous in the following  in the hollow by the stream the beechtrcc lcaneth downof which you said the bread in it hath a naiads heart and pines for waters beware of tragic masks we lie before though glass uplifted on the column half a yard above the natural staturewe would play heroic parts to ourselves and end perhaps as impotently as athenians wives who shrieked in fits at the eumenides how fine is this too describing the hills of the riviera seen by night the old miraculous mountains heaved in sight one straining past another along thc shore the way of grand old odyssean ghosts athirst to drink the cool blue wine of seas and stare on voyagers speaking of a mother she calls her a better woman after all with chubby children hanging on her neck to keep her low and wise ah me the vines that bear such fruit are proud to stoop with it the palm stands upright in a realm oj sand  there is  matter for midsummer thinking  in these also what is art but life upon the larger scale the higher which pushes toward the intense significance of all things hungry for the infinite good love howeer illplaced is better for a mans soul in the end than if he loved ill what deserves love well earths crammed with heaven and every common bush afire with god but only he who sees takes off his shoes the rest sit round it and pluck blackberries and daub their natural faces unawares more and more from the first similitude we have quoted enough in the course of this brief notice to show how various are the strings how clear the tones of our gifted authoress if she says truly thatwhen god shall help the workers for his world the singers shall have help of him not last certainly not lastin such a rollcall will be heard the name of her who gave us  aurora leigh in dismissing our subject we would linger especially on the fearless loyalty to her race and love of truth conspicuous in her writings her heroes if noble are all called noble for their nobleness mrs browning has long sat highest of her sisterhoodbut she may challenge a wider competition than that of one sex or age an irresistible comparison rises in our mind between the vague eolian vibrations of  maud and the steady organmusic of  aurora leigh let the laureate look to it  poeta we learned at school is epicene nor will the salic law operate to his favour in the wide and unbiassed realms of poetry  poetry

poems unce anil you are conscious of floating in a charmed atmosphere but you zannot partieularise the nature of the charm read them again and you become aware that the attention has been excited by the fervour of the poets iheas not by a correctness of arraniminent mrs browning is less fanciful than felicia hemans less sweetly lyrical than eliza cook less emotional than l e l hlut she surpasses them each and all in the intellectual breadth of her poems thus her name is not familiar in our streets the balladsinger does not torture ter genius neither is she familiar by cottage firesides because to understand lher poems aright and especially her latest poem a certain amnunt of mental culture is required she does not in the absence of thought pile up glittering similes merely to catch the eve and which are as coldly beautiful as icespars with the sun shining on their bald tops write when and where she may she will always command intelligent readersl she may be accused of carelessness in the construction of her sentences and we are not disposed to defend her against the charge of mannerism but thete drawbacks are only occasional in her grand flights we can overlook incidental failings knowing as we do that the eagle which soars nearest to the sun is no less a royal bird because the tip of his pinion has been soiled in its contact with the earth that the highest convictions of life and art have entered into the composition of this new poem aurora leaqh there can be no doubt since every page shows the result rather than the process of thought the whole poem is wonderfully suggestive it takes up an ordinary subject of the day and in a poetical sensewe are not so sure about the philosophical sensemakes it extraordinary this is clearly not a poem for flippant readersnot a poem that any one for fashions sake may canter through it is not a fashionable rotten row of rhythm but the bold broad path leading tosome magnifieent cathedral in its every pagethereisalivingthought throbbinglikeapnl e life is always more serious thanthefool in hisfollv believes and this poem is life intensified its obvious pleasure and that which will make itself first of all felt is the story for this is charmin2ly varied and although it bristles with conceits and ethical crotchets yet it speaks a language which is absolutely universal the love which is purified by wanderings and sufferings comes honue at last like a wounded bird to its nest as did aurora and romney leighs every man and woman can understand that though not every reader will be able to divide the natural fronm the philosophic love so as to see that beneath the hard crust of the latter mrs browning is developing an important social truth scores of individuals who have no taste for statistics or unadorned facts will read this remarkable poem and thereby better understand the surgings of society the social volcanoes which strnigle in the very centre of english life first the enjoyment of the story will break upon them with a new rapture like morning then as they read more intensely for the storys sake they will perceive that romney and aurora leigh are types of distinctive endeavours to elevate the condition of humanityromney dealing with statistically packed disorders  in the body and aurora contending with the diseases of tie soul rhese converging actionsthe two cousins like their ideas have been moving in distant orbitscome home at last to reap the knowledge that it is idle if not wicked to expect too much from individual effort to give up much on each side then tawe all but the triumph of the poet of aurora is complete when at length romney in the luxury of requited love exclaims fewer systems we who are held and do not hold les mapning out of massea to be saved lisv nations or by sexes fouriers void and comte is dwarfedand cabet puerile subsists no law of life outside of life no p feet manners without chi intian seals the christ himself had been no lawgiver unless le had given the lifo too with the law late in the season of life but not too late these toilers in a noble causea cause made only slightly less noble by the impatience and fretfulnest of the poet and philanthropistare brought to see that all work for the regeneration of men is circumcribed by two circles the first circle is that which isgrandest broadest ftrd mostluminous and designated  gods love  the next is termed the love of wedded souls there certainly is poetic force if not human justice in afflicting lromney with blindneess in the sequelmade blind by the vulgar wretches whose condition he had eniployed his generous youth to ameliorate the situation is pathetic but it shows clearly the domination of that ideaauroras ideawhich sought to elevate the flesh by the elevation of soul aurora must gaze for romney now she must shine out for two and no less work for both it will be seen therefore that this poem has a design hut whether this design has been developed with philosophic regularity as it certainiv has been unfolded with poetic beauty is a question that every reader will answer for himself we have no hesitation in saying that no modern poem has so many passages of brilliant description if it were worth while to cite any passages unworthy the poem we should instance the feeble gossip in the church when romney is about as some respectable persons would say to make a fool of himself by marrying a seamstress but then romney is true to his principle of ihumnan equality our objection to this gossip is not that it is a fabrication and wholly untrue to life but that it is ill suited to the character and manner of the poem it cannot be looked upon as that true repose or artistic declension so often successfully applied by great poets just before the situation is strained towards its highest pitch it is rather like an indignity to the muse just as if an arabian steed of high mettle and proud action were compelled to bear the dishonour of panniers mrs brownings views on art are so elaborated form in fact so large a feature in this poem that they would require a long article either to support or refute them we therefore leave them to the quarterlies at the same time suggesting that they afford material for a very interesting paper our object is rather to give our readers some choice poetic portions of the poem if we retrace the story it will be in so brief a manner as to do no injustice to mrs browning by cheating her readers of an anticipated pleasure our object is to render the extracts still more interesting by showing them in their natural conjunctions first then this book is an autobigraphy written when aurora leigh was still  what men call young when she had not so far left the shores of life as not to hear  the intirmur of the outer infinite our first extract will lodge us on the threshold of auroras career it is full of wisdom anti truth too and for these so truthful words grim men should be tolerant of nursery  trifles if any man has the dombey vein let him read this extract a dozen times and if he io not then become wiser there is no hope of his redemption i write my mnother was a florentine whom

of ours so that he pays his just share of the incometax and does not owe for his newspaper while romney is out endeavournng to rub the rust off the ample shield of society a certain lady waldemar pays aurora a vi it with the apparent design of patronising the muse very considerate of lady waldemar and the example might have gone far to draw down aristocratic smiles on the labours of poor bards were it not for the disagreeable fact that lady waldemar is in love with romney but romney true to his philanthropic resolve scorns the highborn lady and determines to wed marian erlea sweet crea ture but the daughter of brutalised and brutalising parents he would conciliate the poor by marrying into their ranks and shame the rich by giving a personal proof of human equality half the interest of the poem hangs on the eventful life of marian erle we watch the fate of this blossom with intense apprehension every wind that sends it eddying through the dusty hlghroads of life has its especial interest when it is at length strippedfor no fault of its ownof a portion of its beauty when itthat is marian erlequivers with the first sharp knowledge that mans violence not his seduction has blighted her then the poet is developing in that poor forlorn girl those holy feelings which place a mother only a little lower than the angels but not to anticipate the course of events we must show how marian escaped from her vile parents this passage for fervent forceful description has scarcely a parallel in the english language one day said martanthe sun shone that dayher mother had been badly beat and felt the bruta sore about her wretched soul that must have been she came in suddenly and snatching in a sort of breathless rage her daughters headgear comb let down the hal i upon her

is waiting in a church with his fashionable friends in order to wed marian half st giles in frieze was bidden to meet st james hn cloth of gold there is first among the highborn visitors the particularly small gossip to which we have alluded then impatience then surprise and lastly it may be the proud gratification that marian does not come she poor girl has been what is vulgarly termed trapped by lady waldemar she writes a letter to romney which delivers him up  to his own prosperities and in a brief space is on her way to paris under the guidance of a 1 devils daughter being no other than one of lady waldemars women what followed we have already hinted at subsequently aurora leigh wandering about paris in pursuit of her divine art accidentally discovers the wanderer but first we must give auroras description of paris because it is pictorial and also because it contains some of those peculiar views of art which interlace almost every page of the volume the city swims in verdure beautiful am venice on the waters the seaswan what bosk gardens dropped in closewalled courts as plums in ladles laps who start and laugh what miles of streets that run on after trees still carrying the necesary shops those open caskets with the jewels seen i and trade is art and arts philosophy in paris theres a silk for instance there as worth an artists study for the folds as that bronze opposite nay the bronze ha faults arts here too artfulconscioua as a maid who leans to mark her shadow on the wall until she lose a vantage in her step yet art walks forward and knows where to walk the artsts also are idealists too ab olute for nature logical to austerity in the application of the special theory not a soul content to paint a crooked pollard and an ass as the english will because they find it so and like it somehowah the old tuileries is pnillng its high cap down on its eyes confounded eonsciencestricken and amazed by the apparition of a new fair face in those devouring mirrors through the grate within the gardens what a heap of babes swept up like leaves beneath the ehesnuttroes from every street and alley of the town bv the ghosts perhaps that blow too bleak this way alooking for their heads dear pretty babes ill wish them luck to hare their ballplay out before the next change comerand farther on what statues poised upon their columns fine as if to stand a moment were a feat against that blue what squares what breathingroom for a nation that runs fastay runs against the dentists teeth at the corner in pale rows which grin at progress in an epigram while aurora is musing on life and art a face flashes by god whose face is that that face persists it floats up it turns over in my mind as like to marian as one dead is like the same alire in very deed a face and not a fancy though it vanished so the small fair fice between the darks of hair i used to liken when i saw her first to a point of moonlit water down a well the low brow the frank space between the eves which always had the brown pathetic look if a dumb creature who had been beaten orce and never since was easy with the world ali ahnow i remember perfectly those eyes todavyhow overlarge they seemed a if some patient passinnate despair like a coal dropped and forgot en tapestry which slowly burns a widening circle ont had burnt them larger larger and those eyes todav i do

time posses however before the two friends meet a simple chance i did all i could not sleep last night and tired 0 turning on my pillow and harder thoughts wkent ont at eariv morning when the air is delicate with some last starry touch to wander through the marketplace of flowers the prettiest haunt in paris and make sre at worst that there were roes in the world so wandering musing with the artists eye that keeps the shadeside of the thing it loves halfabsent wholeobeerving while the crowd of young vivacious and blackbraided heads dipped quick as finches in a blossomed tree among the nosegays cheapening this and that in such a cheerful twitter of rapid speechmy heart leapt in me startled by a voice that slowly faintly with long breaths that marked the interval between the wilh and word inquired in strangers french w would that be mnch that branch of flowering mountaingorse so much too much for me then turning the face round so close upon me that i felt the sigh it turned with they go off together marian leading the way to the miserable room in which she lodged we have heard it stated that mirs browning is not intelligible that she is never certain of her meaning the assertion is a stupid libel on her genius for if she does not always she certainly does frequently speak with a natural and fervid utterance the woman and the artist are often so exquisitely mingled as ill the passage we are about to quote that we cannot tell which is dominant while both are working at the creation of a picture which we do not so much see as feel no one surely can miss the simplicity of the following and we pity the man who cannot perceive its beauty alone she threw her bonnet off then sighing as twere sighing the last time approached the bed and drew a shawl away yon could not peel a fruit you fear to bruise lore calmly and more carefully than sonor would vou and within a rosier bushed pomegranatethere he lay upon his back the yearling creature warm and moist with life to the bottom of his dimplesto the ends of the lovely tumbled curls about his face for since be had been covered overmuch to keep him from the light glare both his cheeks were hot and scarlet as the first live rose the shepherds heartblood ebbed away into the faster for his love and love was here as instant in the pretty babymouth shut close as if for dreaming that it sucked the little naked feet drawn up the way of nestled birdlings everything so soft and tenderto the little holdfast hands which closing on a finger into sleep had kept the mould oft wblle we stood there dumbfor oh that it should take such innocence to prove just guilt i thought and stood there dumb the light upon his eyelids pricked them wide and staring out at us with all their blue as half perplexed between the angelhood lie had been away to visit in his sleep and our most mortal presencegradually he saw his mothers face accepting it in change for heaven itselz with such a smile as might have well been learned therenever moved but smiled on in a drowse of ecatacy so happy half with her and half with heaven he could not have the trouble to be stirred but smiled and lay there luke a rose i said as red and still indeed as any rose that blows in all the silence of its leaves content in blowing to fulfil its life she leaned above him drinking him as wine in that extremity of love twill pass for agony or rapture seeing that love includes the whole ofnature rounding it to love   no moremince more can never be than just love selfforgot cast out of self and drowning in the transport of the sight her whole pale passionate face mouth forehead eyes one gaze she stood then slowly as he smiled she smiled too slowly smillng unaware and drawing from his countenance to hers a fainter red as if she watched a flame and stood in it aglow how beautiful said she mlarian relates to aurora the fearful story of the drugged cup the after madness and misery the shameful but not so far as she is concerned history which made her a mother but this we must for want of space pass overpas it with regret and regretting still more that the world had so few aurora leighs to soothe the anguish of the unfortunate and to say as aurora didi am lonely in the world and thou art lonely and the child is half an orphan comeand henceforth theu and i being still together will not miss a friend nor he a

chasm left by the cliff as it fell and we could distinctly hear the gentle gurgling of thc water to our right reverberattug ailong through the tortuous passage which communicated with the occam thus supplying this little reservoir with water without allowing its calmness to be affected by the swell without the sun shining down over the rocks which completely surrounded this little loch lit up its white and shining bed in a manner truly beautiful to behold while the depth of the water seemingly even greater than it was added a lovely tinge of blue beautifully contrasted with the vivid hues of the orangecoloured starfish which clinging to the rocks beneath dotted ait intervals the distant bottom in one or two plaices the wild and stunted shrubs grew down close to the waterline and thc shadows of a couple of young ash trees were seen playing on its sparkling surface the passage across was by a very slippery causeway not more than a foot broad at the widest and formed by thc edges of some ponderous fragments of the cliff which had faheu across the pool almost in its centre altogether it was one of the loveliest little spots that i think i ever beheld and thus suddenly brought

composed by the author under review  the life and times of frederick reynolds is certainly the most comic we have laughed  loud laughters three in the perusal of it an excess which mre cannot charge ourselves with having been guilty of when engaged with the  dramatist within the compass of these two volumes lies the embryo of many a plot which duly developed might have been expanded into three acts or have attained even unto five it appears almost as if mr reynolds having taken his leave of the theatre and having no further occasion for the comic incidents and ideas which floated in the regions of his imagination or lived in his portfolio had emptied them promiscuously and with unwonted profusion into this his last dramatic work we could not insinuate that the adventures it relates are absolute fictionsgratitude forbid we are three laughs in the authors debt and one hearty explosion is well worth a whole days ordinary existence but allowing a germ of truth to each mr reynolds has made the most of that germ has cultivated it with carefostered it in his fancytill it has shot up into  the life and times of frederick reynolds written by himselft 2 vols london  colburn 1826 a comedy or a farce habit is powerful and the habits of the dramatist would almost necessarily interfere with the duties of the historian the adventures may be true substantially but he has dramatised them and in the heat of composition may have sometimes forgotten that he was writing a life and not a play as papillion says in a piece of footes the name of which we care not to mention papillionyou will pardon my presumption but you have my good master one little foible that i could wish you to correct young wildwhat is it  papillionand yet it is a pity too you do it so very well young wildpry thee be plaia papillionyou have sir a lively imagination with a most happy turn for invention it is not long before we observe the authors fancy at work adorning the bare facts of his story when but a child he was taken to see mrs barry the great mrs barry and had the honour of being invited by her to sup and sleep at her house during the ride home in the carriage he kept inquiring whether she was really the identical desdemona that had just been smothered and could not refrain from touching her to ascertain what he calls the  corporeity of her existence this familiarity she checked once or twice with a goodhumoured smile and a slight blush observing to her husband  barry what an extraordinary boy this is they found supper on the table and according to barrys invariable custom after acting a boiled fowl mrs barry was so unlucky as to place the liver wing on the wrong plate by signs and winks her husband endeavoured to attract her attention but in vain barrys visage approached the hue it had worn in othello and he quarrelled with his wife in real earnest she rose and quitted the room leaving a kiss upon our authors lips which made a deep impression upon his boyish mind this is all sufficiently natural and may be true  but he is never easy unless he improves upon the truth let the following testify next day i returned to school and my tasks were required of me as usual but i was an altered being i had sen mrs barry the great mrs barry  mrs barry was never out of my head  she was in my cup at breakfast my plate at dinner and my bed at night i called the gawky housemaid mrs barry and when the master asked me to translate  improbe amor i answered  cruel mrs barry the consequence was i was atlength flogged under the birchen influence my mists vanished as fogs under the suns and my sight was restored thus i bore mrs barrys impression on more parts than my lips is it to fancy or to memory that we are indebted for the following incidents among the occurrences of his boyish days  at petworth when viewing the statute gallery i saw a plaster bust of democritus moulded from the antique so much struck was i with the laughing physiognomy of the philosopher that unable to keep my hands offhim i gave him a familiar slap on the face  in return he nodded then tottered fell and scarcely left  a wreck behind lord egremonts servants could scarcely keep their hands off me while my aunt as usual exclaimed what a funny boy fred is  in the gradual progress of the family westward a direction in which the desires of the female portion of it invariably pointed our authors father took a house in the adelphi the mere mention of this name sets his imagination instantly at work and in a trice we have a carpenter evoked whose name is terence  this led to a curious equivoque for wilkes john wilkes who happened to meet him and his father together turning suddenly towards me said in his usual urbane manner  well my boy how far have you got i whose mind was wholly occupied by our late removal from salisburysquare replied  as far as the adelphi sir  upon my word rejoined wilkes  your son reynolds is very forward for his age  forward indeed  cried my father smiling  why fred you young rogue you know nothing of terence v  dont i replied i rather snappishly  why you yourself saw me with him thia very day and i heard him tell you that your upper story was in a very bad condition  ho ho said my father laughing heartily  1 understand the matter now j he means terence the foreman to the three adams who built the adelphi  i see wilkes replied joining my father in the laugh then added  if his blunders be always as amusing as the present the more frequently miss wilkes and i see our young friend the better but fancy has hitherto been only fluttering her pinions  it shortly takes a bolder flight and as the author is yet of an age unripe for strange adventures an elder brother is put forward as the hero of the story it would form the groundwork of an excellent afterpiece in three acts possibly it may already exist in that shape it is certaii that many a drama has been concocted out of slenderer materials  and in the hopes of drawing the attention of some ingenious playwright to its capabilities we shall briefly state the principal incidents  hot with tuscan grape and high in blood mr richard reynolds one night at the opera is smitten with thc charms of a lady extremely handsome the wife of sir charles  a baronet of fashion and fortune he gazes so intently and sighs so deeply that j his admiration becomes obvious not to though lady only but to the ladys husband scene ii represents the crush room of thc opera and here by one of those golden chances which favour dramatic heroes the lady by the pressure of the crow j is separated from her party richard advances proffers his services hands the lady to her carnage and being  hot with the tuscan grape as aforesaid puts his own foot on the step with the intention of accompanying her at this moment the  green eyed monster sir charles darts forward grasps our hero by the arm high words ensue and cards are exchanged the scene shifts and discovers richard wandering under the influence of the same tuscan grape in st jamesssquare after a while he seats himself under a portico and falls asleep to him enter an irish watchman and shortly after two irish chairmen with a sedan the body of richard is after a parley deposited in the sedan and the chairmen are departing with their burden when p hali ni recollects that it is necessary to learn first whither they are to go  the pockets of richard are searched and a card is found which paddythe watchman reads aloud by the light of his lantern  sir charles lower grosvenoistreet the next scene discovers the front of sir charless house lower grosvenorstreet enter a sedan  chairman knocks  servant appears at the door the paddies tell their story and show the card  and the servant fearing to disturb his master causes the sedanchair to be conveyed unopened into the library scene now changes and represents the interior of a library with a sedanchair solus after a pause up rises the lid of the sedan and richard awakened from his nap makes his appearance his astonishment at finding himself in a  a member of the house ot commons not long deceased whenever he quoted latin used to translate the passage  for the benefit of the country gentlemenso for their benefit and that of their ladies allow me to state that terence not the abovementioned carpenter hut the carthaginian wrote a comedy called the adelphi strange apartment is great who am i a good gesticulator would here set the house in an uproar when as he is about to ring for explanation the door opens and in rushes the identical fair one of the opera deceived by the imperfect light of a single wax taper and blinded by lier agitation she rushes into the arms of her supposed husband which u nothing loth are opening to receive her when lo the real husband enters all stand aghast the lady confounded takes her husband by the hand and weeps in silence richard completely sobered stammers out an explanation and pit and galleries loudly applaud the naivete which richard discovers in the relation of his story and the corroborating testimony of the two paddies are beginning to work conviction in the baronet when the latter suddenly breaks forth into a new passion and exclaims  this is not the only provocation i have received from you tonight do you know a captain smith sir but here we bethink us that we have inadvertently omitted a part of the drama necessary to the right understanding of the remainder after the exit of richard in the sedanchair the scene shifts from st jamesssquarc to st jamessstrcet and discovers a gang of pickpockets hustling a gentleman to them enter sir charles who succeeds in rescuing the stranger stranger returns thanks and asks the name and address of his deliverer sir charles gives him as he imagines his own address but it proves to be the card of mr reynolds the stranger captain smith as he is styled in the dramatis personae no sooner casts his eye over the inscription  mr richard reynolds than he cries  so sir i have found you at last and proceeds to vent a torrent of abuse after many loud invectives the mistake is cleared up by a mutual friend who drops in upon them from the clouds the author must not here be censured for a dramatic impropriety the knot was a most intricate one and in every respect di gnus vindice the moment is criticalcaptain smith is evidently proceeding to extremities wc may now go on with the library scene sir charles  but for this friend sir there i should have been as much indebted to mr richard reynolds for the loan of his name and character as i am here for the unexpected pleasure of hi3 company richard professes his regret but can offer no elucidation of this second misadventure  pledges his honour however to give the baronet satisfaction one way or other and proposes to defer ali further discussion till the morrow baronet consents and scene closes the parties go to bed and the violins play an interlude act iii scene last represents an apartment in the bedford  present mrrichard reynolds captain smith and sir charles parties mutually explain whence it appears that captain smith had been traduced by a mr richard reynolds who was not our mr richard reynolds but some other mr richard reynolds hence his wrath at the sight of the card presented him by the baronet our hero stands acquitted instead of exchanging shots the parties exchange apologies curtain falls amidst the shaking of hands  and  the mistakes of a night is announced for repetition without a dissenting voice the next recommendable subject from the dramatic portfolio of mr reynolds is the groundwork of a piece in one act to be entitled  jack and the highwayman and performed at sadlers wells with unbounded applause the hero is another of the adventurous family of the reynoldses scene i shows jack in his gig menaced by a highwayman who presents a pistol and furiously demands his money jacks horse takes fright as well as his rider and gallops off at full speed highwayman has his foot struck by the wheel and is unhorsed highwaymans horse mechanically follows the gig scene il discovers jack driving in great haste towards a town followed by highwaymans horse which jack who has not cast one look behind him all the while supposes to be highwayman himself mounted and in pursuit on reaching the inn jack discovers his mistake seizes the horse advertises it to be sold by auction  to defray expenses and nobody appearing to claim it actually disposes of it for thirty pounds and this jack calls  robbing a highwayman the author in the conception of this piece has fallen into an involuntary plagiarism the flight of jack followed by the horse which he supposes to be the highwayman mounted is an idea evidently derived from the adventures of father francis the italian story versified by colman but plagiarism is now so much the law of dramatic composition that this slight instance of importation may well be overlooked  hanc veniam may the playwrights say petimusque damusque viczsstm the subject we have next to recommend will require the playwright to gird up his loins for it can hardly be digested in anything short of five acts it is a serious comedy called  olivia garcias or the will the story for we cannot enter into particulars is briefly thismr b an english gentleman falls in love with a fair portuguese in lisbon the ward of our authors uncle by name olivia garcias when the guardian is for bringing the gentleman to terms mr b hesitates and is embarrassed and when guardian proposes marriage mr b looks as though the word had been a bullet shot at him from the mouth of a musket  he was already married a very charming scene ensues by the tagus on which mr b suddenly appears in his yacht and surprises olivia reading on the bank finding her obstinately virtuous he sails for england whither some chance or other shortly after brings olivia and where by a chance equally fortunate they encounter each other at the house of mr reynolds our authors father this is a scene of  deep and powerful interest and is followed up by much love much distraction much perplexity and much despair the difficulty is how to dispose of the superfluous wife  a knot requiring some pains and thought to unravel mr reynolds the elder proposes a divorce but this mode of solution though it might appear satisfactory enough to the attorney squares not at all with the ideas of the dramatist the plot is wound up in a much more masterly style the denouement is so truly dramatic that it deserves to be communicated at length one evening after dinner osborne the proprietor of the hotel opposite us was introduced on business when he informed my father one of his inmates a lady who a few days previously had arrived from france in a weak state of health found herself so rapidly decaying that she was most anxious to have her worldly affairs immediately settled by a legal adviser as soon as he had made this communication osborne retired urging my father to follow him instantly instantly being a common sense and not a common law term my father paused and aid  probably she speaks only frenchin that case you had better go jack as i am afraid i have forgotten all mine 1 will replied jack the hero of  jack and the highwayman  after the next glass and then the conversation recurring with redoubled ardour to olivia and the divorce the new client was awhile totally forgotten another visit from osborne reminded them of their neglect and he frankly avowed that if my father could not instantly attend the lady application must be made for other professional assistance jack then rose and after one more glass departed in about half an hour he returned j much shocked and affected by the interview he said that when in health the unfortunate stranger must have been a woman of considerable personal attractions and though now evidently in a dying state she dictated her last intentions with a feeling and firmness that at once excited his pity and admiration he brought with him a rough draught of the will for my fathers perusal and revision  short and sweet i vow said my father  she has left blanks i nee for thc name of the principal devisee and for that of the executor these i presume she intends to fill up herself   she does replied my brother  and she wished also that her own servants should be the witnesses to her signature instead of me or any of your clerks and she added that when the will shall be signed to prevent accidents she would send you a counterpart a will was completed on that evening and immediately dispatched by my father to osbornes on the same night he received the promised counterpart with positive directions not to open it until after the decease of the testatrix and in an accompanying envelope a ten pound bank note as a remuneration for his trouble on inquiry the following morning the unfortunate lady was found to be considerably worse and in the evening she expired my father then opened the will and in the presence of olivia her lover and the whole family commenced reading it but not aloud our curiosity having been already considerably excited by the mystery attached to the stranger we all anxiously observed my fathers countenance which to our surprise suddenly displayed strong emotion and agitation before however we could ask the cause raising his eyes from the document and fixing them on olivia he exclaimed in a hurried faltering tone  olivia to whom do you suppose this illfated person bequeaths her whole property v he then read aloud as follows  givedevisebequeaththat freehold estate called and all other property i die possessed of to my wronged husband edward b now residing in london and whom i implore as the last request of a misled though attached wife to follow to the grave his once loved eleanor  and there to bury with her all his just resentment thus terminated the divorce in a few days the youthful widower attended the unfortunate eleanor to the grave j and within the following halfyear the happy olivia to the altar we cannot afford to exhibit any more of the authors dramatic schemes although there are many others equally worthy of notice among these may be specified the story of the monk and his capacious cloak  the dialogue at cross purposes starting with  jai vu votre pair yy the scene at lord grandisons in which the dramatis personae are a french viscount an english lawyer a german notary and our author an english attorney assembled together apparently for no other purpose than getting up a scene  dr franklin for the first time  bought and sold an interview with the attorneygeneral sir pepper arden on the subject of a patent for a balloon of novel construction that by artificial wind counteracting the effects of the natural wind was to sail like a ship et ccetera et ccetera et ccetera as blanchard says the pains taken by the author to dramatise the history of his life and to enrich it with additional particulars from the realms of imagination have arisen from the very mistaken idea that the simple truth is what mr reynolds would call an unendurable and that a narrative can only recommend itself by eccentricities and oddities and by strange incidents told in as strange a manner mr reynolds is eternally beset with the fear of beine dull and in his attempts to avoid the imputation becomes actually so instead of making us cry out  mad author mad composition the summit of his ambitionhe is but lively dull or to make free with the name of mr h ts double in vivian grey let him be called  vivacity dull an appellation he but too often deserves he is in fact endurable only when he is neither eccentric nor witty for hi wit is dullness and his eccentricity commonplace there are portions of this life which to reperuse would be as intolerable an infliction as to read an act of any of what he calls his half damned or whole damned plays on the other hand there are good

with the following sentence these are all my recollections of him  that they are not more extensive is no fault of his he gave us time to stamp his image on our minds for he lived till he was one

in  a full suit of goldlaced scarlet a small cocked hat kneebreeches and silk stockings conspicuously displaying a pair of gouty legs i recollect that after the performance of othello i was much surprised by seeing a person put his head through the hole in the green curtain and facetiously say to the audience  remember me tomorrow on which immediately followed a loud laugh this person mrs

about a poem which one of them had written and which another declared he had heard so often that he could repeat it with as much facility as its author  facilis descensus averni muttered the doctor and then added in an authoritaftvetone  ring the be one of yoy ring the bpi and the servant was ordered to summon my father on whose appearance the doctor formally arose and said  when next i call

fictions to rescue it from the imputation of commonplace is tolerably faithful westminster was then what it is now  not only in its fashion but in its system of education latin latingreek greek and the measurement of verses were our sole themes morning noon and night every other thing has changed either for the better or worse  but this both building and principles remains in statu quo if queen elizabeth were to raise her head from the tomb and with astonished eyes search for an old acquaintance she would recognise but one i think and that would be westminster school his debut is characteristic of the place he found them busily engaged in the rehearsal of a farce  pleased and unobserved i stood listening until suddenly catching their eyes with a loud halloo and a cry of new boy new boy they surrounded and seized me then mounting me on the table they all at once exclaimed  which of us will you fight i supposing they jested replied any of you  oh oh you will will you v9

late duke of bedford they were in the same class and of nearly the same age on the half holidays we used to stroll together to his estates either in covent garden or bloomsbury square and then with boyish exultation he would exclaim  all this is mine  then we would enter stacies hotel in the former place and call in a swaggering tone of half real half mock authority for the master who well knowing his young landlord would immediately set before us soups venison and all  the fat of the land our author sat iii the pit the night on which garrick took leave of the stage an occasion signalised by a riot and struggle for places almost unprecedented though a side box close to where we sat was completely filled we beheld the door burst open and an irish gentleman attempt to make entry vi et armis  shut the door boxkeeper   loudly cried some of the party  theres room by the powrs  cried the irishman and persisted in advancing on this a gentleman in the second row rose and exclaimed  turn out that blackguard   oh and is that your mode honey 1 coolly retorted the irishman  come come out my dear and give me satisfaction or ill pull your nose faith you coward and shillaly you through the lobby   this public insult left the tenant in possession no alternative  so he rushed out to accept the challenge  when to the pits general amusement the irishman jumped into his place and having deliberately seated and adjusted himself he turned round and cried  fu talk to you after the play is over we are tempted to add another specimen of irish character our authors father accompanied lord grandison to ireland and took frederick who was the pet of the family along with him our voyage ended the following evening when we landed at waterford where we were much struck by the beauty of the quay the customhouse and the cathedral but my attention was soon withdrawn by metal more attractive a lamp post with a playbill on it stating in large letters that  hamlet was that evening to be performed for the benefit of a mr randall a supposed london star we took a hurried dinner and after it went to the theatre which was so nearly empty though for a favourites benefit that

gratitude to mr harris for occasional freeadmissions and used boastingly to exclaim to my father  thank fortune out of my own family i dont know a lordlittle did i then think that i should ever live to see this distressed personage in possession of a peerage the seals and the annual receipt of above fifteen thousand pounds one of his first clients was admiral kepple who being brought to a court martial by sir hugh pallister and acquitted presented his successful young advocate with a banknote of one thousand pounds mr erskine showed us this novel sight and exclaimed  voila the nonsuit of cow beefy my good friends in the first volume are the journals of one or two excursions on the continent but whether penned at seventeen or seventy we are unable to decide certainly they are not without marks of having been written at no very remote period if they do belong to our authors nonage it is curious to remark how exactly the youth of twenty resembled the youth of seventy style and turn of thought or more properly speaking the absence of it are precisely the same at both periods there is little in them that will gratify the reader at paris he observed the evident discontent of the people this was in the year 1782 and saw many caricatures of the royal family in one of these caricatures fish were seen flying in the air while birds were drowning in the sea a court of justice was inverted  the king in his robes stood attempting to water some drooping plants but the water flew upwards by his side on its hinder legs stood a large female wolf to whom an immense pocket was attached into which several courtiers of the austrian faction were seen rapidly pouring gold while in the wolfs paw was a large flambeau whose long flame descending perpendicularly fired their wigs on the wolfs head which bore a most ridiculous resemblance to the queen were immense plumes of feathers  alluding to the feather mania with which marie antoinette had infected the court at a period when they were only worn on the heads of horses never had fashion a greater rage  every week an additional a handsomer or a larger feather was attached until at length the queen her suite and her horses at a short distance from the beholder were lost in one waving undulating forest of feathers we ought not to forget to enumerate among the authors parisian adventures the story of the  right man newell assuredly circumstances conspired to make a dramatist of our author  for every thing that befell him seemed to belong more properly to the stage of the theatre than the stage of the world we have no room for the history of the authors numerous family of dramas whether damned or successful he does not appear to be very sensitive on the subject of his dramatic fame but records the various rubs he received with great good humour at bristol he went to thc theatre to enjoy the triumph of his firstborn werter but was driven away before the close of the second act by the following gentle criticism of a stranger  wretched sad stuff sir and if you will begin to hiss i will join you with all my heart the profits that accrued to him from the two eldest of his dramatic family were not very splendid  see said he to macklin  i have but exactly eight pounds by two tragedies  and very good pay too sir gruffly replied my orthodox patriarch  so go home and write two more tragedies and if you gain four pounds by each of them why young man the author of paradise lost will be nfool to you the performance of his opera which he called the crusade and which somebody nicknamed the cascade was distinguised by a laughable incident that somewhat relieved the dullness of the evenings entertainment but our misfortunes did not stop here  for during mrs billingtons bravura in the last act mr billington her

enough of it however to judge that mr lawson is exactly the proper kind of biographer for laud isle is adapted for the task by an unhesitating faith in the perfection of his hero and a hatred for his opponent only qualified by contempt in his eyes every puritan of thc seventeenth century was either a fanatic or a hypocrite we shall review the book in time for our next weeks publication  the water witch or the skimmer of the seas a tale by the author of 1 the borderers c   3 vols 12mo the novelistfof the seasproduce what he will in the shape of talesmust always be readable not that he ever makes a good tale but because he paints his own element and all that floats upon it so admirably the water witch the name of a smuggling vessel is but another tel rover in the beauty of its construction and the facility and all but intelligence of its movements the commander the skimmer of the seas is again the identical skipper of the rover the same bold and reckless character with the like generous and seamanlike qualities the skimmer is apparently nothing but a smuggler while the other is wholly a pirate but the marking difference in the water witch is the introduction of some mechanism and mummery to attach the crew to his person and interests by the chains of their superstitions the scene of the tale is almost entirely confined to the waters of new yorkthe intricacies of which with the land though laid down with the precision of a geometrical surveyor and described with the authors own glowing pencil still require a chart of so much importance are the localities to a tolerable conception of the piece the chief characters are an honest dutch burghers family the skimmer himself and the gallant captain of the english cruizer on the station and the period of time is the latter part of queen annes reign when lord cornbury the queens cousin had just been superseded in the government of new york but was still unable to leave the colony for the claims of his creditors he is re presentedhistoricallyas a man of profligate habits and drivento enable him to meet the demands incurred by extravagancenot only to connive at smuggling but to join in the ventures and connect himself with even more unjustifiable transactions buccaneering habits still lingered among the english and the drakes and italeighs who were in their day no better than legalised pirates had left their mantles behind them and they were not yet worn to rags iord cornbury is brought prominently forward but unluckily for the interest of the tale is not well mixed up with its texture he only fills the pages without advancing the story the old burgher has a country house a few miles from new york but still within the waters of the estuary where he occasionally goes professedly for country air and retirement but in reality the better to cover his intercourse with the commander of the water witch for he dabbles in contraband wares on one occasion he is accoinpanied by his niece a wealthy heiressa lady for whom the captain of the english cruizer avows his admiration the captain who calls to pay his devoirs makes some awkward discoveries relative to the old burghers dealings with the smuggler and his duties and affections come a little into conflict he is however too much a man of honour and too much devoted to his profession to suffer his public duties to give way to his private feelings they only mo dify his conduct circumstances occur also to excite his jealousyhe surprises the young lady smiling very graciously upon a youthful but very animated personage who was displaying before her his silks and laces and whom the captain concludes though lie seems fitter for a ladys boudoir than a smugglers deck is the notorious commander of the water witch that same night she euddqnly disappears and every body as well as the captain believes her to have gore o with the skimmer on board the watprivitch this remarkable vessel avens wel wpows on the station the calptin haid bong had orders to seizeher and exasperated as he was at the recent event on discovering she was within the waters he loses not a moment in commencing the pursuit of her the chase is eagerly prosecuted and vast space is occupied in describing the witchs ma noeuvres and the captains annoyance at finding himself repeatedly baffled the sailors universally believe her some unearthly thing giving up the pursuit at last as hopeless the captain returns to his station and visiting the old burghers country house he again finds the lady who reappears as it nothing had happened and again in company with the smuggler ihe burghers house is neutral groundthe skimmer is safe from his resentments and his authority but returning to his ship in the even ing the captain intercepts him in a boat and whips him off to his own deck the seizure is communicated at the smug glers desire to the family and they all in a body come aboard and the captain politely cedes his cabin to the party but the water witch is within sight and he with the visitors and the prisoner on board again starts in pursuit of her and is again fairly baffledhe loses sight of her but falls in with a french frigate and an engagement ensues in which the captain offers the skimmer a chance of redeeming his credit in the command of some guns the offer leads to a discovery which explains some previous mysteriesthe skimmer proves a lady and declines the com mand returning to the new york waters the real skimmer comes on board and gives the captain notice of a new and more formidable french force and finally by his exertions and those of part of his crew rescues him from certain destruction scarcely is the captain thus nobly rescued when the ship is discovered to be on fire and a tremendous scene of distress followsfrom which when all hope has vanished they are again delivered by the witchs crew discoveries and explanations now take place at the old burghersthe lady who so long figured as the skimmer is the old mans daughtershe finally refuses to abandon the skimmer  the scene here is a very striking oneand he and she put to sea again and are heard of no more  the life and times of frederic reyolds written by himiself  2 vols 8vo pp 795 london 1826 colburn so many volumes of reminiscences recollectiorls and autobiographies nows appear that one might almost be tempted to think the faculty of muemory improved or personal vanity on the increase there is however a fashion in authorship as swell as in every thing else and mr colburn who knows the public taste as well as any bibliopole in the three kingdoins no sooner makes a hit than he follows it upthat is strikes while the iron is hot this has been the case with the novels of fasitionable life of which we have one at least every month and with anecdotal biograpiy such as the reminiscences of kelly the memicrs of the maargravine of anspach and the life and times of frederic reynolds life and times of frederic reynolds there is something both conceited and vapowing in mlr reynoldss title certainly coar and his times cromwell and his tincs or napoleon and his times sound well enouglh for they wcrc the most important personages of their respective periods and liad no small share in rendering the times what they were we might also take shakespeare and his times or milton or pope or atly other individual who towered above all iis compeers in some particular art though in such case the association ought to be limited nays we would scarcely have quarrelled with mr 1reynoldss title had his book referred only to dramatic subjectsthough hie is not the greatest dramatic writer of his times certainly that palm belongs to sheridain and no one we believe will dare dispute it mite him with these objections to tle title our bolt is shot and we turn with pleasure to the wvork itelf which has our unqualified aplrcbaio1 it is 1y far the nmvst entertain i i ing piece of autobiography that has appeared for many years every page teems with some entertaining anecdote or interesting incident mlic kellys reminiscences were amusing but kelly cannot write okeefes anecdotes are of the same class but he poor fellow has outlived a share of his memory buit not so mr reynolds who is a very clever writer and whose memory is unimpaired besides he had all the advantages of birth education and genteel society lie too has a keen perception of what is worthy of notice and has kept so close a look out to what has been written by others or what is already before the public that there is scarcely an anecdote in his hook that is not new the work too is written with so much candour pleasantry and good humour that it is impossible not to be delighted with it and to entertain much personal respect for the author there is another thing we like in these memoirs they are not exclusively confined to theatrical subjects but contain several anecdotes of some of the most distinguished men of the time the narrative also is sufficiently connected to show the progress of the author which lhe traces even from his boyish days tip to the very time that mr colburn not desdemona bade him tell it air reynolds was born on the 1st of november 1764 his father was an eminent solicitor who had for clients the great lord chatham i mr wilkes c c we do not however intend to give a connected memoir of our author but merely at present select a few of the most piquant anecdotes the first is a ludicrous account of a card party at montpelier row where mr reynoldss grandmother lived and whose neighbours four old maids were called manille spadille basto and punto mr reynolds was at one of their parties 6n newyears day which he thus describes were i to live a thousand years i never should forget the stately dullness and formality of this antiquated party nothsno was heard above the sipping and gurgling of tea but whispering comparisons on their losses and gains at cards congratulations on the others and their own extreme good looks and mutual informations on the state of the weather some admired the parrots and patted the dogs while others displayed their ignorance in learned disquisitions on the indian bonzes and chinese josses among the first that entered from amontpellier row were alanille spadille basto and punto hluge caps and little heads rouged faces white wigs compressed waists cxteiided hips and limping gaits were the characteristics of this antediluvian quartetto at sight of them whether from astonishment fear or laughter the cup from which i was drinking slipped from my grasp into the lap of a lady next me here was confusion all the stately corpses immediately came to life buzzing about the scene of disaster the lady screamed that she was scalded i blushed and begged pardon and my grandmother alhnost wept over the fragments of one of her choicest cups  as soon as tranquillity and formality were again restored quadrille was proposed and all immediately took their stations either as players or betters impelled by ay dramatic propensity i stationed myself close to mrs clive now mentally giving the pre ference to her and now to mrs barry of tws occupation however i soon began to weary and closing my eyes uttered a loud and protracted yawn then approaching manille and co i tweedled their chairs and their gowns mixed their tricks by hunting for the court cards and stole snuff from their boxes which i continued to cram up my nose till i had induced a fit of sneezing violent enough to threaten the destruction of every ligament in my little frame then the paroxysm finished more wearied than ever i began to yawn again in course all these various manoeuvres drew on me the black looks of my grandmother but unhappy that i was my destiny led me to me it yet blacker before the close of the even ing  it did not require much discrimination or knowledge of the game to discover the loser from the winner i soon observed mrs clives countenance alternately redden and turn pale while her antagonist vainly attempted the suppression of a satisfaction that momentarily betrayed itself in the curling corners of her ugly mouth and in the twinkling of her piggish eyes at this sight iirs clives spleen seemed redoubled at last her manille went and with it the remnants of her temper wer face was of an universal crimson and tears of rage seemed ready to start into her eyes at that very moment as satan would have it her opponent a dowager whose hoary head and eyebrows were as white as those of an albiness triumphantly and briskly demanded payment for the two black aces  two black aces  answered the enraged loser in a voice rendered almost unintelligible by passion chere take the money though instead i wish i could give you tuo black eyes you old white cat waccomparnying the wish with a gesture that threatened a possibility of its execution  the stately starched old lady who in her eagerness to receive her winnings had half risen from her chair astounded at her reception could not have sank back into it with more dismay if she had really received a blow she literally closed her eyes and opened her mouth and for several moments thus remained fixed by the magnitude of her horror  the words sounded through the roomw with an awful clearness of articulation that fixed every guest like the stone subjects ot the king of the black isles in the action ot the previous moment one old ladys hand stuck midway between her snuffbox and her nose while 1 basto who had turned the cock of a lemonade urn stood abstractedly staring as the fluid overflowed her gass then the tray and at last the floor at this sight or rather combination of sights i never shall forget my delight it seemed to forget my dyelgti seemed to accumulate in despite of mysef until totally unable longer to retain it i burst into a loud and coutinued laugh thi soufl1 that at any time would have been scaring to ears unaccustomed for at least half an age to any audible expression of mgatification above that of a whimpering and accordant titter now by its strong contrast with their stilly horror was rendered terrific itecovering herself with dignity my grandmother advanced and with imperial frowns expressed her commands for an immediate silencein vain like an alarum whose spring once removed will not cease till unwound so my risible machinery once set in motion was only to be stopped by satiety in fact i remained roaring with increasing glee till a hand was placed on my shoulder and i was genteelly turned out of the room our next is a sort of irish benefit which an actor of the name of randall a supposed london star had at waterford  we took a hurried dinner and after it went to the theatre which was so nearly empty though for a favourites benefit that the hero of the night on his entrance suddenly receded with a start of horror then again advanced and bursting with ragre exclaimed  now ladies and gentlemen ought ye not to be ashamed of yourselves  and is this the way you support sterling talent  by the powrs replied a spectator near the orchestra i only know the whole pit kcrethat is mn self my son lary and donaghadoo my mothers sonpaid to support youand is this your gratitude jewel  feeth and thats just our way of thinking cried a voice from the gallery  so go it my pippins three cheers for the present company and three groans for the absent  these opinions opened randalls eyes and he apologized and thanked his few but real benefactors  the play then proceeded and for some time vith only a few interruptions when suddenly a new and most unexpected actor made his appearance no less a personage than our old enemy father neptune who owing to an uncommonly high spring tide followed us up even into a theatre at first however he only invaded the passages and lower parts beneath the stage but soon filling them and bending his irresistible course through the orchestra to the pit it appeared probable that more personages than ophelia would have  too mnuck f aterat length the manager stepped forward and informing us that rather than see an existence put to our lives he begged we would return our money and whuibly gave us leave to depart lord thurloiv was of opinion that the stern look of a courageous man would awe a lion and if report says truly no person was more likely to effect this than his lordship if perhaps we except dr willis who attenided his late majesty during his illness in 17889 and of whoin we have the following anecdote related by the doctor to our author dr wvillis then simply a country practitioner speedily became a prrincial actor in the dranma isle lhad an  eye like maars to threaten or cominaiid threaten in 6eryy sense of the word  for his numerous patients stood a3 much in awe of this tormit dable weapon as of bars chains or straigtht f waistcoats after a few weeks attendance i allowing his majesty a razor to shave hinmself t and a penknife to cut his nails dr warren dr reynoldls and the other physicians  openly attacked dr wllis with a charge of rshness and imprudence of evening before a committee of the house of cmoznons burke also was very severe on this point and authoritatively and loudly demanded to know  if the royal patient had become outrageous at the moment what power the doctor possessed of instantaneously terrifying him into obedience i  place the candles between us mr burke replied the doctor in an equally authoritative tone and ill give you an answer there sir by the eye  i should have looked at him thus sir thus   burke instantaneously averted his head and making no reply evidently acknowledged this basiliskan authority mr reynolds was very intimate with major topham andt in his company visited the miser elwes who had a formidable rival in a neighboura barrister who gave a tenant at midsummer a glass of wine out of the same bottle as lhe had had one at christmas and which had notbeen opened in the intermediate time major topham though not a miser was as eccentric an may be seen by the account of his costume  ills dress consisted of a short scarlet coat with large cut steel buttons a very short white waistcoat topboots and leather breeches so long in their upper quarters as almost to reach his chin in order that the peculiarity of this dress should be duly appreciated it must be remembered that at that time every other person wore very long coals and very long waistcoats and breeches so very short that half the day and one whole hand were entirely employed in raising them en derriere to avoid any awkward declension en avant i have seen many of the court of aldermen enter guildhall in this manner until every body in consideration of its convenience defying its singularity adopted tophams costume thus he had the ecat of introducing the present male fashion which in comparison with the last is not only useful but ornamental among other successful pieces written by mr reynolds wvas the dramatist and when it first caine out was very productive old nurse morgan who had been long in the family was anxious to see the play and no orders being given mr jreynolds who resided at this time in the temple gave her four

time i think your honiour yourself will allow i cannot axe yam a farthing short of another two shillings of amacklims rudeness our author gives an instance we could forgive any thing in a man of iniety or a hundred years oid but his snappishness was both affected and overbearing a piece called the crusade was got up at covent gartien theatre by mr reynolds  during its rehearsal the late duke of cumberland who was fond of theatricals accompanied by a colonel attended the carpenters were all engaged that morning in setting the platform for the storming of jerusalem the grand event of the piece consequently there was no scenery on the stage  the duke who evidently had expected a grand display expressed his surprise and disappointment at seeing only a wide waste when one of the stagecarpenters a simple but officious fellow advancing towards his royal highness told him with great humility that as the flats a part of the scenery and the corresponding side pieces could not be set owing to the platform he hoped that he and his friend would condescend to imagine them in their respective situations 6  i dont understand exclaimed thd duke and the colonel together   dont you  rejoined the green coat man  then with your royal highness and the other gentlemans permission i will explain my meaning w hen ceremoniously conducting them to the back of the stage and stationing himself at the side with great selfsufficiency hie said  there  now please your royal highness look  i am the side scene and you are the pair of flats now you understand  every body even the duke and the colonel enjoyed heartily the unintentional allusion the crusade did not succeed and mr reynolds acknowledges with almost unparalleled candour that a more mawkish hotchpotch a more sickening melange than the crusade was never offered to the public there were certainly some untoward circumstances attending its first performance and yet it was performed for sixteen niglhts  on the first

B2177,['9045688'],  nadir shah by sir mortimer durand with illustrations constable  co sir mortimer durand has fallen between the proverbial two stools he has written a biographical romance which is at once too romantic to be a real biography and too biographical to be a true romance he confesses that he adopted this form  after some doubt because he found that  the existing accounts of nadir shah whether persian or european are hardly the material from which exact history could now be written no doubt  exact history is rarely to be deduced from eighteenthcentury persian or any other chronicles but a tolerably accurate biography of the great turkman conqueror might have been compiled which would at least have proved a useful contribution to history and would have been valued by students and even by orientalists to whom sir mortimer durands persian scholarship is known to such the present work without a single reference to original authorities is of little interest beyond showing the conception of nadir shahs character and career which an able man formerly resident in teheran and acquainted with the persian sources has formed even this has too much of the obvious in it and offers scarcely any originality we accept unreservedly sir mortimer durands assurance that his story is not  inconsistent with known facts and that he has done his  best throughout to treat known facts with proper respect  but since  this book does not pretend to be a history there appears to be no obligation to treat it with proper respect from the historical or biographical point of view taken merely as a romance founded upon history with the design of giving  more life and colour  to the story of nadirs career the work suffers from overlearning most of the romances in which the manners and modes of thought of the east and its  local colour  are sought to be imparted have been failures there are very few who possess mr marmaduke pickthalls happy gift and though sir mortimer knows persian and has been fairly intimate with upperclass persians we doubt if he knows the people as for example prof brown knew them when he lived amongst them or if he can think in persian as mr pickthall thinks in arabic the result in the present case is that the reader who is probably unfamiliar with persian ways is annoyed by frequently occurring words which he cannot understand and requires a glossary which is not supplied  the romance is burdened with archaeology and the action hampered by an attempt at historical accuracy which nevertheless leaves the reader unconvinced those who are already interested in nadir shah will read this romance of his life with appreciation but not because it is romance those who know nothing about him or his time will be perpetually puzzled and irritated it is not the business of romance to teach history and the mistake here made is not so much the founding of the romance upon an historical basis as the choking of the romance by too elaborate an historical setting the long accounts for example of nadirs campaigns have nothing to do with romance and are merely digressions perfectly justifiable and indeed necessary in a biography but out of place here the subject we admit lends itself to treatment as a novel or as a drama the rise of the turkman robber chief from obscure poverty to w ide empirewonderful though not unparalleled in the east the land of opportunities  the spoiling influence of success and the growth of arrogant ruthlessness under the sun of too favouring fortune the alienation of the affections of the people and finally the army by frequent acts of irresponsible injustice and barbarity culminating in the blinding of his son and the inevitable downward path pointed out by offended nemesis ending in the longforeseen assassinationhere are the makings of a tragedy sir mortimer durand has realised this clearly enough and has drawn the character of nadir with insight  but he is always taking our attention off the main subjectan interesting though not very unusual psychological studyto carry us away to campaigns and marches in places with outlandish names outlandish at least to the majority of readers which could have been sufficiently indicated by a few allusions without interrupting the development of the story the real romantic interest centres not in nadir but in the beautiful tender rajput girl whom he made his bride in india when he was crushing the mogul emperor here sir mortimer is fairly in the realm of romance for whatever truth there may be in nadirs marriage to an indian wife the story of her relations with the conqueror could never have been divulged but the introduction of sitara and her devotion gives the book its chief merit as a romance and also a real charm the indian girl is admirably drawndrawn with knowledge as well as sympathy the inevitable contralto to sitaras soprano the shirazi wife a particularly hateful characterrests on surer historical foundations for sir mortimer had traditions of her related to him by a persian minister who had them from one who had known her second husband residence in persia does not tend to exalted opinions of the people and we do not advise persians of either sex to apply to sir mortimer durand for j a character we cannot recommend the book to novelreaders pur sang they will find it tedious in spite of some charmingand some rather realisticharem scenes the landscape and the historic durbars and the military surroundings are well done yet all the time we feel ourselves not in persia of the eighteenth century but rather in the persia of nasiruddin shah and that is not the feeling the author designed,britain_contra
