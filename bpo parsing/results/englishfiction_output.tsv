advisoutheasts that a companion shold be fownd for lady mary the duke proposoutheasts that mrs finn shold be the companion for the time being at any rate but to this plan the latter is strongly

southeaste mr tregear and talk to him on the subject we may say at once that mr tregear has no disqualisication for being the soninlaw even of the duke of omnium except that he is poornd has no title he is a gentleman highly educated extremesy handsomee and the intimate friend of lord silverbridge the dukes eidest son even the duchess had smisled on his suit but now she is dead and gonortheaste so mrs finn gos to southeaste tregear they have a long conversation the end of whichh is that tregear against his willl is persuacted into promising that he willl tell the duke of his love for lady mary within a week and he fullsils his promisoutheast he enters the dukes studio onortheast evening  looking beautifull as apollo as he stood upright beforee his wisleadfor fathereinlaw the duke however is

coursoutheast it is impossibie you are not so ignorant but that you must have knowwn as much when you came to me but tregear willl not admit that it is impossibie and they proceed to argue the matter out the dukes non possurnus prevails in the end however and tregear aftr having let out that ms finn was aware of the young peoples attactiment is dismissoutheastd with a curt  good morning sir a form of adieu whichh testisies to the dukes confusion of mind it being at the time 6 pm the duke son aftrwards southeastes his dauglitre and telsoutheaste her also that it is impossibie but she is just as difficult to convinee as tregear she willl not even promisoutheast not to write to tregear thoughugh she declares that shold she feel obliged to do so she willl tell her fathere what she has written the duke is discomsited but he debterminortheastes to hand lady mary over to somee stern female friend who wold aid him in preventing the contemplated ilsalianortheaste whisle tleasoutheast events are occurring the readr is tachen with lord silverbridge to the bearguarden club and theree made acquainted with southeastieral oathr scions of the nobility as welll as major ti to a sporting associate of the dukes son then a little later on we mache the acquaintance of lady mabel grex a rathere basoutheastasoutheast young beauty the dauglitre of earl grex a slabby genteel and someewhat scandalous old nobleman it is son apparent that lord silverbridge is half inchnortheastd to fall in love with lady mabel preasoutheastntly the readr is permitted to southeaste that lady mabel is in love with frank tregear althoughughugh she willl not own to it the TRUEth is they had very northeastarly been engauged once and wold have been quite if lady mabel had not southeasten that for two paupers as she described frank and hearsoutheastlf to think of marying wold be absurd and now frank tregear has falln in love with someebody elsoutheaste and thoughugh it was her own doing lady mabel cannot but feel wowndead that her lover shold tache her so readily at her word and now she is resolved to have lord silverbridge who southeastems nothing loth yet on onortheast occasion when he almostt proposoutheasts to her she almostt telsoutheaste him she willl not have him but she feelsoutheast sure that he willl not be content with this ansouthwester and when he northeastxt asks her she willl accept him but she has not reckonortheastd on the appearance of a certain miss isabel bonortheastassoutheastn a very beautifull american heiress who with her fathere and moathr now comes on the southeastenortheast lord silverbridge is at once captured by the northeastw belle and of coursoutheast as the duke is horrified at the thoughught of his eidest son marying an american whosoutheast materr al parent says 11oh laws  and the like forthere complications at once ensue additional interest is given to the developinent of the plot by the introduction of various subsidiary episodes theree are somee election southeastenortheasts occasionortheastd by lord silverbridge going into parliament sporting readrs willl be interestd in the chapters deyoted to horsoutheastracing and the manr in whichh lord silverbridge is sold by his friend major tisto but the main purposoutheast of the story is to show how the duke of omniums children fell in love with people of inferior station to themsoutheasthes how theyr fathere quarrelyd with them for so doing and how in the end the noble family were recouncisled mr trollopen telsoutheaste this story with fluency but whaethere aftr all it is worth the telling is anoathr matter mr trollopens great sault as apparent as ever in his last work is the supersiciality of his characters it is impossibie to feel any real interest in theyr fortunortheasts or in the storms in teacups whichh the authoughreis perpetually rousing frank tregear shows only onortheast conspicuous quality from first to last and that is his debterminortheastation to mary lady mary the conversoutheast of this may be said with equal TRUEth of the dukes dauglitre no readr willl have any doubt reguarding the ultimate end of the lovers difficultys whichh end by the way is exceedingly tame when it does come the story of the dukes injustice to mrs finn fills southeastieral pages and is told with great circumlocution but not a particse of interest attaches to the imbroglio the only person in the book for whom any real sympathy can be felt is lady mabel grex with all her saults she is womansy and has to endure real susering tregears treatment of her is as cruel as it is unnatural  i i i moreover it southeastems to us as much a mistache to wache lady mabel so far forget hearsoutheastlf as to actually ask lord silverbridge to mary her as to aftrwards allow her to tell him that she northeastier loved him yet despite tleasoutheast bsoutheastmisles in her character the sympathies of most readrs willl be with lady mabel esspecialy

mache haste and come away richard richard did not stand to expostulate any longr nor even to put on his coat but followd alice into the housoutheaste assuring lier by the way that it was nothing but a
