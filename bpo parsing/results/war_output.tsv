standard of another fair and impartial to all the characters stand out in marked individuality living and breathing creatures while the scenery is as delicately true to nature as if a gainsborough or a linnell had painted it it is a charming book minute in its details yet never tiring and so full as it were of slight masterly touches on the glaze of the picture that the reader is every now and then tempted to linger as he proceeds with the story to enjoy a second perusal of many of its pages lest some of these delicate touches should have escaped him as an illustration we quote the opening passage of the book the early summer of 1792 was ripening the wheatears and darkening the vine leaves about the hamlet of fayeauxjonquilles the season was too far advanced however for showing the appropriateness of its sweetsmelling name or for proving that it had contributed in its day to the four thousand crowns worth of jonquilles spent on the progress of the great monarch to chantilly which is pleasantly chronicled by that jonquille among french womenmadame de sevigne but say was lucky in more than its name of fayeamongthejonquilles it had plump wheaters instead of the shrivelled heads of rye which replaced at a later date the jonquilles that enamelled and perfumed the steps of the sublime louis its present proprietors had suffered less than some from the roadmaking the charge on salt and the general taxes of the french people which took somewhat from the scent of the jonquilles and the sublimity of the louis say was in the interior of france sixty miles from paris it was

road bordered by walnut trees wound and clomb to the tour de faye giving one the impression that the village rose on tiptoe to curtsy to the feudal lord and master in spite of the prohibition of titles of rank by a national assembly and the flight of great flocks of nobles the tour was a true antique not setting its claim on massiveness or splendour it had the hoary picturesque grace of a grey lichen set between the green of the earth and the blue or daffodil or peabloom of the sky the walls were very thick and pierced with narrow windows they looked as if they might have stood sieges from the normans and the english the league and the fronde and as if they might yet stand another siege from a new jacquerie as an historical novel  citoyenne jacqueline  will owe much of its success to its thorough dramatic style not in the sense of an acting play but of one written for the closet never straining after effect and every page adding fresh proof of the unusual power of the writer and of the careful pains and study she has bestowed upon her work differing in the details of its manipulation from that of the waverley series there is still the same key to its inspirationa thorough knowledge of the spirit of the time in which the action of the tale mioves rather than the reproduction of the dry bones of past events scott knew well this secret of his art and so made the historical novel his own and many as have been the attempts to follow in his footsteps as yet failure or at least but partial success has been the chief result stepping out of the beaten track of those who consider the historical novel rather as a chronicle of facts than as the exponent of thoughts miss tytler manages to centre the chief interest of the story around the changing fortunes of the owner of the old feudal tour de say and his familyvicissitudes of which the description would be both trite and commonplace but for the skilful way in which are laid bare the workings of the human heart out of the depths of which whatever the training gush forth under the pressure of adversity very much that tends to ennoble our nature the novelists privilege is freely made use of but so carefully is fiction interwoven with fact that it claims the full merit of the proverb southeast 10on e vero e ben trovato take this picture of an old french marquis of 1 792 monsieur de lussac existed principally in connexion with meals but there could not be a huger mistake than to suppose him in consequence a nobody on the contrary wherever he went he became the presiding genius of the kitchen where asking and receiving cart blanche he installed himself in the admiring confidence of the chief of the department he entered so completely heart and soul into businessthrew himself so disinterestedly and generously into the choicest most recherche achievements for the entertainment of the chateau or hotel in which he was guest that like his less endowed marquise he emerged from his field of enterprise in a collapsed condition sat with halfclosed eyes or slumbered outright till the moment of trial when the fillet a la du barry or the salade i la volaille rewarded his great qualifications and covered him with glory then the marquis was at his culminating pointthen he not only carved and sent round a dish as a finished artiste would dispense it but he rendered it historical aesthetical poetical religious does the dish please you madame  i am ravished to hear ita bagatelle quite simplethe kernel of the affair had its birth at a lent supper of the great cardinals but let us await the souffletalso a virginal dish with a still more splendid origin this soufflet aux dattes was brought from egypt by no meaner personages than saint louis and marguerite of provence a spectator above all a convive could easily discover that the withered brighteyed old nobleman had lived at a time when dainty eating and famine were two of the institutions of france and when supper was one of the things to live for he was not malicious or tyrannical rather like most unrivalled men of science he was goodnatured and affable that he was likewise perfectly careless of all outside his own range was an unlucky not a remarkable abuse of his powers monsieur de lussac would really have preferred the whole universe to profit by his cftelettes and crmes since that was impossible he believed sincerely that men might as pivy i well perish of inanition as swallow garlic soup with a taste of artichokes the plot of the novel is well sustained to the end it never flags but like the larde snowball which boys delight in rolling on tilll it becomes an absorbing interest to all it leaves 11 pon the readers mind a sensation of regret that the last page has been reached when he comes to the end of the third volume ii citoyenne jacqueline is not a puling love tale its power lies in the simple pathos of the incidents and in the struggles of jacqueline to regain her lost position in the opening chapters jacqueline a descendant of the ancienne uoblesse makes a mesalliawce by becoming the wife of michel sarte her fathers registrar or bailiff thii3 illassorted match not only precipitates her from her rank in society but brings with it much bitterness and heart suffering a mere child at the time she neither loves nor cares to understand her husband but marries him in a fit of despair or pique having been jilted by her cousin achille for a fascinating and wealthy widow michel sartes character bears a vague resemblance to that of john halifax he is brave noble hearted and generous and though a peasant by birth truly one of natures gentlemen the descriptions of life during the reign of terror evidently drawn from lamartines girondists and of the sad partings of the condemned at the foot of the guillotine are told with deep feeling and pathos few novels have afforded us so much pleasure in the perusal nor can we lay th e book aside without calling attention to the happy delineation of the subordinate characters of the tale in which miss tytler shows how carefully she has studied the rich raciness of french life in its most piquant phases

do with himself went out into tiie desert and towards night he re turned home but the gates of the city were shut and he went down into thc valley of jehosaphat and entered the tomb of absalom  and slept and be dreamed a dream  and next morning he came into the city smiling and  the maiden met him and she said k is that  thou art thou a laugher and lie answered k behold yesterday being disconsolate i went out of the city into thc desert and i  returned home and the gates of the city were shut and i went down into the valley of jej bosaphat and i entered the lomb of absalom and i

B5218,"['4695032', '6144746']",  air miidshiipman easy by the author of peter s1mpli 3 vols post 8vo saunders  otley captain mairiyat is a deserved favourite of the public the many works which he has presented for the perusal of the novelreading woril have all been decided hits and have wvon for him the reputation of being our best seanovelist the good qualities of his books up to the appearance of the present volumes have been progressiveand consequently from the author of peter simple very much was expected  nor indeed whatever blemishes the candid reviewer must point out has the hope been dlisappointed the tale is neither so full of incident nor are the characters drawn with that forcenor indeed is the whole so well finished as peter simple  but waith the exception of our favourite we have great pleasure in stating our conscientious opinion that mr midshipman elasy is the best of the authors novels captain marvatt is not like mano of his tribe of litterateurs who write merely to amuse without a moral object each of his books has a distinct end in vice  and in each he has considered a novel as a channel through which wholesome advice may be conveyed in a palatable form and there is reason to believe that his writings have not only amused the public but have also lone no small good to the navy whether or not  out and out radical notions are gaining ground in the service we pretend not to know if the alolbinlations of radicalism are tainting the middies all well and good  the e quality mania must be written down but if not why the gallant author has raised up a mans ot straw in order to knock him down but to tell the truth we suspect him of aiming his shafts at civil as well as naval politics oh fie captain marryatthis is too bad  but to the story the hero jack leasv is the son of a wealthy country gentleman imbued with the revolutionary notions of equality which prevailed in england at the close of the last century which of course he is made bv the author to express in so absurd and unlimited a manner as to make the reader laugh at mr easys expense jack as tiresome and obstinate a little brat as ever sucked of a wet nurse imbibes from his father at a very early period all his peculiar notions of equality and it requires all the hard discipline detailed in these three volumes to knock them out of his noddle his first acquaintance with schooldiscipline would it is reasonably supposed have opened the youngsters eves but no not even his acquaintance with the watchdog the bull and the beehive while robbing an orchard to the fruit of which in arguing the point he claims an equal right with the owner nor his ducking in the fishpond when caught poaching on a neighbours property are sufficient to convince master jack of the untenableness of his position the theory of equality not being satisfactorily proved on land as far as his experience goes he determines to try its truth at sea and he accordingly asserts to his father his right on the principle of equality of determining his own profession the  point is argued and jack prevails by influence with a captain fortunately for jack under pecuniary obligations to mr eiasy he is appointed midshipman on board the harpy and in due time he makes his way to portsmouth after enjoying his notions of equality by spending his money like a lord for three weeks and after insulting the first lieutenant of his own ship one of the best scenes in the book he goes on board and while in the service meets with a variety of adventures particularly in the mediterranean on board in engagements and on shore all of which tend to prove the invalidity of his favourite point jack on the whole is a lucky fellow with his vltra notions to escape mastheading or the bilbos he gets married in the end to donna agnes a spanish lady whom he had once released from a prize ship and afterwards fallen in love with at palermo mr easy senior becomes starkmad with the equality mania and dies jack succeeds to eight thousand a vear leaves the navy and becomes a country gentleman and a conservative there are some admirably humorous scenes in these volumes which might be extracted if our space allowed and we did not wish to forestall the readers lleasure jacks learning his alphabet withhis nother and afterwards with the schoolmaster the first interview between him and the lieutenant biggs ad venture at gibraltar illustrative of  duty before decency and the duel scene at malta are perhaps the best but there are many others at which we have laughed incontinently the best drawn characters are mesty quite a bijou in his way although a black diamond easthupp the pursers steward ci devant pickpocket talbovs the mathematical gunner and gascoigne the firm friend and ally of easy the foreigners are we think rather a failure after pointing out so much that is excellent in mr midshipman easy we mnay safely take up the pen to make some strictures on the book we do not go the length of saying with one of our great men that he who would make a pun would pick a pocket but we detest puns except after dinner when a few glasses of wine have made us very amiable and easy to please written puns are absolutely intolerable need it be said that such wretched traps for horselaughers are quite unworthy of the acknowledged talents of captain marryat i but a much graver charge is that of representing the roman religion and its priesthood in an odious light such bigotry is now quite pase and can only serve to disgust the intelligent reader and injure the captains credit the most rabid orangemen could not paint more revolting scenes than are here given of the foul conduct of the romish priesthood the author may have his own opinions on these matters and we will not argue the point but we question the good taste of dragging them before the public in a work of fiction those of our readers who enjoy hearty merriment must read these volumes  mr midshipman easy literature notices of new works by the author of  peter simple  ja cob faithful c 3 vols this is a beautiful personification of a principle a working out of character that is fiction only in the events in which it is shown as in a multiplicity of mirrors hut perfectly true and real in its moral identity had mr midshipman easy existed he must per force have acted precisely as captain marryat has made him act and that he has actually been met with a thousand times in the naval service all who know that noble service will testify though the midshipmen kanya who have appeared on his majestys books have not been placed exactly in the same situation as this mr midshipman easy par excellence occupies in captain marryats we have given in a long extract in our preceding number a specimen of what this exciting novel is it was the opening of the tale and with the sliest humour and in the blandest style covereel the most hiting satire of this almost every sentence was pregnant with covert wit of which not one two but three or four perusals were necessary to understand the full force the paternal mr kasy having allowed his goodnature to run to seed which seed proves to be the dry fruit of democratical mania carried out even to the agrarian law anel a community of goods becomes as such a person infallibly must a madman abroad and a tyrant at home though he finds his beloved theory of equality plants thorns on his pillow the expression is pretty though a little used and something sharper than thorns elsewhere and everywhere else he still follows it out as all other democrats do until it interferes with his own convenience and at length notwithstanding the junior easys assertions to the contrary the old gentleman finds it just and expedient to send his son to school this part of the story which is not at all maritime but strictly natural and highly amusing will be found philosophical also now the embryo mr midshipman easy inherits from his worthy father a most unconquerable predilection in all cases to argue the case whatever may be the tense in which he finds the circumstances or the mood in which he finds his opponent this leads the young philosopher into the most ludicrous situations out of which he always extricates himself with glory owing to the sound principle upon which he always acts of taking things easily should he be on the horns of a bull or of a dilemma no fear for master easy he will contrive to lip himself off softly from the one without a broken bone and to extricate himself honourably from the other by making an easy cushion between them from which to combat his adversary but as neither father nor son can make many proselytes to their doctrine of equality when united like the roman conquerors of old they resolve to divide the world between them old easy undertaking to regenerate all that live on thc earth vonni kasy all those who reside on the waters with a shamefully ample allowance the latter goes to sea as a midshipman then conic thc laughable collisions between absolute authority and unqualified licence thc reader may suppose that at first in endeavouring to take all things easy he of that name finds it goes hard with him no such tliintr he is imperturbable command him he argues the case and produces his minorreprove him he argues the case still and produces his majorwell he is still unconquered  then to wind up the debate his superior officer proceeds to punish himbut he is not beaten  he begins logically to draw his conclusions from his premises and ultimately proves himself to be in the right by taking his punishment easily but the witty author contrives that a subject so apparently intractable shall with all his whimsies do himself great honour and his country some service by mr easys maimer of thinking and acting he manages to rectify errors of much better and more experienced officers and to perform achievements that would well entitle him to the epithet of more than the hero of an excellently written novel but his many droll and highly interesting adventures gradually work out an alteration in his levelling principles by teaching him that in this ever shifting world everything will ultimately find its own level worth and activity rising vice profligacy and stupidity sinking to the depths of their natural degradation lu fact mr easy though always liberal becomes very gentlemanly and a good tory leaves all notions of equality to the indulgence of those who have got nothing and determines hereafter to preserve his station in society and his very excellent estate of eight thousand pounds a year with it lucky was it for our midshipman that it was entailed  for mr easy senior not having been to sea to gain wisdom goes on from bad to worse from the whimsical to the extravagant and from the extravagant to thc insane all this part of the tale is a melancholy but a true picture of our fallible natures the love affair of our hero is merely an amplification of madame de staels aphorism that the tender passion is but an episode in the lite of man but captain marryat has contrived to make his midshipmans episode a very exquisite one the naval scenes as usual with this author are glorious the storm the fight the imminent danger are all portrayed in these volumes with the hand of a master the delineation of the various characters that act with mr easy are also first rate what a troop of creations has this writer called forth we will not use the cant of criticism and say as that cant too frequently does this is the last and best of his works it is not better than  peter simple nor better written than  jacob faithful or a more true picture of life as life really is than  japhet in search of a father each of these works has an excellence peculiar to itself which excellence could not by any possibility belong to the other midshipman easy is inferior to none of captain marryats preceding works  we think that the world will prefer it to any of them  but this preference ought not and will not throw his other productions into shade we shall conclude our remarks by saying that our author has given a perfect literature to the marine of our country not merely originated one to be improved by othersand the world acknowledges that the fairest and the brightest fields of fiction are now to be found on the measureless waste of thc seas over which we hope that england may be for ever triumphant,war

of the sign given by tiresias  d6ipioiybv cttr aiu jguo7w vt is shirked in the paraphrase  a rustic implement however the translation is throughout so very free that it would be unfair to attempt to criticise too closely points missed or perverted  the iliad of hosier book xviii by a platt blackie ls6d it was said by a famous commentator that to understand dante needed great wit rather than great learning and in reviewing new editions of fragments of a classic one naturally looks for freshness in treatment and in the illustrations rather than in interpretation of the text the new element in this book is that the grammar of the dialect is learned bit by bit fifty lines of text at a time by this device the boy passes straight from the attic forms of his grammar to the homeric dialect mr platt remembers that the object of reading the iliad is to enjoy the story and if a boy is forbidden to read it until after he has mastered the homeric dialect well if he comes to hate homer whose is the fault  the book is defective in one particular the illustrations are without a commentary  the iliad of homer rendered into english prose for the use of those who cannot read the original by samuel butler long mans  co all who have thought about the subject must have recognised that there can be no such thing as a final translation of a classic homer has been done out of honesty into all sorts of admired affectation by different ages the present version is for a special audience and goes as might be expected a good deal nearer current english than that of messrs lang leaf and myers whose admirable work scholars have generally concurred with mr butler in admiring but that translation effective as it is is in a restricted dialect which often loses life where it gains gravity mr butler points out that the elizabethans did not lard a crib with chaucerisms and think that they were translating they aimed fearlessly and without taint of affectation at making a dead author living to a generation other than his own to do this they transfused their blood into his cold veins and quickened him with their own livingness the present version is full of life and surmounts the difficult task of being familiar but by no means vulgar on the whole with great success the translator boldly prefers you to thou as dr rendall did before him in his recent  marcus aurelius he uses the latinized names of gods and heroes and often omits  stock epithets in this he is well advised as a rule though not perhaps always in a case like the appeal of chryses to the acheoans to accept the ransom  in awe of the son of jove fardarting apollo surely the epithet chosen for apollo has more than one is a significant hint of consequences likely to follow which was worth preserving the more sanguinary parts of the iliad cannot mr butler says be made interesting indeed i doubt whether they can ever have been so or ever been intended to be so to a highly cultivated audience culture may agree to that but probably they have as good a chance with the average english reader as they are ever likely to have nowadays when novelistic blood is lavishly spilt and some experience of what is popular seems to show that it is a case of supply and demand it is possible that homer wrote such passages  with impatience  possible also we may conjecture that they had their practical value as a sort of primitive textbook of wounds mr butler need not despair of his fights his gain in vigour and naturalness over more elaborate and artificial translators is marked here and in scenes of action generally perhaps in the speeches sometimes sentences are too short and snappy goddesses a little too like angry housemaids but victorianisms which are also elizabethanisms such as vixen and hurlyburly are used with good effect the danger of course of a version like this is the use of words which are hopelessly degraded we have seen for instance virgil turned into language which a sporting tipster affects and the result was fatal even tennyson hardly succeeded in making  a blooming boy  anything but comic mr butler has no such lapses he knows his bible and his socalled good english as well as his victorianisms indeed working with the earlier version at his elbow he has been more like wardour street and less familiar than we expected is it wise or fair to homer especially with an audience of modern readers in view  to make achilles call a woman a fruitling of my spear sovpiktyjriljv ix 343 why need mr butler elaborate an unnecessary metaphor and unusual diminutive here as a rule ho is much simpler and translates for instance a familiar line  with all sincerity and goodwill he addressed them thus where lang leaf and myers with whom lie challenges comparison render  he of good intent made harangue and spake amid them english readers may well vote for the increased naturalness and simplicity of the later hand we notice that the dubious cnfiara vypd vi 169 are rendered here lying letters of introduction mr butler has evidently not yielded to the persuasions of the pictured script of the ojibbeways aud other evidence of the sort we should prefer a more indefinite version but will imitate the translators wise reticence in not piling up notes on this and other points homer the very word has elicited reams has been buried under enough notes already  non ilium nostri possunt mutare labores poets and prosemen pedants and paraphrasers all must feel that they are translators and traitors but with so many affected stylists abroad one can only be grateful for a virile and direct prose like that of these pageswhich remind one of hobbesand for a lively courage which the scholar after all his pedantry about right meanings and shades of expression can endorse with a line from a great master of language and criticism  tantum de medio sumptis accedit honoris  the iliad of homer classical translations translated by j g cordery rivingtonsj  strange things are many 6ays the tragedian  but nothing more strange than man aud no man seems to us more strange than he who publishes his translations of the classics a translation must of its very nature be addressed to a limited number of readers at least we hardly imagine that translators really think to awaken an interest iu the original authors among the unlettered multitude or that one who cannot read homer in the original will seek to make his acquaintance through a translation they cannot be profitable from a pecuniary point of view they are not a likely road to fame all this of course applies to metrical translations of poetry in prose the matter is so much more important than the form that a translation which renders the first accurately is often a perfect substitute to those at all events who do not care to study the language for philological purposes but with regard to poetry the case is altogether different the poets thoughts are so indissolubly incorporated with his words that at the best all the translator be he ever so good a poet can achieve is to write a poem on the same subject with the disadvantage of being fettered in his expression of it by having to follow another mans method of treatment in the present instance we may at once say that mr cordery though a painstaking and generally accurate translator is not a great poet consequently if we wished to give an idea of homer to one unlearned in the greek tongue and were driven to choose between bohn and mr cordery we should unhesitatingly prefer bohn nor do we in saying this imply that we put mr cordery much below other translators of homer in the passage which since mr tennysons rendering of it has been accepted as the regular test of homeric translation we think mr cordery compares not unfavourably with others let our readers judge  we need not say that we refer to the closing lines of book viii so lifted high with hope the whole night through they camped outside upon the foughteii field  and many a blazing campfire flamed upon it as when in heaven about the fair clear moon the btars rise bright deep in a windless air and every peak and promontory and grove stands forth while to their highest the heavens break up a boundless empyrean  ever star shows and the shepherd sees with gladsome heart such and so thick in front of i lions towers midway betwixt thc fleet and xanthus streams the watehflres kindled by the host of troy a thousand blazed upon thc plain  by each within the ruddy glow sat fifty men  while by their chariots stood their steeds and champed corn and white barley patient for the dawn whether mr cordery has got the right meaning of the obscure 7roiioio yttyvpai we are not concerned to say at all events he has got something and herein deserves credit for at least facing the difficulty which the laureate has shirked he tells us that his translation was written two years before the publication of enoch arden but owns his indebtedness to mr tennyson for one expression he is good we think though quite nonhomeric in the description of the wrestling in book xxiii we quote a few lines  off them streamed their sweat and in the stern strain of strong heads creaked their broad backs whilst purple with their blood swollen on their ribs and shoulders rose the veins the alliteration we venture to think is well managed though there is not a hint of it in the original on the whole where his theme inspires him as in the more pathetic and spirited passages the translator has done his work as well as the restrictions to which we have alluded will allow but where homer nods mr cordery goes very much to sleep and what is naivete not unpleasant in the greek becomes utter baldness in the english one or two small errors we may note such as the false quantity often repeated in oileus the scansion of  epeus in syllables the spelling eilytheia and the use of foregather in the sense of gather together adrastus for admetus on p 315 of vol il is we suppose a printers error,war
B3189,['3169911'],  the reds of the midi here is a historical novel such as we get only once in a very long time and in a translation so good as to balmost as much a rarity the author is a very distinguished provenalmy information i may as well confess is derived entirely from the prefacewho is at this moment capouliw that is official head of the fulibrige the society of provensal men of letters being second in succession to mistral he has written epics and lyrics and stories in prose and conspicuous among these wst is this tale of the march of the marseilles battalion to paris it is a very remarkable work it is literaturewhich not one such story in a thousand contrives to be but just because historical romance is fashionable now i should recommend it with a warning to those who read mr stanley weyman and his entertaining brothers and imitators in england it is not a budoir version of a rough chapter out of a rough and terrible time it is very real and very ungenteel the marseilles men did not fight in kid gloves nor save when they were shouting their songs or their stereotyped cries did they utter fine sentiments no one at all in this story is told gff to speak words of horror or deprecation or to adjust the balance so as to be quite fair all round it is made up of the recollections of a rude untaught peasant boy that marched with the battalion who had no theories but sang the marsellaise with greater faith than he had ever sung a litany no philosophy of any kind blurred what he actually saw his story is a peasants story and told to peasants there is a good deal to find fault with the incidents relating to the marquis dambrun and his family and surto and l jacarasse seem like a hallucination and that the wretches should stifler death by the very guillotine on which the child they had plotted to kill had innocently written her name is a straining after an artificial effect which is below the level of the rest but indeed the story does not much concern a reader though the characters do little pascalet margan and samat with his banner of the rights of man and his goodhumoured intolerance of anybody who would not applaud and look cheerful at

once it is men of the midi you have to do with all that long weary trudge to paris with momentary intervals of depression their tongues and their throats are making a deafening din with the carmagnole or their own hymn the exuberance of their spirits produces every appearance of disorder they are chattering excitable children the vitality of a northerner would have given out long before in mere waste emotion but these had enough and to spare there was method in their madness they reached paris and tired of waiting for the word of attack from the finnicking timid townsfolk they gave the word themselves that lost louis xvi his crown pascalet is a type of them lie is in despair about his extreme youth and will convince the whole world by his tremendous exertions that he is as good a man as any he smears his maiden chin with blackberries insists on being harnessed to the cannon that he may enter vienne with honour and dragging with might and main is delighted when a girl cries out  just look at that young fellow goodness how he frightens me  he thunders out big oaths with ostentation and never a single grumble in the fighting in paris he is both frightened and plucky he dances with joy when he finds a joint of his finger shot away and plays the fool and the man and the child all at once wvhat military excitement means to an eager boy bred in obscurity will probably never be better described but as i have maid the paris scenes are not for squeamish reader who will be shocked to find no words of protest from the simple men who having walked hundreds and hundreds of hungry

historical romance could alone have brought to the task to say of the author of whitehall that he has not entirely succeeded in his ambitious aim is to say of him only that he is not the greatest writer of his age and we frankly admit that it would be unfair to try him by an extraordinary standard compared with his contemporaries he is not inferior to any of theis in some of the qualities requisite for this class of literature he is equal to most of them in the accomplishments necessary for the production of fiction of any kind is descriptive powers are great  he has read up well for the occasion he has keen perceptions of the nicer shades of character and his soul is in his work so that he writes with the flow of a full mind and carries the reader onward by force of a certain energy which is felt although incapable of definition but these excellences are mingled with manifest faults his composition is often careless and ungraceful his plot is wanting in artistic skill  he resorts too much to the tricks of the novelist relies for his effects upon the unnatural or supernatural mistakes the wonderful for the grand and the melodramatic for the dramatic lie is copious of contrivances for any difficulty but they are so farfetched mo thoroughly beyond the bounds of probability that they offend the readers sense of propriety and often produce a smile where a striking surprise was intended this tendency of the writer to exaggerationthis convulsive straining after effect wau apparent in his previous novel but it has grown with his growth and is still more obvious and more repulsive here another fault he has fallen into in common with many of his predecessors he has been overanxious to press into his pages all the great personages of the time and to bring this about he has resorted to contrivances so out r so wild so out of the natural order of things that the design is made palpable to the reader whose interest in the affair departs the moment he is compelled to feel that all these good people have been brought together to show off the writer and not to ad vance the story it is in the strictly historical portions of the romance that the author

B2596,['9458182'],  macaria by augusta j evans 3 vols saunders otley ft co this is a story of american life in the southern states and the author introduces some 4 stirring battlescenes and a spirited account of  maning the blockade a few years ago the american stories which obtained popularity in england were those which exposed the hardships incident to the institution of slavery  but now the negro is judiciously kept out of sight though from a passage here and there we find that the servants whose names are mentioned from time to time are undoubtedly of the african race the principal personages are of pure european descent and the author who writes in the interest of the south is too skilful to bring the dark spot too prominently forward if we are to form a judgement from what appears to be an honest and friendly picture of american society we must conclude that passions pride and prejudice an pretty much the same in transatlantic cities aa in the aristocratic capitals of old europe having no peerage to distinguish the grades of society the americans are obliged to have recourse to another test so that money becomes the touchstone of rank and the possession of wealth is equivalent to a patent of nobility no doubt this is the case to a limited extent even in europe for wealth can buy rank indirectly and the noble houses of today may have been the rniluoonaires of a former generation the advantage however of a permanent nobility is this that it is fixed and definite enough to establish certain canons of social conduct and influential enough to came these canons to be generally respected it costs a nevus homo no little trouble and selfdenial to master the delicate system so that the rough the ignorant and the selfwilled must undergo some tndning before they can get received into good society the nouveau rich may perhaps consider that there is some hardship in this but the world is not so black as it is painted and if a man be but observant goodtempered and above au modest he may pass the golden barrier sooner than he expects but he cannot get the degree of gentleman without examination  he cannot enter the charmed circle of society by merely paying a fee according to miss evans the higher sets in an american town would appear to be quite as exclusive as the crime de la crime of an english county  and perhaps their cloak of pride is even more conspicuous from being worn without the graceful ease which habit alone can give we are not speaking of course of the old landed families of whom no doubt there still exist a few who more closely resemble the english untitled aristocracy the wealthy storekeeper and the successful stockjobber are of the class to which we allude both perhaps began life as errandboys  and even now the desk or the counter is more familiar to them than the splendid equipage which rouses the envy of their fellowtownsmen they have now however a high position and they are determined to keep it np but they do not find that the neighbours whom they have outstripped in the race of life are quite so ready to recognise it they are in need of constant selfassertion and their dignity sits not om them easily as on those who are  born to greatness the shopboy is gorgeous in his sunday best but you see that he is a shopboy till while the gentleman may be distinguished at a glance though bis coat be none of the newest the story of  macaria is somewhat melancholy and it ia not very easy to transcribe so we shall only briefly indicate the principal points irene and electra are two beautiful girls in the town of w who according to the custom of their country attend a dayschool during their childhood there they become warm friends  bot there is no intercourse between their respective families for irenes father mr huntingdon is a millionnaire and moreover he had a deeplyrooted hatred for mr aubrey the deceased uncle of electra this onfortanate man has lost his life by an unjust sentence in consequence of an angry struggle which resulted in the death of his adversary at the opening of the story russell aubrey the son is a yoong man of seventeen struggling to maintain his mother and his young cousin electra he is energetic and conscientious but somewhat cynical in his temperament and he fails to perceive that electra loves him with more than a cousinly love in the mean time irene loves him no less deeply so that when he goes to europe as secretary to the minister at brussels he leaves two aching hearts behind him in his absence electra goes to live with an artist and his mother and devotes herself to painting with extraordinary success she little suspects that the artist who seems to instruct her from mere admiration of her talent is devotedly attached to her but dares not speak at last the secret comes out and electra though sorely tried refuses him steadily but nurses him with the utmost tenderness till he dies of a decline nor is irene without her admirers for some unknown cousins of electra turn up unexpectedly and one of them a young clergyman loses his heart on the spot moreover she is tormented by her own cousin hugh to whom her considerate father has promised her almost before she was born the two beautiful young women both intensely devoted to one man and yet preserving their own honest affection for one another form just such a picture as ladywriters love to dwell upon and the main interest of the book is made to turn on the unselfish devotion thus exhibited russell aubrey is a youth in whom we do not feel inclined to take much interest but he is one of those stern idols whom women in novels fall down and worship of course mr huntingdons enmity is a bar to russells marriage with irene and he does not reciprocate electras love the war comes on to cut all the knots which it accomplishes very effectually by killing mr huntingdon at manassa unfortunately russell is killed very boon after so that irene never gets married and she and her friend are left to make bandages and mix medicines in the military hospitals few occupations could be more desirable or praiseworthy just now but it is melancholy to think that these two brilliant beauties should be condemned to solitude for the rest of their lives the wealthy miss huntingdon resolves to found a school of design for women of which electra is to be the ladyprincipal thus they will both be useful in their generation  but it is evident that they are both to wear weeds for the godlike hero russell aubrey the book is well written as a whole  and its aim is not exclusively to describe the

B2114,['8525829'],  fr0m0nt jeune et risler atne fromont jeune et rider abie moeurs parisiennes par alphonse baudet paris  charpentier et cic 1875 m daudets last novel has obtained and may be fairly said to have deserved considerable success it is a book which amuses and interests while one reads it but in which one cannot but discover a variety of faults on after reflection for instance the author displays a certain poverty of invention in taking the disregard of the seventh commandment as the mainspring of his story  toujours ladultere a french critic cried in despair at seeing a new domestic drama  and indeed the subject has been worn very nearly threadbare we must not flinch from our duty say a certain class of romance and play writers there are malignant diseases which arc gnawing at the very heart of society  it devolves upon us however painful we may find it to lay bare the source of the evil this is all very fine and it makes an interesting picture to imagine alexandre dumas the son for instance convulsed with grief but battling manfully with it as he fulfils his terrible task of unveiling the horrors of vice which he discovers to his audiences or readers but it is natural to suspect that the writers who continually stand forth armed with the caustic which they will not shrink from applying to their countrys wounds feel some anxiety to keep themselves and their great object before the eyes of the public and thus they may grow to resemble quack doctors who having invented a marvellous cure find it desirable to keep up in appearance at least a supply of disease which may demand their skill it may also be supposed that to most writers it is easier to make a story out of the distorted state of things arising from illicit love than out of more tranquil conditions it is greatly to be regretted that a writer of m dumass power should not attempt to deal with some newer and pleasanter subject than that of illicit love one cannot help entertaining a hope that his new play lfitrangere the production of which has been delayed by m delaunays severe illness may have some fresh and less sordid motive than is found in his others besides the fact that m daudet has chosen a weuworn theme for the motive of his romance a fault which is certainly not peculiar to him there are other points where there is a want of originality in his story the device for example by which the woman who plays the most important part in it gets rid of a man who threatens to reveal her perfidy is so exactly like that employed by the comtesse de chalis in m feydeaus novel under the same circumstances that one cannot but think the one suggested the other sidonie chebe or sidonie risler as she has become when the story opens is a kind of becky sharpe that is she has becky sharpes love of luxury and finery and utter absence of principle but she has besides this a vulgarity and stupidity which make it difficult to believe in the powers of fascination which she exercises upon various people it is not upon her own cleverness but upon the dullness and brutality of others that ethe depends for success she begins her career with nearly succeeding in marrying georges fromont of the great manufacturing house of fromont for which chance she throws over frantz risler who in despair takes an engineering appointment abroad then her project of marrying fromont is destroyed by his carrying out a longarranged plan of his family and marrying his cousin after this risler aim frantss brother is promoted to a partnership in though bouse of fromont and then sidonie with tears and blushes confesses that it is the elder risler whom she has always loved and that she only accepted frantz risler because he was the next thing to his brother the worthy risler is overjoyed sit his good fortune and exclaims as he does on all occasions which mvp him delight je sins content the secucl is that sidonie gets georges fromont info her clutches and all but ruins the house by the extravagances wbich sbe induces him to commit  while risler is so persistently blind and deaf that even bis oldest friends suspect him of complicity in a vile contract by one of these friends frantz is recalled to set mattersstraight if possible and of him sidonie disposes by the trick already mentioned as seeming to be suggested by the comtesse de chalis the difference is that in m fcydeaus novel the incident is probable enough while in m daudets it is grossly unnatural had be succeeded in conveying to his readers the notion of any kind of attraction in sidonie it would be possible to accept the triumph of her manoeuvres as possible as it is one is lost in wonder at ber having found so many stupid people as victims for her impositions the strongest scene in the book is that in which his wifes faithlessness suddenly breaks upon risler and in this there is certainly some power but its incidents resemble so much those of the scene between lord steyne and rawdon crawley that the impression first given by sidonies character of m daudet having carefully studied  vanity fair is confirmed it is in little bits of observation and in the drawing of characters who only affect his plot incidentally that m daudet has made a real success sidonie is like a coarse copy of becky sharpe risler is aggravatingly humble and stupid  but sidonies mean lazy father and mdme dobson the languishing singingmistress who herself the most respectable of persons delights to live in an atmosphere of intrigue are living people the best character in the book however is undoubtedly

B7310,['9213546'],  st ives being the adventures of a frenth prisoner in england by robert louis stevenson heinemann tnis is a rattling touchandgo tale of adventure of a somewhat ordinary type yet relieved by some fine but slight studies in characterization that it will not add to stevensons reputation is clear from this description as well as from his own doubts about the book already published to the world in the  vailima letters whether it was altogether wise of his executors to publish it admits of some doubt yet after all it will not lower if it will not enhance his reputation and it is of course far above the average trade novels that pour forth in such increasing floods from the press perhaps the most remarkable and significant thing about the book is the skill with which mr quiller couch has supplied the last bu chapters which both in style and briskness of treatment bear an astonishing resemblance to the preceding thirty it was a dangerous and difficult task that mr quiller couch undertook and to some it might seem of disputable taste but he has come out of the ordeal triumphantly and for once a patch has proved to be not altogether a botch take for example the following passage in which the hero is forced for a purpose to simulate drunkenness  doubtless by my uncovered head and gala dress he judged me an allnight revellera strayed bacchanal fooling in the morrows eye prompt upon the inference came inspiration i must win to the centre of the crowd and a crowd is invariably indulgent to a drunkard i hung out the glaring signboard of crapulous glee lurching hiccoughing jostling apologising to all and sundry with spacious incoherence i plunged my way through the sightseers and they gave me passage with all the good humour in life this has the true stevensonian accent the unexpected adjectives the double accusatives the metaphoric signboard all are just in stevensons style as for the matter of the supernumerary chapters they appear to have been supplied from the memory of mrs strong stevensons amanuensis and their episodical character is merely on a par with the rest of the work the tale as its subtitle indicates tells the story of the adventures of a french prisoner in england and scotland just before napoleons first downfall but the viscount anne de st yves de keroual the french prisoner in question is of somewhat curious upbringing he had had an english nurse and ample opportunities of learning english which he talked with scarcely perceptible accent but the training in english seems to have gone somewhat deeper that the mere language for it is only occasionally throughout the book that he remembers that he is a frenchman and a french soldier to boot and altogether he is by no means convincing in his title rdle he is a dandy and is curious in waistcoats yet there is something raffish about his bearing a quality which he shares with his cousin the elder viscount de st yves who is the rather pinchbeck villain of the story altogether it is difficult to believe that a hero such as this could have won the heart of a highspirited scotch girl after two or three interviews the fact is this book bears the mark of a fggel aiinl on almost every page of it it is largely reminiscent of other works of the same writer the interview which the heroines brother has with the hero resembles closely a scene in  beau austin the escape from edinburgh castle has its counterpart in a similar escape in  the black arrow the villain viscount is a faint copy of the master of ballantrae the counting up of the treasure recalls the last pages of treasure island the fight with the drovers is a similar incident to the attack by clunys men in kidnapped rowleys flageolet takes the place of the penny whistle of the carrier in  the wrong box while the friendly relations of the hero with that burly villain burchell fenn had previous existence in the pages of  the wrecker and so throughout the majority of incidents recall similar passages in stevensons earlier books and prove that while be was occupied in writing st ives his mind had lost its power of fresh combination that the loss was only temporary that vigorous fragment  weir of hermiston is more than sufficient proof little fresh as are the incidents they are even less well considered and connected the story is practically of an escaped military prisoner who travels from edinburgh to his uncles place in the south and then returns to the northern capital the motive for the return is supposed to be an invincible desire to see the loved one but the coxcomb tone in which the fair one is wooed does not make this return at risk of death any the more probable stevenson may possibly have felt this as he props up the motive with a somewhat trumpery charge of assault in which others might be implicated for the heros sake but even this is only brought in as an afterthought for it could not have been made the principal motive or else the attractive power of love would have been so much diminished when st ives gets to edinburgh again where he is wanted for an alleged murder really the result of a duel he naturally falls into great dangers from which he ultimately escapes by the most mechanical of methods a casual balloon that wafts him away to the bristol channel altogether the book regarded from the point of view of plot is a panorama of improbabilities nor on the character side is there much to attract we have already referred to though unconvincing nature of the heros position as an angloscotch frenchman the heroine is somewhat of a lay figure more care has been taken with the villain but he is after all merely a lath that is not even painted to look like iron and in the relations of the hero either to heroine or villain there is nothing inevitable nothing that could not be otherwise yet unsatisfactory as the book is both in construction and characterization it has an interest of its own to the student of stevensons art previous to this book his studies in characterization were somewhat forced and he had clearly to content himself with but a few figures on the stage he characterised with deeficulty but here at last he began to show himself a compeer of the masters in that quality in which they specially proved their mastery what distinguishes fielding scott dickens thackeray and even charles read to a certain extent is the ease and fecundity with which they create minor characters it is possible they crowd their canvases too much but the total result is to produce that effect of bustling life which it is the peculiar function of the novelist to reproduce here in  st ives stevenson for the first time came to his own in this respect it is crowded with subordinate figures the majority of them alive and some of them uproariously kicking there is major chevenix the heros rival a dry stick but a gentlemanly the heroines aunt miss gilchrist is crabbed and caustic but goodnatured at bottom rowley the boy valet is scarcely the success that the pains devoted to him would warrant but he is certainly alive one of the minor characters a french colonel who had broken parole in order to reach the deathbed of his only daughter sounds a note of almost tragic intensity but whether it be a postboy demanding blackmail or a runaway bride who is sorry she has run away or an attorneys clerk who has touches of patriotism or an edinburgh buck who is professor of nonsense in an imaginary universitywhether they are portrayed in fewor in many linesalmost every character introduced has the tang of individuality stevenson must have felt some of this increased capacity himself for he has been so greatly daring as to introduce as one of his minor characters no less a person than walter scott himself the passage in which he appears is short and slight but may be here quoted as an instance of perhaps the most characteristic thing about  st ives the evidence it gives of the capacity of indicating character by a few traits   our encounter was of a tall stoutish elderly gentleman a little grizzled and of a rugged but cheerful and engaging countenance he sat on a hill pony wrapped in a plaid over his green coat and was accompanied by a horsewoman his daughter a young lady of the most charming appearance they overtook us on a stretch of heath reined up as they came alongside and accompanied us for perhaps a quarter of an hour before they galloped off again across the hillsides to our left great was my amazement to find the unconquerable mr sim thaw immediately on the accost of this strange gentleman who hailed him with a ready familiarity proceeded at once to discuss with him the trade of droving and the prices of cattle and did not disdain to take a pinch from the inevitable rams horn presently i was aware that the strangers eye was directed on myself  and there ensued a conversation some of which i could not help overhearing at the time and the rest i have pieced together more or less plausibly from the report of sim   surely that must be an amateur drover ye have gotten there the gentleman seems to have asked sim replied 1 was a young gentleman that had a reason of his own to travel privately well well ye must tell me nothing of that i am in the law you know and tace is the latin fora candle answered the gentleman  but i hope its nothing bad sim told him it was no more than debt   oh lord if that be all  cried the gentleman  and turning to myself  well sir he added i understand you are taking a tramp through our forest here for the pleasure of the thing i  why yes sir said i  and i must say i am very well entertained   i envy you said he i have jogged many miles of it myself when i was younger my youth lies buried about here under every heatherbush like the soul of the licentiate lucius but you should have a guide the pleasure of this country is much in the legends which grow as plentiful as blackberries and directing my attention to a little fragment of a broken wall no greater than a tombstone he told me for an example a story of its earlier inhabitants presently after giving us a cigar apiece scott bade us farewell and disappeared with his daughter over the hills and when i applied to sim for information his answer of  the shirra man  abode kens the shirra  told me unfortunately nothing the incident is slight enough in all conscience but every touch tells and the whole impression is one of life it is perhaps worth while mentioning that the word cigar is here spelled otherwise than in the rest of the book where it has the old spelling segar there are also some anachronisms of fact and tone and what is probably a misprint on p 92  usuriousness for uxoriousness these discrepancies would doubtless have been removed if stevenson had lived to revise the proofs but no amount of revision could have made up for the want of cohesion in the plot the inefficient colouring of the chief characters it is needless to say that in speaking in these somewhat slighting terms of  st ives wear judging it by a high standard whether destined to be classic or no there is no doubt that stevensons work stands out markedly from the ruck of machinemade fiction and this very book with all its faults shows that he was slowly maturing to a mastery of his art which might have raised him to an equality with the greatest of the past,war

worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis

in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes

j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of

B2164,"['8500512', '4382121', '8773746']",  mos ravendrs conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest harper and brothers new york we believe our readers will thank us for introducing to their notice something a little novel in novels we have now before us a transatlantic tale a sketch of men and manners in america not caricatured by an englishman but a picture of life during the war etched by one of them selves the great contest brought out in strong relief the broad contrasts of character which naturally exist among the people of the great republic sprung from so many sources and actuated by such various feelings and interests the author has availed himself of the abundance of material which he found at hand to keep alive the interest of his book by placing before us a vast variety of characters all skilfully hit off each with a very distinctive individuality no two of his actors being at all alike and even the supernumeraries having their appropriate characteristics it is long since we have met with a book which has presented to us so many amusing people the author has the art of lavishing goodness upon his favourites without making them insipid while he justly gibbets the mean and the vicious and shows the weakness of vice the great events of the war contribute their quota of amusement and furnish abundance of incidents telling situations startling sensations without the necessity in any instance of having recourse to a strained effect or improbable adventure no doubt we look at all the circumstances from a loyal point of view but if a federal officer lends us his glass we must be content to see the objects in the field as he points them out  secession however has a fair champion in the lovely heroine whose  conversion  gives a name so the story this conversion is effected in the early chapters of the tale in what would be the first volume of a novel got up a lartglaise let us here note a slight preference for the one handsome volume in which this work is given to the world it dates indeed from her return to secessia the coolness with which she found herself received by her former friends in new orleans the social ostracism to which she was in fact subjected on account of her journey to the north first made her waver in her allegiance and the cowardly way in which her father was attacked on account of his proclaimed loyal sentiments quite shook her faith in her country and effected the miracle which all the arguments of her parent and her northern friends had been powerless to achieve we call upon the father and

papa when i am as old as you are and you are as young as i am ill satirise you dreadfullywell if we are going io live in new boston why cant we keep house  this extract gives a good idea of the pleasant natural style in which the book is written the doctor is a most delightful character so frank and hopeful so generous and highminded devoted to his daughter ever watchful for her welfare yet with an expansiveness which makes him seem the benefactor of mankind his conduct is throughout consistent the strength and weakness of his sanguine temperament are admirably worked out he cannot accept the colonelay of a black regiment because he has no idea of militazy matters i mst confess sid the doctor resuming his seat that this is a most attractive and flattering proposition i am vain enough to believe that i could be of use to this poor ignorantbrutish downtrodden insulted plundered race of pariahs and helots if i could orgaise negro labour in louisiana on a basis jut and profitable to all partieishould consider myself more honoured than by being made president of the united ates in ordinary times if i could be the means of educating their darkened minds and consciences to a decent degree of christian intelligence and virtue i would not exchane my good name for that of a paul or an apollos my only objection to this present plan is the colonelcy i should be in a false position i should feel myself to be ridiculous not that it is ridiculous to be a colonel he explained smiling but to wear the uniform and receive the pay of a colonel without being one ere is the satire now could not that point be evaded could i not be mad superintendent of negro labour without being burdeed with the miluay digmity i really feel some conscientiou scruples on the matter quite aside from my desire not to appear absurd i should be willing to do the work for less pay provided i could escape the livery but he is glad to obtain an appointment in the hospital with the pay of a captain and delighted when he finds the opportunity of making the experiment which terminates so fortunately of organising free black labour it must be understood that he is not a successful man but he is always happy and contented he cannot withhold his consent from his daughters union with the man whom she adores but he distrusts his physical strength breaks down when he discovers his utter worthlessness yet he rouses himself to support and watch over his child how tender is his care for her how devoted his attachment i how pleasant and how playful his manner yet always so full of sympathy and wathful love  he and colbourn the volunteer captain are both made superior to ordinary mortals they can be hardhearted to themselves but they are always tenderhearted to their neighbours the cut the burden of their own troubles and griefs behind their backs that they may sympathies with those of their friends the virtues of the parent ae reflected in his child lmeli is the worthy daughter of such a father the gaiety of her temper is the charucteristic which chiefly charms the reder the personal beauty which exercises so potent a spell over all with whom she has to do cannot really afford any particular pleasure to one who only reads of it beauty must be seen to be appreciated there is but small satisfaction in hearing of a beauty one is never likely to se

a ldier life seem to us photo r al the details are brought out so vividly the enn and tediousn of life in camp the restraint of discipline and the frequent negligenes of volunteers the reckless rush of some to the charge whilst others are skulking behind the terrors of the battle the uncertainty of the result the terrors of the retreat and then the experiences of hospital the weariness of convalescence the chapter of hardships and privations the weary marches the fsae alarms and the constant watching which try the patience of an army in the field a regular army could hardly have afforded such portraits as were to be found in this volunteer force it required the peculiar circumstances of the time and case to make gazaway a major and to promote him to be lieutenantcolonel you know the secret history of his rehabilitation said he well there is one consolation in the miserable affair he fooled our sly governor you know it was agreed that after gazaway had been whitewashed with a lieutenantcolonelcy he should show his gratitude by carrying his district for our party and then resign to make way for the governors nephew major rathbun but it seems gasaway had his own ideas he knew a trick or two besides saying his bacon on the battlefield his plan was that he should be the candidate for congress from the district hen he found that he couldnt make that work he did the next best thing and held on to his commission wasnt it capital  it pays me for being overlooked daring three years in spite of the recommendations of my colonel and my generals there he is still lieutenantcolonel with the goverors nephew under him to do his fighting and field duty i dont know how gasaway got command of the conscript camp where he has been for the last year i suppose he lobbied for it but i know that he has tutned it to good account one of my sergeants was on detached duty at the camp and was taken behind the scenes he told me that he made two hundred dollars in less than a month and that gazaway must have pocketed ten times as much his poltroonery is as ludicrous as it is disgusting the doctors small attempt at soldiering is sufficiently absurd but the conduct of colbourn in that episode is admirable and the defence of fort winthrop was justly considered one of the most gallant feats of the war what shall we say of colonel carter i that he is a warning a man of great power exercising a strong influence over others mighty in command yet unable to control himself a prey to the meanest temptations unable to refrain from drink incapable of resisting the wiles of an artful woman no wonder he should find himself constantly at his wits ends and be driven to add to his other sins the ungentlemanly one of swindling we have not attempted to give an outline of the tale there is so much matter in it that a very imperfect summary would have exceeded our limits besides we think we shall be more likely to excite the interest of our readers and induce them to turn to the book itself by this slight sketch of some of the leading characters than by a bare epitome of the history i  miss ravenels conversion there is a pleasant franknesssometimes developing into pure  cheek in this book which lends to it a certain piquancy and freshness as a work of art it has few claims but the story is not uninteresting and many of the sketches of the american war are very vivid and striking it is withal very  yankee the  tall talk  is amusing on account of its very audacity there is a sort of unconscious heroism in a writer who makes his ideal womanthe heroine of his booksay that a certain thing is  right nice and tell her father whenever he displeases her that he is  addled for instances of yankeeisms the reader has not far to seek a man thus describes the bombardment of fort jackson i was in the rebel service sir an unwilling victim dragged as an innocent sheep to the slaughter and took a part much against my inclinations in the defence of fort jackson it seemed to me sir that the day of judgement had come and the angel was blowing particular hell out of his trumpet miss ravenel is the daughter of a new orleans gentleman who finding himself in some danger through his pronorthern sentiments seeks refuge at the breaking out of the war in one of the northern states unlike himself his daughter is a violent secessionist her prejudice being so far like a mania as to transform the gentlest of creatures into a termagant the author has of course a great liking for his heroine but loyalty to his country forbids his glossing over the unladylike speeches and acts of which she was guilty while yet unconverted on one occasion we are told of the effect which the news of the bull run defeat had upon her  miss ravenel the desperate rebel jumped to her feet with a nervous shriek of joy and then catching her fathers reproving eye rushed upstairs and danced it out in her own room this is certainly strange enough conduct but mr de forest renders it more inexplicable by not telling us what the  it was which she danced out was it her fathers eye which she had just caught  at another time a letter is being read to her in which the writer exclaims  how glorious will be that time now near at hand when our reunited country will be free of the shame and curse of slavery    miss ravenel spit in her angry pussycat fashion when her father read to her this passage of the letter but this was in her unconverted days the story proceeds to show how two men fall in love with her and how she married the least worthy of thema colonel in the federal army who is of a reckless dramdrinking impulsive and goodnatured disposition the other lover is a captain in this colonels regimenta model of modesty endurance and selfdenial dr ravenel and his daughter venture back to new orleans and the colonel and captain are with the body of men who made history in louisiana the operations of the federal forces in the southern state are most admirably described and the first attack on port hudson is detailed with such minuteness and graphic power as to render the reader almost certain of mr de forest having himself seen the progress and result of that unfortunate effort the colonel gets killed in an engagement shortly after his wife has learned of his liaison with another woman and she and her father again go north by this time she has become quite converted to federal principles and the end of the story is that she marries the poor captain who is as proud of his fate as george dobbins was of amelas hand the tale it will be perceived is slight and is rendered quite subservient to the chronicling of the louisianian campaign some of the reflections of the author upon the war are in themselves very interesting as the following passage will testify i such was the defene of fort winthrop one of the most gallant feats of the war those days are gome by and them will be no more im rases conversion from secwoin to loyalty by j w de forest nusw york harper brothers like them for ever at least not in our for erer not very long ago not more than two hours before this ink dried upon the paper the author of the present history was sitting on the edge of a basaltio cliff which overlooked a wide expanse of fertile earth flourishing villages the spires of a city and beyond a shining sea flecked with the fullblown sails of peace and prosperity from the face of another basaltic cliff two miles distant he saw a white globule of smoke dart a little way upward and a minute afterwards heard a dull deep pum  of exploding gunpowder qaarrymen there were blasting out rocks from which to build hives of industry and happy family homes bat the sound reminded him of the roar of artillery of the thunder of those signal guns which used to presage battle of the alarums which only a few months previous were a command to him to mount and ride into the combat then he thought almost with a feeling of sadness so strange is the human heart that he had probably heard those clamours uttered in mortal earnest for the last time never again perhaps even should he live to the age of threesoore and ten would the shriek of grapeshot and the crash of shell and the multitudinous whiz of musketry be a part of his life nevermore would he hearken to that charging yell which once had stirred his blood more fiercely than the sound of trumpets the southern battleyell full of howls and yelpings as of brute beasts rushing hilariously to the fray the longsustained northern yell all human but none the less relentless and stern nevermore the one or the other no more charges of cavalry rushing through the dust of the distance no more answering smoke of musketry veiling unshaken lines and squares no more columns of smoke piling high above deafening batteries no more groans of wounded nor shouts of victors over positions carried and banners captured nor report of triumphs which saved a nation from disappearing off the face of the earth after thinking of these things for an hour together almost sadly as i have said he walked back to his home and read with interest a paper which prattled of town elections and advertised corner lots for eale and decided to make a kidgloved call in the evening and to go to church on the morrow to those interested in that long struggle across the atlantic and who are notp we can heartily commend this booknot so much as a novel as a series of warsketches  miss rarentys conversion from secession to loyalty by j w de forest new york harper brothers mr de forests novel is perhaps not the less true to womans nature because miss ravenels conversion is effected by the wickedness of her secesh husband inspiring her with disgust for southern doings and is not brought about by the force of northern argument showing her the abominations of slavery and the sinfulness of rebellion but though we do not quarrel with the author for making his heroine change her politics at the instigation of animosity for her first husband and love of the man who follows him in her affections we can say nothing in behalf of the story which sets forth the ladys sentimental experiences and illogical doing as mr de forest has made previous attempts in literature it is only seasonable kindness to suggest to him that he should expend no more of his time and industry on an art for which he has no special

in one way superior even to that delight of boyhood walter thornburys old stories retold for wherever the editor has been able the very words of the actors or spectators of forgotten and unearthed romance have been faithfully translated or preserved whore this firsthand eviience is unattainable the romancer in deposing the editor has nevertheless chosen some true tradition for the groundwork of his tale the histories which mr cable his saved from the wreckand his account of their discovery and verification is not the least interesting chapter  thus fall into two classes first and foremost those in which he reproduces an authentic ms and secondly those in which in default of such a treasure he has serged up an orally transmitted legend with his own sauce and garnish mr cable is himself the first to admit the greater value of the firsthand paperspriceless jewels all rough and uncut such as are not found thrice in a century and unlike stones of mere shining dust would only lose in value if tampered with by the lapidary but before these are noteed the three tales from mr cables own pen deserve honourable mention of  salome muller  the haunted house in royal street and  attalie

combination of sympathies artistic sympathy with all the figures upon his canvas be they spirits black white or grey and personal sympathynever warping his artistic presentation but constantly shining through it with the millions of the victimised colour this note is sounded yet more clearly in the horrible story of the haunted house no one could soon forget the picture of the negro child flying over roof and stairway from the cowhide lash of its charming and accomplished mistress madame lalaurie till  there came a dull jarring thud in the paved court beneath  as a specimen of mr cables

complexion a dull clay colour spattered with large red freckles his eyes small grey and close together his hair not long or bushy but hesitating between a dull yellow and a hot red his clothes his own

air of the south downs in the pages of this novel we rise refreshed and inspirited fiom the perusal of these three enticing volumesa result which has become so unusual latterly with readers of works of fiction as the story ran through the pages of blackwood it had many admirers and it is not too much to say that mr blackmore has never produced superior work in ilorna doone there were more striking passages of natural description possibly and in  the maid of sker there was at least one character of more intense individuality but the present novel is remarkable for its general merit given unquestionable genius at the outsetwhich mr blackmore possesseswe should expect an author to ripen in this manner so that his work while it may not impress us for the force of any single attribute will leave upon us a very distinct idea of power that a novel should be styled a worthy suc cessor to the two works we have just named is no mean tribute yet it is one which we are able to pay on the present occasion in the fullest and frankest manner one point has especially struck us in relation to the present story and that is the utter lack of straining after effect either by a spasmodic brilliancy of style or sensationalism of plot the gentleman and the scholar are alike perceptible in every chapter and we are never in a state of dubiety as to the healthy morality he would teach of absolute flinging of moral lessons at the head of the reader there is indeed very little but the whole might very well be placed before the hysterical and sensuous school who having gratified the lower passions of their readers throw an occasional sop to the almighty by patronising religion the true end of the novelist mr blackmore always keeps in viewnamely that of telling the unvarnished history of any character he undertakes to depict one incident at the close of his latest story would in other hands have appeared unreal and grotesque but the author has so manipulated it that it adds to the effect of his work the lorraines of coombe lorraine were a very old family possessing undoubted records of their abode in the land for centuries there was always from the time of baronets either a sir roland sir hilary or sir roger lorrainenames which were never strayed from for the head of the race the present baronet when the story opens in 1811 was sir roland he had an only son

land in the valley of the upper medway a few miles above maidstone while on a visit here with gregory hilary falls desperately in love with mabel lovejoy at which we can express no surprise if the original were anything like mr blackmores portraiture she is a most charming creature yet with a strong heart circumstances favouving as in duty bound thy ought to do mabel was induced to return his aftbction elut here the smooth course of love ends oz returning to coombe lorraine hilary endeavours to persuade his father in favour of mabel sir roland owever will not permit him to descant upon her numerous virtues and concludes in this strain let th wings of imagination spread themselves in a more favourable direction this interview must close on my part with a suggestive but perhaps selfevident proposition hilary the door is open hilary avails himself of the parental suggestion and goes off to the war in the peninsula as he finds he cannot give up his love for the growers daughter the young recruit covers himself with glory at ciudad rodrigo and other places and becomes very popular with all the fellows in his regiment on one occasion he gets desperately wounded and is tended during his illness by the lovely daughters of the count of zamora one of these goes very near wounding him deeply in the region of the heart and he does not get released from his entanglement except at a very severe cost she is the means of his losing 50000 guineas the property of the british army for which he is cashiered by the duke of wellington he afterwards however recovers his credit

obtains sir rolands consent to the matchthat she should marry captain chapman the disreputable son of sir remnant chapman a landowner who has got possession of too many of the lorraine acres lady valeria lorraine thinks this would be an excellent way of recovering them alice ventures to think otherwise but in the end being persuaded that the honour of the house requires it she consents to sacrifice herself on the morning of the weddingday nevertheless she casts herself into the woeburn a stream which has always been a dreaded one with the lorraines on being drawn from the river after she has fulfilled the prediction of the astrologeronly this can save lorraine one must plunge to rescue twainshe remains for several hours apparently lifeless but the heart at length resumes its office and she is recovered sir roland lorraine is stricken with illness when he learns of his daughters supposed suicide a happy event hastens the story to a happy end mabel lovejoy has an immense fortune left to her which is generously given to the lorraines by her father and hersolf and alice and hilary are thus both savedthe former to marry major aylmer a brave british officer and the latter to reconcile sir roland to his union with mabel the above is the merest outline of the story and gives no idea of the quantity of byplay which runs through the volumes some of the best drawn characters are those which are least prominent notably the rev struan hales a sporting parson of the old type and bonny a boy wvho owns a donkey which may lay claim to more intelligence than we should be willing to concede to half the human race these three sketches of two bipeds and one quadruped are  really inimitable and serve as an outlet for mr blackmores peculiar vein of humour we wish it

success or fame it is the earliest worst written and least important yet it has fine comedy and profound tragedy the influence of meredith is very apparent in the picture of broke a more rigid more passionate stupider sir willoughby patterne in one passage an invocation to the audience at the olympian theatre the author lapses into a travesty of merediths very style the tutor one of natures gentlemen and gods poets who rescues the youngest most intelligent and least ugly of brokes six daughters from the horrors of a manage de cowenance is closely modelled on vernon whitford all this detracts a little from the excellence of the book and certain abominations of style which have also to be mentioned detract from it still more take for instance this sentence  a gallant but intrepid hound who took a somewhat informal departure from this life because he chose to cross a railway when hounds were in full cry at the moment the express from london had chosen to cross it also this is terrible we hear too of  a game rejoicing in the euphonious name of pingpong and of  that mysterious zoological specimen the consummate ass dickens himself never committed worse excesses than these in the way of cheap irony and we may add that mr snaith would be well advised to go through all his books and scratch out the word  somewhat  wherever it occurs nevertheless there is grandeur in the scheme of broke of covenden it is thrilling to read how blow upon blow fell upon the all but indomitable pride of the hero and not till the end will lie vield and the characters are more vivid more passionate than merediths meredith would never have shown us the fire in delias soul admirable too is uncle charles a bibulous and kindhearted nobleman beloved by everyone but his wife a literary lady who writes for the spectator whose character the author draws with more ferocity than finesse in a humorous chapter this insufferable dame is smacked by her longsuffering husband alas that the author should add  not in the authentic place  broke of covenden may then be classed as a fine book but imitative henry nortbcote and william 7ordan 7unior resemble nothing but each other written in a style of fantastic beauty they both describe the soul of genius battling to keep its purity untainted in the material world they are spiritual tragedies already in broke of covenden the author is apt to make his characters speak not as they would have spoken but rather as their souls would have spoken already in the description of brokes final desolation we have a foretaste of the authors power of expressing the psychical  there were occasional fierce gushes of rain driven by the wind against the windowpanes of the cottage he mistook them for waves of blood breaking over the walls of his mind in the two later books the whole atmosphere is spiritual the real things are the things of the soul and the phenomenal world becomes a hideous and obscuring dream henry northcote is an advocate penniless and unknown in the prelude a dying and destitute stranger who has heard his oratory in hyde park comes to visit him they talk together about jesus and the need of a new failure a great renunciator like him  to restore the sense of illusion and to show that the strife for the perfect is not a chimaera of the madhouse the stranger vanishes and the same night northcote is given his chance he is to defend a prostitute from a charge of murder the case seems as hopeless as it is sordid the woman is guilty beyond all doubt but to northcote it seems an unholy thing that a woman should be hanged he exerts his amazing genius and procures a verdict of  not guilty the trial scene is dramatic and northcotes speech with its vision of an ideal jury and christ as foreman is great literature but northcote realises that he has worked not for his ideal but for himself his ideal self dies and the ideal self of the woman he has rescued perishes at the same time we leave him an incendiary and a murderer established on the road to worldly success the grim story is relieved by passages of a peculiar humour a humour that reminds one now of dickens now of baudelaires poemes en prose and like the book itself baffles all description hard as it is to give an account of henry northcote in a few lines it is harder still to suggest the characteristics of william 7ordan 7unior judged by the standard of the souls grand effort towards perfection henry northcote the advocate fails and william jordan junior the poet succeeds despite imprisonment poverty sickness and ridicule air snaith is perhaps the only writer of prose who has understood the poetic character his prose in its faults and merits is a poets prose throughout and the character of his poet must be founded on some mighty experience the frail boy is brought up by his aged father in a little bookshop he lives with the heroes of the iliad in a world of poetry and dreams he is terrified of the  streetpeople and as unfit for school or business as a fairy yet gifted with dauntless resolution he lives down his terrors one by one and does not die till he has written the poem it was his mission on earth to write there is nothing in literature like this story of a sublime spirit imprisoned in a wasting frame even the humour is unique who can ever forget the conversation of mr octavius crumpett the publisher with queen victorias favourite novelist  the novelist is in distress he has been offered a title mr crumpett tells him that he should accept it for the honour of literature the great author acquiesces with a sigh he says he can hardly imagine sir william shakespeare and no friendship in literature is more truly pathetic and charming than that of the poet ith the young matthew arnold dodsonan episode which keeps the story human and relieves the mad and stifling tragedy of its close in these days those who would proclaim  one genius more  can hardly hope for a hearing however just their arguments or good their cause we have no desire to be extravagant in our laudation of mr snaith he has given us only three books that are literature and only one masterpiecewilliam 7ordan 7unior

B3200,"['8894040', '3185273']",  the great proconsul edited by sydney c grier blackwood  sons though the great proconsul is not a book of so much fancy or interest as  in furthest ind and like another helen or some other historical novels of the same author it would be absurd to rank it with common novels in in furthest ind we had a stirring story of the fortunes and misfortunes which befell an englishman during the early days when the trading establishments scattered along the coast were laying the foundation of british dominion in india the narrative of edward carlyon late of the honourable east india companys service gentleman and comprising his most marvellous escape from the hands of the inquisition falsely called holy at goa and his journey to the court of the great moghul was full of life variety and colour the materials were real but they had passed through the crucible of the imagination edward carlyon was a hero with flesh and bones and therefore he lives in our memory in  like another helen the author chose a romantic period in the history of our indian empire and the story of the siege of calcutta well told from original documents gave it dramatic interest sylvia irene who related her adventures in a series of letters was a bright and felicitous creation in the great proconsul the narrative is presented in the form of memoirs by mrs hester ward a friend and dependent in the family of the governorgeneral but she is not a creation merely a portrait of a respectable female of her time while her sentimental rhapsodies become somewhat tedious and her love story is not very interesting maxwell her lover we are prepared to like and respect but it is impossible to have any wild enthusiasm for him the following cannot by any stretch of imagination be regarded as an exciting love scene   if omnipotence preserve me you ll find me awaiting you still i assured him and he raised my hand again to his lips in silence what a mournful pleasure do i now discover in tracing afresh every word and incident of that evening  as though i could transfer to though cold and voiceless paper the clasp of my maxwells fingers the music of his tones  beloved youth how noble is thy spirit which with uncomplaining fortitude endured a separation uch as it almost drew thy tears only to contemplate  how long we sat band in hand in a sympathetic and not unhappy silence i dont know but we were disturbed by the blaze of lights and the noise of the servants which announced the return of our patrons and their ii oats in  the great proconsul the historical material has not been sufficiently idealised for fiction and the amount of it interferes with the story and shackles the romance we have an account of the revolt at henares the mahratta war the carnatic war and the dissensions in council the revolt at benares the retreat from talekaon baillies disaster would each of them supply background for an historical romance lut when you attempt to deal with all of them the canvas has too large a background either for artistic effect or for he common readers interest sydney grier has here followed the example of scott in conuectidg a love story with the fortunes f a great historical character warren hastings however is a difficult personage to bring prominently forward in u work of fiction but the task has been performed with considerable skill and he etands out lofty brave and unselfish touched with a sacred fear of the excellence of the woman he loved his letters to his wife most fully reveal the character of the man and those who have read them as the present writer first did some thirty years ago in the british museum or the selection of them in that most delightful book echoes from old calcutta will recognise how closely the lines of this selfrevelation have been followed by sydney grier it would have been more effective to include some of them instead of mrs hester wards opinion of them she tells us that hastings after his escape from benares wrote three billets all very brief from chunar to his wife they all breathe the same spirit of unqualified cheerfulness displaying not the least anxiety in the world for the writers own safety but much for that of mrs hastings whom he desires repeatedly to return at once to boglepore or even to calcutta so as to be out of danger hastings wrote to his wife  i am at chunar and in perfect health i entreat you to return to calcutta be confident my beloved all is now well and will be better i have no fears but for you the character of the  adored marion  is marvellously well drawn she stands before us fond of pomp dress and diamonds but with an imperious will and a passion capable of bewitching the soul of hastings her sole aim was that he shall have every day a several greeting though german was her natural language she spoke english correctly and elegantly but with a foreign accent it is we think a perilous business if not an artistic blunder to attempt to reproduce the foreign accent  de victory is won now and more dan half de cost saved i will be responsible for de future does not delight nor does it necessarily convey the accent of one whom philip francis considered  really an accomplished woman the b ok has its faults but it has also the great merit of giving a living picture of the manners and characters of a past age we have them before usgenerals councillors judges women of fashion painted with a sure and delicate touch eyre coote the most flighty and capricious of men who had the divine gift of winning victories elijah impey the able and learned lawyer who knew how to maintain the independence of his court his spouse lady impey who swears that madame imhoff shall pay her the first visitan idea which i dont fail to encourage says the malicious francis and  curricle  barwell who a letter of the period states encouraged francis to play for high stakes in order to get him into his power but francis won he wrote to mr godfrey  you must know my friend that on one blessed day of the present year of our lord 1770 i had won about 20000 at whist it is reduced to about 12000 and i now never play but for trifles and that only once a week to win a big sum bank it and then play for trifles is characteristic of philip francis but there was a generous side to his nature your allowance to me is noble wrote the faithful wife and if he was the monster that he is painted the woman who loved him would have found it out lady anne monson a greatgranddaughter of charles ii by barbara villiers who used to be the life of the concerts

pall was born by the governor the chief justice mr justice chambers mr francis mr farrer the councillor six ladles bore it from the gate of the buryingground to the grave sydney grier embodies this incident in the story and it is an example of the fidelity with which she has described and illustrated the manners and habits of the time one must be a student of history to estimate the book fairly and one must have dwelled in india to appreciate the freshness fidelity and glow of colour of the eastern descriptions  the great proconsul by sidney c grier 6s blackwood the prefatory note of warning to the ordinary novel reader that you are earnestly recommended to shut this book and pass on as it will not interest you and so forth is a mistake it savours of an affectation of superiority towards her public that the novelist would do well for the sake of her own dignity to avoid it is better every way to leave even the most ordinary novel reader to judge for himself what suits his taste instead of assuming that his mental capacity must needs be less than the authors certainly  the great proconsul  is as the author announces in that warning note long and dull but that in itself is no justification for its being soit ought not to be either a little pruning a little condensation of occasionally verbose and relatively unimportant passages would have fitted the book for the ordinary as well as for the extraordinary novel reader for certainly the career of warren hastings is no matter for dulness from his own writings and those of his friends and enemies miss grier has drawn an intimate and sympathetic view of his character and she reveals it and tells the story of his troubled and broken career by means of a diary kept by an imaginary lmrs ward who lived and went through some startling adventures in india and was befriended by hastings and his wife it is cleverly written and in parts profoundly interesting it required only some effective omissions and curtailments to have made it wholly so and to have secured for it that popular success that is not always so despicable as it seems,war

by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,war

B8772,['8746335'],  adventures in servia  or the experiences of a medical free lance among the bashibatouhs fr by dr alfred wright edited by a g farquharbernard mrcs late surgeon of the servian army sonnenschein  co the supposed author is evidently an imaginary person the real hero of the adventures being mr farquharbernard the book is confessedly a sort of historical novel but in the preface we are assured that  at least three out of every four of the incidents herein narrated really took place and that to the fourth only such proportion of romantic dressing and spicery has been added as would enable it to harmonise with the rest moreover i am desired to state that every character depicted in these pages had its living prototype one great advantage of this imitation of defoes system is that it enables the author to express his opinions of the people whom he seeks to describe very freely without wounding the susceptibilities of individuals the imaginary dr wright a medical student in july 1876 when the struggle between the servians and turks was at its height agreed with another medical student henry winter nicknamed by his comrades hiems to go to servia with the double view of making themselves useful and of gaining professional experience taking with them a supply of medical comforts and surgical appliances the two friends arrived at belgrade and were engaged as assistant surgeons at two pounds a week and board and lodging posted first to the hospital at semendria their short stay there was rendered pleasant by a little lovemaking sent to belgrade in charge of a steamerload of wounded the author after completion of his duty went to the hotel patronised by the russian officers who flocked to offer their services to servia most of them were gentlemanlike and friendly but there were exceptions at belgrade he was witness of a scandalous scene of which a col bragg an adventurer commanding a regiment of servian cavalry was the nero here we may be allowed to remark how extraordinary it is that in the case of a war like that between turkey and servia disreputable englishmen without courage conduct or experience should so frequently be engaged by the combatants when there are many good and selfrespecting retired english officers only too ready to accept commissions to return to our textprincess natalie lying seriously ill an edict was issued forbidding people either to ride or drive past the palace the inhabitants of belgrade were particular in obeying the order and were wont when passing the palace to speak in whispers and walk on tiptoe   suddenly the silence was broken by the clattering of a horses hoofs and the yelping of a cur who should appear upon the scene mounted upon a large chestnut horse but col brag  he sat his horse pretty well but from his fiery complexion and the way he swore sk the dog which bayed furiously at his horses heels i fancy he must have been intoxicated that at least is a charitable supposition the cur yelped and snapped at the horse making it rear and plunge in a way that threatened to un seat the gallant colonel who livid with rage cursed until he was hoarse for fully five minutes a frightful war of sounds continued the dog growling and barking the colonel roaring and swearing and the horse kicking and striking sparks from the rough pavement with his hoofs suddenly the terrible brag changed his tactics and drawing his sabre made a vigour ous down cut at the dog the blow was well aimed the dogs head rolled on the stones then sheathing his weapon the colonel trotted along twirling his moustache with an air of triumphant ferocity on his truculent face undeterred however by the awful fate of the cur a presumptuous gendarme took upon himself the enforcement of the edict in the colonels case and fearlessly confronting him forbade him to ride further in that direction  get out of my way youidiot whats the matter with you  said the colonel contemptuously putting on a tremendous expression and endeavouring to spur his horse past the bold gendarme the  bold gendarme however laid hold of the bridle  will you take your hand off my bridle v shouted the colonel the gendarme stood firm whereupon uttering one of his choicest oaths the colonel struck him on the face and making his horse rear at the same time succeeded in shaking him off then invoking a lot of the most bizcme and recherch maledictions i ever heard on his discomfited adversary the twice triumphant brag rode off  do english officers usually behave like that  asked mouravioff sarcastically  never replied i indignantly  they are gentlemen as for this col bragg i believe he is an american adventurer i am quite certain he is not an english officer sent to the front dr wright found himself owing to an unfortunate grudge born against him by one of the principal surgeons obliged to exchange his position of assistant surgeon for that of lieutenant in the eussian brigade so called because of the nationality of most of the officers being full of fight he was delighted at the circumstance and found the russians excellent comrades the men were however a set of awkward louts taken fresh from the desk and plough and by no means quick in picking up even the most elementary drill tired of inactivity dr wright and two of his eussian comrades spent out of a spirit of bravado a night in a cottage in a wood close to the turkish outposts and after a sharp skirmish in the morning with difficulty gained the servian lines the story of this adventure is told in a spirited fashion the following eassage illustrates the discipline applied j the russian officers to their servian soldiers savrimovitch mouravioff and i were silently smoking under the shelter of our hut when a bullet whistled between us and passed out through the leafy wall behind we btarted to our feet and rushed outside a number of soldiers were standing or sitting about engaged in cleaning their rifles cooking c mouravioff demanded furiously who had fired the shot a heavy btupidlooking fellow was pointed out as the culprit whereupon our friend strode up to him and seizing him by the collar asked him sternly what he meant by discharging a loaded rifle in camp the soldier sulkily answered that he had only fired his piece in the air and did not know there waa any harm in that whereupon the roughandready mouravioff replied  idiot dont you know that when you send a bullet into the air it is likely to come down again like this  and striking him on the head with his clenched fist knocked him over this severe treatment caused some murmuring amongst the soldiers who were already beginning to tyre ofrussian discipline a sinister rumour that many russian officers had been treacherously slain in battle by some of their own men whose illwill they had incurred was current in camp and it was undoubtedly true that russian officers frequently treated the servians with great harshness but considering though rawness and inaptitude of the material they had to deal with and the absolute necessity of enforcing discipline i do not think that the kicks and cuffs i often saw them bestow on their men were unmerited again although the unwarlike serbs murmured at being dragooned into discipline they seemed very soon to regain their equanimity they are naturally too goodnatured and easygoing a race to be vindictive and therefore i believe that the heavy losses among the russians were due to their reckless valour and not to servian treachery nevertheless many russians i met firmly believed this rumour in spite of the indignant denial of it given by the servians,war

B7137,"['8766574', '8507622']",  noblesse oblige novels and novelettes by sarah tytler 3 vols hurst  blackett vestinays martyrdom a story of the catacombs by emma raymond pitman hodder  stoughton the spanish barber by the author of mary powell nisbet  co perhaps the latest production of miss tytler an author not without experience might have been fraught with more interest to the general reader if the necessities of custom had not required that the matter of half a volume should be spread out into three taking the most favourable view of noblesse oblige the best friends of its author could scarcely venture to say that it offers anything of engrossing interest either in the characters or in the story yet there are glimpses here and there of humour and intention especially where the author does not attempt too high a flight in the social scale which might have formed as it were the cadre of a good story before the sevenfold process of dilution was applied small countrytown scenes and society might have afforded a good deal of amusement at least we should imagine so from the description of the misses medlar the twicefour blooming daughters of the  first attorney in wellfield  the low and vulgar wellfield wags we are told multiplied the number of the miss medlars to forty the forty miss medlars j then by a natural and wicked association they had changed the miss medlars into thieves the forty thieves innocent though they were of stealing mens hearts they were tall stout passably goodlooking girls their bane was plethora in constitution as well as number few men could serenely contemplate a wife of eleven stone weight any more than thirtynine sistersinlaw happy had it been if miss tytler had traced out the lives of these smalltown beauties instead of giving way to that alluring form of ambition which forces a certain class of novelists in spite of nature and in defiance of art to draw highlife groups for which assuredly they have never had any proper models what can we expect when we find colloquial phrases not used in the upper classes or in any educated class cropping up to the surface continually in certain parts of the book lord wriothesleys illness had seemed nothing out of the common she seems to be learning to live without rest or refreshment of any kind for as small and frail as she is  once they had arrived and got a cup of tea she would be able to chat with phoebe  she felt a vast deal better already and able for any amount of gossip i am glad i have got anything i wanted and am the better of we take these singular specimens of english as we find them here and there and we have only to observe that they are not placed in the mouths of persons supposed to be uneducated or even of the misses medlar but that they proceed either directly from the author or from the more refined personages of the story including the countess of exmoor and her daughter the lady dorothea latimer it is wonderful how the author identifies herself with the great latimers and how she despises the small latimers otherwise  the essex latimers who will succeed to the title in consequence of the death of lady dorotheas brother lord wriothesley yet these despised latimers are kind enough to give a home to lady dorothea who conde scends while utterly despising them and calling them commonplace goodish sort of people to avail herself of the accommodation of their house for the purposes of her wedding the difference between the present earls family and the relatives who are to succeed him and who are of course of the same aristocratic stock is surely a difference twixt tweedledum and tweedledee but the author revels in such a difference and so far from exhibiting it as a personal prejudice in the mouth of one of her characters makes herself a party to it in the most uncompromising and glaring manner in short miss tytler is an oligarch to the backbone except in one particular point and there nature creeps out the two heroines of the story lady dorothea and miss phoebe pas ton are both wooed by men of rank yet they both condescend to marry men of far inferior positions thus the independence of the sex is vindicated and the authors female conscience is saved it will be better for her readers and herself if in future works she makes her matter in some degree commensurate with her space and abstains from the attempt to describe phases of society with which her acquaintance is evidently imperfect passing to the second work on the above list we come to a tale of other times but one which is also of serious earnest quality as almost all visitors to rome have joined a party to see the catacombs and have made their way through the narrow passages lined with the empty restingplaces of early christians pausing now to observe a phial of blood now some ancient device on the wall it is likely that the present story will revive many interesting associations miss pitman promises to introduce us to the life of that roman community which was addressed in an epistle and was visited by st paul and which dragged out a troubled and anxious existence under the shadow of the emperor nero vestina who gives her name to the story is a noble roman maiden aud a convert to christianity at first she keeps her religious change a secret but after a time her mother and her brother follow her example and they are martyred before her but there are other and much more important characters in the story miss pitman tells us at the end that many of the incidents here recorded are historical facts and could have been presented in a series of historical chapters but to many minds the thin disguise of fiction is more attractive and to many more the dry historical account seems repulsive while they will welcome the same information in this form it is for this reason no doubt that st paul himself is brought on the stage and that we are shown the apostle during his first visit to rome arguing with the jews and preaching to christians in the hired house where he was suffered to dwell with the soldier who had charge of him several names mentioned in st pauls epistles occur also in the story onesimus demas alexander the coppersmith take a prominent part on the whole miss pitmans work is a fair sample of the religious historical story there is a certain superficial verisimilitude in the use made of the smallest biblical hints and in the working out of characters whose names and leading peculiarities alone are mentioned by the apostle miss pitman enters sometimes into the spirit of her story and the description of  vestinas martyrdom or rather of her timely release from martyrdom is simple and touching when we are told however that the facts presented to us might have occupied a series of historical chapters we feel bound to point out the abundance of grave errors in the historical parts of the story miss pitman has apparently taken her dates from the margin of her bible and seeing there that st paul arrived in rome ad 63 and that the epistle to philemon was written a year later she has not scrupled to bring in the story of onesimus the slave and to describe his being sent back to his master even with these materials before her she has made a mistake for in this epistle st paul speaks of demas as his fellowlabourer while according to miss pitman demas had already forsaken the apostle but the other facts which have to tally with these dates are still more unfortunately chosen we read that in ad 63 vespasian had defeated the jews vespasian was not sent against them till the year 66 nero is represented in the same year as accompanied by his young wife octavia he had put her away the year before and had married poppaja a few days afterwards the late attempt to rehabilitate nero seems to have led miss pitman to state that he set the city on fire to satisfy a brutal jest  as is now universally believed from corroborative testimony the peculiar felicity of the word  now  appears most strongly when we remember that modern criticism has shaken what ancient historians believed but if in this case ancient opinions are attributed to the moderns modern words are in return ascribed to the ancients miss pitman talks incomprehensibly of the  bagnio or public way to what language does she think that word belongs  yet even this is outdone by the statement that the part of rome lying beyond the tiber was called in ad 63 the trastevere what possible sense that name could have till the river itself had become the italian tevere instead of the latin tiber or tiberinus we must leave to miss pitman to discover when she says too that  to dwell in the trastevere was to be accounted among the scum and offscouring of the inhabitants we cannot but feel for the good name of that friend of horaces who lived far across tiber near caesars gardens after these specimens of miss pitmans mistakes we need hardly add that the laliclavu8 or broad stripe was not worn on the toga or upper garment but on the tunica or under garment that pan was a greek deity and not  the god of the country among the romans and that the lupercalia were not festivities in his honour but were offered to the god of fertility accuracy on these points is a minor consideration though it was hardly necessary for miss pitman to enter into details which she could not verify her other blunders are much more serious and affect the value of her book we abandon neither serious purpose nor grave mistakes when we come to the third of the above works in punch for the year 1844 will be found one of those humorous paragraphs illustrated with quaint woodcuts by thackeray and called forth by a statement in the times of the day to the effect that some british society had hit upon a novel plan of introducing tracts into spain viz by bottling them securely corked these same bottles were cast adrift at the entrance of the bay of cadiz and being washed on shore by the tide found their way landwards through the medium of the sailors  so no doubt  reported the agents of the parent society thackerays humorous paper is in the form of a remonstrance addressed to espartero then an exile in england there are three illustrations no 1 depicts a sailor waistdeep in the sea clutching a bottle floating towards him on the crest of a wave  rum praps exclaims the excited salt no 2 the same sailor on shore a fellow salt and a boy personating audience he is in the act of inserting the screw into the cork and exclaims  sherry i hope no 3 in withdrawing the cork he finds some paper adhering and with disappointment dismay and contempt depicted on his countenance exclaims  tracts by jingo the title of this book the spanish barber by the author of  mary powell suggested  rum praps and a perusal of the table of contents and the first chapter led to sherry i hope this chapter has much of the power of this quaint and original writer but a further perusal induced disappointment and the exclamation of tracts by jingo involuntarily escaped our lips miss mannings story is evidently written for the purpose of what is termed in the exeter hall vernacular  doing the good work a certain lay figure is set for the converted sinner who goes on converting other sinners in a style of simple addition quite delightful to contemplate given a spanish barber locality gibraltar who shaves a lay figure named caravantes probably so called because the barber quotes cervantes and boasts that he knows the adventures of the knight of la mancha by heart proverbs and all the shavee converts the shaver at once the shaver his wife they quote texts and the shaver decides to close his shop on sunday this naturally curtails his trade but he pursues the  good work leaving his wife in the charge of and to be maintained by her parents he crosses to oran as a colporteur laden with a sack of tracts he lends a shivering jew his cloak who returns it by the hands of his son a delicate youth consumptive of course this young jew is converted his father smothers himself with dust curses the barber and dies a  contrabandist is introduced who uses very coarse language and cuts the throats of his fellow creatures without the slightest compunction he repents conveniently and ever after trades honestly paying all importduties in a very  goodygoody manner indeed no englishman worthy the name he bears will speak slightingly or contemptuously of true religion nor of those who seek to carry the godly precept of loving ones neighbour as oneself into daily practice but goodygoody stories like the present serve no purpose worthy the name of purpose  and such a pen as that which traced mary powell should leave such  good work  to smallbeer chroniclers of the  moral

to gain for the exmoors the glory of great reputation and his sister lady dorothea is to strengthen the family by a rich match lord wriothesley is rather infirm of purpose for instead of passing reform bills and organising emigration schemes he falls in love in a sort of helpless fashion with phoebe paston the artists daughter lady dorothea on the other hand knows her duty and performs it she is about to may a lord fairchester whom she does not particularly love then she gets to love him very much then it turns out that there is a mistake in the title atid then the young woman who is represented as a miracle of goodness aned kindness and honor turns him off  if lord fairchester is reduced to john blount she observes tranquilly to phxebe he will be no match for dorothea latimer owe exmoors have always sacrificed our private feelings and had not to do with mwial1iianvx when she parts with her lover she informs him that their two souls are united for ever which means we presume that her delicate sense of honour will not prevent her marrying her body to somebody else meanwhile lord wriothesley dangles after the artists daughter much to the discomfort of her other lover an artist whose only comfort is that wriothesley is a good young man and means no harm he had no doubt thwt lard wriothesley was of such a set whitewashed and vituos os became a latimer but man enough to have his iudividual tastes although peer enough to hanker after forbidden fruit lord wriothesley could not have phoebe paston mny more than the prince of wales could have had her but he could admire her court her and dangle after her in a dilettante virtuous iatimer fasbion only robbing her of her virgin fancy her maiden meditations the first bloom of her heart phoebe is a curious young woman who

sort of vassal or serf of the exmoor family the other characters are unhmportant now it would seem that the great occupation in life of these people is to talk of the differences of class indeed the word  class  crops up in these  pages until we get heartily sick of it two women almost strangers meet hurriedly in the street they have not seen each other for some time and the one asks the other how she likes the place phoebe replies that she has every reason to speak well of the people whereupon mrs edgecumbe immediately points out that such people are necessarily unknown to her  you see i have known my class these thousand years and the other is not at all in my way poor phoebe she is beset on all sides by  class  and it is an open question whether one ought to be more ashanied of the despicable titleworship on the part of her neighbours or more disgusted with the profound selfconsciousness of rank on the part of her grand friends lord exmoors family talk as if they had just acquired their patent of no bty and were overcome by the new sensation even the mild and characterless lord wriothesley when he visits phoebes father has to beg that there will be no fuss made about him and hopes that paston will not turn courtier but the oddest exhilbitions of this feeling occur in its reflex action upon the people around phoebe is writing to lady dorothea and she says is it not the boast of the ermoora that they have once and again at such seasons jeopardied lands and life for king and country  may not we follow at a distance and hazard in our turn our small private fortunes for the credit of our friends and our class is there no noblesse oblige in the middle rank and the mercantile world also p forgive me for likening myself to you lady dorothea but i wish you could see my uncle now he sets himself to breast the blast and begin life anew with my aunt standing by and fairly for etting that she used to take a great deal out of him and demand special consideration from him for being a wingfield of batty and wingfield a norman mercantile house in these parts lady dorothea now more eagerly deferential to him than i could have imagined a woman a little hard and exacting in her better days could under any circumstances become  a norman mercantile house  is excellent elsewhere phoebe remarks of her titled friends  they are great people and as such perfectly exceptional no more to be measured by small people in their actions and the consequences of their actions than kings are to be measured it was probably owing to her deference to this divine right of great people that phoebe although she loved barty wooler and was by him beloved invariably snubbed him in order to remain single and let lord wriothesley flirt with her indeed she looks forward to the certainty of his proposing to her and she allows her neighbours to talk of the match as settled without taking any particular thought as to what she must do should he be so indiscreet phoebe has a great liking for lord wriothesley but then she is of opinion that  love and love alone can cross securely the chasm between clas and class and so she allows matters to drift apparently hoping that lord wriothesley would marry her and yet not removing barty wooler too far out of reach finally lord wriothesley dies and then she falls back upon barty and marries him she admits that she might have married lord wriothesley  out of pure gratitude loyalty and reverence but that her heart was b alty s the time we hope barty liked the position dy dorotheas affairs end in a marriage also for she at

have read for some years certainly since the first two or three of jai ess novels when his imagination was fresh and he had not taken to copy himself reginald i astings is a story of the civil wars it is in truth the history of prince rupert and the cavaliers wrought into a romance with the help of a few fictitious personages but with facts for its foundation and framework and its portraiturcs of personages and descriptions of manners of costumes and other accessories faithfully drawn from the reminiscences of the times as they had been presented to the author in the course of his historical researches with another object and here too we discover that distinctness of description that liveliness of narrative that breadth of colour and glow of imagination which distinguished his crescent andithe crossl and made it one of the most popular books of our time ilis battle scenes are peculiarly exciting for he brings them before us not as do inferior writers by an accumulation of epithets and a cloud of big words that convey no distinct image to the mind but by incidents by separate groups and the actions of individuals whence a mnuch more definite notion is formed of the whole than by an unpracticable attempt to represent as one image the entire hurlyburly of the field then tis dialogues are unusually dramatic smart and lively rarely falling into the vice of disquisition or the

likewise a nice appreciation of character and considerable skill in its evolution in short he has all the elements for a successful novelist and only needs a little more practice to llace himsef among

flung backward from their palisades of pikes or perished under their fire more than one half of his brave aigiment fell before the sun was high after that finding it impossible to rally them again he rode away to the foot to endeavonr with them to retrieve the day but by that time the whole feed was in a general mneke as far as the cavalry were concerned the foot however stood firmly on either side exchanging hot musket fire as from so many fortifications while the horse fought each man where he could soonest find an enemy my yeomen indeed kept close to me and strove to apply their strength where it was most needed but with scarcely a dozen men i might almost as well have fought alone hotepur had been summoned to accompany the prince i had been left to rally what men i could and strange

blount alone remained to me that faithful servant seemed to forget his own existence in watching over mine when i was struggling and trampling among fierce enemies there was he parrying the same

but at length we were left unassailed by the enemy and so rested on our arns men and horse alike incapable of further offensive movements i then had time to cast my eyes about me everywhero i beheld groups of dying men who had been withdrawn or withdrawn themselves out of the strife with which they were done for ever surgeons with their men with bared arms and bloody shirts were attending upon some ministers of religion were bending over others exercising their healing office upon the souls of the departing i drew near to one of the latter groups a noble form all sheathed in armour lay resting upon a pile of heather the face alone was bare and upturned to the sky and all seemed still with him except gushes of blood that bubbled up from the cuirass at every pulse beat so laid the beloved of many the admired of all the gallant good canarvon and kneeling by his side his white hair waving in the breeze was jeremy taylor the divine pouring forth such heavenly and consoling prayers as brightened up the countenance of the dying man with thoughts that conquered agony as we stood round our happy comrade lord jermyn the queens favourite rode up to him and hastily dismounted  ah my dear lord he exclaimed  this is sad work but we must get you round we never could afford to lose such an ornament to court and camp the courtier suddenly ceased for he saw that the angel of death was already there and even ho was awed in his solemn presence he was kindhearted too in his own way and lie bent over his friend and whispered softly  you have deserved well of the king have you no wish or prayer that i can deliver for you  the dying man without moving his eyes from a bright sunset spot among the clouds where they were fixed replied faintly and firmly  noi have no prayer but for the king of kings and with these grand words lie died i remained silently there beside him for some time and then rose sadly and slowly to seek among the wounded or perhaps slain my faithful follower

remained only some weary friends to seek and sonie savage suttlerwomen to spoil the dead thlen were found faulkland and sunderland and they were laid beside their friends as i have described then too was found many a slain father by his son a brother by his brother with heartbreaking grief that never found a voice except in the humble homes made desolate anl cries of pain anid half suppressed

lately men and thus is glory won and thus after 16k years of christian grace do christians decide controversies concerning the common weal of their perishable bodies and immortal souls i leaned upon a broken guncarriage lost in contemplation of the scene before me and still as one of the surrounding dead i envied them the meanest trooper there looked sublime and happy in repose while the few forums

reudereui all shapos doubtfnl anrd undefined and ghostlike as the figure drew near however i could hear its breath drawn hard as if drawn through clenched teeth and as it turned towards the light i could see the glitter of the long knife or skene used by the camp followers my heart beat quick in spite of me as this illornened figure glided on now stopping over one body and cutting from it some article that seemed of value and now rolling aside another unconscious corpse in order to rifle it more conveniently i could by this time see that this creature was a womanone of those lost ones who haunted every camp corrupting the living and spoiling the dead bodies of the soldiery it was also asserted and i fear too truly that their murderous looking knives prevented many a wounded mans

conviction that our present artists in this genre must look to it if an american writer is not to step ahead even of them dr weir mitchells story may be pronounced excellent entertainment it is a fullblooded narrative rich in stirring incident in shrewd delineation of character and most pleasantlyand considering its title unexpectedlyrich in charm and mellowness it has breeding and courtesy it may be said at once that the influence of thackeray and of stevenson is perceptible in the book again and again we oome upon suggestions of esmond and the virginiansthe period is that of the latter novel and washington is again prominentand often there are turns and phrases that seem to proceed from familiarity with the author of catriona and kidnapped but this is no more than to say that dr weir mitchell has studied in good schools stevenson himself played the sedulous ape to great personal advantage dr mitchells equipment is too considerable for any stigma to rest upon him because he has not been equally successful in eliminating all direct traces of his exemplars dr mitchells own qualities should be insisted upon the story is tnat of the war of independence at the end of the last century from the point of view of a young philadelphia quaker turned soldier it begins with schooldays and ends in a glance backwards over happy married life and so far is conventional and commendable as the quakers say to the publio that has bought so many editions of lorna doone on the way there are good fighting good duelling and many perilous enterprises and fine scenes in old philadelphian mansions and imprisonment and fair women and brave men but there is more too there is a genuine flavour of the past the reader has glimpses of early pennsylvanian friends and the ample leisurely life they led and there are excellent portraits to add to his gallery aunt gainor the strongminded old whig gambler is a fulllength of much merit aunt gainor disliked quakers and hated tories hence she

was hardly likely to i betray the diffuse wrongheadedness of youth 1 or the effete garrulity of age middle life is 1 not the autobiographical epoch he was not looking back upon a closed career but like a busy man of affairs just utilised the enforced leisure of the sickroom to jot down a few reminiscences in his own plain modest yet confident manner his last words were as characteristic of himself as they are affecting now to all who mourn him  if i bring these pages to a somewhat abrupt conclusion it is because i have had the bad luck to get a chill out shooting and have been somewhat seriously ill however i have hope that there is  lifo in the old dog yet and that i may before long have some other adventures of a similar description to add to these 4 unvarnished sketches of my life and this was written in the last stage of a hopeless illness a few days before that death whose approach he sturdily refused to recognise nor was such fortitude the outcome of a rough coarse nature for we cannot too highly praise his delicate reticence and forbearance he suppresses the names of his private enemies the very names of their ships are so faintly indicated by initials that only the experts whom it may concern will trouble to track them out he has not studied in the new school of posthumous calumny and testamentary libel een in their ashes live their wonted fireswho launching greek fire and stinkpots from behind the tomb would tempt us to misread the old maxim as de superstitibus nil nisi bonum and revising solon to cry  call no man formidable till his death in his scramble through life hobart jostled against many a knave and many a fool who deserved exposure but seemingly he felt that each has a little followingif only one or twoof harmless believers who love nnd admire him for such measure of good as unseen of the world is in him and who must needs weep to see their idol stripped and mocked he passes lightly over his somewhat neglected childhood and first three years at sea under a bad captain that a man of rank and breeding should illtreat a child of twelvea relative confided to his careso barbarously ought to be but is not incredible the wretch belonged to a type nearly extinct he was a handsome young man with fine features darkened however by a deep scowlthe old type of the essentially wicked man no one is unaffectedly wicked nowadays because no one enjoys such despotic power as those captains of the old school when engaged in the suppression of the slave trade young hobart witnessed an instance p 22 of that unscrupulous and insolent naval policy which made our ships too often a byword in this case a sanguinary encounter and fatal eas us belli was averted by the humane surrender of his rights by the french commander the passage is too long for quotation hobart took part in the expedition to paraguay in 1839 and praises highly perhaps undulythe order and prosperity of the jesuit rule before we murdered paraguay among other victims by our precious liberating policy of slaverhunting and the great emancipation bubble hobart writes with distressing candour and highly improper veracity as a philanthropic and deservedly selfsatisfied nation we objeot to be reminded that philanthropy itself invented the slavetrade  or that the worst plantation was a heaven compared to the hell of cannibal africa or that the horrors of the slave ship 3 were entirely due to our interference or about the spies in our pay and the wholesale corruption we encouraged  or that after all we simply stole the slaves ourselves from their purchasers and enslaved them to work seven years for us in demerara and then by emancipation opened to them or such as survived the glorious vista of vice want and degradation such remarks are most true most imprudent most impertinent and should be put down for the baleful reign of philanthropythat thirsty vampire which has long brooded over the sleep of humanity has not yet passed away and simple truth is still blasphemy hobarts interviews with antonelli and pio nono chap viii contribute something to the history of the popes flight to gaeta more important is the authors justification of his seizure of the enossis at syra a leading case in the law of blockade here hobart is probably right upon a point where england has usually taken too moderate a view of her rights of the blockaderunning adventures we will only say they are exciting and racy had marryat practised the sport he would have described it not much better nor will we venture out of our depth to criticise the authors remarks on military and naval tactics turk and russian or his mockery of torpedoes one story however is as curious as it is exciting hobarts flagship once caught the czars splendid yacht the livadia in the disgraceful act of pillaging and burning a poor little turkish merchant ship and chased the imperial marauder across the euxine into sebastopol another story throws light on news manufacture a turkish ironclad hastening with stores to sulina reported that on her way she had casually chased a russian cruiser but could only spare time to exchange a few shots soon after appeared a paragraph in the times   turkish ironclad driven off and nearly destroyed by the russian mailboat cruiser vesta describing  how the vesta had engaged at close quarters a turkish ironclad killing her crew how officers in european uniform had been seen directing the working of the turkish guns c how her sides were crimson with the torrents of blood pouring from her decks and how she would have been surely captured had the vest i been provided with sufficient ammunition it added that the gallant russian commander was received with the greatest enthusiasm on his arriving at sebastopol and immediately promoted to high rank and covered with decorations the author is too fair not to add that when the impostor was found out he was instantly degraded for admiral hobart was a generous enemy he admires and celebrates the military virtues and splendid gallantry of the russians he deplores and blames himself that like others he saw too late the superior resources and indomitable courage of the  federal americans it was not his fault that 5 j fate once opposed him to the only nation which discerning tolerance could not respect the greedy greeks the rebel southern states had his sympathy in their foolish heroic struggle for liberty and existence he was not blind to their glaring faults but his strong sense was revolted at the hypocritical paradox of an eightyyearold confederacy founded on secession throttling secession by civil war one foreign people abovo alland the one he knew best and bad known in their bitter life and death struggle when national character flashes out in supreme sincerityclaimed his honest respect experience presented the ottoman turks to this practical sailor as history presents them to the philosopherdispelling the mists of ignorant intolerant prejudice which still float down to us from crusading days to distort our view of that noble race of few inherent vices and many splendid and deeprooted virtues cramped by circumstance their political genius distorted by the glamour of an alien semitic faith their government a vile ferment of western leaven among the dregs of oriental corruption unwilling and now unable to march side by side on the pith of progress with the nations which for ages have reviled while they feared them the turks might yet have found mercy had they not scandalised europe by the fatal imprudence the unpardonable sin of practising christian virtue apart from christianity all which surely we may regret when we reflect that in the moral sphere above mere racial and historical affinities the turk claims a far nearer kinship to the englishman than does even the spanish goth religious differences have hardly ever marred our genuine intimate camaraderie with the magyars in the rare cases where intercourse has existed between us and the turks a wider chasm of bigotry has yawned engulfing those who have charitably tried to leap it our grandfathers would have openly called hobart pasha a renegadewe only think him soour grandchildren will do neither our utmost stretch of indulgence is to excuse the sailor because he was only a sailor sailing away as a boy and all his life from the charmed circle of insular prejudice learning life by living and foreign peoples in their own homes instead of in british parlours lecturerooms and missionary meetings admiral hobart like many another sailor of vigorous understanding unsophisticated conscience and limited culture failed to appreciate the timehonoured prejudice which should have forbidden him to respect in the infidel those very virtues dignity sobriety fortitude domesticity truth generosity and love of justicewhich he had been taught to revere as the peculiar appanage of his own countrymen in his eyes the swindling greek was no better than

sorely aggrieved because mr dickens is not so inhuman as to be absolutely faultless some suggest modifications and point out how they would have planned it if it had been theirs to write some are in raptures over one part some over another and some very particular fellows are carping at every part the judgments on lileah house are in short as various as judgments are apt to be upon a man whoso failings it is thought a subtle test of criticism to discover for the very reason that all the world admires and likes him and his books are bought and read by everybody that this latest of his hooks has filled the fancies of its readers with new groups of people as familiar and real as any that in life they may have known  that it overflows with inimitable grace and tenderness that it is stored with the most subtle wit and with a humour hearty and true that sets always instinctively at work our pleasantest and kindliest emotions  that mirth and pathos abound in it that its satire is always just and manly and that it is full of generous indignation against social usages that create wrong and perpetuate suffering among usis simply in other words to say that it is a book written by mr

smiles also from our childrens children mr dickens has a large public in the present and wo do not hesitate to declare our belief that he will have one hardly less large in the future the world will grow wiser than it is the abuses attacked by this greatest of humorists and kindliest of satirists will disappearbut the spirit in which he writes and to which he appeals is indestructible  and the emotions he awakens are not more fresh and true to us than they will be to future generations thc first remark we are disposed to make on lileah house has relation to its plot the conduct of the story appears to us singularly skilful not without justice has it been objected that the habit of writing a story in monthly parts is apt to lead to a grouter concern for the part than for the whole und to interfere with though steady and continuous working of every event up to the final issue but let us in the present instance with no less justice remark that the habit of reading a story in parts is equally apt to prevent many readers from noticing how thoroughly a work so presented to them is calculated for perusal as a whole the studied and elaborate care bestowed upon the construction of lileah house is very manifest event leads to event and chance words or though deeds of chance people that seem perfectly irrelevant are seen everywhere precisely as in real life exerting a direct and powerful bearing on the course taken by a train of incidents whereof the issue is one of life or death of happiness or misery to men and women perfectly unknown to them taking the mere surface view of such treat ment it would of course be easy to exhibit its apparent want of connexion and design and to display in the j attempt only our own very real want of sagacity this subtle linking together of thc deeds and interests of many people so far as they bear on the progress of one given set of incidents is in fact truer to nature infinitely truer than the common plan of representing half a dozen men and women acting and re acting on each other exclusively as if they were fenced out from the surrounding world its drawback is that it compels the uso tf a huge number of characters which come and go during though progress of the story  und j as their purpose in the narrative is not always evident until the reader can look back from the journeys end over the  ground he has traversed they may now and then cause some j confusion in the readers mind mid produce an etlect like j that of an overcrowded picture 13ut the art rather than the artist is there in fault  he this as it may never in any former work has mr j dickens made use of a plot so evidently planned before hand with minute consideration or throughout so elaborately studied even the lits of the little lawstationers servant aid directly in the chain of little things that lead indirectly to though catastrophe of lady dedlocks death so dexterously indeed an the many little incidents of this kind leading to i great results managed throughout lileah house that wu can hardly feel surprise if the results should by not very careful readers be received as substantive and independent facts and the small precedent details held altogether separable from them as a mere cloud of isolated incidents a novel j may havo its too superficial readers as life has its too hasty obsorvers at though closo of his preface mr dickens marks

intention though great chancery suit on which the plot hinges and on incidents connected with which important or trivial all though passion and suffering turns is worked into j every part of the book

knew hotter what he was alout and though use made of jarndyco v jamdyco in lileah house is always complete and masterly fjthe other grand feature of the tale connected also closely yet quito naturally with this is the dedlock household lt is brought out with equal power with the same thoughtful elaboration aud with as perfect a result not only have we sir leicester a truo gentleman with all his weaknesses and lady dedlock the supercilious woman of fashion with a busy heart painfully throbbing beneath that hard and quiet outside but yolumnia and though cousins the town house and the footmen

cuffys and buffya in which they believe politics to consist down to the last chapters that concern themchapters in eluding the flight and pursuit of the unhappy lady dedlock which are in conception aud construction absolutely wonderfulthe power aud care spent upon though group are unceasingly exerted yet so successfully as to bear no trace of effort to keep it throughout iu that central position towards which the other sections of though tale may be seen gradually and surely to converge taking the story piecemeal as a mero gallery of pictures and persons we are disposed to think that there are particular groups in lileah house finer than anything that even mr dickens has yet produced in the same way exquisitely true and tender as are his descriptions of the suffering classes in former writings wo can remember none by which we have been touched so deeply or that has been graced by so much of the very finest writing as though entire tale of the streetwandering joe as it may be gathered from the pages of the book before us in though trooper george though ragnets and their humble household we have another of those fine broad hearty exemplifications of humour in which mr dickens delights in which all though ludicrous features of every object or incident are intensely enjoyed and made prominent yet with a most genuine and charming sentiment at the same time underlying it all nothing is repulsive  everything is large laughable and true and the most homely and ungainly figures become radiant with the spirit of goodness the character of esiher summerson has been much elaborated and the early portions of her narrative aro as charming as anything mr dickens has ever writtenindeed some of the best things in the book may be found throughout it full as it is of noble fancies and delicate and graceful thoughts but wo suspect that mr dickens undertook more than man could accomplish when he resolved to make her the naive revealer of her own good qualities we cannot help detecting in some passages an artificial tone which if not selfconsciousness is at any rate not such a tone as would be used in her narrative by a person of though character depicted yet the graces and virtues of esther have won so many hearts that we do not care to dwell on our objection to his method of displaying them  and as to the one or two other characters of the book which wo might have wished away these are quite lost in that crowd of fresh and ever real creations that will live while the language continues mrs jelly by and her despondent husband her daughter caddy and though turveydrops the trooper george and his man phil the brickmakers wives and the dead infant the lawstationer and his little woman roy thorn and ski dipole mr chadband and the coavinses the mother of mr  uppy the inscrutable and impassable tulkinghorn to say nothing of 1 poor miss flite or the immortal bucket and a dozen others j have been added here to the long list of ideal people with j whom mr dickens has made his countrymen intimately and permanently acquainted mr dickenss characters as all the world knows pass their names into our language and become types lt is  an evidence of his possession of the highest power that the best of them are thus made each to embody some characi toristic feature to personify some main idea which are ever after found universally applicable such has been the aim of the highest class of dramatists and novelists since though beginning of all literature they know little how much there is in any ono mans head or heart who expect to have every i character in a tale laid bare before them as on a psychological  dissecting table and demonstrated minutely we see nobody minutely in real life the rough estimates we form of character aro on though whole if we possess any tact correct  but men touch and interfere with ono another by the coni tact of their extremes and it is the prominences the sharp i angles that aro most likely to appear in a tale really worth the telling hence it is therefore as well as for i other reasons that the dramatist or novelist is concerned chiefly with the display of salient points in leach one of his characters though rest ofthe sketch is filled iup by the reader or spectator instinctively and sufficiently i out of his own experience squire allworihy rlifil philosopher square parson adams trulliber and all the rest of fieldings characters were formed upon this plan  nor was it thought unjust or unnatural by the great novelist to give distinctness to thc picturo in each case by just so much of genial strength and breadth of colouring as should prevent his idea from being impressed too faintly on the public mind it is for the most part much more easy than correct to cry outexaggeration wo may be only betray ing our ignorance after all thero is an eastern saying to the effect that there is in the world precisely what the eye can find in it and let us not suppose that what limits our viewin any particular direction should of necessity be an equal restriction to thc view of a man of genius of mr dickens it is to bo said if of any oue that his main strength has lain in the ability to concentrate his thoughts on objects external to himself if his mero personality were at every turn set up as the limit aud bound to his perceptions if it were still his recurring habit to tako his own character as the infallible test of all other characters ho would in each fresh essay be always retracing only the old weary ground rut ready and cager at all times with genial warmth and fulness to enter in all the peculiarities of others we have him continually throughout his books apprehending and interpreting iew forms of character and truth and carrying with each new achievement of his genius new pleasure nnd delight into thousands of homesbecause his genius is his fellowfeel in with his race to illustrate these remarks a few passages may bo taken almost at random from the tragical

whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in pickwick and nicholas nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined mr dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art in place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole we dwelled upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc tale of two cities in the story of great expectations the same thing is equally remarkable and the new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in england and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power there is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation in great expectations the thought is one often enforced by mr dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour joe gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying about him revolves pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman his great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning there is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need he escapes from australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him the monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour that he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow pip sees and

law pip turns to his neglected fosterfather joe gargery the blacksmith joe who had in these late years found the fallen pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour one with this story is that of miss havisham and her foster child estella who becomes the object of pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter wealthy miss havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most

chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with joe gargery at the forge the delicacies of joes character are often suggested rather than told we make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant pip as his child but we are told by himself why he leaves mrs gargery to develop into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and

laying it upon her husband as well as unon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had s general impression that she must have made joe gargery marry her by band joe was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth see sad with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they  to have somehow got mixed with their own whites hs wat a mild goodnatured sweettempered easygoing foolish dee fellowa sort of hercules in strength sad also in weakness my sister mrs joe with black hair sud eyes had sacha prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she  yes pip said joe  and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  she sot down said joe  and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she rampaged out pip  has she been gone long joe  i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock  shes been on the hampage this last spell above five minutes pip shes a coming  get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing mei often served her as a connubial missileat joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg but the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  and last of all pipand this i want to say very serous to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap  i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraigbt on it pip and i hope youll overlook shortcomings there is a subtle indication we may observe of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as mrs joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with dolge orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon j had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me  why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see  its aim orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it biddy again who is mentioned in that extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined poor biddy had kept shop at the village dame school and had taught pip the first mysteries of letters when mrs joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge imperceptibly i became conscious of s change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered she bad not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty snd very good  j it cease ci my urang onay own eyes fan  writing some psssages fros a book lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing biddy observant of what i was about i laid down my pen aad biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down mbiddy said i how do you manage it either i sm very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage i dont knowreturned biddy smiling she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean mort surprising how do you manage biddy said i  to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me  i was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though i hsve no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price  i might as well ass you said biddy  how you mansge    ko because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy  i suppose i must catch itlike a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better tou are one of those biddy said i  who make the most of every chance tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  i was your first teacher though wasnt i   said she as she sewed  biddy   i exclaimed in amazement  why you are crying   no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing  what put that in your head  what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  tes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  ah poor thing  replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  well said i u we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat still more exquisite in the same way is the sketch of that long chat between pip and biddy the connexion of pips great expectations with the great old bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of newgate associations with pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of the skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout we may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to london as an actor pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe when pip becomes a pupil of mr matthew pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils startop and bentley drummle they are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot but mr pumblechook docs nothing it is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash we are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness no other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of great expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,war

the untiring activity of cooper the broad humour of paulding or such sudden bursts of keen vivacious satire as emitted by mrs trollope yet she is held by the transatlantic public with great justice in higher esteem than her american literary competitors her novels are imbued with an irresistible charm the charm of truth and by consequence its neverfailing companionthat of sympathy without the superfine metaphysical process of minutely scrutinising and portraying the secret mechanism the various movements and phases of the human heart miss sedgwick exhibits at once and without seeming effort the  open secret of our affections and impulses in a manner so quietthough not the less unerringas must engage the sympathies of every reader be they ever so homely moreover her characters are evidently not the creations of imagination but actual studies from the great life academy of nature we find in the novel before us no exaggerations of fact in no one instance a departure from probability but an easy calm and no less interesting flow of events presenting a more healthy nay greater source of excitement to the  reading public than the sudden transitions or  remarkable events  embodied by the great  wizard of the north himself the title of the book  sixty years since immediately refers its readers to the commencement of the american struggle for independencea retrospect peculiarly favourable to the novelist and of which the authoress of the linwoods has availed herself judiciously and effectively we shall present our readers with an extract affording a peculiarly favourable specimen of the description of talent we have given miss sedgwick credit for as also one of the easy unobtrusive humour she possesses it describes the parting of eliot lee from his family his village friends and the home of his childhood on starting to volunteer in the cause of his country  a fine black saddlehorse well equipped was at the door little fanny lee stood by him patting him and laying her head with its shining flaxen locks to his side  rover she said with a trembling voice be a good roverwont you  and when the naughty regulars come canter off with eliot as fast as you

would you have eliot killed no indeed but i had rather hed come deused near it than to have him a coward  dont talk so loud sambessie will hear you but the young belligerent was not to be silenced he threw open the dwellingroom door to appeal to eliot himself the halfuttered sentence died away on his lips he entered the apartment fanny followed they gently closed the door drew their footstools to eliots feet and quietly sat down there how instinctive is the sympathy of children how plain and yet how delicate its manifestations  bessie was sitting beside her brother her head on his shoulder and crying as if her heart went out with every sob the youngest boy hal sat on eliots knee with one arm around his neck his cheek lying on bessies dropping tear after tear sighing and halfwondering why it was so  the good mother had arrived at that age when grief rather congeals the spirit than melts it her lips were compressed her eyes tearless and her movements tremulous she was busying herself in

their natural state dashed off their tears and began whispering among themselves miss sally produced from her workbag a comforter for mr eliot of her own knitting which she  trusted would keep out the cold and rheumatism  and she was kindly showing him how to adjust it when she spied a chain of braided hair around his neck ah ha mr eliot a love token she exclaimed   yes it is said little fanny who was watching her proceedings bessie and i cut locks of hair from all the childrens heads and mothers and braided it for him and i guess it will warm his bosom more than your comforter will miss sally  it was evident from the look of ineffable tenderness eliot turned or fanny that he  guessed so too but he nevertheless received the comforter graciously hinting that a lady who had been able to protect her own bosom from the most subtle enemy must know how to defend anothers from common assaults miss sally hemmed looked at master hale muttered something of her not always having been invulnerable and finally succeeded in recalling to eliots recollection a tradition of a lovepassage between miss sally and the pedagogue  a little girl now came trotting in with  grandmothers love and

we have every reason to hope that his future tense will be as perfect as his past  wheugh   exclaimed the major  a pretty long march you have had through that speech   the good schoolmaster quite unruffled proceeded to offer eliot a timeworn virgil and finished by expressing his hopes that  he would imitate caesar in maintaining his studies in the camp and keep the scholar evenhanded with the soldier  eliot charmed the old pedagogue by assuring him that he should be more apt at imitating caesars studies than his soldiership and himself bestowed virgil in his portmanteau of a good lady now stepped forth and seeming somewhat scandalised that as she said  no serious truth had been spoken at this peculiar season she concluded a technical exhortation by giving eliot a pair of stockings into which she had wrought st pauls description of the gospel armour the scripture she feared did not often find its way to the camp and she thought a passage might be blessed as a single kernel of wheat

B729,['8771387'],  norwood or village life in new england by henry ward beecher sampson low son and marston there seems to be a great tendency in american writers of fiction to make the plot dialogue and even characters subservient in a great measure to some leading idea of the authors own mind and this in some degree prevents their novels from doing what is supposed to be their legitimate office namely affording amusement or serving as a relief from graver studies if the amount of amusement derived from the perusal of a novel be given as the test of its worth mr beechers work must be pronounced a failurenot that it is devoid of interest but that the mind is strained too far and dealing as it does with the highest problems which agitate humanity and reasoning high  cf providence foreknowledge will and fate it can hardly be said to afford what we may call mental relaxation this tendency to grapple with the most abstruse doctrinesto rush even in their lighter literature into paths where angels fear to treadmust we suppose be an hereditary gift from those stern and unheeding sectaries who left home and country for the liberty of deciding for themselves on the doctrines of religion and gave to their children the most precious legacya legacy purchased by blood and tearsthe stern and rugged doctrines of the westminster divines in a puritan village of new england and amongst inhabitants most of whose lives are formed and moulded by the teachings of the westminster catechism mr beecher has found ample materials for the construction of such a novel as does not often happen to fall into the reviewers hands in the present day and the grace and play of an imaginative mind relieve it from the charge of heaviness it is perhaps scarcely fair to an author to give a sketch of his plot meagre as of necessity it must bein the present instance particularly sofor the plot is very simple and serves merely to bring together a variety of characters which could hardly be

sense of honour rather than of religion doing right as in the sight of man whilst barton acted as in the sight of god through doubt and severe struggle barton regained the faith of his childhood and religion would remain evermore for him a possession purchased at a great price whilst heywood bred an episcopalian regarded the teachings of that system as fixed as a mathematical axiom he hated much

as characteristic of american manners village life in new england is described with great minuteness and the typical inhabitants of an outoftheway district are portrayed with a distinctness of individuality that deserves the highest praise the characters are not only drawn in lifelike touches by the author but they paint themselves by characteristic remarks and observations as a representation of american inner life we can thoroughly recommend this work of a man who is in his own person a remarkable representative of the public life of america,war
B4358,['3275461'],  cease firg by mary johnston 6s constable taken by itself miss mary johnstons new novel  cease firing may seem a ragged piece of work it is likely at times to perplex a reader unacquainted with the authors last book and some misunderstanding would we think have been prevented if the new volume had been plainly put forward as a continuation of  the long roll it is really the second part of a trilogy which is not yet completed slowly and carefully miss johnston is composing a great panorama of the american civil war taken from an unusual point of view a daughter of the south descended from a famous fighting stock she writes with intense and yet restrained partisanship nevertheless she treats the north with the courteous fairness becoming in a virginian of the old school but sadly lacking in the multitude of modern american novelists who take the popular triumphant side in some respects she is rather more of an historian than a novelist in the fine and important work on which she is now engaged the story in  cease firing  is a mere thread which scarcely connects together all the chapters of the book what miss johnston aims at depicting and succeeds in depicting is the whole life of a dying nation for the south was a nation distinct from the north in manners spirit and tradition and this distinction was the fundamental cause of the civil war properly handled the slavery question might have been settled without an armed conflict for a majority of the planters was inclined to some pacific scheme of emancipation but between the industrial democratic northerners and the agricultural gentry of the south there was a division as deep as that which once separated our puritans and cavaliers  free government says one of the characters in cease firing is founded on the consent of the governed and every community strong enough to establish and maintain its independence has a right to assert it my father fought great britain in defence of that principle but being behind the north in industrial power the planters were at last defeated and broken and it is as a tragic picture of a highspirited people in their day of irretrievable disaster that miss johnstons new work fills and touches the mind it is not an historical novel built from books and deriving all its animating power from the writers imagination the author has woven her fine work out of the living memories of her relatives and friends of the older generation the result is a peculiar vividness of treatment the whole struggle of the south is seen in so intimate a way that the living fighting desperate nation becomes the real hero and the individual figures count for what they represent more than for what they singly are the characterization is always clear and interesting but it is merged in the larger subject,war
B8044,['2450666'],  fiction all our yesterdays by h m tomlinson heinemann 8s 6d this substantial book must we suppose be criticised under fiction though a good deal of it seems like direct memory of fact chosen by the book society for its readers it will put before them one of the best living writers of english it begins with the launching of a great ship a subject in which the author is at his best and he proceeds with the assistance of a few other characters to develop his ironic and disappointed vision of life from the beginning of the twentieth century up to the end of the war we have a row in a musichall a happy tobacco shop with shelves of books which is a haven for the discontented cynically competent journalists including the great harmsworth himself an interior in the slums and another in the drawingroom of the rich it is a slice of real life practical philosophers who think and talk about literature politics and paydays with the racy freedom which does not reach the newspapers before we reach the war one journalist has gone out to tackle the terrors of a lonely jungle and bring supplies to an innocent scientista scheme interrupted by international graft the war section of some 300 pages is finely done but uniformly depressing the world is very wrong for mr tomlinson he sees little good anywhere and hypocritical humbugs in high places typical is his view of the classic mass of st pauls in its immemorial soot with its facings of rainwashed stone as if the chief temple of london was itself a permanent tribute to darkness and was on the point of being absorbed into the power to which it was dedicated it is a pity that our intellectuals have so little belief in england for the english can run themselves down daily without help,war
