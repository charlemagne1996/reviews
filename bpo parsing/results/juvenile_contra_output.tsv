B7193,"['8859500', '8980030']",  the life and works of charlotte bronte and i her sitters with introductions to the  works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co fint notice the true criticism of the work of the sisters bronte ought to present to our imaginations on a general view an aspect at once large and simple it ought to be no more complex than the sight from any vantage point of the famous moors above haworth parsonage or we might add the picture which memory would bear away even after many hours wanderings in those almost classic haunts the journeyings would reveal of course many grim or appealing details unapparent in the general prospect but imagination after we had come south or gone north would but see a great picture synthetic and simple and would have wrought its own sense of the colour and  spirit of the heathlands the deeper essence of the place would still be a secret of nature that knows the meaning of matter and spirit and all their manifestations in the universe so the general features in thoroughgoing bronte criticism will be sheer simple outstanding the details deftly set in subsidiary proportion for charlotte and emily bronte were strange and intense souls and in their books it is the soul  fact that matters true there are a hundred less inspired things let them be quietly touched and passed the great poetic passionate creative stages are elemental and bold easily seen by those that can see and having duly marked them and told their quality criticism has done its broad work it cannot sound their mystery wring out the secret of their inspiration any more than the traveller on the heath can penetrate to the secret below the colour and the lonely beauty of nature mrs humphry ward is sometimes thoughtful in her bronte studies but she also dwells unduly on none too relevant details we could wish on the other hand that she had boldly considered a vital matter that must be settled before the absolute worth of the sisters work in literature or the evolution of literature is satisfactorily determined in her introduction to jane eyre she writes with pardonable gratification of the unquestioned spell exercised today by charlotte brontes novels on the imagination of england but this suggests the important and here unconsidered question whether the reading world on the whole realises what great fiction ought to be whether its general ideal is such that its enthusiasm in the case of miss bronte can be said to be a really critical tribute it is to be feared as a matter of fact that england and the continent have paid more attention to the body than to the spirit in fiction and despite mrs wards high opinion of latterday developments of the novel it is by no means yet certain that it can become a supreme medium of literature a worthy instrument it has been in some instances a noble one we have even seen achievements that have suggested the supreme the novelist in such rare cases showing great soul in action giving embodiment to as we might say spiritual romance indicating in characters and destinies something of the soul above souls vision of the power that  ever accompanies the march of man the general desire however is that he should walk  rationally  upon earth and paint the body and circumstance of his age or another much too muchis expected of him as a delineator of daily manners till often he becomes but the photographer of individuals the autolycus of data that have no more than a transient importance it might almost seem that the great novelist must be a master of two artsthat of revealing spiritual forces permanent passions like a great poet or dramatist and that of imparting imaginative significance to more ordinary actualities the two powersthe interaction of the two worldsmake the true novel to be thus a seer and a convincing delineator of actuality so far as actuality is essential  a keen problem  necessitates vision intuition opportunity aud experience on such a scale that we must needs be modest in our expectations on the score of permanent fiction the vision and the intuition are of the greater importance on their possession and cultivation depends the fact whether fiction can be absolute literature rather than excellent description or analysis or the work as it were of a syndicate of reporters in the service of a 4 time spirit which may not be by any means a true daughter of the eternal if the vision of the sisters bronte sometimes failed them it was uncommon at its best and even as regards their experience or their knowledge of life mrs ward like many critics seems to entertain a too narrow idea the sources of knowledge are subtle as well as obvious knowing the celtic inheritance of the sisters of which more anon their contact with a world of great northern tradition the keen ordeals to which their sensitive spirits were subjected at home and abroad which stirred unimagined forces in their natures and made them critics of life in a higher sense than perhaps is commonly realizedunderstanding all this and more and remembering the subtle ways in which nature and life speak to the chosen mind we may well be chary of complaint as to lack of knowledge in their case it is the soul that matters not the number of miles travelled the number of cities seen in the actual world charlotte bronte has told as she was eminently fitted to tell the ordeals of souls that live alone in more senses than onethe never finished tragedies of deep natures in plain frames her unhappy governesses and teachers are more than governesses and teachers they are types old and new as the passion for sympathy the lack of consideration in any womans sphere and crises and partings journeys and reunions in her pages sometimes seem to tell of people in more mysterious lands and on more mysterious seas than ours they speak of souls rather than bodies faults and crudities of construction in jane eyre and its successorsmatters with which mrs ward deals at length  are sufficiently obvious had charlotte bronte been careful enough or courageous enough to free herself boldly from old theories of plotmaking and other prepossessions her story of the struggle of duty against affinity would have led to truer ordering perhaps almost to real fusion of material but some of her critics strictures on details are scarcely tenable we may not always regard mr rochester so gravely as his creatorhe does not justify himself to the imagination in the way of paul emmanuel but his early talk with jane eyre is scarcely the delectable food for comedy which mrs ward imagines the judgement on the countryhouse party also is much too sweeping without taking sides on the interesting question of governess versus provincial society one may gently urge that a governess of genius in her merciless way would be likely to detect and record an ugly side of thing possessing more or less glamour for the polite it is not really a case of an ignorant governess passing judgement on  high life  it is injured and incisive genius casting critical eyes on humanity socially more favoured but spiritually inferior convention may seek to put her out of court with scorn but the spirit of critical judgment especially after some of miss brontes own stories recorded by mrs gaskell will not be convinced that there may not be a great deal to be urged on the other side it were better no doubt to invoke the comic spirit in the treatment of puch issues but haworth was not meet alas for her airy presence certainly charlotte bronte had not always the happiness of overcoming ordinary prejudices in the gleam of larger vision nor had she the unfailing power of shaping ordinary material to artistic ends as we see in the often delightful and sometimes poetical  shirley the novelist as we have suggested is on occasions hard set to be an artistic interpreter of permanent passion and minute and mobile actuality but it is possible to slip on points of detail to fail now and then in kindling imaginative life in ordinary material and yet to be true again and again in the high hours to what the imagination recognises as aoulfact because charlotte bronte so vividly interpreted soulfact not occasionally but often we know that however fallible at other times she was an eminent novelist mrs ward maintains the interesting but of course by no means novel theory that the genius of charlotte bronte was fundamentally celtic the racial spirit or rather the deep human one as affected in the light and shadow the momentum the environment of a race of changeful fortunes no doubt lives long and works subtly in unconsidered regions and is an attractive if rather tentative study though put to strange uses by extremists too bent on dividing humanity into compartments but leaving temperaments and workaday selves and looking into the souls that live deeply the souls that create permanent literature we feel that they are of no race they know not geographical boundaries as to charlotte bronte and ireland she seemed unable to create aa irish character  the curate malone ia  shirley and the drunken mrs sweeny ia  villette are beneath notice in this regari but it is obviously true that certain qualities well marked in celtic nature and personality are apparent in her work it is te be feared however that mrs ward has tee conventional an idea of celtic characteristics her remarks are a little too suggestive of matthew arnolds lectures on the 4 study ot celtic literaturelectures fruitful in their day and still useful but not founded on a comprehensive acquaintance with even translated gaelic literature and irish or general celtic personality  celtic melancholy is but a halftruth joyousness is the dominant quality of much gaelic literaturejoyousness and n fierce zest of life the theory of though celts love of loneliness seems strange when we know that the idea of contention being  better than loneliness passed into a proverb with one order of celts for the theory of  celtic shrinking from all active competitive existence it would be difficult to find any generai justification ancient or modern nor ds mrs ward convincing when she tries te explain bronte celticism as a growth of the ireland of the north on which commerce and protestantism have set their grasp this although perhaps a popular notion is but another halftruth the catholic and celtic traditions and elements of ulster are in their way outstanding in any case did not the rev patrick bronte come of a south of ireland family mrs wards consideration of the celtic basis of the bronte genius might have been much more interesting had she understood the manysidedness of the real celticism and that the bronte sisters practicality and order were no more alien to it on the whole than their share of the vision that remakes the world were gaelic literature accessible as a whole it would clear away many misconceptions caused by taking it in snatches that concern widely severed years and varying circumstances and give a disconnected and somewhat shadowy idea of the race or races its modern successor angloirish literature does not really display a true grip of later irish realities and political controversy has unfortunately obscured certain verities the celt has dreamed dreams idealised his moors and hills seen visions of hells and heavens that show a dantesque feeling without of course a dantesque art he has realised the tears of things and known at stages the melancholy that for sensitive souls accompanies the fateful trends of life but he framed the elaborate brehon laws and a still more elaborate bardic system pursued philosophic and scholastic ideals with a strange passion and in modern days in more lands than one he has proved his genius as an empirebuilder far from being an elusive creature half within half without existence he has shown at his highest a remarkable grip of both worlds mrs ward did be really know the various aspects of celticism might have profitably considered that phase of it which would appear to have lived a tenacious if halfinscrutable life in emily bronte rather than charlotte yet the critic conscious of the highest reaches of english genius would claim much of hers as peculiar to his own race there is truth on both sides how much of the spiritual the poetic the divine even lies below either racial consciousness seldom coming into being or concrete embodiment  this deeper human subconsciousness so to say carno 10 consciousness in the bronte sisters on their great moors in their yorkshire world of distinctive tradition in the crises of their struggling years it mixed with moods and found outlet in forms in which celt and touton and all men find much of their more passionate selves so when all is said the origins are of natures underlying store the result speaks for and to humanity  the life and works of charlotte bronte and her sisters with introductions to the works by mrs humphry ward 6 vols smith elder  co second notice mus ward inlier introduction to wuthering heights propounds a theory of an appreciable german influence a somewhat liberal infusion of hoffmann and even tieck in emily brontes work it muet be said at once that mrs ward unfortunately does not seem to realise the spirit and the stages of the  german romantic movement some of her views suggest the wild and peculiar conceptions of this german literature against which carlyle protested in a critical essay comparatively early in the century  tieck and hoffmann says mrs ward  are full of raving and lunatic beings who sob shout tear out their hair by the roots and live in a perpetual state of personal violence both towards themselves and their neighbours this to speak mildly is not fair criticism even of hoffmann but how must it be regarded by the student who has a comprehensive knowledge of tieck the whole trend of mrs wards critique is unjust to the german  romantics  at their best to their beauty there is only a casual allusion there is no suggestion of those qualities both grave and humorous in which they are seen to differ decisivelyeven to the merely casual eye from the author of wuthering heights it would appear that mrs wards imagination has dwelled overmuch upon the earlier tieck and on the other hand it is more than doubtful that a mind like emily brontes could ever have been so much impressed as she thinks by the horrors of hoffmann or indeed of his english contemporaries of the school that would  make parnassus a churchyard in fact critics are too apt to exaggerate the  haunting effect of the bowl and dagger book men on the early century we may be sure there was an esoteric english self unimpressed by their terrors monk lewis it is suggestive to remember had no appreciable effect upon the house of commons and the haworth sisters let it never be forgotten had a critical as well as a creative faculty mrs wards theory however will be interesting to the curious who seek for the source and development of genius as distinguished from casual shades and external dyessome of which in emily brontes case were no doubt germanic as some in charlottes were french anywhere but in the mysterious store and order of nature we know from charlotte brontes words and without them should realise the truth that emily bronte the creator the emily bronte who means much to the imagination owed little if anything to literature it lit or shadowed her mind of course as sun or darkness lit or shadowed her moors and heath it did not permeate her spirit or become a second nature with her her distinctive work and that widespread literature which may be regarded as an outcome so to say of the british museum readingroom seem ages asunder in point of date and method all that places her apart owes no more to booklore than the stories woven and rewoven by vigorous brooding minds in the lonely icelandic life to which we are indebted for the procession of the sagas work to which remoteness from common actuality and profound aloof winters gave so often a novel sense and depth of mood by the way there was of course a norse element in yorkshire tradition and one finds it interesting to trace in emily bronte a certain kinship with the sagamen though fancy might easily carry the kinship too far a critic in the athenaum once suggested a decisive relation in emily brontes genius to something far greater than that of german romancowhich of course at its best had some sense of greatness or at least was deeper than a cult more than a mere fashion in fiction  to no less than the genius of dante himself this is a highly interesting question which unfortunatelyat least so far as the present writer knowsthe acute critic has not considered in detail in this connexion and in view of emily brontes celtic ancestry it were profitable to study that celtic visionary spirit which made many infernos before and during dantes day even though they found no comprehensive and powerful artist to shape them into concreteness and permanency there was a potential dante in the racial soul and in truth some sense of it lingera to this day with the celts as to other aspects of the kinship it is not merely fanciful to apprehend a certain dantesque significance in the chief lovers in wuthering heights abandoned to passion in such a degree that it becomes as a great doom catherine in the passionate scene where her cry is that she is heathcliff is no faint reminder of francesca but a dante would not allow a heathcliff or a catherine in hate or love to protest so much the tears and cries doubtless set mrs ward thinking of the minor features of german romance the passion as the forementioned critic recognized runs too much to rhetoric but the concentration not only of speech but of passion which mightnay would surely have come is indicated in a few of emily brontes best poems unfortunately enough in treating of her virtues or defect mrs wardwho holds the theory that  we passionately accept her or we are untouched by herdoes not always employ felicitous figures of speech charlotte bronte touches the shield of the readershe attacks him and complete as his ultimate surrender may be he yields fightingit is still more so with emily this martial stress and circumstance is rather overwhelmingand artificial and  wuthering heights whatever its naivete of construction its signs of inexperience does not suggest the artificial it is like a grim and elemental outcome of nature not meant either for human enjoyment or human opposition it makes us as it were spectators in strange lands where our word counts for nothing we stand by pits of the passions had it been germanmade to the degree mrs ward imagines instead of being virtually a creation of impersonal and independent genius it would not have its on the whole decisive imaginative justification were it possible for emily bronte to have been dominated by book impressions and such casual experiences as her critic supposesin short were she an artist of the receptive ordershe would surely have reproduced more of her overyday life in the manner of anne the frail little one in  agnes grey and more gloomily in  the tenant of wildfell hall or in that of even charlotte in her more porsonal and argumentative moments when the compelling new self was not active emily was too original for that she obeyed that inscrutable and overmastering spirit of imagination which as charlotte said in a well known preface strangely wills and works for itself mr swinburne rightly finds in her  a dark unconscious instinct as of primitive nature  worship  unconscious instinct  contains more essential truth than the germanic dissertation of mrs ward and strangely enough if we may touch again the question of emily brontes ancestry in the oldest known fragment of celtic poetry handed down for hundreds of years in irish tradition there is the unconscious instinct not only of worship of but absolute identification with nature there is a gleam as well as darkness and though suggestion of a fierceness of spirit that the strenuous and conquering emily would have understood and sympathised with readily the singer is  the wind which breathes upon the sea the vulture upon the rocks  the ox of the seven combats  the fairest of plants a wild boar in valour a salmon in the water  a lake in the plaineverything in his sheer primaeval world as emily brontes spirit was everything in the great moorlands the singer before the dawn of celtic history expressed the dark unconscious instinct in the novelist and poet after sophisticated ages nature again stirred and spokethe nature below books and beyond race eventually of course as we see by the later poems the unconscious instinct gave place in some measure to a conscious and considered philosophy this haworth edition contains besides the novels and poems of the sisters and the  cottage poems of their father their portraits and the original titlepages and prefaces in their due places mrs gaskells life with an introduction and notes by mr clement shorter will conclude the series the style of the six volumes

will regard as specialillustrations from photographs of places indicated in the works they are of course interesting in their way though the way is too literal they would bind the genius that speaks for many scenes to too local and particular ones for instance though description of lucy snowe in london is accompanied by a picture of ludgate hill and st pauls cathedral in 1848 the pages have as much to do with ludgate hill of 1828 or 2048 they are concerned with a state of soul much more than with a local habitation,juvenile_contra

the assurance is satisfactory miss braddon indeed remarks in her present work that  the human mind is naturally imitative and the plagiarisms of commerce are infinitely more audacious than the small larcenies of literature but there is so much literature that is merely commerce and there are so many plagiarisms which are anything but small larcenies that it is comforting before opening a novel to be assured that nothing of the kind need be expected we accept the certificate gladly especially as it introduces in the present case a really good novel as novels go  charlottes inheritance though the writing of it is in some parts superior to that in most of miss braddons novelspresents every wellknown characteristic of the aathors manner and adds one to the many tests by which readers have sought to fix her place as a novelist to begin with the story is interesting cleverly planned and leads up to a sufficiently dramatic climax the writing is in this instance careful and quiet there is apparently no effort whatever at characterdrawingthe men and women are blank abstractions serving only to make the story run there is a number of easy slipshod references to classical tales which make some passages look like concentrated telegroph leaders or boileddown lempriere there is an affected acquaintance with french idioms which takes the form of giving an exact english equivalent for familiar french phrases what is the object for instance in rwriting such a speech as this i and the young monsieurthat one who died in rouen the poor ah that he was kind that he was gracious what of tears what of regrets when the old chased him this nonsense is unintelligible to readers who do not know french while those who do see that it is in no sense a translation of the french original any more than suchl a ridiculous rendering as  that goes without saying indeed in her anxiety to show her knowledge of french miss braddon has rather maltreated her english as when she says there is sympathy between we others students of miss braddon however have taught themselves to regard little beyond the plot of her stories and they have reaped the reward that generally recompenses moderated hopeswhen miss braddon has a good plot she can produce an excellent story and if the interest she excites is not of a very intellectual kind it must be remembered that to be able to excite interest at all is a great virtue in a modern novel 1 charlottes inheritance opens with a little lovestory of the previous generation the scene of which is laid in france this introductory episode is really very charmingly doneis very tender very touching and very french it reads like one of henri miraers slighter sketches and in the case of susan meynell miss braddon has almost succeeded in drawing a character whose personality remains with us after the story is ended this susan meynell is an english girl who has been ruined by an english nobleman she is left in paris and is saved from committing suicide by one gustave lenoble who has fallen deeply in love with her the intense abandonment of his affection and the regard it awakens in her for him are gracefully and delicately indicated and altogether the story of these two hapless lovers assures us that miss braddon has the chsrlottes inheritance a novel by the author of  lady auks ey secret london ward lock  tyler capability of producing better and truer wvork than she has hitherto done when we leave this preliminary tale and come to the main plot of the book we find all the old stagebusiness and hackneyed grouping of impossible characters with which modern fiction has made us familiar we immediately plunge into the mystery of an occult inheritance a search for missing relatives and all the trickeries which one villain of the approved stamp opposes to the trickeries of another villain of similar generic qualities the inheritance as the title tells us is charlottes at least so charlottes stepfather a speculator in the city persuades himself now stepfatbers and stepmothers are said to be cruel as a rule but this stepfather is a monster of wickedness for he straightway proceeds to poison poor charlotte it is not his first essay in that way he has already poisoned charlottes father and then married the wife of the man he murdered and although three persons are cognisant of his crime no one of them has opened his or her lips about it charlottewho is rather inaccurately described as i rose of the garden garden of girls is beloved by one valentine halwkehurst a vague young journalist who stalks through the story like a ghost in a dream charlotte gradually becomes paler and weaker no one knows what is the matter with her for her father iisists upon her taking from day to day some port wine which he has got specially for her this is quite as effective a way of poisoning as that adopted in  the hidden ifand  but it is less suggestive of dramatic scenes at last valentine hawkehurst lights upon the doctor who attended charlottes father when he was being poisoned and his conscience now forces him to confess the pyevious secret and aid valentine in averting the second crime he excuses his silence on the ground that had he brought a charge against the poisoner it would have been difficult to prove and that had it not been proved he would have been ruineda theory which will probably be gravely accepted by the ordinary reader of novels the guardian of the heroine of  the hidden hand  and valentine hawkehurst are now placed in the same predicamentthey must combat the poisoner without resorting to open defiance he secures the services of an old nurse who never sleeps and intrusts to her the duty of seeing that the stepfather is not allowed to get near the medicines here we have no great baronial hall with a gloomy curtain brilliant moonlight and pretty miss foot looking very pale and anxious but a bedrooom in bayswater the ancient nurse sitting by the bedside and gas burning dimly on the landing outside the clock strikes two as the poisoner slips upstairs and enters his stepdaughters room the nurse stares up at him  with unwinking eyes and refuses to let him look at the girls medicine in such a tone as to convince him that she knows of his former crime he threatens to turn her out of doors if she will not show him the medicine but she is firm and he retires growling finally they tell him that charlotte has died and he forthwith goes into the city to raise some money on certain insurance policies effected on her life but charlotte instead of having died has been quietly withdrawn from the house and married to valentine hawkehurst when the stockbroker learns this fact and that the policies are in consequence valueless to him there is nothing left for him but to disappear in order to escape the inevitable exposure and disgrace brewing for him in the city this properly is the dramatic end of the story but miss braddon devotes another halfvolume to tracing the consequences of the detnotnzaent the inheritance after all does not fall to charlotte but belongs to the son of that gustave lenoble of whom we have beard and this son marries charlottes bosom friend diana paget charlotte and valentine however are very content and having established themselves in a house near wimbledon are enjoying a christmas party when the old stockbroker having returned from abroad crawls up to the front garden and dies among the snow such is the skeleton of miss braddons story and it is draped with much modest and effective writing unnecessary and hazy allusions to greek fables and an occasional pious reflection miss braddon too goes out of her way to have a fling at her critics and like everybody else who resents plain speech she labours hard to convince her reader that she has a lofty contempt for it and that she considers those critics who do not call her a george sand or a george eliot to be a worthless and inhuman race if miss braddon would concentrate her efforts upon a tale similar to that which is suggested in the preliminary story of susan meynell and gustave lenoble and leave private detectives lost inheritors and reckless poisonings to transpontine dramatists we think the critics would moderate the rancour of that unreasoning envy with which she gracefully credits them  charlottes inheritance a novel new

introduction to the drama which follows the rest of the novel seems to have been put together for though stage and with an eye to effects it is an extremely disagree able story and it has nothing to redeem i its coarse reality it is left naked bare and ugly without even the mellowing touch of time to disguise its harsh and sordid hideousness miss braddon has chosen and adapted the facts of two notable poisoning cases one of them that of wainwright a literary man of lome note in his day wno wrote under the signature of  janus weathercock he insured the lives of his wifes two sisters and then slowly poisoned them by a process which at that time was not generally known the other trial is that of palmer for poisoning his friend by whose bedside he watched the progress of his own work a novel founded on a case of poisoning in mediaeval italian or french history has a certain romance of time place costume and of the imagination which delights in the now departed mysteries of lonely castles subterranean passages winding stairs drawbridges c with the lively alternations of feasts fights and raasqued balls and prince cardinals and picturesque peasants for the characters all these accessories disguise the prosaic ugliness of crime and make it at least pleasanter to read about in a novel j but miss braddon has exercised no choice or  selection the crimes of the elder sheldon are

swindling bullying cheating and overreaching are the only feelings brought into play the reader who is not acquainted  with the preceding novel birds of prey will j have to pick up the information

their applicability to modem times fills one with wondering mr grisets illustrations are altogether in keeping with the text sir richard burton translated freely he acknowledges  to remedy the conciseness of their language and certainly he gave them an attractive form  vikram and the vampire or tales of hindu devilry  adapted by richard f burton frgs c london  longmans green and co 1870 christmas is the time to welcome old friends with new faces but it is a question whether mr burtons adaptation of the baitalpachisi or twentyfive tales of a vampire which first appeared in fraser should not rather be described as an attempt not altogether welladvised to pour the new wine of western criticism and humour into the old bottle of oriental invention w7ith the exception of a few modern and altogether foolish jokes such as  i love my love with an s because hes stupid and not psychological which do not harmonise with the ingenious paraphrases of hindu eloquence the book is decidedly amusing there are no weird horrors like those in the story of grettir and glam and the vampire himself is a goodtempered and rather engaging demon who executes the will of fate by slipping through raja vikrams fingers and having to be recaptured every time the raja is seduced into giving an opinion on the merits of one of the true stories which he relates in succession these are of varying interest and complexity the worst being the only one literally translated  but in the others it is easy to distinguish by internal evidence the modern gloss from the original framework of the tale the episode of the apple of life in the introduction is one of those which found their way from oriental collections into the gesta romanortttn and the vampires third story contains the rudiments of the favourite german character der getreue johannes the fifth story which recalls portions of the forty thieves suffers from the editors attempt to give the modern equivalent for the lingo of the hindu scripture chanriyavidya or thieves manual the best illustration belongs to the seventh story and represents a quadrupedfrankenstein a supernatural tiger destroying the wagners who created him  but it is one of the incongruities of style before complained of to make the guru  a physiologicophilosophicopsychologicomaterialist a jayasthalian who had become convinced  that the fundamental form of organic being is a globule having another globule within itself the problem which finally poses king vikram is to find the relationship between the children of a father and son who have married a daughter and mother but this is introduced by a pseudoprophetic description of the white outcasts who will one day conquer india which is not much better than is common to this hackneyed form of satire the chief use of the volume besides dispelling unpleasant associations with the name of vampire will be to familiarise the run of readers with hindu methods of thought and expression and to show the tie of aryan brotherhood strong through all superficial discrepancies m octave feuillet could not improve upon  no one knows the ways of woman  she kills her husband and becomes a sati suttee

taits of hindu de vii ry adapted by richard f burton with illustrations longmans  co it is somewhat strange that the indian tales entitled  the twentyfive stories of baital and the thirtytwo stories of the throne have not become better known in europe the baital pacbisi and singhasan battlsf such are their indian names are household words in hindustan they truly reflect the customs and superstitions of the hindus and they contain some poetical touches and a great deal of capital horror of the monk lewis and der freischutz school sometimes there is an approach to pathos as in the story of the rajput family who devoted themselves for raja rupsen their chief excellence however is in the description of lonely cemeteries and incantationscenes which latter are quite equal to that where the wild huntsman of the hartz mountains makes his appearance capt burton therefore has a theme of some promise in its peculiar way and he is the man to make the most of it but it is time to explain the meaning of baital pachii vetiilab in sanskrit is a sprite or goblin haunting cemeteries and inhabiting dead bodies in hindi the word is baital such a being is the narrator of the twentyfive tales which have become one of the popular storybooks of india and the way he is brought on the stage is as follows  the father of vikram king of ujjain a city in central india has incurred the resentment of one of those hindu saints who seem never to be aroused from their heavenly meditations except to deliver an anathema on their fellow men gandharbasena vikrams father is cursed by the saint and dies and the saint then plots the destruction of vikram he is the more confirmed in his design as it so happens that vikram who is the indian king arthur was born at the same astrological period as the saint as was a third individual the son of an oilman who in some way we are not told how but probably by penance obtains though sovereignty of the infernal regions and fate has decreed that whichever of the three can murder the other two will become a universal monarch the saint who by the by is the son of a potter murders the oilman and suspends his corpse in a cemetery head downwards from a tree where it becomes the abode of a baital or demon the saint then comes to vikram in the shape of a handsome young merchant presents the king with rubies of inestimable value and asks him to attend a sacrifice which he is about to make to durga the goddess of carnage intending when vikram prostrates himself before the goddess to strike off his head vikram however has been warned of the treacherous design by a giant whom he had defeated in single combat he goes to the sacrifice with his son and is told by the ascetic to bring the oilmans corpse from the cemetery where it hangs in spite of horrible apparitions which are sent to deter him vikram cuts down the corpse when the demon who inhabits it tells him he will consent to go with him only on condition of his not speaking he then tells the king as he is carrying him twentyfive tales and at the end of each puts a question so artfully that vikram is twentyfour times betrayed into answering whereupon the corpse slips from his grasp and resumes its hanging posture in the tree at last when the twentyfifth story is told vikram maintains silence and the demon now instructs him when he is commanded by the saint to prostrate himself to request his holiness to show him how to do so and to strike off the head of the ascetic as soon as he bends baitiil then departs from the corpse which vikram carries to the saint whom he decapitates as directed capt burton has selected the first second third fourth sixth ninth tenth thirteenth fourteenth twentyfirst and twentyfifth stories and of these he has translated the tenth literally and the rest freely his eighth story which corresponds to the twentyfirst of the hindi is largely supplemented and there is among the insertions an excellent account of hindu philosophy capt burton makes no mention in his preface of a former translation of the  baital pachisi by mr burckhard barker which was edited by mr eastwick in 1855 we will only further observe with regard to the note at page 36 that persia is one of the countries in which a hog is stabled with horses to avert calamity from them at page 41 we suppose witches should be read for bears as da in is

in invention and fancy it is desirable  to direct these faculties into a profitable channel it  five old friends and a young prince by the author of  a story of elizabeth witt illustrations smith elder  co the five old friends of this fresh and delightful book are the stories of the sleeping beauty in the wood cinderella beauty and the beast little red riding hood and jack the giantkiller but original thought and delicate literary manipulation have so completely changed the faces of these ancient friends and have imbued them with so many qualities of fancy and feeling of head and heart that whilst it is sometimes difficult to recognise in their actors the favourite heroes and heroints of childhoods romance it is still more difficult to state precisely in a few words how far they resemble and in what respects they differ from the narratives of which they are transformations a general and sufficiently exact notion of the authors aim and method may however be given by saying that she presents the moral lessonsor rather what her humorous vision apprehends as the moral lessonsof the old stories in a series of papers which combining the properties of the moral essay with those of the modern domestic novel preserve just enough of the incidents and characters of the original tales to remind the reader how beauty was found sleeping in the wood and how all the other personages of the marvellous legends accomplished the parts assigned to them in their respective dramas the wood of q the nursery story is changed into a dreary j w mansion in a stagnant district of a dull a english shire and its beauty is a heavyeyed nervous shy young woman who has been reared under a score of stupefying influences by an austere mamma and a mournful governess so that she enters her sixandtwentieth year with scarce a tithe of the intelligence and none of the joyousness appropriate to a person of her age and rank  a great many people observes the author moralising on poor cecilia lulworths education  think there is nothing in the world so good for children as scoldings whippings dark cupboards and dry bread and water upon which they expect them to grow up into tall fat cheerful and amiable young men and women and a great many people think that for grownup young people the silence the chilliness the monotony and sadness of their own fading i  twilight days is all that is required mrs lui j r worth and maria bowley her companion j s cecilias late governess were quite of this j t opinion they themselves when they were  c little girls had been slapped snubbed locked  s up in closets thrust into bed at all sorts of hours flattened out on backboards set on high stools to play the piano for days together made to hem frills five or six weeks long and to learn immense pieces of poetry so that they had to stop at home all the afternoon but though mrs lulworth had grown up stupid suspicious narrowminded soured and overbearing and had married for an establishment and miss bowley her governesss daughter had   turned out nervous undecided melancholy and j  anxious and had never married at all yet they i determined tobringup ceciliaasthey themselves  had been brought up and sincerely thought t they could not do better so poor cecilia is i drilled and stultified by unsympathetic treatment till she becomes a torpid creature whose life is nothing more vivid than one long sleep until her prince in the shape of a jolly and slightly impudent cousin wakes her up with a startling kiss whereupon after the wont of children abruptly roused from their slumbers she bursts out acrying at the dazzling daylight  such a thing never happened in all my life before said cecilia  i know it is wrong to cry but reallyreally but cecilia never relapsed into her old unconsciousness of the beauty and brightness of life for cousin charlie married her and she turned out a happy wife and mother cinderella is retold excellently and with greater closeness to the original story than any of the three following tales the ella of the new is no less exemplary and charming than the cinderella of the old version and capital fun does the reproducer make of ellas

and julia of whom we are told that they  grew up into two great tall fashionable bouncing young ladies they pierced their ears turned up their pigtails and dressed very elegantly the dreadful narrative of little red riding hood is converted into a fresh and abundantly humorous lovestory the heroine of which finds her wolf in a suitable lover who devours without destroying her after he has gratified his natural voraciousness by gobbling up all her grandmammas objections to their marriage but the history on which the most labour has been expended is the record of jack the giantkiller who in the service of the church militant as country curate and subse quently as country rector does valiant battle with ignorance and poverty and gigantic evils arising from the laws delay or the laws abuse humorous literature seldom gives us anything droller or more just in the way of kindly satire than the portraitures of miss moineaux and miss triquett who gather subscriptions to thc fund for presenting the rev john trevithic with a teapot and strainer when these zealous spinsters have pushed their way into the narrators lodgings at sandsea they both sat down very politely as people do who are utter strangers to you and about to ask you for money of course the sum required for jacks teapot was raised and when it was inspected by subscribers at the silversmiths in cockspur street  it was a very handsome teapot as ugly as other teapots of the florid order and the chief peculiarity was that a snake grasped by a clenched hand formed the handle arid a figure with bandages on its head was sitting on the melon on the lid this was intended to represent an invalid recovering from illness for the particulars of jacks brave doings in the cause of workhouse reform in the face of opposition at home and slanderous calumnies out of doors readers must refer to the text which in places reminds us of what was strongest and most pleasant in the  roundabout papers  five old friends and a young prince it was mr james hannay who said concerning the genius of thackeray one of the best of all the things which that large  five old friends aii a youon prince by the author of the story of elizabetb c with four fliustrations by fr erick walker london smith eidcr  co topic has called forth in the way of criticism nawely that the great novelists mind had within it an ioipluvitum of poetry which kept it fresh though it contained no mighty fountain of song a more felicitous metaphor does not often occur and it might be used in speaking of the writings of the author of the story of elizrbeth she cannot be called an unworldly writer she has the same kind of quiet sagacity as her illus trious father her common sense wvorks in her writings as his did in his with all the fmrce if not with all the dignity of fate she is essentially of her time and always writing with the quiet pronounced accent of an english gentlewoman of the latest social culture and the highest social opportunities and yet the impluvitun of poetry is there it would be an interesting task to trace the movement of the qualities of air thackerays genius feniinized if such an ugly word may be pardoned to us in that of the fascinating writer whose book is now before us the vein of poetry in the daughter dips more towards those facts and influences which we are accustomed to sum up under the word nature than it did in the father it seems to us though the point is no doubt an open one that the cord of common sense is drawn tighter in her writings than in his not only weak minds but minds with a certain kind of force in them may occasionally feel as if the blood was ready to spurt under the constriction mr thackeray himself often made his readers or some of them feel like that in reading the writings of his daughter the same class of readers feel it none the less because her manner is so quiet again mr thackeray always impressed his readers as being distinctly qf the world he painted so wonderfullyyou could guess his position culture and social environment and it appears to us that as was to be expected you can do this with still more certainty in the case of the lady it may seem a necessary thing in the nature of the case that an english gentlewoman should write like one but except as to points of abstinence it is not so a good book does not necessarily give you the remotest hint of its authors social status or training a book of george eliots does not the best of mrs gaskells books do not all mr trollopes do and we are quite sure that the fact where it exists tends to limit an authors audience the bulk of mankind who are outside of the circle of a certain social culturewe were going to say cultfeel puzzled when its existence appears to be assumed as the necessary point on which to rest the imaginative lever one quality which mr thackeray possessed in a high degree that of the poetic naivetgis possessed in certainly not a less degree by the author of the story of eiizabeth it must be called a high quality for though its use on any large scale implies a certain humorous selfconsciousness it is distinctly affiliated to the simplicity of genius and no writer ever showed it consciously in his works who had it not in so great a degree that it also showed itself unconsciously in his life in the very beautiful stories now before us we have at the basis of the work the same kind of faculty as that which produced  prince giglio and prince bulbo  but while the hypo thesis on which the work is supposed to restnamely the natural origination and indestructibility of may we say fairyismmight prepare you to expect that large licence of fancy would be taken there is none taken at the same time the glamour or delicate threat of glamour is so well kept hanging over the readers head that he would not be surprised at the most im probable thing in the world let us suppose that we had all been accustomed to hear fairy tales recited or played by a fairyfied storyteller in a peculiar voice with peculiar gestures and with peculiar music between the acts then let us suppose somebody comes to us and adopting or gliding into the voice and maniere d6tre of the fairyfied reciter and repeating the music exactly proceeds to tell us stories of everyday life that is exactly what the author of these tales does and we feel ready to be tripped up at any moment by a touch of the old wand though the scene is laid in sussex or in brompton we are decidedly of opinion that the introduction with its theory of the natural indestructibility of the fairy tale is a mistake the effect would have been complete without this uncovering of the imaginative basis of the work or if not it might with a little labour have been made so that readers of the

B3201,"['3211297', '2445410']",  the white monkey art resembles love in many ways and not least in thisthat the most complete capitulation may be the most complete conquest when a character created by a novelist imposes his wrill upon his creator the creator wins and this is what has happened to mr galsworthy it was in these columns a year ago that i wrote  mr galsworthy wanted to make soames unlovable but soames is not at all unlovable that in face of the general opinion about  the forsyte saga was a paradox but here is a sequel to  the forsyte saga and my paradoxas happens to most paradoxes if you leave them long enoughhas became a platitude before mr galsworthy while apparently with his conscious mind vilifying soames and everything that soames stood for was yet somehow compelled by artistic integrity by direct inspiration by subconscious inclination or by whatever else vou choose to call that divine something which shapes the ends of books to give soames the credit for distinction of mind and nobility of character the unintentional irony was indeed complete for in the conflict in which the saga terminated the conflict over the mutual love of fleur and jon it was soames the  man of property who behaved with sense unselfishness and generosity it was the champions of light and liberty who behaved with malignant and indeed inconceivable egotism and in  the white monkey which tells the result of that conflict and of its solutionor rather of the failure to solve itsoames at last comes openly into his own his merits seem to have risen above the threshold of his creators consciousness and are accepted golden in the light of day he is the one wholly sympathetic and admirable character in the book and perhaps it is because the presumable struggle between mr galsworthys impulse and his intention is over that the new story has an effect of lightness and clearness and at the same time of hardness and solidity like a jewelan effect which was certainly lacking in its sombre and powerful predecessors a sequel is always expected to be a failure but here is one which is a triumphant success 1 am inclined to think it is the best novel mr galsworthv has ever writtenand that is saying a good deal it has many faults but they do not matter much so great is the force of the work considered as a whole it will be remembered that  to let the concluding section of the saga proper ended with a marriage and a funeralthe marriage of fleur soamess daughter to young michael mont the funeral of the almost prehistoric timothy in  the white monkey soames fleur and michael are in the centre of the picture but neither fleur cold and restless in the disappointment of her love and her marriage with a  secondbest nor michael charming and chivalrous and inconclusive is drawn as surely as some of the minor charactersas for instance aubrey greene the artist who occurs only casually and briefly fleur is tempted to try for  experience and engages in a dangerous flirtation with wilfrid the sardonic poet her theory is that as she cannot have love she   the white monkey by john galsworthy 7s 6d net heinemann may as well have sensation but she is not  modem  enough to carry the theory into practice and anyway her immediate perplexities are shelved one cannot say solved by the opportune arrival of a baby michael is a publisher and this gives scope for some excellent satire of contemporary fashions it also provides a link with the subplot the story of bicket who is a packer for michaels firm and is dismissed for stealing he steals to get nourishing foods for his sick wife and she when she has recovered becomes an artists model to get money for him so that they can emigrate and be happy she conceals her method of raising money as he conceals his of course there is suspicion discovery and final reconciliation but this whole subplot is unnecessary and unreal on the other hand another complicating thread of excitement provided by soamess seat on the board of directors of a speculative insurance business is artistically relevant and most admirably handled nobody does directors meetings or shareholders meetings like mr galsworthy he does them very often but not too often for he makes them both thrilling and funny indeed the book is rich throughout in thrills and fun in sheer narrative energy it is amazing and the writing is of the finest galsworthy stampwith one or two almost incredible lapses how in the world does a writer of his stature and of his conscientiousness come to say that a thing  became almost a

has held it does not appear yet as he remembers attending the funeral of his aunt more than fifty years ago we can conclude that the air of the vicarage of bray is still favourable to longevity mr austenleighs recollections of miss austen are somewhat scanty the impressions left upon the mind of seventy by the persons known at eighteen can hardly be otherwise when the favourite aunt jane of boyhood has developed after death into an admirable painter of character wheii the works which were treated half contemptuously by friends and indifferently by the public have become classics there is necessarily a greater gulf than can be measured by years all we learn of miss austen is that she was attractive in her appearance that she had a charming animated face which is faithfully reflected in the portrait prefixed to this volume and that she was a delight to children particularly to her nephews and nieces her tastes and habits were simple and homely she was not accomplished according to the present standard of accomplishments but her modesty was almost as conspicuous as her genius when we add that there were no events in her life that she was never married nor asked in marriage that she lived in total seclusion from literary society and neither knew nor corresponded with any contemporary authors we have given a summary of the materials out of which mr austenleigh has constructed this volume that he has made a pleasant sketch is under the circumstances much to his credit aud the glimpse we have of miss austen will add to the charm of her novels we have said that her personal characteristics may be summed up in a few lines not much more is told of her method of composition she wrote on a little mahogany desk in the general sittingroom where all the rest of the family were occupied and where she was liable to constant disturbance readers of  northanger abbey will remember her modest account of her own powers  the little bit two inches wide of ivory on which i work with so fine a brush as produces little effect after much labour but of this labour we hear scarcely anything it seems indeed that miss austen began to write when almost a child that before the date of her first published work she composed several tales not without merit but which she considered unworthy of publication and that  pride and prejudice was written when she was only twentyone in one of her letters she speaks of having lopt and cropt at this novel so successfully a3 to make it shorter than  sense and sensibility which though written later was published sooner something further might surely be obtained by referring to her papers many of these mr austenleigh says have been destroyed by her family but we infer from another part of his book that there are some remaining as it is internal evidence is sufficient to show that in the midst of family distractions miss austen worked up her novels to a high degree of finish currer bell speaks of this characteristic while professing herself unable to understand why miss austen was so much admired sir walter scott writes apropos of  pride and prejudice on his third perusal of it  the big bowwow strain i can do myself like any now going but the exquisite touch which renders ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and sentiment is denied to me what a pity such a gifted creature died so early it is a still greater pity that she met with no such appreciation as this during her life her first novel was offered to a publisher and declined by return of post the manuscript ofnorthan ger abbey was sold to a bookseller in bath for 10 and remained in his drawer for some fifteen years miss austen herself collected some of the opinions expressed by the reading public of her day and was much amused by their diversity one lady called  mansfield park a mere novel while another said its language was poor and there was nothing interesting in the characters one gentleman read the first and last chapters of emma but did not look at the rest because he had been told that it was not interesting while a lady pronounced  sense and sensibility  and  pride and prejudice downright nonsense how remarkably these opinions contrast with the judgement of macaulay who as his sister lady trevelyan informed mr austenleigh  proposed to write a memoir of miss austen with criticisms on her works to prefix it to a new edition of her novels and from the proceeds of the sale to erect a monument to her memory in winchester cathedral perhaps the most significant illustration ofthe difference between contemporary neglect and posthumous fame is to be found in the remark of the verger at winchester cathedral who was asked to show her grave  pray sir he said  can you tell me whether there was anything particular about that lady so many people want to know where she was buried almost the only tribute paid to miss austen while she was alive came from a quarter where we should least expect it the prince regent was so fond of her novels that he read them often had a set of them at each of his residences and accepted a dedication from her of his own accord his librarian too gave miss austen hints of which she could not avail herself at one time she was requested to take a clergyman of the type of beatties minstrel for her hero at another to write an historical romance illustrative of the august house of coburg in reply she avowed herself the most unlearned and uninformed female who ever dared to be an authoress  i must keep she said  to my own style and go on in my own way and though i may never succeed again in that i am convinced that i should totally fail in any other with all her apparent diffidence it is clear that she must have been more or less conscious of her success we see this partly in her criticism of other writers partly in her boast that she attempted to create rather than to reproduce it is a high tribute to one who did not go beyond her own sphere of life for events and characters who said in a letter that three or four families in a country village are the very thing to work on that her own relations never recognised any portraits in her novels mr austenleigh says that this was not owing to lack of opportunity for several of her acquaintances had the most tempting peculiarities and laid themselves open to caricature it certainly was not owing to want of power as we may see amongst other things from the plan of a novel according to hints from various quarters which was left amongst her papers the piece is too long to quote but its quie comedy is delicious what miss austen thought of the higher class of contemporary novels appears from the following allusion to waverley  walter scott has no business to write novels  especially good ones it is not fair he has fame and profit enough as a poet aud ought not to be taking the bread out of other peoples mouths i do not mean to like  waverley if i can help it but i fear i must i am quite determined however not to be pleased with mrs s should i ever meet with it which i hope i may not i think i can be stout against anything written by her i have made up my mind to like no novels really but miss edgeworths es and my own the pleasant appreciative irony of this passage is thoroughly characteristic of miss austen she makes herself forget for a time that her own novels have put very little bread into her mouth that she has always spoken in the humblest tone of their merits she adopts the pedestal of an aggrieved author preparing to be driven out of the field by a new comer and looking forward woefully to loss of fame and profit her real feelings on this point were as her biographer tells us cheerful and contented she received 1501 from the sale f  sense and sensibility and considered it a prodigious recompense for that which had cost her nothing it is something that miss austens genius was sufficient for herself that she was ready to delight others without caring for a reward and that she shed abroad the gifts of her bright sunny nature and never paused to ask whether they were appreciated  a memoir of jane austen c1     by her nephew j e austen leiili    j i uien xeigiu second edition to which is added lady susan and fragments o two other unfinished tales london  bentley and son in obedience to the unanimous demands of his critics both public and private mr austen leigh has now produced from the family storehouse nearly all the fragments of his aunts compositions which might reasonably be supposed to be of general interest we say nearly all because he has not published  exictso the first twelve chapters of the work on which she was engaged at the time of her death neither has he had thc courage to produce even a specimen of the many half burlesque stories written when she was little more than a child the editor is perhaps right in avoiding everything that might bear the appearance of bookmaking but our faith in his judgement is rather shaken by his having waited for encouragement from without before introducing us to lady susan and the watsons the latter fragment is quite in miss austens best manner and as it was begun in 1804 or 1805 it is not easy to account for its having been laid aside the scene is laid at the usual countrytown and the story begins with a ball where the heroine humanely dances with a little boy whose uncle we gather was ultimately to marry her the watsons are the bennets with a difference that is instead of a clever elizabeth and an amiable jane we have a goodnatured but vulgar elder sister and a heroine who is only wellbred and sensible while the other sisters are quarrelsome and underbred instead of fast and silly in miss austens hands there was therefore no danger of the work turning out a repetition of pride and prefttdice and we must therefore suppose that she was not satisfied with the plan of the story or perhaps strange as it may seem that she could not get on comfortably without a leading idea of some sort or a moral to be enforced and of this there was certainly so far no sign with lady susan the case is very different it is a study rather than a novelette and a study which there was more originality in making fifty years ago than now when dangerous heroines are so much in vogue we need scarcely say that there is no sensationalism in miss austens sketch of such a character and that she keeps strictly within the limits not merely of the possible but of the real her lady susan is a clever and attractive woman far too sensible to murder anybody and not likely even to figure in the divorce court at the same time thoroughly unprincipled but fortunately without the quite miraculous powers of deception with which later novelists would have enriched her thus it happens that the young man who is to marry her daughter escapes from her snares before it is too late while we are free to suppose that the young man whom she marries herself will be tormented and perhaps ruined but probably not poisoned or otherwise made away with the story is written in the form of letters but though that device s very well suited to a subject which turns more upon revelations of character than on incident we have not time in ninety pages to feel at home with six or seven different correspondents to the memoir itself mr austen leigh has been able to add a few more of his aunts letters of the same general character as those already published and a categorical assurance that anne elliot and fanny price were in no sense whatever the fruit of personal experience on the contrary we are told that jane declined one suitable offer in her youth and though a favourite sister thought that she might have been persuaded to marry a gentleman whom they met at the seaside if he had lived to ask her so remote a possibility cannot be supposed to have affected her subsequent happiness the cancelled chapter of persuasion in which anne and captain wentworth come to an understanding is far inferior to the one in the published work and perhaps all the more on that account helps to raise our opinion of the writer by showing that judgement had a share in her successes as well as inspiration in the first draught the eclaircissemcnt was brought about by the admirals blundering and everything was arranged so easily ind naturally that the result was rather tame the captains letter written on the spur of the moment in a crowded room gives a far more heroic turn to the conclusion though it is only in real life or miss austen that so slight an incident could pass for an event as the illustrations which accompanied the first edition of the memoir are not reproduced in the second the editor should have withdrawn the allusion p 83 to  the likeness prefixed to this volume h lawrenny  a memoir of jane austen by her nephew a j e austenleigh to which is added r lady susan and fragments of uvo other un finished tales by miss austen london saturday july io 1871 1  e literature  bentley   son a humorous critic once divided the world of letters into those who admired and those who did not admire jane austens novels nor is this fantastic division entirely without some show of reason it places on the one hand all who have the love of art for arts own sake irrespective of sentiment passion or romance it ranges on the other those who care only for art as it calls out or illustrates a certain class of feelings or ideas now of all novelists miss austen is the very last to excite any intense interest from the subjects she chooses there are no highflown characters and but little scope for imagination in her stories she is a dutch painter dealing with familiar homely scenes and very ordinary people  but then how admirable her touches and how true the picture  give her a group of commonplace men and women in a stupid english village and her art makes them all alive and we count them henceforth among our own friends and acquaintances it is an art which seems half marvellous it is like that of the great french cook who wanted only an old kid glove out of which to make the most exquisite of volauvents but the great literary artists are her warmest admirers southey declared her more true to nature than any other of his age macaulay proposed to write her life and reedit all her novels coleridge was loud in her praise and guizot speaks of the pleasure he owed to her sir walter scott asserted that she  had a talent for describing the involvements and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful i ever met with but we have still stronger because quite unconscious testimony to the hold these novels have taken on very cultivated and gifted minds without a trace of plagiarism without a thought of imitation on their part we see the impression which miss austen has left on novelists as unlike herself as well can be they may probably have never remembered at the time nor ever suspected afterwards how much they were indebted to her but nevertheless the debt must have been incurred did any one ever read  the small house at allington and fail to recall at once barton cottage in  sense and sensibility   there is the park and there is the great housethere are the widow and the two girlsthere is the lovemaking and the faithless lover the surroundings of the story are the same and much of the story itself a still more striking illustration is furnished by lady georgiana fullerton never could two writers less resemble each other than the  author of emma and the author of grantley manor they are unlike in style in temper in motive the one is a restrained and careful artist quickly working out her subject with no purpose beyond it the other is an earnest impulsive writer who has aims quite independent of the evolution of the story itself the impressions left by the two novels are entirely different and yet who can believe apart of course from some distinct denial that  grantley manor would ever have been written had  emma never been read  there are differences and contrasts enough but the main thread of the story is precisely the same when emma receives jane fairfax into the house and more than half falls in love with frank churchill then finds out the mysterious understanding between her lover and her friend and finally marries old mr knightley as the best thing left for her to do she is but rehearsing the part which falls to margaret in the later novel there jane fairfax becomes ginevra edmund neville takes the place of frank and old walter steps in at the right moment to marry the young heroine turning now to the book before us we need not speak about miss austens life of which the first part consists as we reviewed it when it first came out it has now been enlarged and improved and though still somewhat slight is well and pleasantly written but the real interest of this volume consists in the unpublished fragments of jane austens writings there is a chapter ofpersuasion which was afterwards cancelled there are the first rough notes of the story she was writing when she died there is a short but complete story lady susan which is believed to have been an early production lastly there is the unfinished beginning of a novel to which the editor has given the name of  the watsons of course these fragments must be taken for what they are worth it was a natural wish on her nephews part that nothing of his aunts writing should be lost and so he has gathered together what he could but the responsibility is his alone and as he says censure if any  must fall on him who put it forth not on her who kept it locked up in her desk certainly jane austen would never have allowed anything incomplete or less good than her best to see the light still if these remains have not the literary value which attaches to her finished works they have nevertheless a value and an interest of their own they are only sketches but we draw them out from the portfolio of a great artist and find in them all that masterly touch which scarcely any other could have given even the cancelled chapter of persuasion the place of which was afterwards better supplied we should have been unwilling to lose as for the story on which she was engaged when the pen fell from her hand for ever it gave promise of ranking with her best novels the scene is laid at a little village on the sussex coast which two great proprietors are anxious to turn into a fashionable bathingplace one of these is an enthusiastic mr parker who believed that seaair and seabathing together were nearly infallible  nobody could catch cold by the sea nobody wanted appetite by the sea  nobody wanted spirits  nobody wanted strength they were healing softening relaxing fortifying and bracing seemingly just as was wantedsometimes one sometimes the other if the seabreeze failed the seabath was the certain corrective and when bathing disagreed the seabreeze was evidently designed by nature for the cure the other proprietor is a greedy old widow a large boardingschool is expected at the village and she remarks ah well no harm in that they will stay their six weeks and out of such a number who knows but some may be consumptive and want asses milk and ive two milch asses at this very time if only the story could have been finished what fun we should all have had with this old lady denham and mr parker and the invalid miss parker of whom her sister writes  she has accordingly had three teeth drawn and is decidedly better but her nerves are a good deal deranged she can only speak in a whisper and fainted away this morning on poor arthurs trying to suppress a cough  lady susan though complete in itself is otherwise of less real value than either of the unfinished stories it is in the form of letters which is an obvious disadvantage though formerly it was a method of telling a story which was much in vogue in spite however of sir charles grandison and of evelina miss austen herself distrusted its effect she recast sense and sensibility which was originally written in this form and she suppressed lady susan altogether the narrative instead of flowing easily and naturally along is given in a succession of jerks as now one and now another letterwriter takes up the tale it is difficult moreover so to vary the style apart from the substance of the letters as to give to each writer his own distinctive character and miss austen is less successful in lady susan than we had a right to expectfor when was ever letter written like that of mr collinss in  pride and prejudice nor is this story itself a pleasant one lady susan is a widow of doubtful reputation who is never happy except when engaged in a series of flirtations her young daughter is terribly in her way and she must marry her offhand a sir james martin is chosen as her husband but the man is a fool and the unfortunate girl detests him and will fall in love with a certain reginald de courcy meanwhile lady susan herself keeps up a sentimental flirtation with de courcy and at the same time a very violent flirtation with a married mr mainwaring de courcy fortunately discovers this double dealing and marries the daughter instead of the mother while lady susan stepping into her daughters place contents herself with sir james all this half rivalry between mother and daughter is disagreeable enough and lady susan is simply odious in spite of her beauty tact and fascination no woman however of her crafty and experienced worldliness could write so openly and so atrociously as does lady susan not only has she no disguises from herself but she affects none when writing to her friend and confidante here are two amiable examples of this excellent lady   my dear alicia in what a mistake were you guilty in marrying a man of his age just old enough to be formal ungovernable and to have the gout too old to be agreeable too young to die and again  mainwaring is more devoted to me than ever and were we at liberty i doubt if i could resist even matrimony offered by him thib event if his wife live with you it may be in your power to hasten the violence of her feelings which must wear her out may be easily kept in irritation i rely on your friendship for this but if we care little for  lady susan we care very much for  the watsons what we have of it was written in a moment of gay and happy inspiration why it was never finished it is difficult to imagine mr austenleigh suggests that  the author became aware of the evil of having placed her heroine too low in such a position of poverty and obscurity as though not necessarily connected with vulgarity has a sad tendency to degenerate into it and therefore like a singer who has begun on too low a note she discontinued the strain but surely this cannot have been the reason the watsons are at least as good as the bennets and tom musgrave is immeasurably superior to john thorpe as for the heroine herself she is more charming than elizabeth bennet or fanny price or catherine morland or any of miss austens heroines anne elliott alone excepted we suspect the real reason of this story remaining unfinished may have been that tom musgrave was too real a character and she shrank from what she would call  an invasion of social proprieties certainly tom mus grave if not taken from life is one of her most lifelike and vigorous creations the spoiled dandy of a country town with his insufferable conceit to thc equals who flatter him and lls unblushing toadyism to his betters who endure him he is simply glorious the ball at the hotel where he will not deign to appear till the osbornes come and from which he must retire when the osbornes go is capitally described and then what can be more delightful than his astonishment when emma refuses to dance with him or his disgust when she declines a seat in his curricle or his bewildered surprise when she will not admire lord osborne  he spends an evening with the watsons and condescends to play vingtetun with them  the favourite game at osborne castle and keeps them well supplied with anecdotes  the ways and good jokes of osborne castle were now added to his ordinary means of entertainment he repeated the smart sayings of one lady detailed the oversights of another and indulged himself even with a copy of lord osbornes overdrawing himself on both cards the clock 3truck nine while he was thus agreeably employed and when nanny came in with her masters basin oi gruelwas the father of emma watson we conder as particular about the thinness of his gruel as though father of emma woodhouse  he had the pleasure of observing to mr watson that he should now leave him at supper while he went home to dinner himself the carriage was ordered to the door and no entreaties for his staying longer could now avail for he well knew that if he stayed he would have to sit down to supper in less than ten minutes which to a man whose heart had been long fixed on calling his next meal a dinner was quite insupportable it is tantalising to feel that we can never know tom musgraves fate did he marry into the osborne set or fall a victim to some intriguing barmaid  the more painful  nd is we fear the more strictly probable this book then possesses singular aud varied interest it is well edited and carefully arranged to one thing only we must demur on behalf of some unsuspecting reader considering that  lady susan comprises only 88 pages out of 364 that the greater part of the book is the alreadypublished life we doubt whether the name lady susan c on the back fairly represents its contents we would commend the matter to either editor publisher or both as a case of conscience for them to ktiacide  a memoir of jane austen by her nephew j e austenleigh vicar of bray berks london bentley 1870 sense and sensibilitya novel by jane austen new edition london  bentley 1870 in the same sense that keats is the poets poet miss austen has always been far excellence the favourite author of literary men the peculiar merits of her style are recognised by all but with the general mass of readers they have never secured what can fairly be called popularity the technical dexterity of her workmanship is best appreciated by fellow craftsmen and some education of the literary palate is needed to do full justice to the delicate execution and subtle analytic power which give the author of emma an unassailable place amongst english classics it has always been known that miss austens private life was unruffled by any of the incidents or passions which favour the trade of the biographer  had it been otherwise the circle of her admirers fit if comparatively few would never have consented to wait half a century for the meagre but still interesting details which her nephew mr austenleigh has now made public it fits in with our idea of the authoress to find that she was a proficient in the microscopic needlework of sixty years since that she was never in love that she  took to the garb of middle age earlier than her years or her looks required and that she excelled in telling stories for children the few extracts given from her letters have the additional recommendation of illustrating the rise of the modern novel and the school of realistic fiction which fanny burney had announced though not founded at present the difficulties against which miss austens novels have to contend are the sententiously moral titles of pride and prejudice sense and sensibility the lengthy moral dissertations which the characters allow themselves and the consequent delay in developing the story the authoress on the other hand writes impartially of pride and prejudice  it wants shade it wants to be stretched out here and there with a long chapter of sense if it could be had if not of solemn specious nonsense about something unconnected with the story an essay on writing a critique on walter scott or the history of buonaparte or something that would form a contrast and bring the reader with increased delight to the playfulness and epigrammatism of the general style it would be difficult to ignore more completely the origin and the tendencies of her success but the passage shows the difficulties she had to overcome in the form of a preconceived theory the critics of the day were equally in the dark and one reviewer allows no merit to sense and sensibility but what arises from the exemplary behaviour of the elder sister it was not till after miss austens time that the domestic novel was emancipated from the theories of the amusing and the doctrines of the edifying which chill and stiffen miss edgeworths talent she was not conscious herself of founding a new school of fiction which would inspire new canons of criticism and in the mean time since she left tales of thrilling adventure to radcliffs and porters she could only claim a literary locus standi as a wit a satirist or a moralist to all of which characters she had of course a right though neither of them includes all the qualities with which we should credit her works these there can be little doubt would have been more popular now if the morality had been taken for granted and as much reliance placed upon dramatic and narrative truthfulness as upon the polished satire and the slight though pure thread of humour which runs through every work as a matter of art miss austens novels are more perfect than thackerays but they are far from containing as many separate excellencies  and her per feet command of the materials she possessed seems to warrant the belief that a wider experience of men and things would have enriched without corrupting her style as it isr she stands nearly alone amongst novelists in drawing men and women with equal success by the help of follies and weaknesses slight enough not to reduce their victims below the level of mediocrity mr austenleigh explains as a pure misrecollection the unaccountable secondhand description of his aunt found in miss mitfords correspondence since her mother on whose authority it was given is proved to have known jane austen only as a little girl the biographers task has been performed with care and judgment though certainly with less spirit than macaulay would have thrown into the memoir he once thought of writing the scantiness of the correspondence is however to be regretted and few specimens of unpublished writings would have added to the interest of the work thus where a wellknown passage like the end of persuasion exists in an earlier and less perfect form it is for the credit of the author that we should have an opportunity of comparing the two the new edition of the novels which is coming out does not appear before it is

we expressed a doubt whether it could be surpassed for folly and offence unlikely as it seemed the doubt has been resolved by our becoming acquainted with though socalled novel now before us which within its two volumes contains to the full as much silliness and vulgarity as did the three volnmes of the other production  while as the author has dared to fall back upon though most wellworn ticcues on which novel puppets have been strung for the last twenty years it may fairly be said to be even more commonplace its commonplaceness is indeed soextraordinary that it verges on genius let any experienced novelreader take the materials of which  the hazelhurst mystery  is compounded and we will back him at long odds to serve them np in a less appallingly inane and flaccid mess than has been made of them given a lonely and lovely girl married to a worthy young man for whom she has no passionate love a meddling aunt of the girls and a fashionable doctor as handsome and insinuating as was though fabled dogsmeat man who is the intimate friend of the worthy husband and there is already matter enough to make a thrilling if not a very edifying romance miss lloyd however has clearly shrunk in tenor before the possible strength of her ingredient and lest their flavour should bs too violent ha bhitsci them in such fashion that she has produced a far mon nauseous mess than the most sincerely immoral frencik writer could have manufactured mrs george grafton the lovely being of whom we have spoken falls in love soon after her marriage with harry cartland the insinuating wretch of a doctor and he of course can do not less than fall in love with her but his love is not revealed until one fatal evening  up tc now he had never for one moment believed that she cared for himhad indeed no reason for thinking anything but the right and proper thought that she loved her husband george grafton but now    therewasasoffc ness in her face about her lips that he had never seen beforethe something that had been wanting was there now  and kate was not only handsome but beautifult this was too good an opportunity for making love ta his greatest friends wife to be lost and he naturally leaned over her saying  kate  kate   we read that on this her eyes filled with tears and love and that the pair were  on the brink of temptation but fortunately at that moment george came in and kate like  wellconducted person flew into his arms only for a time however was this to endure george with the prudence that should of right belong te an honest husband resolves on going over to ceylon alone to look after his business and says to cartland if i go harry you will see her constantly and watch her as carefully as if she were your own yon will promise it is needless to say that the sly wretch of a doctor does promise and does watch over kate as carefully as if she were his own so carefully indeed that he ends by making her his own not however in the way in which things would happen in a shocking french novel but by what she takes for lawful marriage after the supposed death of george but here let it be noted that before she fancied grafton to be dead she had  put her arms about cartland her lips on his fevered brow and said several times that she loved him she was careful however to add  when i cease tobe his i am yours love while he lives never theseremarkable scenes took place in cartlands private rooms in london whither kate had accompanied him shortly afterwards he persuaded her that george was dead and the very next day they were married meanwhile the wily cartland had found a dying girl very like kate and when was she dead sent her off in a coffin inscribed with mrs graftons name to mrs graftons house by means of this simple device grafton away in ceylon was persuaded that his wife was dead he took the news of her death however less coolly than she did that of his and was indeed so true toiler memory that although a charming girl was saved with him from a wreck on purpose to fall in love with him he utterly refused to marry her until public opinion decided that unless he did so she could not continue to live in his house which she distinctly declined toquit however they were married and had an infant son and lived very happily until george with his usual idiotcy came straight back to england because his first wifes meddling aunt reported to him with no evidence to back her statement that kate was still alive having ascertained that this was indeed the fact and fathomed the depth of cartlands villany he refused to have anything more to do with the woman he had as he thought married in ceylon because for her to stay with him longer would be a sin his noble soul never conceived the possibility of keeping the matter secret from her about which there would have been no difficulty the fitting climax to this string of hideou rubbish is that kate having gone mad for a time recovers to be affectionately tended by her successor and while the two are talking religious platitudes which are under the circumstances only less offensive than those uttered by cartland on his deathbed george enters george graftonfor it was henever forgot that sight his two wives  it would have been surprising if he had kate immediately dies and george marries the other wife again next day what became of the unfortunate child born before this second and legal marriage we do not hear we should not have been at the pains of noticing such stuff as  the hazelhurst mystery but for its being an attempt to give to a revolting story au aspect of goodiness which is infinitely sickening we may give as an instance of this the deathbed of cartland already referred to when this excessively wicked person wras dying  kate fell upon her knees holding the almost dead hands and breathed that blessed promise into the failing ears of the dying man who had lived an unbeliever  and she saw that he believed at last for a glorious smile of intelligence passed across his ashenhued facelending a beauty even to death itselfand all was still out of evil good may come  and the fact that such stories as this are written by women with nothing better to do

received as rich and racy additions to our comic literature which is of paramount attraction at the present moment this diversion of the public taste may be a reaction in parliamentary phrase we suspect that the reading classes or in one word everybody have become so weary of the utilitarian bores and their neverending nevermending doctrines that a leap from grave to gay has been eagerly and generally taken and probably more improvement may be effected by the light artillery of satiric humour than by the sappers and miners in  the march of intellect for men are more likely to be laughed out of their follies by true humour than to be worried out of them by dulness mr tiitmarsh ranks very high in if not at the head of the english school of wits as we observed in noticing his paris sketch book d he has a very nice percept tion of the ridiculous and a talent for raillery which would hale delighted even the great lord shaftesbury who maintains that nothing is proof against raillery but what is honest and just this rare talent is here admirably worked out as every page and plate of these two volumes testifies for titmarsh is his own illustrator as well as editor at the duties of the latter he glances in his preface wherein he commends the publishers custom of causing the works of unknown literary characters to be  edited by some already popularperson a custom which cannot be too strongly praised both by authors of high repute and by writers of no repute at all for the former pocket the publishers drafts and the latter their meed of fame but the literal illustration is still more amusing this little editorial fiction is one which can do harm to nobody in the world and only good to the youngauthor so introduced for who would notice him in such a great

houses painted or coloured in all colours chiefly red the streets are wide very wide indeed and the whole thing looks as if it had sprung up in a night by the work of a few carpenters hands there is an old orangecoloured castle partly in ruins up there on a great elevation from whence you see interminably around over one vast plain unbroken almost by a tree the widest barest most uninteresting scene i ever beheld there is an immense brick cathedral deformed by swedish taste in renovation standing in an open space there are multitudes of men young and middle aged walking everywhere about with cigars or pipes in their mouths and hideous boys caps of white jean on their heads and no other academic dress whenever they get together in groups or set out on their favourite annual tours they sing a great deal make much noise and generally act rather rudely these are the students miss bunbury passed a winter in stockholm as the lodger of a countesswho instructed her benignantly on the manners and customs and shortcomings of english ladies and who is depicted as being a mean oldfashioned prejudiced womanilliberal in her notionsand not very generous in her hospitalities the coming on of hard weather is described with some sprightlinessthough as regards pictorial skill miss bunbury does not equal other travelling englishwomento name but two the writer of the letters from the baltic

she was carried as a spectatorand which was solemnized as not unfrequently happens on the continent in a house hired and garnished for the occasion then we have the tale of miss bunburys presentation at courtand an illustration of conventional modesty new to usin its comicality outdoing the most outrageous case or specimen gathered by mrs trollope or by capt marryat  as i was unable to eke out the little adornment which nature herself had bestowed upon my head by wearing the plumes more lavishly bestowed on other creatures without being guilty of usurping the honours of matrimony i felt it necessary to make the most of my natural advantages by calling in the aid of a hairdresser kccolleering having seen a shop of that description kept by a frenchman from paris somewhere about bruukehcrg i thought there was no ditliculty in the way and asking froken to accompany me on a walk i went out intending to make this matter its object the shop proved to he a perfumery ami fancy tttionery one also there was a woman only therein who when i asked for monsieur said she was his wile and supposed she would do as well i replied no for i wanted him to come to dress my hair  not your own hair she said in a solemn and questioning manner certainly my own hairon your headcertainly on my own head can i see him the good woman looked at me with a face that plainly said what an audaciously hardened creature this must be to make such a proposal then abruptly saying  he is absent he is in paris he is very ill in bed she turned her back and looked up at the articles on her shelf i went away on our road i saw a sign with  pcrukmakare upon it and before froken could stop nie i entered the shop there was a man here  is it to make a peruke he inquired  no to come to dress my hair the poor man seemed to undergo a convulsion to avoid laughter then he looked so awkward i think he blushed but i looked out and saw froken standing with a very pretty face of perfect distress in the street madame madame she cried at the door when i appeared that is impossible that we can ask for a hairdresser in stockholm pray madame come home i want to be at home i went home with the poor girl thinking only that it is very unpleasant for any one not interested in an object to go about thus on an unpleasant day looking for what is not easily found a few minutes after we entered the house i followed froken to the salong and found my hostess leaning her back against the kakelugn or stove and laughing most heartily while froken stood before with a halfashamed halfrelieved countenance evidently in the act of confession  yes madame cried the former interrupting her laugh to speak to me and taking it up again yes i am telling her that is not so dangerous and the laugh recommencedwhatto ask for a hairdresser that there was some infection going which such persons were in danger of conveying i was now quite convinced but when i simply asked if this were the case a roar of laughter echoed through the great room it brought out some young ladies to see if what was going on were roliga word i think oftener used in the swedish language than in any other certainly oftener than we use its english expletiveamusing but to see all the modest faces that were put to the blush when they heard that madame had actually been inquiring for a hairdresser  well said the hostess at last it is not wonderful that madame should do so for in my younger days it was not thought improper to employ a man to dress hair improper i cried opening my eyes as a new light dawned on them and that good wifes shocked expression of face reappeared before themimproper why in england where propriety is very much thought of and in france too that is an everyday occurrence1 yes yes that is not dangerous and that i find quite a foolish idea though it is our custom said our hostess for once in her life giving up the perfection and immutability of swedish ways  it was not so in my youth no when i was in the world it was not improper to have a hairdresser the ladies ran away and i asked the elder one in private what it was that constituted this impropriety that is just what i cannot well say she replied but no lady here would have a man to dress her hair they have women who are taught to do so but these women are taught by men yes but man kan inte hjelpe det the fact is it is a ladys propriety but not a womans that is shocked by employing a male hairdresser i remarked it is our custom madame but i grant you i do not think it a wise one for it was not thought dangerous when i was in the world forty years agobut how can it be so now  whyyou know he must go into the ladies apartments yes but men often do so here at all times and sit and talk there with them yes but you know their toilet is not complete when their hair is to be dressedbut propriety is much more outraged when it is complete i answered man kan inte hjelpe det said the noble dame and ran off to the kitchen the above extracts will suffice to give the reader a fairand we think a not unpleasant idea of miss bunburys book she is not so much wanting in good nature ns wanting in taste she possesses the power of observation in larger proportion than the faculty of selection a sledge accident which confined her to the house made her the object of affectionate ministration on the part of miss bremerto whose thoughtful and delicate benevolence every one who has written concerning the swedish novelist bears concurrent testimony,juvenile_contra

degradation by three faitgful knights too loyal to allow their disapproval of his crime to interfere with their chivalrous devotion and how in the end they were rewarded for their labours here is a good story of a different sort three impostors came to a xing and told him they were clothweavers and could fabricate a cloth of so peculiar a nature that a legitimate son of his father could see the cloth but if he were illegitimate though believed to be legitimate he could not see it now the king was much pleased at this thinking that by this means he would be able to distinguish the men in his kingdom who were legitimate sons of their supposed fathers from those who were not and so be enabled to increase his treasures for among the moors only legitimate children inherit their fathers property and for this end he ordered a palace to be appropriated to the manufacture of this cloth and these men in order to convince him that they had no intention of deceiving him agreed to be shut up in this palace until the cloth was manufactured which satisfied the king  when they were supplied with a large quantity of gold silver silk and many other things they entered the palace and putting their looms in order gave it to be understood that they were working all day at the cloth  after some days one of them came to the king and told him the cloth was commenced that it was the most curious thing in the world describing the design and construction he then prayed the king to favour him with a visit but begged he would come alone the king was much pleased but wishing to have the opinion of some one first sent the lord chamberlain to see it in order to know if they were deceiving him when the lord chamberlain saw the workmen and heard all they had to say he dared not admit he could not see the cloth and when he returned to the king he stated that he had seen it the king sent yet another who gave the same report when they whom he had sent declared that they had seen the cloth he determined to go himself  on entering the palace and seeing the men at work who began to describe the texture and relate the origin of the invention as also the design and colour in which they all appeared to agree although in reality they were not working when the king saw how they appeared to work and heard the character of the cloth so minutely described and yet could not see it although those he had sent had seen it he began to feel very uneasy fearing he might not be the son of the king who was supposed to be his father and that if he acknowledged he could not see the cloth he might lose his kingdom under this impression he commenced praising the fabric describing its peculiarities after the manner of the workmen  on the teturn to his palace he related to his people how good and marvellous was the cloth yet at the same time suspected something wrong at the end of two or three days the king requested his alguacil or officer of justice to go and see the cloth when the aglacil entered and saw the workmen who as before describod the figures and pattern of the cloth knowing that the king  had been to see it and yet could not see it himself he thought he certainly could not be the legitimate son of his father and therefore could not see it ile however feared if he was to declare that he could not see it he would lose his honourable position to avoid this mischance he dmmenced praising the cloth even more vehemently than the others  when the aiguacil returned to the king and told him that he had seen the cloth and that it was the most extraordinary production in the world the king was much disconcerted for he thought that if the al acil had seen the cloth which he was unable to see there cold 1o longer be a doubt that he was not the legitimate son of the king as was generally supposed he therefore did not hesitate to praise the excellency of the cloth and the skill of the workmen who were able to make it on another day he sent one of his councillors and it happened to him as to the king and the others of whom i have spoken and in this manner and for this reason they deceived the ing and many others for no one dared to say he could not see the cloth things went on thus until there came a great feast when all requested the king to be dressed in some of the cloth so the workmen being ordered brought some rolled up in very fine linen and inquired of the king how much of it he wished them to cut l off so the king gave orders how much and how to make it up  now when the clothes were made and the feast day had arrived the weavers brought them to the king informing his maesty that his dress was made of the cloth as he had directed the sing all this time not dating to say he coild not see it  when the king had professed to dres himself in this suit he mounted on horseback and rode into the city but fortunately for him it was sumner time the people aeeing his majesty come 1 in thismanner were much surprised but knowing that those who could not see this cloth would be considered illegitimate sons of their fathers kept their surprise to themselves fearing the dishonour consequent upon such a declaration not so however i

equal to he was greatly troubled having x the will and not the power l now in the same town there lived another moor who held a r higher position and was very much richer than his father and 3 who had an only daughter the very reverse in character and appearance of the young man she being of so very violent a temper that no one could be found willing to marry such a virago b one day the young man came to his father and said you r know that your means will not allow you to put me in a position r to live honourably adding that as he desired to live an easy and i quiet life he thought it better to seek to enrich himself by an advantageous marriage or to leave that part of the country the father told him that he would be very happy if he could e succeed in such a union on this the son proposed if it were e agreeable to his father to seek the daughter of their neighbour in e marriage hearing this the father was much astonished and t asked how he could think of such a thing when he knew that no man however poor could be induced to marry her 8 nevertheless the son insisted and although the father 1 thought it a strange whim in the end he gave his consent the d good man then visited his neighbour telling him the wish of his a son i when the good man heard what his friend said he answered  by heaven my friend were i to do such a thing i should prove t myself a very false friend for you have a worthy son and it would i be base in me to consent to his injury or death and i know for cer tain that were he to live with my daughter he would soon lie or death at least would be preferable to life do not think i say t this from any objection to your alliance for i should only be too r grateful to any man who would take her out of my house the young mans father was much pleased at this as his son was so intent on the marriage all being ultimately arranged l they were in the end married and the bride taken home according i to the moorish fashion to the house of her husband and left to i supper the friends and relations returning to their respective homes waiting anxiously for the following day when they feared to find the bridegroom either dead or seriously injured  now being left alone the young couple sat down to supper i when the bridegroom looking behind him saw his mastiff and said to him  bring me water wherewith to wash my hands the dog naturally taking no notice of this command the young man t became irritated and ordered the animal more angrily to bring him water for his hands which the latter not heeding the young man arose in a great rage and drawing his sword commenced a savage attack on the dog who to avoid him ran away but l finding no retreat jumped on the table then to the fireplace his master still pursuing him who having caught him first cut off his head then his paws hewing him to pieces covering everything r with blood thus furious and bloodstained he returned to the l table and looking round saw a cat  bring me water for my hands said he to him the animal not noticing the command the master cried out  how false traitor did you not see how i treated i the mastiff for disobeying me if you do not do as i tell you this  instant you shall share his fate the poor little harmless cat i continuing motionless the master seized him by the paws and r dashed him to pieces against the wall his fury increasing he again placed himself at the table looking about on all sides as if i for something to attack next his wife seeing this and supposing i he had lost his senses held her peace at length he espied his horse the only one he had and called to him fiercely to bring him i water to wash his hands the animal not obeying he cried out l in a rage  how is this think you that because you are the only horse i have that you dare thus to disobey my orders know then that your fate shall be the same as the others and that anyone living who dares to disobey me shall not escape my yengence saying this he seized the horse cut off his head and hacked him to pieces and when the wife saw this and knowing he had no other horse felt that he was really in earnest she became dreadfully alarmed he again sat down to table raging and all bloody as he was swearing he would kill a thousand horses or even men or women if they dared to disobey him holding at the same time his bloody sword in his hand he looked around with glaring eyes until fixing them on his wife he ordered her to bring him water to wash his hands  the wife expecting no other fate than to be cut to pieces if she demurred immediately arose and brought him the water   ha thank god you have done so said he  otherwise i am so irritated by these senseless brutes that i should have done by you as by them he afterwards commanded her to help him to meat she

sleep for a short time he said to her get up i have been so annoyed that i cannot sleep take care that nothing disturbs me and in the meanwhile prepare me a good and substantial meal  while it was yet early the following morning the fathers mothers and other relatives came stealthily to the door of the young people and hearing no movement feared the bridegroom was either dead or wounded and seeing the bride approach the door alone were still more alarmed she seeing them went cautiously and tremblingly towards them and exclaimed i traitors what are you doing how dare you approach this gate  speak notbe silent or all of us you as well as i are dead  when they heard this they were much astonished and on learning what had taken place the night previous they esteemed the young man very much

B6962,['8370428'],  cha4rles reades no vels i believe that publisherswho have their opinions just as other people and perhaps may be supposed to know something about booksare fully agreed upon one point that women make more successful novelists than men looking at the question from a publishers point of view considering that there are a dozen women who read novels to one man that most women like most men are lacking in imagination and therefore like to have things presented from their own the feminine point of view this fact does not seem remarkable probably scotts novels when they first came out were in less demand than those sweet works of letitia matilda hawkins and one can very well understand how those books which prophesy smooth things accept all the little social makebelieves and consider the convenances as if they were actually the revealed law may be more delightful to many people than those which set forth the grave and terrible realities of the world the solemn responsibilities which years bring upon us all the temptations which beset us the ambitions and the disappointments the inherent nobility of human nature the possibilities always open to the most fallen and the east importance of every single mans conduct to those who are associated with him making every allowance however for the people who read only to be made to laugh for those who have small imagination for those who like smooth stories of society and for those who like to read what may be called tales of the lower nature it has always been to me matter of great astonishment that the appearance of a novelist among us like charles read should not have been receivedi do not say with wider popularitybut with a more ready and more generous appreciation on the part of the critical press the truest and best distinction which a writer can obtain is the appreciation of the general reading public and it may be said of the novelist as of the dramatist that critics who may at the outset greatly help a new man cannot even if they try extinguish him critics for instance for a good many years went on trying to extinguish miss braddon but they failed and her books continue to rise in reputation they said all kinds of hard things about her yet she got a larger dlienlle with every new novel the reason was that the critics only saw certain obvious faults of style and failed to see beneath the style the genuine storyteller the real secret why miss braddon has succeeded is because she has always a good story to tell and has always told it effectively in fact there is good reason for the success of every novel that does succeed it may be in bad tastethe majority of mankind do not know good taste from bad it may be vulgarthe majority of mankind are themselves vulgar it may turn on forms of wickedness about which some people prefer not to speak but others love to read it may treat of the lowest depths like  lassommoir some people like to be in imagination among the very beasts of the people so that if a work of fiction be in demand it behoves the critics to discover what are the qualities which cause this demand now in the case of charles read we have a long series of novels every one of which has been successful and many enormously successful yet he has received from critics nothing more than the usual brief comment accorded to every writer of the least name as each novel was presented to the world i am not so foolish as to suppose that critics ever try to keep a man down here and there a malicious onslaught may be made but as a rule they seem to me a kindhearted and indulgent body there is however a wide difference between recommending one book after the other and forming a deliberate judgement on the position occupied by the author of many remarkable novels there exists perhaps among critics something of the sheeplike quality which makes them follow where one has had the courage to lead no one has yet led so that while we have been inundated with essays on the genius of george eliot miss thackeray and others i do not remember to have read one single serious effort to explain charles reades success to account for the popularity of his novels or to award him his place among english authors perhaps his success is not even known yet i believe that among those who do know it is perfectly well understood that of all living men who write novels he is the most widely known the most read and the most admired remember that there are the people in america in india and in our colonies to consider besides the subscribers to our circulating libraries in the quiet plantations on the coffee tea sugar and indigo estates on the silent sheep runs in faraway farmhouses in the states and canada and the colonies everywhere the men read novels here in this country there are more women readers of novels than men in the colonies men and women together all love novels and read as many as they can buy and if all englishspeaking readers were to vote for the best of living novelists there can be little doubt that they would name charles reade since the quartfrly revines have been silent therefore i should like to be allowed to state some of the reasons which in my mind have united in placing this writer in this position i wish be it understood to speak not as a critic but as an admireri am one of those who would so vote i entirely agree with the popular verdict i for one consider that read takes rank with fielding smollett scott dickens and thackeray that is to say in the great and delightful art of fiction wherein the englishwho are always in every age doing something better than their neigh bourshave surpassed the world charles read stands among the foremost and best first then he is a scholar this means among other things that he brought to the study of living man and woman a knowledge of ancient men and women he knew what to expect the forces which impel mankind and drive us hither and thither are and always have been the same necessity still rules those who speak english as she ruled those who spoke greek the same temptations assail us they are met with the same heroism or the same cowardice the way of the least resistance is always open to man and he generally to his discomfiture takes that way we change the sky but not the mind of man when we read aristophanes lucian martial and horace those have become already critics of humanity who have read these writers a liberal education of course means much more than thisdoes reades strong and vigorous style owe nothing to early compositions in latin and greek but this is surely a great deal before that great anatomist rabelais held scalpel in hand he had studied all that was written by the men of old on the human frame when filled with awe and adoration towards the maker of so wondrous a mechanism he stood before his subject about to penetrate the mysteries of the body he knew what to expect so he who would show the mysteries of action thought motive and desire should first have studied in the ancient schools it is a great injury for instance that we have done to women in withholding from them the liberal education in restoring it to them at their new colleges and high schools we have taken the greatest step towards putting them on the same level with men i believe that by means of likra humanios women will recover the critical faculty learn what is meant by style study epigram and perhaps cease to believe without reason it will be a strange outcome of this revolution in education if in twenty years or so the women novelists will write like read rather than like their predecessors of the present generation secondly charles read is a dramatist observe that the drama permits almost everything except verbosity and tameness a drama may have nearly every fault and yet succeed if it be lively and not verbose but the great majority of novels are verbose to the last degree without action and without incident if such a story as  griffith gaunt for instance be compared with almost any ordinary novel of the day the first note of difference will be found in the overwhelming amount of incident in the former as compared with the latter the second that the descriptions of persons scenery place voice gesture c necessary in every novel are much shorter in  griffith gaunt  than the other the third that the conversations do not drag and seem too long or discursive but that they carry on the action and develop the characters our old dramatists hung up a scroll on which was written  a room in the kings palace the actors by their dialogue and their gestures presently brought the place home to the imagination the spectators saw that splendid roomthey were actually sitting in it they were assisting at the council of the kings most excellent highnessthough the play was but on trestles in the courtyard of an inn slow brains saw nothing then as now if you give them the stage mounting of the haymarket they see no more you cannot by any means of upholstery tear out of himself for a moment the unhappy wretch who has no imagination now charles read in his novel work resembles the old dramatists if he takes his reader to a north country fishing village he does not make up an elaborate picture of the houses the boats the nets spread out upon the seashore the smell of the fish the narrow streets the reek and the dirt of it i do not say that in some hands such a description is not pleasing but it is not part of reades method he is not a painter of scenery nor of houses he does not care for picturesque  bits  and effects of light unless they help his story he is a painter of men and women therefore in the space of half a page or thereabouts he introduces us briefly to the kind of folks we are to meet and then sets them to talk for themselves not a bit of furniture not an inch of tapestry no blue china no cabinets yet when all is told and the curtain drops we know the place where the people live better than if we had read pages of description this is the art of the dramatist fielding who is also a great gossip and perpetually talking to the reader on his own account possesses this art his characters by their acts and their conversations reveal themselves and their surroundings for my own part i have always wondered how charles read could bear his novels to be illustrated except out of kindness to his weaker brthred i saw lately in a review the statement perfectly and literally true but actually made as an objection that read describes his characters from the outside exactly the dramatist describes his characters  from the outside there they are on the stage the king with his crown the soldier with his sword the priest with his shaven crown what more do you want presently they begin to talk and they show themselves as they go on building up their characters bit by bit or it may be revealing themselves in one or two masterstrokes the forciblefeeble writer describes his characters from the inside that is he tells you beforehand what he wants you to think of them this method helps the folk whose imaginative powers are weak it will therefore continue to be practised and to be in demand but which may we ask is the better art to make the characters reveal themselves or to describe them from the  inside looking therefore upon his story always as a dramatist considers his plot reade at the outset seems to have considered strength as the first essential in his work he aims continually at strength  he achieves strength in three ways first by a style which is always reined in nervous and vigorous in the purest english next by clearness of vision in his own mind you cannot draw a portrait when you do not see the face witness the blurred features of daniel deronda whose portrayer wrote round him and about him right through four dreary volumesor was it sixand left him as uncertain to the reader as he was to his biographer thirdly reades strength is achieved by his conscientious fidelity to truth not only is he true to his characters but he is trve to his plots i mean this there are so many complications possible in life that there is no difficulty whatever in finding the materials for a story but the artist must have story and characters to match he must have players who can play the parts and look the characters he must have a plot which springs naturally from the given conditions and does not appear manufactured the age the position the very names of his characters must belong to his story now all reades stories are strong and strong in their studied art which seems so unstudied many of them depend upon situations which in less skilful hands would be merely melodramatic in his they belong to the natural development of the plot thus  it is never too late to mend is one long series of striking incidents it is like a french play in five acts and cinquante tableaux there is material enough in it to make a dozen threevolume novels with the wordspinning and characterdrawingm which fill them out in  love me little love me long the contrast between david dodd and reginald talboys struck almost at the opening is a situation in itself maintained throughout with wonderful skill and success then is there anything more delicious than peg woffington pretending to be a portrait in triplets studio in put yourself in his place he covers the canvas with incidents he is prodigal of incident as becomes one who is fertile in devising situations continually new while in the short  wandering heir he has at least halfadozen situations all new and all strong one need not continue the list enough has been said to show my meaning that strength is the main quality desired by this author endless as are the variations which differentiate men so that the day will never come when the choice is exhausted the novelist who has studied his art has to remember that while many of the varieties lying ready to his hand are uninteresting he has to select for the purposes of his groups only those who will fall naturally into line with the rest and be able to take their part in the development of the story if you consider you will observe that read never introduces a needless character nothing more hinders a play nothing more endangers its success than a character not wanted reade as i have said before writes his novels as if he were writing a play scene after scene act by act the story advances what does not help the story along must be cut out and as in a play a man does not come on the stage with a paper tacked on his back describing his character but proceeds to show himself by words so in these novels every character shows who and what he is by words and deeds many weak writers can imagine vividly and can describe more or less what they imagine their characters to have done and why they did it reade on the other hand i repeat does not describe he makes his puppets act their own story and tell it themselves putting in only here and there the necessary explanation the canida jundmra which must never be beside the subject and must like the conversation advance the story he is not himself a narrator so much as a dramatist his works are almost ready for the stage his characters portray themselves strength truth aninationthese are three excellent qualities for a novelist to possess they will not be denied to charles read even by his enemies there is however a great deal more i have observed that he is a scholar and a student he says himself  wandering heir appendix p 305 i studied the great art of fiction closely for fifteen years before i presumed to write a line of it i was a ripe critic long before i became an artist my critical knowledge has directed my art but the practice of that art has not diminished my studies he has approached art therefore in the truest spirit that of a resolute student who knows that there is much to learn but is conscious of his powers i know no other example in history of a writer who deliberately proposed to become a novelist and spent fifteen years in preparation for his work the preparation was manifold in meditation about the quiet walks of magdalene in cultivated talk in the fellows common room in life among books in life among men in studies of french books and of francereades wide reading in french literature lends a flavour to his work which is as charming as it is easy to be recognised by those who also read french when he finally sent forth his first workit was i think  peg woffington a master in fiction already full grown stood before the world in another part of the appendix to the wandering heir he defines fiction as the art of weaving fact with invention if he goes on to say it were mere arrangement of fact thousands could write it the paragraphwriters and pennyaliners would become great novelists if it were pure invention the young would beat the older men out of the field but they do not because though they have invention they have not accumulated facts and they have no art dickens is the only great novelist who made an early success and there are many circumstances in his youthful history which account for that success let us therefore consider what is meant by the word fact he means that whatever be the story finally decided upon by the novelist it must be based upon a solid substructure of social life which must not be invented but be a faithful and truthful presentment of reality now the hardest thing in the world to get at is reality there are six hundred and fifty men in the house of commons hammering all night long and every night over what they call reality and the only reason why they do not agree is because they cannot convince each other of the real truth what then is the novelist to do he must go to all the available sources of evidence he must collect together all the undisputed facts and draw his own conclusions he must spare no pains in working out the problem for himself so far as the data allow and with no bias thus to illustrate reades method he found in the trades unions and the strikes with all the tyrannical cruelties and contempt of law and justice manifested in bringing the men within the unions an excellent subject for his pen he began therefore by collecting together arranging and digesting a solid body of facts he collected them from various local journals from blue books and reports very likely from visits to sheffield and other places and from conversations with workmen and their leaders when he had got these quite ready and not before he constructed his story now a story may lend itself to facts but facts cannot be got to accommodate themselves to a story there is the result howeveran actual presentment of a trades union a living chapter for future ages of this nineteenth century life all his books again represent life in action thackeray loved to sit at a club window and watch the procession along the pavement of old fogies old bucks old warriors old dowagers young dandies girls in carriages actresses gamblers brave young country lads admiring colonials and the rest who make up the world of clubs and of society reade who cannot be compared with thackeray because there is no single point at which they touch loves the life of action it is the brave workman fighting singlehanded against a union it is the young sailor handsome gallant and simplehearted against the man of the world it is the girl disguised as a man it is the wretched criminal struggling upwards to the level of self respect or the husband tortured by jealousy always real life with flesh and blood temptations and a hatred of hothouse and artifi ciality all his charactersyes allare men and womcn because if he flings a figure even for a moment on the canvas he finishes it with a few bold strokes and it remains a portrait not an uncertain phantom the true artist will not scamp any part of his work everybody is real everything seems to happen as it might happen to all of us even when the scenes are the most romantic and the situations are the most unexpected and this because he weaves his fact with his inventions so that one hardly knows where reality ends and romance begins and the novels taken altogether cover so wide an area that we may certainly accord to read the glory of being the chief painter of english modern life in its many forms from the belle of the season to the fishfag and from the peer to the convict i believe however that the great uninteresting stratum of life known as the  lower middle class  has been left quite untouched by him probably because he knows nothing of it he gathers his material where he can like moliere and shakespeare if he wants to write about modern times there are the daily papers the essays of the monthly press the bluebooks the pamphlets all kinds of things it he wants to write about the past there is the literature of the age to teach him some years ago an attack was made upon him on account of this very use of literature i would rather not speak of the trouble because the assailant is no more among us but one must allude to it in the story of the  wandering heir  the author had occasion to describe the gambling of a ladies party he went to that treasury of social manners and customs4swifts works and found in the wellknown  journal of a modern lady the ordering of a ladys whole day from morning to evening with the style of talk which went on he was accused of plagiarism and defended himself in a pamphlet which must be allowed to be a masterpiece of good english as well as of strong invective the following is the process as described by himself by which he handles his materials the perusal should be instructive for young noveliststhe first strata of facts i had to build my figment on were two reported trials in one james annesley was defendant on a charge of murder in the other craig v anglesey he was virtually plaintiff in a trial at bar for great estates and titles you will find the first case in  howells collection of state trials the second craig v anglesey is badly reported in howell i used the folio report published by smith  bradley dublin 1744 this book shall be deposited with my publishers that any novelist or critic who likes may see the use i have made of it the next source of fact was the amemoirs of an unfortunate nobleman written by james annesleys attorney upon the whole it is a tissue of falsehoods but there are a few invaluable truths in it the lies declare themselves trumpettongued the truths arc confined to james annesleys adventures whilst he was a slave in the colonies and his return home with admiral vernon i used a few of the truths and shunned all the falsehoods the memoirs being rather a rare book shall be deposited with my publishers for inspection in the three books i have now named lies half a plot but only iefntion of equal hwer with tah facts could make it a whole plot therefore i invented philippa and all her business and the whole sexual interest of the story i tell you this union of fact and imagination is a kind  intellectual copulation and has procreated the best fiction in every age by a law of nature to go into smaller details the irish schoolmaster and his  tall talk  are from facts supplied in print by carleton the irish curses i have used are culled with great study from three authors carleton banim and griffinand selected from an incredible number the decayed irish gentleman  the scornful dog who eats dirty puddings is fact taken from  a tour in ireland published 1740 to be found in the british museum the country costumes the price of salmon and other particulars are taken from the  postchaise companion in ireland  and  twisss tour in ireland the great salmon leap from  twisss tour in ireland the turf backgammon board with a boy for dice from oral traditionit was told me forty years ago by an irish gentleman who had it from his father the incomparable speech arrah people people c i had entire from the mouth of an irishman who heard it actually delivered in a fair the abductions and sham abductions of irish girls from ireland sixty years ago and sir j lubbocks  origin of civilisation c c in the other hiberniana of the story i have used the various histories of dublin and cork by gilbert and others the exrept anagwixm the  post chaise companion it ireland letters from a gentleman in ireland to a gentleman in bath rather an uncommon book and a very rare collection of old irish journals i obtained by groping that city for them the charning series of incidents in which john purcell figures are fom his sworn evidence and almost verbatim the abduction of the heir in open daylight is also sworn evidence see craig v anglesey the uncle beating his niece her flight to foreign parts and his apprehension on a charge of murder is a recorded fact i got it out of a chapbook but it has been referred to by jurists in my own day and i also possess it in a ballad called the  new west country garland  james annesleys adventure with christina mccarthy her shah penitence her cajolery and attempt to poison him were told by james annesley to his attorney and printed by him in  the memoirs i and i have set that gem of female nature in my story the discovery of james on board admiral vernons ship by his old schoolfellow matthews rests on the same basis of recorded fact the curious advertisement by jeweller drummond is an actual advertisement of the day taken verbatim from the gteaemans maguzine banker drummonds ancestor inserted it flizabeth shipleys character and her remarkable dream about wilmingtonthis and other vilmingtonia are condensed from ferriss  history of the original settlements on the delaware and from barkers i history of the primitive settlements but whatever in that part of the story bears upon the flagellation and other punishments of men and women and the legal relation of the planters to their white servants has been taken direct with careful study and precision from the various  charters and acts of assembly  of each separate state at or near the ulate of my story and here my method has kept me clear of the errors of james annesleys attorney who says in the memoirs that two of jamess companions were executed in the stakt of drlawart for elopement and suspicion of adultery now the law in that state inflicted no such punishment it imprisoned whipped and lettered it did not kill these colonies were hard upon religious offences but on the whole they did not take life half so recklessly as the mother country did at that time and with regard to sexual criminality they exacted such difficult proefs that their laws on that head were much thunder and little lightning the anglicana generalia have been culled with care from periodicals and books of fact too numerous to specify the masculine costume the women wore in the morning rests on addison amiss 7ournal the london yourna gcnat mans magaixc for 1730 daily courant and other contemporaneous authorities which are full of detail the entire reversal of female costume in the evening rests also on contemporary books periodicals and pictures lord angleseys levee and toilet are put together from alists 7ournal and various passages in the pictorial iistory of england in my novel of  a simpleton  there is a dressmakers bill 1872 in  the wandering heir  there is a dressmakers bill i got the modern dressmakers bill by asking three or four ladies of my acquaintance to oblige me with the original accounts they did so i was about to pursue the same plan in  the wandering heir when i found to my disgust i could not raise the dead so i had to ransack libraries  the graves of those who cannot diecrahk i found the truth i wanted in  the book of costume or annals of fashion by a lady of rank the parsot of colebrook charges the best bred ladies of his day with gross ignorance i fowid that in numerous authoritieslady mary wortley montagues letters mrs stones  chronicles of fashion and alas in my own family letters before and after that date as for their bad spelling that continued long after the date of the parsons observations other ladies spelled phonetically besides miss tabitha bramble hat in england and ireland the men drank hardest but the women gambled most i gained from essays and plays of the time how dublin gentlemen lived i got from  barringtons memoirs  ireland sixty years ago c and how a dublin lady passed her time i got from swifts photographic verses which carry truth as plainly written on them as livy and tacitus carry falsehood if i could have raised three ladies of dublin from the dead i would not have troubled swift but i cant raise the dead any more than mr home can and i have no personal experience of the year 1730 so i took the only remaining source of truth and interwove printed but reliable fact with my figment the possession then of scholarship which gives judgment taste and discernment strength of treatment clearness of vision fidelity of portraiture fidelity of incident the careful study of art the life of action truth in factsthese are qualities which seem by themselves to justify a place in the very first rank but there is still more i think as i have already said that the collected volumes of reades novels present a more complete picture of english modern life than can be found in the works of any other novelist there are separate novels by trollope hardy mrs oliphant sketches by laurence oliphant stories by miss mulock and plenty of others invaluable as pictures of contemporary manners and touching on portions of life outside the field of charles reade but not one has covered so wide an area or studied so carefully or represented so successfully the living moving struggling acting life i do not wish to set up comparisons between read and trollope or any other good writer to each his gifts it is however a very remarkable and suggestive thing about read that he cannot be compared you cannot lay hold of read here and of trollope there and compare their treatment he is absolutely unlike thackeray he bears no resemblance to dickens with blackmore hardy or george meredith the three who seem to me to come next to thackeray dickens and reade he has not one single point in common the impossibility of either comparing or classifying reade or of judging him from a critical point of view which admits any other writer is to my mind one of the strongest proofs of his excellence i propose next by way of illustrating these remarks to consider very briefly two of his works the first of these is one of his earliest christie johnstone it was written early in the fifties there was then as now a good deal of rubbish afloat among the uncritical that is to say the majority a few were trying to get art out of conventional groovesart of all kinds gets perpetually into grooves out of which it is the business of men with brains and clear eyes to drag it then there was a great deal of nonsense talked by certain followers of carlyle about mediaeval men and the decadence of modern times as if the present was not better than the past and there was a considerable quantity of ecclesiastical squabbling the meaning and importance of which is now happily quite forgotten and lost as is the way with this sort of foolishnessonly that more fool ishness of the same kind is always succeeding charles readei am not going to tell a good and wellknown story badlytakes his hero out of the city of babbledom right away to the country of caller herrin and fishwives would you know what the fishgirls are like then read the following and observe that the ordinary novelwriter would not convey so clear a portrait in ten

singing and in troops the french by their prayiung the flemitigs by their respectful bowings the bohemians hy fortunetelling the portuguese by their cryinz the italians by longs harangues the english by abusing and the spaniards by their haughty growlings we hereby command thert all to observe the following statutes under pain of our heavy displeasure  1 we forbid any lame or wounded beggar of

perfect health form no manner of connexion with blind men fieldpreachers mountebaniks poets musicians redeemed captive nor even with old soldiers that have escaped from a rout or seam a saved froin a shipwreck for although it is generally allowed that all these must subsist by imploring charity their manners of beggins being different it is necessary that each society keep to its own particular rules i 2 wve ordain that beggars have certain taverns assigned them in every country where shall preside three or four of their ancients with staves in their hands as emblems of their authority which said ancients are hereby empowered to canvass in the aforesaid taverns all the affairs of the world and to give their opinions as freely as there please at the same time we permit the other beggars to relate their own heroic exploits as well as those of their ancestors and even to illustrate the conversation by boasting of battles they were never in  3 we command that every beggar carry a good cudgel in his hand with a spike at the end of it if possible to be provided against emergencies lest they repent of their neglect  4 that each beggar take especial care never to presume to wear any thing new that all his clothes be worn out torn or patched nothing bringing more scandal on the profession than begging in good clothes be it however well understood that if in the exercise of his professional duties a beggar chance to obtain somne new garment he is at liberty to deck himself out in it for that day but no longer we positively will and command that he dispose of it the following morning  5 to prevent any dispute that may arise between comrades for certain posts we ordain that the moor e ancient possessor prevail and take precedence without regard to persons  6 it is permitted that two infirm or sick persons beg in company if they please and call each other brothefs provided they beg by turns and in a different toue the one beginning where the other leaves oti tlhey are to

who lltut har hand a cavalicr of gome called dorido a young man of an illustrious family an engaging person and great bravery fell in love with a young lady of the name of clorinia who was about seventeen years old virtuous beautiful and of equal rank the relations of this charming girl brought her up with so much care that they would not allow her to make any connexion by which her virtue might be at all endangered she was hardly ever suffered even to approach her latticed window lest some misfortune should be the consequence as no one could gaze upon her extreme beauty with impunity either her father or her mother or her brother valerio attended her every where and watched her every action some months ago dorido having accidently obtained a sight of her became violently enamoured  but could declare his love by no other means than by casting empassioned glances towards the window of her chamber when she happened to be there as he passed by the house if the homage of his eves was not always remarked by the object of it at least it was sometimes noticed  at all events it was practised often enough to produce the wishedfor effect  clorinia at first was satisfied with looking at the cavalier without being seen but soon she felt a wish that he should see her also without knowing why she wished it and answering by little and little to his amorous looks she at last conceived a passion in the same way in which she had inspired it i mean by appearing at her lattice dorido soon guessed that he had made on her all the impression he desired and since he was denied more indulged himself in the transports of believing himself beloved nevertheless lie sought to reap a more solid satisfaction from his conquest lie contrived to form an acquaintance with valerio and succeeded so well as to attach him in such a degree that they were inseparable a valerio could no longer live without his friend dorido they were always together sometimes at one house sometimes at another this gave iorido an opportunity of sometimes seeing his charmer aid even speakingg to her but never alone thie eves of the lovers alone communicated to each other the secrets of their hearts this state of affairs however did not last for ever clorinia mdle her maid scintila the confidant of her passion  this old woman wlho had wit and wished to serve her mistress called uipon dorido and having met with him  noble cavaliet said she  you need not attempt to disguise the truth from me i know tile state of your heart you love clorinia and i am niuch mistaken if your love is not returned you are both dying with impatience for an interview and i cannot see your situation without pity i shall never rest till i have procured you the satisfaction you both so ardently desire the lover transported with joy at these words thanked the dtuenna for her good will assuring her that she should not find him ungrateftul if she succeeded then making use of so excellent an opportunity he wrote a very passionate billet which he conjured her to convey to the amiable sister of valerio scintila returned immediately to her mistress to acquaint her with the step she had taken and presented her with loridos letter clorinia blamed her for taking charge of itbut soon forgave her nothing was now thought of but how to manage the interview with the lovers the lady raised so many difficulties that she would have relinquished it altogether if the old woman who was more ingenious had not hit upon a plan they both approved of scintilas ledelhamber was on the ground floor and adjoining to her room there was another which was filled with old and useless furniture this room was lighted only by a small window defended by two strong bars of iron through which there was only room sufficient for a hand to pass this window which was about five or six feet from the ground looked into a lane or blind alley quite uninhabited and the place appeared exactly suited to lovers who were satisfied to limit their happines to conversation only the old woman as soon as she saw her young mistress disposed to speak with jorido through this little window hastened to inform the cavalier who on the ensuing night at eleven oclock placed himself at a convenient spot lie approached the bars where he found scintila expecting him she requested him to wait patiently until the servants were gone to bed lie did not languish long in suspense the wishedfor moment soon arrived clorinia came trembling to the window at which her lover presented himself in speechless agitation as they both now loved for the first time they were agitated at the sight of each other and the excess of their feelings at first prevented them from speaking but love has more than one language the lady passed one of her beautiful hands between the bars of the window and the lover clasping it with ardour covered it with a thousand kisses at last by degrees they broke silence and indulged in passionate protestations of eternal love their souls were so entirely occupied by the pleasure of seeing each other that they would have suffered daylight to find them together if the old woman had not interrupted their conversation to warn them that it was time to seplarate before he would retire dorido entreated his mistress to allow him to return the next night at the same hour to the window and the lady could not resolve to refuse him this favour at last they separated equally delighted with the conversation they had just had with each other and filled with impatience for another interview lorido especially was too much agitated to be able to take any rest or to speak more correctly he was miserable until the time of his reiurn to the window you may easily suppose he did not fail to be punctual his mistress finding no obstacle to her design appeared again at the same place and their meeting was the second time less embarrassed by timidity than the first the cavalier who had a great deal of wit said a tliouialtld fine things to his mistress who replied to them in as lively a manner this conversation lasted for three hours and tfleir discourse was mingled with innocent caresses  so that the second interview pleased them both as much as the first che prudent scintila was again obliged to separate them again and again they accused her of cruelty not reflecting that though she disturbed their pleasures it was only with a view to render them more lasting for in fact they continued to enjoy their stolen interviews with so much secrecy and good management that not a soul livjiugt knew of them but the old woman and one other person t this other person was a young man of rank namded horatio a native of this city lie also loved clorinia having by chance seen her at her lattice and had revealed his love to her by signs  but finding them very badly received he concluded that he had a rival wsho was mole happy and judged that rival to he lorido as he was united in so strict a friendship with valerio to clear upi his wellfounded suspicions he sought out dorido who was one of his friends to vwhom lie spoke in these words  aly dear dorido i am come to ask a favour of yno and i conjure you not to refuse me my happiness depends upon it you are cointinually with valerio  you very often visit at his house aid i cannot help thinking that vou ale in love with his sister  if i ami mistaken in my conjectures oblige me by declaring it y ou are too well deserving the heart of that lady for me to venture to dispute it with you  you love clorinia then exclaimed iorido a little ruffled i i confess that i am quite charmed with her replied ihoratio  but nevertheless i do you justice and agree that you dese rve letter than i can the happiness of being her husband  lhet us speak without flatterv interrupted dorido  i should doubtless consider myself highly honoured in hecoiningr the husband of clorinia but  frankly eonfess to you that i have no designi to marry her  is it possible cried horatio eagerly  that you do not mean to mnarry her all i my friend how different are my intentions from yours aly highest ambition is to unite my fate with hers  your views should yield to mine  sacrifice the mad hopes you have conceived i expect this effort from your friendship and your virtue  you might add said dorido  that i owe it to the family of lorinia yes continued lie  i will leave the field open to you and if valerios sister should accept your addresses and consent to give you her hand i will cease to be your rival i vill do more i will speak in your favour and i assure you that in that case it shall not be my fault if your wishes are not fulfilled horatio was so well satisfied w ith this speech that he testified his gratitude to iorido without thinking that his promise ivas only conditional and therefore that he ought to mistrust it lie made no reflection of this kind but even requested dorido to use his good offices in his behalf with clorinia dorido could not but be touched at the frankness of horatio and being generosl ellough to prefer the huippiness of his friend to his own inclinations as his views were purer he resolved to do all in his power to wean his affections from this lady in fact the very next time he saw her he addressed her thus  you are not ignorant madam that horatio is added to the ntinber of your slaves lut i am doubtful whether you know how truly he adores you learn then that he thinks only of you and that to receive your hand is the only wish of his heart  i am chairmed to hear it replied clorinia  my reception of him shall convince you how little i wish for any lover but dorido   well know replied the cavalier  the value of a preference so glorious for me but i should think that i abused your goodness if i wvas not capable of some selfdenial  horatio has inany good qualities and when you know him better you will not be srrv perhaps if your friends should second ils wishes  how l cried the lady  to hear you is enough to make me believe that you wish to make me miserable is it possible that you can wish me to reply to the tenderness of horatio i i never answered dorido   i have no such thought i only wished to convince you that if you feel any inclination for lloratio and your friends approve of his addresses my heart would in vain rebel  that i would sacrifice mnselfto the happiness of my rival to show you how entirely devoted i am to all your vishes  i fear replied she  that the victim would be as submissive as you represent him and that your love for me is not quite so sincere as you profess it to be but continued she  i do not pretend to put you to the trial dorido shall be my first lover and my last upon this assurance you may rely let horatio persevere as much as he pleases in his love for me he will never be more successful i will confess to you that i was acquainted with his passion which i learned from his gestures before my window and have been so little pleased lb it that i have conceived a dislike for him which almost borders on hatred  after these words iorido did not dare to mention hioratio again as he perceived very plainly that the topic was extremely disagreeable to clorinia lie changed the conversation for the rest of the time they were together and the night was passed in mutual lrotestations of eternal love on the next day dorido received a visit from horatio i well my friend said the latter i have you seen clorinia  did any thing fall from her lovely lips which could be interpreted in my favour  i am very sorry replied the other  that i cannot give you a very flattering account you have but little room for hope 1 extollrd your merit i pointed out the splendour of the alliance i represented you as much more in love with her than perhaps you really are  but the cruel beauty silenced me by declaring that she could not reply to your love and that the soft bonds of ilymen should never unite her fate with yours at these words lioratio turned pale and fell into a profound reverie  while uorido symathising in hlis grief like a true friend pointed out to him that he ought to reliiiilnih his pretensions rather than attempt to constrain the incli nations of clorinta and that there were in room many other ladies equally amiable who would do more justice to his merit  to conclude my dear horatio added he  i am sure i have given you no cause to be dissatisfied with me i would willingly have yielded the sister of alerio to you provided she had been at all inclined to fiavour your passion i would have made this sacrifice to friendship can you now refuse to abandon a conquest that you are by no means sure to gain  horatio theit broke silence and replied to his friend far from reproacling you i must consider myself under a great obligation to you tor the service you have fruitlessly attempted to render ine in pleading my cause i confess that it is more reasonable i should renolunce mily pretensions to a hand which 1 am not alble to obtain than that you should relinquish a heart which you already ossess0 farewell iny triend i will spare no ains to enable me to profit by your advice and formi an

tou conpuer his pa ssion for a woman whose illgratitude convinced him that lie loved liter too well but his intentions were fiar diil ferent lie looked upon iorido as a traitor lle is a false friend

feel as acutely as you the misfortune of clorinia upon this the two friends separated ldorido returned homewards vowing to listen only to his anger in the revenge which he purposed to take upon horatio for he could suspect no one but him of having committed this action as soon as he arrived at home lie shut himself up in his chamber that he might freely lament the loss of his mistress  my

shall i have sacrificed horatio to your ashes than i also will join you in eternal darkness oh i that it were permitted to thee to see and rejoice in the just vengeance whichi will intlict on the wretch who has dared to deprive thee of thy innocent hand thuiis did iorido bewail his mistresss fate until daybreak when lie repaired to her house where every one was in the greatest distress and agitation valerio and his father seemed to be doubly afflicted at the sight of him and they embraced each other almost drowned in tears  oh dorido my son said ihe old man  my daughter is at the point of death having lost so great a quantity of blood as alone would be sufficient to terminate her existence was there ever so unfortunate a father who can have been capable of committiug so horrible an act  what punishment can console us under our present affliction  sir answered dorido  suspend we our lamentations for a while and let us think of one thing only which concerns us all the author of this misery must perish i will inflict on him an adequate punishment but before i execute a revenge on him which shall astonish and horrify posterity i must make myself what i now am not receive me therefore for your soninlaw it will be more for the konotir of us all that it should be said that clorinia was avenged by her husband than by her fathers friend  both fattier and son accepted doridos

thc majority of english readers even those who have travelled abroad and lived in paris are lut imperfectly acquainted with the old court life of france they know something but little of the names of certain kings they know nothing or what is popularly called next to nothing of the people who surrounded those kings and who were often less puppets than movers and impellers of the sovereign such courtlife details present themselves to most readers as the scenes of a new drama on a subject if not entirely novel yet strange and attractive to an audience wearied with authors and actors who year after year go on thrashing the same modicum of chaff in such dramas as this court life there is great splendour com bined with much variety mrs elliots history is not strictly  history she makes her characters speak aa she imagines they would be likely to speak and we must say that mrs elliots imaginative powers are considerable she indulges in such writing as we find in sensation novels and allows us to witness a very liberal quantity of caressing and kissing which we dare say took place as described or ought to have taken place and so is artistically put in but when  stopping her mouth

mrs elliots volumes begin with francis the first and close with louis the fourteenth the former king has always appeared to us as a fortunate ruffian who has had honour far beyond his deserts except valour of a certain sort he had not a single virtue and what would a man be without  the manly heart courage 1 louis the fourteenth was more of a gentleman in his vices than francis the valour of the grand monarque however was not of such a heroic nature as flatterers have proclaimed it to be louis southeast plaint de sa grandeur qui lattache aa rivage was not meant for satire but nothing more sarcastic was ever uttered it might have been said by a courtfool instead of by a courtly poet like boileau there is if the word be permitted a  rascalry  about most of the fine gentlemen who figure in the old court life francis the first could praise the virtue which he could not prize  her soul is as a rose without a thorn he said of his wife claude whom he killed by his brutal indifference mrs elliot truly says of the position of diana de poictiers mistress of the king and next of his son that nothing can more mark the freedom of the times than this liaison and she speaks of diana as being  one of the brightest ornaments of the court the royal mistress was in truth as beautiful a piece of shabbiness as ever lived but morals were in a very confused state francis who after his capture at pavia said or is suppose to have said all is lost except honour stooped to tell a lie in order to get free and according to mrs elliot his sister marguerite prompted the chivalrous monarch to that unchivalrous act when mary stuart appears upon the scene there is a sense of a pleasant change but mrs elliot might have made more of her that hapless queen never looks so bright as when saying smart things against catherine de medicis the marquis de bouilli has noted some of them in his  history of the dukes of guise mary took especial delight in expressing her contempt for catherine as belonging to a family that had been in trade perhaps mrs elliot has been afraid to say of marguerite de navarre all that was to be said and indeed it would make the hair stand on end to read it  she lives in a world of intrigue is a mild form of speech by which to describe one side of the life of this orthodox and erotic lady while to say that  she pendulates between henri de guise and le molle and a thousand other flirtations is a form indicating a certain regularity in a life which was altogether irregular we confess to little or no admiration for most of these people we do not feel any remarkable reverence for that vert galant henri quatre nor do we acquiesce in mrs elliots judgement as to the feminine tenderness of henris mistress gabrielle destrees the mother of henris son the duke of vendome in succeeding chapters the romance of history is not so well told as the history without the romance in the count de st aulaires  histoire de la fronde and when we come to the period of louis the fourteenth we hardly know which are the worse the showy swaggering men or the audacious shameless women lauzun was the typical frenchman of a long period there are a few exceptionally good individuals who occasionally turn up in the moving crowds at the court of louis the fourteenth and ono la valliere who like the young augustine thought pleasure should come before repentance a scene between the lady and louis the fourteenth will give the reader au idea of what we may call the subdued lovestyle of the writer in which she calls in the imagination of her readers to endorse her own   pressed by the king to grant him some mark of her favour la valliere becomes so confused she cannot reply louis grows more and more pressing interpreting her emotion as favourable to his suit in the midst of the tenderest entreaties the thunder again bursts forth and poor louise overcome at once by fear love and remorse swoons away the king naturally receives the precious burden in his arms he seeks hastily to rejoin the other fugitives and his attendants in order to obtain assistance ever and anon he stops in the openings of the forest to admire her as she lies calm and lovely in repose her long eyelashes sweeping her delicate cheeks her halfclosed lips revealing the prettiest and whitest teeth i leave my readers to imagine if louis did not imprint a few kisses on the fainting beauty ho bears so carefully in his arms and if now and then he did not press her beloved form closer to his breast if in this he did take advantage of thc situation chance bad afforded him he must be forgiven  he was young and he was deeply in love words cannot describe the surprise felt by la valliere on recovering to find herself alone born along in the kings arms in the midst of a lonely forest history does not however record that she died of terror or that she even screamed  but perhaps and indeed doubtless she would have done so had not the respectful behaviour of the king reassured her  old court life in france old court life in france by frances elliot chapman and hall historical romance is the handmaid of history even when history has emancipated itself from the level details of the old chroniclers and lives for us in the pages of a macaulay or a froude with something of the passions and changing interests of real humanity there yet remains a place for the historical romance history i3 by profession at least impartial its backward gaze is too comprehensive to allow minute portraiture its aims are too lofty to admit of any but the widest sympathy the nation or the individual as he contributes to the national life is the historians theme in his true function he is a methodioal accountant taking stock of the past who omits nothing balances the errors of one man against the failings of another the greatness of one state against the ambition of another adds nothing to and takes nothing from the facts and figures that lie before him and finally presents the world with his estimate of results in however perfect a manner this operation be performed it is evident that there is yet room for the historical romance rightly composed the romance clothes its heroes with no more living and personal interest than they possessed ra the flesh  but it contrives by a due subordination of details an artful grouping of the principal figures and a light as of the natural heavens thrown on the picture from above to make the whole world appear subservient to that particular spot in space where the little drama enacts itself if the rom ancewriter is a poet so much the better shakespeare though he drew from no other source than dry old hollingshed has filled the story of the plantagenets as far as he told it with life and energy  calling to his aid the fluellens the bardolphs and the falstaffs he made the reigns of our plantagenets something more than landmarks of english history if we had one sterling writer of national romances with genius enough to raise him above the level track of history and yet no coiner of mere fancy with an alloy of fact we should perhaps be greater as a nation in proportion as we saw in the light of today the greatness and littleness of the past mrs elliot does not write historical romance in this way she occupies an intermediate place between the romancer and the historian she presents history in what margaret of newcastle would have called a  romancical dress her method lacks the continuity and completeness of dumas but it allows of greater accuracy and a closer study of character useless details are avoided the material is scanty and at times almost crude  but irrelevant matters are suppressed and those on which must hinge our conceptions of the mans character are thrust sedulously to the front it must be confessed that to interest the reader on such a plan is an arduous attempt it would have been easy to fill in the story with a few legitimate and even historical incidents but mrs elliot has it seems feared to mar the general effect by redundancy  she has avoided the full narrative style of miss freer for instance and elaborated instead a series of animated scenes which in word gesture dress and attitude are intended to be the counterpart of history that mrs elliott has failed sometimes to present in due relief the historical personages who serve as subjects for her nice pen is not to be wondered at that she has succeeded so well as she has is a matter of congratulation one danger we may safely say she has entirely escaped her chapters though often short and fuller of matter than of words are never tediously epigrammatic though it is impossible in this style of work that the artist should be lost in the picture you are not called away too often to admire her artistic qualities the first eight chapters of old court life in france are devoted to francis i his two queens first claude and then elinor of spain one blameless layfigure succeeding another appear the necessary appanages of a court diane de poitier and anne duchesse detampes are the true queens of the hour mistresses not only of the king but in some small degree of the destinies of france the dynasty of mistresses is however scarcely inaugurated in the time of francis the first marguerite de valois and constable bourbon complete the picture in this first essay however mrs elliot is by no means at her best the second group fuller of dramatic incidents offers greater facilities for success catherine de medici the mother of three worthless kings the organiser of the squadron of court beauties the inventor of the sidesaddle forms the central figure from the time fatherinlaw francis  romped with her the entire evening after her arrival to the day when half a century later she lay on her deathbed while the due de guise was murdered overhead this was that due de guise whom the second marguerite de valois would have married but that her mothers ruthless will gave her to the bearnois henry of navarre most of those men whose fortunes and destinies were mingled with catherines during her halfcentury of power and in whom dumas found a neverending source of mystery and intrigue cross mrs elliots stage she has treated them and everything that concerns catherine with much dramatic power and we are inclined to think that this series contains the best written of her sketches as a specimen of vivid description take this of the familiar party of three mother and two sons watching the st bartholomew massacre from a closet over the gate of the louvre to them enter navarre and conde heretics but royal ones who have escaped partly by favour but as it appears mainly by chance charles had recovered his nerves he now looks on huguenots as game and has been potting them with

already the scenes which unfold the life of henri iv are scantier than we could wish and the episode of gabrielle destrees occupies rather too many of them undoubtedly the most important figure in her  show of kings henri iv deserves a larger space than mrs elliot has allotted to him quitting henri iv mrs elliot comes to the times of richelieu mazarin and anne of austria annes husband the bilious and melancholy louis xih surnamed  the just is summoned to live again his miserable unkingly career in her pages and we then drop suddenly upon louis xiv inaugurating his reign with the ruin of la valliere we cannot however attempt to follow le grand monarque whose court life occupies the latter half of mrs elliots second volume the sketches grow more voluminous towards the close  the last of them is called  the end and from it we make the following quotation  then the dying monarch turned his face towards madame de maintenon who was seated within the ruelle of the bed 41 madame he said in a low voice  i regret no one but you i have not made you happy his voice hitherto firm now faltered but i have one consolation in leaving you he added  we shall soon meet again he tried to look at her but madame de maintenon turned from him with disgust she huddered  what a rendezvous  she muttered half aloud  he cares for no one but himself bolduc the kings apothecary was near and heard her say so that very day she left him while he dozed and drove away to saintcyr on sunday the 1st of september louis died his confessor the jesuit letellier never returned madame de maintenon remained at saintcyr save the cardinal de rohan and the parish priest of versailles all had forsaken him no sooner had  breathed his last than precautions were necessary to guard his body from insult  e are not of the opinion that much is to be learned from the extravagant licence and splendid vices that ruled te court of france mrs elliot has confined her story within courtly bounds and offends no one by the plainness of her speech but after all an intrigue is an intrigue whether the parties to it are kings and duchesses or grooms and servingwomen  and we venture to doubt the ultimate use of such a book as mrs elliot has produced with this reservation we confess to a keen appreciation of the artistic merits ot  ula uourt late in trance hp  oli court life in france this is the fifth edition of a book that has had many readers and many critics it is the kind of book that is especially annoying to scientific students of history who are both jealous and scornful of narratives treated without tootnotes and without much visible aid from documentary evidence unless they are labelled  imaginative literature mere scraps of history in picturesque setting lay figures with historic names affixed and made to play the part which some contemporary gossip has assigned to them are to their mind frivolous and from an educational point of view dangerous the critics are wrong we should never think of going to such books for exact information on every page of this one for instance we feel how the materials have been cooked the scantiest knowledge of history is enough to make us often read characters and motives differently but it does give the popular idea and picture of the personages and events described from a long study of contemporary memoirs from long familiarity with the country the authoress has learned the fitting stage properties has noted the gossip and the anecdotes she has used all her gathered materials not with imaginative power but with the skill and swiftness of the scene painter and scene shifter the result is a nondescript kind of thing neither history nor romance but it is very readable it is a very vivid series of pictures we are given of the princes and lords and ladies of gay old france from francis and marguerite of valois and diane de poitiers down to the last days of the grand monarque when court gaiety died out under the heavy influence of the

B4754,['5781119'],  the history of matthew wald i i e i f is no feature in which the novels of our age liffer more from those of the last than in the speculative and ideal cast which they have assuned the bustling plots crowded with incidentsthe characters leveloping themselves only in action the brief and meagre descriptions the system which considered subjert as every thing and execution a matter of comparative insignificance have been supplanted by more intellectual and we cannot help thinking more interesting views plots have become simple even to poverty the province of action has been narrowed to extend that of thought feeling has become the mainspring of interest and its analyses and expression the test of talent descriptions of external nature have become more graphical and mi nnte and their connexion with the business of the taleas influencing by their secret but sensible power the feelings of the agentsis better understood and rendered more effective and available the first of these systems certainly indicates a want of refined feeling in the public it was altogether of a meaner and more mechanical castit addressed itself to a lower class of feelings and might have been acted on by minds of no deep feeling and even of scanty invention for though the process of creating an original story is one of no trifling effort the task of combination or disjunction is not a difficult one and a very slight acquaintance with the history of fiction enables us to see how frequently the composition of these novels of incident has been a work of alteration rather than invention they had one advantage however in the very mediocrity of the principle on which they were constructed they were seldom tiresome if the reader perused them with little of that deep thrillin interest which he now feels we have no doubt he yawned less also if he wept lessbe laughed more there were fewer chances of failure for the effect of a sequence of ludicrous or striking incidents admitted of little variation and in the hands of an author of the greatest or the most slender talent produced only a pleasure differing a little in degree but the more ambitious system of modern novelists while it renders the power of genius more visible and vindicates more certainly its lreeminence over mediocrity makes the works of the lesser herd utterly wretched and intolerable destitute of those hum bler attractions of plot and incident which they might have attained andl filled with ludicrous and impotent straining after those more magnificent qualities which it is hopeless for them to emulate or aspire to the present work has nothing to do however with these it belongs to the higher class and if we wished to prove the superiority of that principle of effect on which our modern tales are constructed we know not where we should find a better example wdith a plot of a grosslydefective kindwith few incidentsfew characters of importance and one the most interesting of these appearing only and disappearing as in a dreamwith little aid from humour and less from the mere paint ing of external nature in short by the mere force and grandeur of individual scenes and the general eloquence and beauty of the writing this tale creates and maintains the deepest and most vivid interest and we close it at last with those feelings of dreariness and desolation with which we peruse the remorse of caleb williams or the settled gloom of st leon after his final parting with his son often in the course of the story we feel the unsatisfactory na ture of some of the incidentsthe want of connectionof explanation theunreasonablesupinenessof some of the characters at one time and their fiery and needless impatience at others with a multitude of et cetera but still we are hurried along by the impetuosity of the narrative and it is only when we have fairly finished that we have time to think of all the authors offences against consistency and to wonder how with so many faults obvious to every one we should have so yielded to its influence but the truth is aw this only shews how little sucl things 4 d weigh in the balance of excellence and how easily the atoning power of genius can efface such errors the author is evidently a man of great talent his humour to be sure we do not much like but his pathos his scenes of passion and his eloquence are of the highest kind his conception of character we estimate more highly from his reginald dale tonne than from the present work yet even here there is a wonderful effect about his sketches his females we have always thought particularly captivating athanasia was very good andl helen hesketh admirable of the heroine of this tale we see almost nothingsbe is remorselessly married in the beginning and passes only once before our eyes until the conclusionand yet even this unsubstantial pageant has something about it that lingers in our memory another beautiful and quiet female is opposed to her gentle affectionate and tinged with religious melan choly and her character is touched with the same chaste and powerful pencil wald himself we cannot help thinking disagreeable and none of the subordinate agents of the story are particularly interesting but we suppose the reader would rather form his own opinion and though it is difficult to select any pasage that can give a proper idea of the characteristic vigour of the book we shall extract a few of the shortest accompanying them only by such a notice as to render them intelligible the story is related like those of godwin in the first person an arrangement well suited to such tales as depend for their effect on the expose of feeling and particularly to those where the narrator poees no extraordinary qualities euther of evil or good and may therefore detail bin feeings without any great violation of modesty on the one hand or of wba bility on the other matthew wald is te descendant of a family et norman extraction which

in the family and who soon begins to curtail his amusements and to treat him with harshness an in cilent of this kind which young wald revenges with a ferocity above his years leads to his removal to the university of st andrews where he quietly spends two winters in pursuing his studies a sudden resolution strikes him to revisit blackford and it is here that the real interest of the tale begins his feelings when on his arrival he finds a general appearance of restraint and coldness and the attentions of his cousin and his aunt devoted to a fashionable in mate of the housethe honourable mr lascelynethe succession of little incidents trifling in themselves that work upon and irritate his tem per are imagined and executed with great art and probability the fli nishing stroke is given by a

now thought it would be as well to close it again as i was walking on tiptoe across the room my eye fell on two little black profiles of katharine and myself that we had sat for to an itinerant limner when we were children and which had ever since hung over the chim neypiece i took katharines off the nail and held it for a minute or two in my hand but the folly of the thing flashed upon me in a

fixed my eyes on the opposite wallthe side of the room along which she was wot to pass i was fixedi was a statue and yet i trembled to the bone to think that perhaps the skirt of her gar ment might be

and the old trees about the bhse were groaning and th leaves fall ing thick about m sdenly two horsemen came canter ia coe by me the first reined his horse and the light from the hall stream ed full upon laseelynes face he dis mounted and i could not but hear what he said to his groom  tell them said he  that your lady will require the car riage immediately after breakfast in the morning mty horses at the same time for we have a longish sttage tomorrow  yes my lord said the man and i saw the one enter the house and the other take the way towards the stables i prowled about the woods a while and then denned myself in my garret and i need scarcely say that i did not honour the distinguished company with my presence at their breakfasttable next morning but how acute was my ear how distinctly did i hear the carriage steps slap and the wheels begin to roll the death of sir claud breaks up the party wald commences sur geon in the county town in the neigh bourhood and joanne retires to the residence of that old servant who had related her story to matthew wald the following is the picture of their retirement and of one of the visits of wald i deferred this visit therefore till the last evening of my stay when i easily found my way to a lonely and as lovely a retreat certainly as ever sheltered the infirmities of age or the sorrows of youth fast by the green margin of the noble ora and embowered among the fading foliage of his birches stood the little rustic shieling for which that gentle child of misfortune had left the hall of her fa therm the hill rose precipitous behind clothed to the loftiest crag with copses wood from the midst of which here and there the red gigantic trunks of the native pine towered upwards waith their broad sable canopies the wide stream rolling in heavy murmurs close under neath the branches of the trees its dark brown waters gleaming with the gold of the sunset appeared to cut off the wilders ness it embellished from every intrusion of the world asmllu skiff lay chained to the bankand slowly did i urge it with my single strength against the deep and steady flow of the autumnal river from without the appearance of the cottage itself was rude and even desolate but within the habits of another life had already in the course of but a few days begun their triumph i had to stoop ere i could pass the threshold and i trod upon a floor of naked earth but the exquisite cleanliness that had entered with the new inhabitants had of itself robbed poverty of all its meoness every thing upon the walls shone bright in the blaze of the nicelytrimmed wood fire and mammy sat in her elbowchair at the side of it a perfect specimen of the nmajestic repose of extreme but unbend ing age it seemed to me that there was something far more grand about the whole appearance of the old woman now that i saw her under her own paternal roof the bluntness of address and expression which had before been a sort of oddity to amuse a circle of tolerant superiors was now the natural privilege of indepen dence though indeed i am not sure that the sense of home and the instinct of hospitality had not somewhat softened already the external manifestations of a temper which no change of circumstan ces could have essentially altered i was received with courtesyeven with grace and when a minute or two afterwards miss joanne came into the room and modestly saluting me drew her stool towards m1ammys knee i really could not help thinking that in spite of all the young ladys native elegance of aspect and carriage a stranger might easily have been deceived and supposed himself to be contemplating a family group i you will have no great difficulty in believing could not contemplate it with out some feelings of awkwardness as well as of admiration the situation in which i saw joanne bar was new and her demeanour i could not help thinking was almost as greatly changed we had been used to treat each other like friends some spell seemed now to hover over us both our eyes seldom met and neither addressed more than a few syllables to the othershe took her work and i sat listening or pretending to listen to mammy at last i contrived to make it be understood that i had come to take my farewell that i was to leave the country the next morning mammy gave me her blessing very affectionately and i bowed to joanne the poor girl said nothing but in a very low whisper it was  i wish you well sir wherever you go she did not put out her hand and i retired stammering more good byes i jumped into my little boat and had pushed myself a few yards from the brink when i heard my name called in joannes sweet voice and perceived that she had followed me to the bank of the river and was holding something towards me in her hand i ran theskifin again and shc tooped to give me my gloves which i had le behind me our hands touch ed each otherand in the deepening twilight and in the midst of some con fusion of my own i could not be blind to the blush the deep grave timid blush and the troubled workings of that half averted eye how much may pass in a moment my little boat was out in the stream again almost instantly and yet the words return and hope had been whispered and while in rowing acros the river my eyes were fixed upon the lowly cabin i perceived that a shadow was still lingering in the windowand a soft dream floated over my heart that some day i should indeed return and that the world after all might still re tain some visions of hopeay of tender ness and soothing consolation for me even for me no fiery pulse beatno maddening ecstasy or passion fluttered in my brain these were strings which had been snapt but a calm pensive feeling was deep upon me i cannot explain it no man loves twice perhaps in the same sense of the word but although the pinetree will never sprout again after he has been levelled to the ground what need hinder plants of humbler statute yet of softer foliage to spring from the soil beneath which his ponderous roots are mouldering joanne and wald are marriedand great changes follow wald re covers evidence that the connexion between sir claud and the mother of joanne had been such as would according to the law of scotland amount to a regular marriage and that his wife was consequently the heiress of his estatesand the fa mily of sir claud are glad to com promise the matter by ceding to him the property of barrmains his hap piness is qualified however by a strong metlodistical feeling to which the gentle mind of joanne had been for some time yielding and to di vert her

over a good deal of a comic cast which is fairly executed but exceedingly inferior to the deeper parts of the book to which we now approach with rapidity wald receives the unexpected intelligence that

B538,['6662006'],  general literature and art traditions and hearthside stories of west cornwall by w bottrell penzance  w cornish london  trubner ever since the brothers grimm published the german popular stories of the rhineland under the title of kinderwid haustndrchen nursery tales and popular fiction of all ages have been looked on in a new light it was soon seen that much of early mythology was embodied in them the  sleeping beauty for instance can be traced back to the early myth which symbolises spring being awakened by the suns touch doing away the sleep of winter the process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls of the ionian chieftains did no otherwise in any case these stories illustrate the social life of our own immediate ancestors in the time when reading had not taken the place of recitation and public interests were not so absorbing as personal talk and home side stones c w boase,juvenile_contra

than any within our recollection and these have been with two or three exceptions remarkable for their inferiority no fresh talent has male its appearance to dispel the languor of the premature logdays no promise of future excellence has rejoiced the heart of the reviewer whose business it is not merely to praise what is well accomplished but to note the sians of an  all hail hereafter which by kindly encouragement he may stimulate to the exertions necessary to success and still though no new aspirants for fame have come forth they whose popularity has been already achieved have withdrawn from the field as if they had no stimulus to exertion in the absence of rivalry mrs gone alone of those who hold the highest place among our living novelists has at the latest moment thrown in her contribution to the summer reading of her majestys liegres during that period called holiday when removed from their usual occupations they find it difficult to kill the time that spite of all their endeavours will  limp so tediously away if mrs gore has written better things than the thitntante she certainly has never lighted upon a more taking i title the very name is enough to kindle curiosity

with whom they are familiar all who are yet in happy ignorance of that gilt and lpasteboard paradisewill devour it with equal appetitebelieving that here they will be introduced in fancy at least to the o elysium of their young dreams ihe former it may be will not find their expectations gratified the painting is after the life but not from the life mrs gore has not singled out this or that individual and made him sit for his portrait but she has embodied in a creation of her own the characteristic traits she has seen in society and thus she has contrived to be truthful without being personal the debutaote as its name implies is a story to which every london season might produce its parallel with little more than a change of name a young lady with a large fortune is suddenly plunged into the whirl of spring life in this metropolis she is of course the game at which all the birds of prey who infest those l circles make their quarry but she is wanting in principle and without any genuine feeling and she contrives a sort of flirtation with charles barrington who i can boast no more either of feeling or principle than herself the dibutante ultimately marries a wornout debauchee lord mortayne who had once intrigued with her mother who it seems is a divorcee mr charles barrington marries a passee lady with a l title after a time the pair meet again and renew their i flirtation harmlesaly enough but sufficiently to enable i friends  to talk and illnature to insinuate the worst i suspicions of his wife into lord mortayne who is apt i to judge others by

it diverse episodes are introduced upon which we 1o not touch for reasons already assigned those who are familar with mrs gores writings and who is not will remember that herforte lies in the manner of telling her stories and not in the con struction of them she excels in bold and rapid touches that give us a fulllength in half a dozen lines in lively narrative that never lermits the reader to nod over her pages and in dramatic dialogues that are really lalkings and not speecifyings these traits to which she owes her popularity are manifest in the debutante and comparel with the productions of the other novelists of the season it is beyond measure the best but tried by another standardby her own previous performancesit must be pronounced inferior to most of them we regret to see that mrs gore is falling into the too common but most fatal fault of writing too fast because too much shlc has acquired by long practice a wvonderful facility of composition wve mean of the mechanical parts of it the construction of sentences and the putting of ideas readily into words but she has mistaken this flow of words for a flow of thouglhts hence a certain flimsiness in the matter which it is di

concluding notice we have already expressed our admiration of this book in terms more strong than wve are wont to use and do not think it necessary although we have dissented from dr meniess opinions inore than once to remind the reader of this fact wvitb a serious face we proceed to select from the elegant picturegallery with which the author has furnished uis such situations as inay of themselves tell the story of josephine we left lber kneeling in the triumph of completed hope tempered with all the delicacy and gentleness of her nature we reproduce her in the daily routine of grandeur unchanged unspoiled  we may well conceive the vexations occasioned by this host of petty observances to those sturdy veterans who wvere more conversant with the battlefield than the boudoir doubtless however the ridicule which has attached to the mianners of napoleons court has been greatly exaggerated and from evident design in writings published by renegade courtiers since the restoration we bave josephines own authority whose judgement and taste are indisputable that the emperor himself from the first observed with ease the habitudes of his rank m ost ccrtainly such are her own words when conversing in the little circle of her own exiled court  most truly do i regard the emperor as a man who has no equal in camps at the council board they find him extraordinary but in the interior of his palace he ever appeared to me still more remarkable i contess that notwithstanding my experience of the world and its usages the commencement of the imperial forms embarrassed me the emperor on the contrary made a sport a pleasure of them and in all the palace lie alone beyond contradiction best understood their observances lannes who enjoyed full licence of speech made mockery of what he termed  the hypocrisies of political worship  but estimatint such things at their real value the emperor regamds them under relations more elevated and conceives that in the eyes of the people they conduce to restore to powrer the majesty and ascendency which so many years of anarchy had destroyed he grants in truth that their principal influenice springs from the personal qlulities of those invested with the supreme rule but he maintains that without equalling or superseding these qualities ceremonial institutions may supply their place with advantage in supporting sluch a system napoleon shows himself at least veery disinterested for wvho can stamid less in need of appliances to impose tipon men than one who seems born to govern  in proof of his argument he adduces the example of a crowd of princes who have reigned so to speak rather seated or lying than standing upright but whose couch glrken by the barriers of etiquette has been respected like al sanr tnarv   of these views added josephine  i did not altogether approve but submitted to them  and indeed her whole czonduct showed that whatever tended to substittite torm for sentiment or ilace

hose first desire was to be loved in this sense bhe migtht hiae said  never lid subject long to he a queen as i 10 long and wish to lie a subject at the commencement of the empire the etiquette of which she chiefly complained was that which obliged her to remain seated while she received those who had lately been her equals or even her superiors in raulk nothizg could be more amiable than her reception of those ladies who came to take the oaths of fidelity on receiving ap pointments inl the imperial household she took care to remove all ostentatious ceremonywas usually accompanied only by her first lady of honourtalked to the neophyte who was often an old acquaintance of their former intimacy or on such topics as might render less sensible the difference between their present station and make the whole pass as an agreement between two friends to love each other this condescension extended even to her humble domestics yet never degenerated into undignified familiarity or absence of selfpossession as the following little incident testifies on the very first occasion of her leaving st cloud for a distant excursion as empress josephine traversed a whole suite of apartments though pressed for time to give directions to a very subaltern person of her household on returning the grand steward remonstrated very respectfully on thus compromising the dignity of the crown and that her majesty should give orders through him the empress upon this gaily replied you are quite right my good sir and such neglect of etiquette might be altogether inexcusable in a princess born to a throne and trained to the restraints which it imposes but have the goodness to recollect that i have enjoyed the felicity of living so many years as a private individual and do not take it amiss if i sometimes venture to speak kindly to my servants without an interpreter there is something excessively winning in that lurk ing childishness which sometimes breaks out so fascina tingly in woman and nowhere have we seen a more charming exemplification of the remark than in this little anecdote no wonder then setting apart her affection that josephine on all occasions evinced so strong a desire to be permitted to accompany her husband on his part napoleon loved to indulge this wish and they differed only as to its being always possible on one occasion however after promising to take the empress something having occurred to alter his intention and to require speed he resolved on departing privately without his companion fixing accordinigly one oclock in the morning the hour wheel she was most likely to be asleep for the timne of setting out he was just about to step into the carriage whene josephine in most piteous plight threw herself into his arms by some means she had obtained itiformation of what was going forward and called her wom en but impatient of any delay had got up without waitingt for them and throwing about her the first drapery she could lay hands upon had rushed down stairs in slippers without stockings  wveeping as our authority an eyewitness expresses it  like a little girl when the hzolidlays are over a moment later and napoleon would have been off like lightning bit he could rarely withstand the tears of his wife so placing her along the bottomr of the carriage he covered her with his travelling pelisse giving orders himselftabout tile clothes antd proper attendants of the empress but we nust have a peep at her domestic privacy and that was elegrant andl refihied as her public appearances were remote from hollow pretemisioni  from about midday till halfpast two or three oclock was passed by the empress in her apartments working conversing and reading with her ladies we have already mnentionedl how beautifully josephine embroidered anrd this accomplishment continuied to be her chief amusement much of the most sllendid furniture ill the various palaces beingo covered with piecers executed by her own hand with the a3ssistane of her ladies the following billet is a curious melange of orders pertaining to these labours while it shows how kindly josephine addressed even her inferior attendwatts  to aubert femine le cambzce to

quickly  while the rest were at work one of the ladies permanently appointed to the office of reader read aloud at such times as conversation was not preferred when any literary production gave more than usual pleasure it was immediately begun from the commencement and perused a second time the volumes selected were interesting but useful books from the standard writers arid all new publications of repute works of taste and imagination constituted of course a large portion of these public readings novels however unless in particular instances were excluded napoleon indeed disliked to see novels anywhere about his palaces anti traversing the antechambers if he found any of his attendants reading he seldom failed to examine the book andif a novel condemned it to the flames without mercy the individual too was sure of a lecture which usually began with the question so you could find no better reading than that while the empress and her ladies were engaged as described the emperor was in the habit of looking in upon the fair party at intervals throughout the morning on these occasions he is described as being extremely amiable amusing and iii high spirits for he rarely visited the saloon in the morning unless when in good humour or in his own phrase w hen things wvent well josephine too though more rarely would venture into his cabinet but when he required her presence for any conference of importance napoleon knocked at the little door of private communication the empress joyfully obeyed the signal and these interviews generally taking place in the evening were often continued so long that on returning she found all her ladies asleep the masquerading adventures of the imperial pair are highly characteristic  the winter of 1808 was one of the gayest which paris had yet witnessed under the empire miaskel balls were especial favourites and those of the ambassador for the new kingdom of italy were particularly listitiguished for their splendour napoleon contrlary

ilestined for declaring his final determination to josephine she had wept all day they were to dine together as usual and to conceal her tears the empress wvore a large rwhite hat fastened under the chiii which wvith its deep front shaded the whole of the utpper part of the face napoleon also had shown marks of the strongest agitationi he scarcely spoke to any one but with arms folded continued at intervals to pace his library alone from time to time a convulsive movement attended with a hectic flush passed for an instant across his features and at table when he raised his eye it was only to look by stealth upont the empress with an expression of the deepest regret the dinner was removed untouchednieither tasted a morsel and the only use to which napoleon turned his knife was to strike mechanically upon the edge of his glass which lie appeared to dlo unconsciously and like one whose thoughts were painfully lireoccupied every thing during this sad repast seemed to presage the impending catastrophe the officers of the court even who were in attendance stood in motionless expectancy like men who look upon a sight they feel portends evil though what they know not not a sound was heard beyoiid the noise of placing and removing the untasted viands and the monotonous tiiikling already noticed  for the emperor spoke only once to ask at question without giving any attention to

sobbing which though inaudible shook her whole frame recovering by an effort her selfcommand josephinte piepared to ptour out the coffee when napoleon advancing to the paige performed the office for

park the empress and her suite retired to dress for dinner to which never less than from twelve to fifteen strangers sat down the evening passed in amusement conversation aud music and was always very gay owving to the number of visitors from paris at eleven tea ices and sweetmeats there served and at midnight the empress retired the apartments in which these reunions took place were elegant and spacious the furniture being covered with needlework on a ground of white silk wrought by the empress and her ladies but the residence altogether was small an inconvenience still farther increased through josephines veneration of every thing that had been napoleons the apartment which he had occupied remained exactly as he had left it she would not suffer even a chair to be moved and indeed very rarely permitted any one to enter keeping the key herself and dusting the articles with her own hands on the table was a volume of history with the page doubled down where he had finished reading beside it lay a pen with the ink dried on the point and a map of the world on which he was accustomed to point out his plans to those in his confidence and which still showed on its surface many marks of his impatience these josephine would not allow to be touched on any account by the wall stood napoleons campbed without curtains and above continued to bang such of his arms as he had placed there on different pieces of furniture were flung various portions of apparel just as he had used them last for among his other extraordinary ways he had a practice on retiring to rest of flinging rather than taking off his clothes casting down a coat here a vest there usually pitching his watch into the bed and his hat and shoes into the farthest corner of the apartment last scene of all  all these grievances preyed upon josephines spirits but without producing any appearance of disease till the 4th of may when she dined at st leu faith hortense eugene and the emperor of russia on returning to m almaison she felt a general uneasiness which however yielded to some gentle medicine and the empress resumed her ordinary occupations though evidently without the usual enjoyment some days after lord beverley with his two sons breakfasted at malmaison and to this nobleman josephine expressed herself warmly on the generosity of the english who at that time she said alone spoke of napoleon in a becoming manner she complained bitterly of the ingratitude of those who not satisfied with abandoning his falling fortunes overwhelmed his memory with calumny on the 10th alexander with several distinguished foreigners dined at malmaison josephine despite a headache and cold shiverings which she laboured to conceal did the honours of the table and in the evening attempted even to take a part in a game of  prisoners on the beautiful lawun in front of her residence how many painful associations must have connected themselves with this amusement both mind and body unfitted her for such exercise and she wvas con strained to become a spectator but with such an altered appearance as to excite the alarm of her guests to these anxious enquiries however she continued to reply with a faint smile which belied the assurance  that she was only fatigued and would be well tomorrow tomorrowv came but josephine wvas evidently worse and for fourteen days her complaint without assuming any definite form or rendering absolute confinement necessary was frequently attended at night with fainting aind sometimes a wandering of the mind more from anxiety than delirium onthe 24th the empress had a slight attack of sore throat but otherwise rallied so much as to insist on receiving the emperor of russia amld the king of prussia woho were engaged to dine with her on th at  sia it dccordtsvivy t1  butt x forced to retire and hortense who never left malmaisoi during her mothers illness took her place at table thenceforward the disease assumed a most alarming cha racter of gangrenous quinsy and its progress became fearfully rapid on the morning of the 25th alexander returned and filled with anxiety at the alteration in josephines appearance requested permission to send his owvn physician this the empress declined but from that day she was attended by her own and the two physicians attached to the households of her sotl anal daughter on the night of the 2627th a blister was applied between the shoulders and sinapisms to the feet but though these gave some relief from pain they effected no impression on the disease still josephine with the same angelic swveetness which had marked her whole life endeavoured by concealing her suffering to soothe the anxiety of her surrounding friends from the morning of the 26th she appears to have been perfectly sensible of her danger for looking then steadily upon the phy sician and perceiving his alarm she silently pressed his hand in token of consciousness and acquiescence she even took an interest in her former occupations and on the 27th when informed that the celebrated flowerpainter redoubt6 had come to draw two fiavourite plants in flower she sent for him extended her hand then pushed him gently away saying  you must not catch my sore throat for next week this was on wednesday  i hope to see you advanced with a fresh masterpiece the preceding night had passed in a lethargic sleep and at ten in the morning of the 28th the physicians after consulting deemed it proper to prepare eugene and iihitense for the final change from those two cherished beings whom she had loved so truly josephine heard a communication which thus lost all its i bitterness with pious resignation she received the last  rites of the itomish faith fiom the ministration of her grandchildrens preceptor for the parish clergyman of ruel happened to be absent late on the same day the emperor alexander arrived and was shown into the chamber of the sufferer now evidently approaching the goal of all her sorrows by the bed of their mother knelt eugene and ihortense too deeply moved to address the emperor but at sight of a monarch whom she regarded with gratitude josephine seemed to acquire renewed strength made a sign for all to approach and said at least i shall lie regretted i have always desired the happiness of france i did all in my power to contribute to it and i can say with truth to all of you now present at my last moments that the first wife of napoleon never caused a single tear to flow these were her last words for she fell immediately after into a slumber which continued interrupted by a scarcely audible sigh till halfpast eleven on the morning of the 29th of miay wvhen her gemitle spirit calmly passed to a world of love and peace we began with some notion that we would attempt a

B8269,"['8622119', '6250503']",  the newcomes memoirs of a most respectable family edited by arthur pendennis esq 2 vols with illustrations on steel and wood by richard doyle bradbury  evans mr thackerays fourth novel now complete furnishes little new matter for the critic his one view of life and manners his habitual mode of balancing good and evil are not consistent with the variety expected from a fertile and popular novelist few stories are more charming to read in separate pages than tales by the author of the newcomesfew when read in chapters or in volumes glide out of the grasp of attention with such slippery ease during the larger portion of the book before us our hearts are neither with charles honeyman nor clive newcome nor barnes the diabolical nor the simple colonel we are trying to audit the complicated account of motives and actions propounded by our calculatorto  check him  in his statements of debtor and creditorin his apportionments of honesty and humbug we are arrested by some brilliant piece of writing by some ingenious mosaic where cynicism is imbedded in the midst of pathos and while we pause to admire to discriminate lights from shades beholdthe tale and all the cares and concernments of its actors vanish like a dream yet this manner of proceeding is not inevitable to its author owing to any natural incapacity on his part to manage a story mr thackeray has few contemporaries who when they are themselves wrought up can work up their readers to emotion more certainly than he can the return to the curzon street casino of rawdon crawley from the sponginghouse in cursitor street is a masterpiece among scenes though told without a word of theatrical exaggeration thus too in the last two numbers of the newcomes when it became necessary for the novelist seriously to bend himself to the business of his talesince otherwise it could never have been wound upit is curious to see how the pococttrante humour vanishes in favour of something more direct more earnest more narrative and less speculativehow we are surprised into eager attention and quick remonstranceand fling down the book it last with an angry protest at the manner in which its  finest character passes from life under the shadow of wrong and petty tyranny bearing these with the resignation of a heart which however humble and just it be is therefore not the less a broken heart a novelist who can thus stir the blood and quicken the sympathies of readers well used to arts of display and stratagems of effect deals unfairly by his own gifts and his own calling as an artist in loitering be it ever so humorously philosophically picturesquely we do not demand course after course as dinnergivers say of striking events and exciting emotionsbut a story after all should be a story and not an essaynot a handful of characters for mr thackeray to lecture upon illustrating sir rogers philosophy much may be said on both sides the title of the newcomes indicates that it is another attempt to define 4 respectability as something different in its nature and bearings from what the world dreams  another story of solemn dullness and smooth hypocrisyof love forced into market by mercenary ambitionof honour trusting craving for affection planning beneficences toiling to complete them failing and its star going out under a cloud the life of the one man among the three newcome brothers if man and virtue mean the same thing the simple brave soldier is a failure from first to lasta failure in lovea failure in the schemes of happiness his kind heart had loved to plan for others if thomas newcome does not die in gloom and in sorrow it is only because he is more of a saint than any of his companionsthan we fear most real men we will not suppose that his fate was planned by mr thackeray in order that he might show us patience in fallen fortunes so beautifully framed as it is in the following picture 44 mention has been made once or twice in the course of this history of the grey friars school where the colonel and clive and i had been brought upan ancient foundation of the time of james i still subsisting in the heart of london city the deathday of the founder of the place is still kept solemnly by cistercians in the chapel where assemble the boys of the school and the fourscore old men of the hospital the founders tomi stands a huge edifice emblazoned with heraldic decorations and clumsy carved allegories there is an old hall a beautiful specimen of the architecture of jamess time an old halli many old halls old staircases old passages old chambers decorated with old portraits walking in the midst of which we walk as it were in the early seventeenth century to others than cistercians grey friars is a dreary place possibly nevertheless the pupils educated there love to revisit it and the oldest of us grow young again for an hour or two as we come back into those scenes of childhood the custom of the school is that on the 12th of december the founders day the head gownhoy shall recite a latin oration in praise fundatoris nostri and upon other subjects and a goodly company of old cistercians is generally brought together to attend this oration after which we go to chapel to hear a sermon after which we adjourn to a great dinner where old condisciplcs meet old toasts are given and speeches are made before marching from the orationhall to chapel the stewards of the days dinner according to oldfashioned rite have wands put into their hands walk to church at the head of the procession and sit there in places of honour the boys are already in their scats with smug fresh faces and shining white collars the old blackgowned pensioners are on their benches the chapel is lighted and founders tomb with its grotesque carvings monsters heraldries darkles and shines with the most wonderful shadows and lights there he lies fundator noster in his ruff and gown awaiting the great examination day we oldsters he wc ever so old become boys again as we look at that familiar old tomb and think how the seats are altered since we were here and how the doctornot the present doctor the doctor of our timeused to sit yonder and his awful eye used to frighten us shuddering boys on whom it lighted  and how the boy next us would kick our shins during service time and how the monitor would cane us afterwards because our shins were kicked yonder sit forty cherrycheeked boys thinking about home and holidays tomorrow yonder sit some threescore old gentlemen pensioners of the hospital listening to the prayers and the psalms you hear them coughing feebly in the twilightthe old reverend blackgowns is codd ajax alive you wonderthe cistercian lads called these old gentlemen codds i know not wherefore i know not whereforebut is old codd ajax alive i wonder1 or codd soldier or kind old codd gentleman or has the grave closed over them  a plenty of candles lights up this chapel and this scene of age and youth and early memories and pompous death how solemn the wellremembered prayers are here uttered again in the place where in child hood we used to hear them how beautiful and decorous the rite how noble the ancient words of the supplications which the priest utters and to which generations of fresh children and troops of bygone seniors have cried amen under those arches the service for founders day is a special one one of the psalms selected being the thirtyseventh nnd we hear25 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way 24 though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand 25 i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging their bread as we came to this verse i chanced to look up from my book towards the swarm of blackcoated pensioners and amongst them amongst themsate thomas newcome his dear old head was bent down over his prayerbook there was no mistaking him isle wore the black gown of the pensioners of the hospital of grey friars his order of the bath was on his breast he stood there amongst the poor brethren uttering the responses to the psalm the steps of this good man had been ordered hither by heavens decree to this almshouse  here it was ordained that a life all love and kindness and honour should end  i heard no more of prayers and psalms and sermon after that we are no wholesale lovers of the poetical justice so liberally dispensed by elder novelists und it is well from time to time to remind all who struggle that to bear defeat may be nobler than to win the battlebut still the end of thomas newcomes career is unnecessarily painful our mention of this good unworldly man who has been intended perhaps as a companion study to the major in  pendennisleads us naturally to touch on our favourite group of characters in the novel these are the de floracs the sketch of thomas newcomes early love the french countesscompelled to make a marriage of ambition but true throughout life to thc heart which had affianced itself to hers in exileis perfect though only a sketch a foreign air and perfume cling about this character as hard to describe but as unmistakeable as those that authenticate the book the knot of faded ribbonthe oldfashioned halfforgotten miniature which those of a younger generation find when they are called upon to examine the hoards and relics of some departed relative nor is her son paul de florae less french in his brilliant way whether his fortunes be at high or low water markwhether he be rakish or domestic old or youngthis incomparable gaul keeps up the character of his country here he is merely to illustrate our praise playing at english country life on the estate of the manchester lady whom misfortune had made him marry for her money  i have seen nothing more amusing odd and pleasant than florae at the time of his prosperity we arrived as this veracious chronicle has already asserted on a saturday evening we were conducted to our most comfortable apartments with crackling fires blazing on the hearths and every warmth of welcome florae

angleterre je me fais anglais voistu mon ami i continued the prince  demain eest sunday et tu vas voir   sunday morning arrived in the course of time and then florae appeared as a most wonderful briton indeed he wore topboots and buckskins  and after breakfast when we went to church a white great coat with a little cape in which garment he felt that his similarity to an english gentleman was perfect in conversation with his grooms and servants he swore freely  not that he was accustomed to employ oaths in his own private talk but he thought the employment of these expletives necessary as an english country gentleman he never dined without a roast beef and insisted that the piece of meat should be bleeding4 as you love it you others he got up boxingmatches and kept birds for combats of cock he assumed thc sporting language with admirable enthusiasmdrove over to cover with a stepprerode across countri like a good onewas splendid in thc huntingfield in his velvet cap and napoleon boots and made the hunt welcome at rosebury   floraes pleasure was to drive his princess with four horses into newcome he called his carriage his 4 trappo his 4 drague thc street boys cheered and hurrayed the prince as he passed through the town one haberdasher had a yellow stock called  the moncontour displayed in his windows another had a pink one marked  the princely and as such recommended it to the young newcome gents we must have a sketch of this glorious gallic crichton at a later period of his history 44 on his fathers death florae went to paris to settle the affairs of the paternal succession and having been for some time absent in his native country returned to rosebury for the winter to resume that sport of which he was a distinguished amateur he hunted in black during the ensuing season and indeed henceforth laid aside his splendid attire anti his allures as a young man his waist expanded or was no longer confined by the cestus which had given it a shape when he laid aside his black his whiskers too went into a sort of halfmourning and appeared in grey 41 make myself old my friend he said pathetically  i have no more neither twenty years nor forty lie went to rosebury church no more but with great order and sobriety drove every sunday to the neighbouring catholic chapel at ccastle wt had an ecclesiastic or two to dine with us nt rosebury one of whom i am inclined to think was floraes director a reason perhaps for pauls altered demeanour was the presence of his mother at rosebury no politeness or respect could be greater than pauls towards the countess had she been a sovereign princess madame do florae could not have been treated with more profound courtesy than she now received from her son i think the lumibleniinded lady could have dispensed with some of his attentions but paul was a personage who demonstrated all his sentiments and performed his various parts in life with the greatest vigour as a man of pleasure for instance what mort active roue than he  as njeune homme who could be younger nnd for a longer time  as a country gentleman or an homme daffaires he insisted upon dressing each character with the most rigid accuracy and an exactitude that reminded one somewhat of boutfe or ferville at the play i wonder whether when he is quite old he will think proper to wear a pigfail like his old father at any rate that was a good part which the kind fellow was now acting of reverence towards his widowed mother and affectionate respect for her declining days he not only felt these amiable sentiments but he imparted them to his friends freely as his wont was he used to weep freelyquite unrestrained by the presence of the domestics ns english sentiment would beand when madame de florae quitted the room after dinner would squeeze my hand and tell me with streaming eyes that his mother was an angel 4 her life has been but a long trial my friend he would say 4 shall not i who have caused her to shed so many tears

charactersmadame la duchesse dlvry and m castillonesare touched mrs odowd in 4 vanity fair is not more essentially military and irish than the pair in question are romantic and french other characters

leech is in the chapter of mothersinlaw  we cannot care so much for any of the young men  one of them charles honeyman the sentimental popular preacher was destined possibly for a more prominent part

mounts to a head without brains  circled with a coronet ethel the heroine is but another blanche or another beatrix redeemed from the ultimate ruin and discomfiture which befell mr thackerays earlier

have happened past the power of novelist to cure  the newcomes memoirs of a most respectable family edited by arthur pendennis esq london  bradbury and evans 1855 we congratulate mr thackeray upon the completion of his greatest work he now ranks amongst the first writers of his age his triumph is signal nor should he prize the honour the less because not sooner awarded the public have forgotten their old prejudices and dislikes and now crowd around him with gratulations it is not our intention to go over the work of course every one knows the story and its characters and with what wondrous ingenuity and artistic genius the whole structure is reared none but the very highest order of talent could reduce so many different elements to a unique purpose never forgetting the main drift of the piece while surrounded by such a complexity of subordinate parts instead therefore of dwelling upon the details of plot and character we prefer reminding our readers of a few passages in which the author has outdone his former doings and in which his power his knowledge of human nature his evidently kind disposition and above all his deep wit and wisdom are particularly displayed we take the following to be one of the most powerful pieces of writing in the book the writer of these veracious pages was once walking through a splendid english palace standing amidst parks and gardens than which none more magnificent has been seen since the days of aladdin in company with a melancholy friend who viewed all things darkly through his gloomy eyes the housekeeper pattering on before us from chamber to chamber was expatiating upon the magnificence of this picture  the beauty of that statue  the marvellous richness of these hangings and carpets the admirable likeness of the late marquis by sir thomas  of his father the fifth earl by sir joshua and so on  when in the very richest room of the whole castle hicks  such was my melancholy companions namestopped the cicerone in her prattle saying in a hollow voice 44 and now madam will you show us the closet where the skeleton is the scared functionary paused in the midst of her harangue  that article was not inserted in the catalogue which she doily utters to visitors for their halfcrown hickss question brought a darkness down upon the hall where we were standing we did not see the room  and yet i have no doubt there is such a one  and ever after when i have thought of the splendid castle towering in the midst of shady trees under which the dappled deer are browsing  of the terraces gleaming with statues and bright with a hundred thousand flowers of the bridges and shining fountains and rivers wherein the castlewindows reflect their festive gleams when the halls are filled with happy feasters and over the darkling woods comes the sound of music always i say when i think of castle bluebeard it is to think of that dark little closet which i know is there and which the lordly owner opens shudderingafter midnightwhen he is sleepless and must go unlock it when the palace is hushed when beauties are sleeping around him unconscious and revellers are at rest o mrs housekeeper  all the other keys hast thou but that key thou hast not have we not all such closets my jolly friend as well as the noble marquis of carabas  at night when all the house is asleep but you dont you get up and peep into yours  when you in your turn are slumbering up gets mrs brown from your side steals down stairs like amina to her ghoul clicks open the secret door and looks into her dark depository did 6he tell you of that little affair with smith long before she knew you  psha  who knows any one save himself alone  who in showing his house to the closest and dearest doesnt keep back the key of a closet or two  i think of a lovely reader laying down the page and looking over at her unconscious husband asleep perhaps after dinner yes madam a closet he hath  and you who pry into everything shall never have the key of it i think of some honest othello pausing over this very sentence in a railroad carriage and stealthily gazing at desdemona opposite to him innocently administering sandwiches to their little boyi am trying to turn off the sentence with a joke you see i feel it is growing too dreadful too serious here we have a sketch done by a master hand his hermitage is situated in walpole street let us say on the second floor of a quiet mansion let out to hermits by a noblemans butler whose wife takes care of the lodgings his cells consist of a refectory a dormitory and an adjacent oratory where he keeps his shower bath and boots  the pretty boots trimly stretched on boottrees and blacked to a nicety not varnished by the boy who waits on him the barefooted business may suit superstitious ages and gentlemen of alcantara but does not become may fair and the nineteenth century if st pedro walked the earth now with his eyes to the ground he would know fashionable divines by the way in which they were shod charles honeymans is a sweet foot i have no doubt as delicate and plump and rosy as the white hand with its two rings which he passes in impassioned moments through his slender flaxen hair a sweet odour pervades his sleeping apartmentnot that peculiar and delicious fragrance with which the saints of the roman church are said to gratify the neighbourhood where they reposebut oils redolent of the richest perfumes of macassar essences from truefitts or dekroixs into which a thousand flowers have expressed their sweetest breath await bis meek bead on rising and infuse the

from among many others we forbear to describe the meeting between the colonel and his sonthe pretty boy from whom he had parted more than seven years before with such pangs of heart and of whom he had thought ever since with such a constant longing affection half an hour after the father left the boy and in his grief and loneliness was rowing back to shore clive was at play with a dozen of other children on the sunny deck of the ship when two bells rang for their dinner they were all hurrying to though cuddytable and busy over their meal what a sad repast their parents bad that day  how their

planted in their little gardens the toys they played with the little vacant cribs they slept in os fathers eyes looked blessings down on them most of us who have passed a couple of score of years in the world have had such sights as these to move us and those who have will think none the worse of my worthy colonel for his tender and faithful heart he was of a nature so uncontrollably generous that to be sure he spent five rupees where another would save them and make a fine show besides  but it is not a mans gifts or hospitalities that generally injure bis fortune it is on themselves that prodigals spend most and as newcome had no personal extravagances and the smallest selfish wants could live almost as frugally as a hindoo kept his horses not to race but to ride  wore his old clothes and uniforms until they were the laughter of his regiment did not care for show and had no longer an extravagant wife he managed to loy by considerably out of his liberal allowances and to find himself and clive growing richer every year besides his own boy whom ho worshipped this kind colonel had a score at bast of adopted children to whom he chose to stand in the light of a father he was

had visited miss pinkertons establishment or doctor ltarnshorns adjoining acadenjy at chiswick and seen little tom davis or little fanny holmes the honest fellow would come home and write off straightway a long letter to toms or fannys parents far away in the indian country whose hearts he made happy by his accounts of their children as he had delighted the children themselves by his affection and bounty all the apple and orangewomen especially such as had babies as well as lollypops at their stalls all the streetsweepers on the road between nerots and the oriental knew him and

inserted and the horses break out into a trot and the empty carriages expressing the deep grief of the deceased ladys friends depart homeward it is remarked that lord kew hardly has any communication

and must be attended to though grief bo ever so severe with all his ease and grace with the high endowment of knowing in what exact light to place a subject and with the power of piercing to the very core of his argument at once there are few men who have so hardly earned a wellmerited fame as mr thackeray in an age when authorship reputations spring up like mushrooms when the royal road to literary success seems thrown opena wide wellbeaten pathhe stood an unaccredited author whose power indeed was acknowledged but whose motives were questioned with a suspicious scrutiny the author of 44 vanity fair  owned but a dubious fame he was but indistinctly known and the current of public taste ran dead against him all his pathos availed him nothing the plot of his story was out of keeping with the prejudices of the age and the innuendoes of an immaculate press assailed him from every quarter never do we remember to have seen a fuller manifestation of that phenomenon of the human heart namely that those very truths which a man most firmly believes he is most reluctant to admit before the community that vice frequently triumphs that the generous man usually 4 goes to the wall that craft and subtlety generally succeed best in the world are truisms among the generality of men they always assume that such maxims are understood by their companions whenever their conversation falls upon the ordinary topics of life but woe to the author who dares point the moral of his tale with such examples or scatter reflections tending to this result among his writings our ancestors were not so fastidious  and yet we are not one whit better than they in respect of moral worth of fair dealing of honesty or honour we are not so openly corrupt perhaps pt but what villainies in trade what adulterations of and frauds has not our age to account for  t time was when an honest author could shoot th folly as it flies without censure from a virtuous public or au indignant press time was when

higher and purer 1 taste t the reading public of olden time was a  smaller but a choicer community than ours 1 the early fathers of the church were of higher  stamp and stauncher soul than the profligate e cardinals and dissolute priests who in swarms i succeeded to their posts when the truth became i widely spread and popular again when the i reformation arose its advocates were few but i strong and learned and its infancy was guarded 1 by veterans unequalled by the men of our days  mr cumming is not equal to jeremy taylor and i the author of 44 mornings with jesus  is not to be i compared with smalridge or hooker the like fact is observable in the progress of knowledge for the last sixty years we have more books and more readers  but the quality has deteriorated the public very naturally buy only such books as they like and are able to comprehend they have a superficial smattering of everything and pass summary judgments accordingly the press as naturally humours the public and praises or condemns in keeping with public prejudices  the consequence of which is that a writer in order to be popular is unfortunately obliged to follow and truckle to understandings infinitely below his own however great his heart or genius however well qualified he may be to lead men onwards to lofty efforts and noble aims it is of the first importance to his fame and his very existence as an author to conciliate his readers in fact without a certain popularity he can get no publisher and if his works cannot command a sale which they never do unless he is a favourite he cannot be properly called an author however truthful or profound if he cease to please he ceases to exist because publishers of course care more for the shillings of though many than the approbation of the few the result is that books are written to please the majority but we never could see that because a work was popular it was therefore of a first order that because a statesman was the idol of the many he was therefore the best statesman or that because an opinion was in fashion it was therefore right on the contrary we find the majority less educated aud more prone to prejudice than the remnant by the necessity of their position they cannot give the requisite time to ethical inquiries or philosophical speculationsciences which must always be entrusted to a select class of the community what has public opinion to do with surgery or medicine or geometry  we leave these sciences in the bands of a few whom we trust but with ethicsdecidedly the most difficult of sciences and with religionthe deepest aud most obscure of subjectsand with politicsthe knowledge of which we believe the whole human race to be in complete infancyupou all these points the unthinking many consider that they know more than the thinking few the antagonism is apparently palpable and strong but a little consideration will show that there is no real antagonism at all that the majority ever follow the few thinkers and never lead save by reaction and that those same principles they so vociferously advocate were once but private thoughts and having expanded into popular principles are believed by the majority not on account of their intrinsic worth,juvenile_contra

the preface to the pretty little stories which mrs edmonds has translated from the greek of george drosines and aristotle kourtidos she seems troubled by the fact that there are no fairies in greece and almost apologises for it no apology is needed stories which have no fairies have the most fairy  and fairies of the courtly kind that is to say with the graces and caprices of great ladiesthe fairies who if rightly encountered bestow good gifts on suffering beautywere not to be found anywhere except perhaps at versailles until they were introduced into literature by perrault and madame daulnoy in all the good old folkstories the part is played by witches or dwarfs or beasts or goodtempered giants nothing in the shape of a fairy is to be found in grimms  kinder und hausmiirchen or asbjomsens  folkeeventyr the conventional fairy was invented in the days when as madame de sevigne tells us court ladies amused themselves by telling stories  they call this mitonner she says and she madame de coulanges  mitonned us and told us of a green island where a princess was brought up bright as the day the fairies were her companions and the prince of pleasure was her lover and they both came to the kings court one day in a ball of glass this fancy for fairy tales at court explains everything  the courtly tone had to be adopted the heroes and heroines had of necessity to be of the blood royal and the wonderworking beasts birds and dwarfs of folklore had to be changed into ladies who would not be out of place in the court circle these greek stories are not of this type but of the hans andersen kind with  a little less and what worlds away  but even with that drawback they are well told pleasant to read prettily illustrated and beautifully got up mr hogan has epitomised his work on the titlepage on which he describes jorgenson a monarch of iceland naval captain revolutionist british diplomatist continental traveller explorer preacher political prisoner gambler expatriated exile colonist and constable in all these he was remarkable the greater part of the history consists of an autobiography pleasantly written we can cordially commend this book to old and young  they will find it interesting amusing and instructive mr kinglake in the australian at home gives us a gossiping olin podrida intended to convey a true idea of daily life at the antipodes his object is to show that the rules and habits of society are as much de rigueur there as in london  that civilization and culture are much more advanced than is generally imagined  that idlers have as bad a chance there as elsewhere  that in short australia is merely england reproduced under the southern cross the authors motives are good his views are in the main correct his work ought to disabuse the english mind of much crass ignorance  the quest of jack hazelwood is a pretty story pleasantly told with many touches of pathos and a generally wholesome tendency we confess to a feeling of disappointment in reading the earlier portion of verschuurs 4 at the antipodes whilst the author gives to his readers his experiences in the welltrodden routes of australia tasmania and new zealand he finds little to say that has not already been written but this feeling is completely obliterated when we reach his account of fiji thc new hebrides and new caledonia the last with its healthy climate splendid scenery fertile soil and mineral wealth is still undeveloped this paradise has been turned into a pandemonium being made a french penal settlement for criminals of the worst class it seems to be grossly mismanaged  discipline is lax idleness is unchecked reformation is unknown notwithstanding this the prisoners are anxious to escape from this scene of ease as the australians know to their cost on our authors homeward route he  rounded the horn and was disabused of his preconceived ideas of the city of rio and of its inhabitants neither here nor elsewhere was ho favourably impressed with the people of south america like all other travellers he was charmed with the scenery of its unrivalled harbour to which principally on account of the foliage he gives the palm in preference to that of sydney until then the object of his supreme admiration recent experience of a painful nature gives additional interest to his account of uruguay buenos ayres and argentina of the last he speaks in terms of the highest praise numerous illustrations accompany his pages last year we noticed favourably mr norways christmas contribution for the young  hussein the hostage his present work  how martin drake found his father will add to his reputation as an author the reader will feel the deepest sympathy for the sufferings of two innocent and heroic boys brought upon them by the fault of their father who was transported to america for smuggling in those early days when that country as well as the west indies was used as a penal settlement by england the boys of course find their father after a succession of adventures such as rarely happen in real life stories of the sea have always a fascination for boys and the little tale by mr george hewett will not form an exception to

amused by her imp of a son lilybel at length after long years things right themselves and dea reigns at dotrava place and phili is not far away there are many attractive illustrations in this attractive book miss maud carews pat spck is one of the best of the misunderstood children who have invaded our literature of late years she is a girl and her name is really patricia but her stern old aunt is the only person who dignifies the child by that stately name pats mother is dead her father is in india and the poor little girl grows to think that every mans hand is against her it takes some time and much sorrow to awaken pat to knowledge of the truth but light reaches her at last her father comes back to her her aunt is no longer stern and pat begins to be happyruth by c e m spck is a sketch of village life pleasant enough but not in any way remarkable it is refreshing to renew our acquaintance with miss mitfords pretty little country stories seeley  co which were published when the century was still young and women not yet new they take us back to the period when grisi and malibran sang when ionandparacelsuswere the poems of the year when people went out to dinner in the early hours of the afternoon the men arrayed in  brocade brodd waistcoats of resplendent lustre and rings studs brooches and chains or to tea at eight with as much depth of purpose as we feel when going out to dinner we can well understand the popularity of miss mitfords stories they are very well written and full of little touches which could only have been given by one who lived in the country and loved it good night by dollie radford nutt is one of the daintiest little books which we have seen for years the verses are graceful and pretty and the illustrations excellent it will please both young and old ledia val legends by mrs leighton nutt is decidedly a step in the right direction even the world of the nursery must be weary of the everincreasing flood of foolish little newly invented fairytales which streams forth from the printing presses and will welcome the romances which have lived so many centuries that they seem to be almost as true as history itself melusina is one of the prettiest and most pathetic of them though like many another romance it would be better if shorter we weary a little of the size of melusinas family and the number of kingdoms that her sons conquered and the ease with which they did it  fleur and blanchefleur in elliss metrical romances  florice and blanchefiour will also be a great favourite as mrs leighton is catering for children she has not made many notes to these legends but she has translated them into good and simple english and her book ought to find a place in every juvenile library it will be read with avidity as a book which is not regarded as a  lessonbook  in disguise and yet it will be a lessonbook all the same and one of the best kind it is of course almost impossible to take up a book of rhymes like national rhymes f the nurseru wells gardner darton  co without discovering a certain number which seem to be not quite so good as the version which we know ourselves but this collection appears to be wonderfully accurate and complete it may perhaps be objected that mrs ilowitts  spider and the fly though an admirable specimen of nursery literature is scarcely a nursery rhyme proper and the same remark applies to certain rhymes which are used in childrens games and are only com pletely intelligible wheii so used if all these were given their name would be legion god bless the master of this house too is not a nursery rhyme but a christmas carol which fiveandtwenty years ago to our own knowledge used to be sung from door to door in a northern town by a woman carrying a doll half smothered in artificial flowers and hollywhich was intended to represent the infant christ the carol nearly always produced a shilling so it is a marvel that the old custom has been allowed to die out  elaie marley is a pitmans song and elsie was we believe a real person the last two lines of the last verse should be she lost her pocket and all her money aback o the bush i the garden honey some of the

statement that it is always pleasanter to read fact than fiction perhaps the great majority of children read their fiction as though it were fact and will hardly care to have fact imposed upon them in the holiday guise of fiction any boy however who makes headway with her japanese story of the little marine will be quite content to take it on its merits an english bugler escaped death during the simonoseki war by the lucky chance of having a japanese helmet in his haversack he has the good fortune to discover the japanese lily on a battlefield clinging to the body of her father  but the lily dies soon after her baptism and though the author trusts that this fanciful conclusion to a narrative of fact will not deteriorate from the interest of the story one cannot but feel rather doubtful on that point  the little marine is apparently intended to be a religious tale as well as a record of adventure in the  land of the rising sun young silas verney was kidnapped in the reign of though merry monarch and passes through the regulation training of hard knocks from friends and foes on land and sea before his fates succeed in making a man of him as might be expected there is a good deal of piping to old tunes in mr pickering s story yet it is a pleasantly written and unobjectionable book for boys and adequately illustrated by mr a pearse the hero s adventures amongst the dutchmen are thoroughly amusing 4 marian ia not a particularly genial story but there are some nice young people in it and the ending is fairly pleasant there is no humour to speak of but marian and her sister norah are characters of whom the reader will moderately approve even if he does not succeed in becoming enthusiastic over their chequered fortunes  hark forrard  is a christmas book mainly in the sense that it appears just before christmas time and that it may be readhalf an hour will dispose of itquite as fitly about the turn of the year as at any other time horses with a dash of gentlemanly courtship make up the staple of mr cottons little story which is too thin to be classed as a novel and too equine for any but the most precocious of boys and girls it is brisk and quite harmless m flammarions  urania is a fantasy compounded of the fairy tales of astronomy the gossip of ghostseers the musings and yearnings of stargazers and a dainty romance of an aeronaut and his wife the volume in fact is more or lees dainty from beginning to end and its charm is heightened by a large number of lightly touched sketches by three artists who add to the fantasy and perhaps a little to the vagueness of the printed text certainly this is the case with a batch of philosophic musings on the last few pagessuggested as the inspirations of urania herselfone of which illustrates the infinitely small by figures and statistics mathematically defined mr noah brooks gives a vivid enough description of settlement in kansas in its earlier but not very remote days some of the practical disappointments incident to farming are well brought out boys will enjoy the boos when we say that we consider  the rajah of dah to be one of mr rennes most successful efforts to cater for the young we have said enough in its praise those who have been in the malay peninsula can judge of the truth of his scenes the author appreciates the cunning of the orientals which few europeans do in  richard tregellas there is provided plenty of excitement a tale based upon privateering piracy and buccaneering affords abundance of opportunity for sensational situations the narrative seldom flags the hero finds untold treasures in a cave in the west indies hidden there by an old buccaneer so many of these have been discovered in recent fiction that the stock must be nearly exhausted it is pleasant to see that miss edgeworths admirable tales are not so wholly forgotten as to disappear from the publishers lists and messrs routledge have done a service by reprinting them in a convenient form the

they were first conceived and told to the exiles little daughter in the faraway land of their imprisonment the illustrations by malischeff are quaint  nurse heatherdales story is in mrs molesworths happiest style it is a return to her older manner a simple and charming tale of the nursery entirely free from ghosts and all the eerie things that haunt it is greatly to mrs molesworths credit that she has banished the supernatural from nurse heatherdales story for if ever there was a castle that should be haunted  it is treluan the home of those fascinating little folk proud queen bess gentle

illustrations by leslie brook are worthy of the letterpress and that means a great deal lady seton in an introductory letter prefixed to mrs chandler moultons stories told at twilight tells usor rather tells mr david stott to whom her letter is addressedthat in america these stories are most popular and that the author is looked upon there as the mrs molesworth of the states we cannot agree with this estimate of the tales and we fail to see how they can in any way compare with mrs molesworths  nothing venture nothing have is not without some merit being the story of a london waif and in her baby brother we discern some strength and sweetness  but for the most part the stories which make up the volume are too full of sentiment and of little else mrs chandler moulton is certainly less successful in prose than in poetry 4 wild meg and wee dickie is a study of life in the slums vivid powerful and unutterably sad yet not without hope megs keen sense of humour helps her greatly and her indomitable spirit enables her to raise herself and the little lad she has saved out of the depths into pleasant and honourable ways  bab though quite as good in its way is a very different kind of story it deals with the i sorrows of the welltodo and that struggle against selfishness which must be waged by rich and poor alike bab is a capital story for children who will be much amused by the picture on the cover of the hideous but worthy doll jocasta who plays so conspicuous a part in little babs history miss lysaght paints in  grannie a saddening picture of though fine lady who takes one up and casts one down her victim being a pretty little village child mollie grannie is the good angel of the book the type of the true and the steadfast to her poor little mollie returns in haste and tears after her beguiling gladys anstruther is a mournful and miserable story of an angelic child hounded almost to death by a jealous stepmother and a wicked imp of a stepsister it is much too painful and improbable a story and we do not recommend it to our young readers we have seldom come across so marvellous a concoction as  the lonely pyramid it purports to be the strange experiences of roy lefevre in the desert during the year 1884 and deals with a lost oasis a lonely pyramid a fair fugitive a murderous figure of isis though mahdi and his men and a funny nigger of course all things combine against roy and equally of course he is triumphant over all the embrace of isis somehow brings to our mind the death of oagool but the whole thing is extravagant and grotesque to a degree and the pictures are simply appalling is it right for a man to blacken his own good name in order to shield another  a good deal of course depends on the other but the man for whose sake neal russell

norman are not at all amusing again there is not much that is distinctive about an old chronicle of leighton which takes the reader to an english rural district at the beginning of the century and

of fernleigh where the reader hears of the dull doings of duller people only enlivened with wild and improbable mysteries the masquerading of the earl which ends the book is the silliest bit of fooling miss peard has written many attractive stories but the locked desk is not up to though level of her former work the main motive of the book seems poor we grow immensely weary of the locked

allround exercises for mind and body rowing too he touches very slightly  and to speak of its effect on the chest and arms without mentioning the more important legwork is onesided criticism the book is enlivened by notices of sundry athletic heroes in these and other matters our author lets his patriotism become too aggressive we fancy some of the great donald dinnies feats have been surpassed both in england and ireland it is also a little hardy to say that england has no national music of a high character even if she concede many of those old ballads which are common to both sides of the border and though  cheer boys cheer  was written by a scotchman his name was not maclean but mackay still less to our taste is the little bit of boasting about the superiority of the scots to the

utilised foundations of sound political thought in dr macaulays book both these conditions are fulfilled among the fiveandtwenty true stories in his book none is trifling and many are of the highest interest when we mention the adventurous exile of thomas muir the scottish political martyr  the services and death from a broken heart of waghorn the pioneer of the overland route  the exodus during

which elderly men look back to as the most critical time our empire has passed within their knowledge the experiences of the young gunner are admirably told the most stirring incident the recovery of

are happily described maggie steeles diary appears to be a story intended to point the moral that people are not always so black as they paint themselves  but it is questionable whether it succeeds no amount of heroic dying can make the reader feel any sympathy with the obtuse and dismal heroine whose very virtues become odious from the manner in which they are described the slight amount of

and the still more infelicitous intrusion into the dialogue of the scores the chaff and the puns of the modern humourist when king abbonamentos son treblo returns the former salutes him as his longlost cheeyld and the dialogue between treblo and mumkie is enlivened by venerable jokes on hoarse and horse and the various meanings of the words crown and sovereign the reference to the king who raised the price of everything that begins with st like sausages and sealingwax and soap and sewingmachines  strikes on the ear with a familiar sound and the device of converting the parcaj into the

elector frederic nnd the stern person of him who is called  the little monk of wittenberg miss stella austins princess angel is a wonderful and fascinating little person and the story of her reign is sure to be read again and again by children young and old it is a subject for regret that her highness should be stolen by circus folk a device too common alas  in christmas books  but there is

suitable for the perusal of elder girls is the most tiresome of all the three  christmas books la rochelle by e c wilson nelson  sons loyal hearts by evelyn everettgreen same publishers dulcies love

the frontispiece of the book the lord beauchamp nephew of the illfated lady jane grey is one of the many heroes of miss everettgreens fascinating romancein dulcies love story the author of  loyal hearts  returns to our own times and to the affairs of every day dulcie is an attractive little person engaged to a worthy young naval officer whom in time she marries but the romance of the book comes from the fact that she lias inspired with a hopeless and utterly unselfish passion one capt bayard randall a bayard indeed who is the real hero of the tale there is no end to books by miss

a charming little child the grandparents are all that they should be and the prodigal uncle is altogether worthy of the fatted calf prepared by his little niece  archies find  is a story of australian life a little confused perhaps and not a little rambling but not without a certain attractiveness the find is gold which as always stirs up envy and strife eastward ho  does not call us over seas but only to the dreary wilds of the eastend of london mrs marshal is sparing in her description of the slums she really writes the story of an unmanageable minx reformed by her cousin an earnest worker amongst the poor hence we suppose the title of the book which contains a great deal of good reading  least said soonest mended is not the most attractive of miss gibernes numerous works the proverb which forms the title appears to have been the favourite remark of the heroines mother otherwise it is not particularly appropriate to the book kitty phrynne is a pretty and not overwise little person who gete into endless trouble through a worthless lover whom of course she throws over in the end for a faithful dobbin  it is difficult now to wax very enthusiastic over jules verne of the purchase of the north pole and  a family without a name it suffices to say that they are in his latest and least attractive style a family without a name  deals with canadian insurrection the horrors of which are relieved by a very funny story of a worthy lawyer who is compelled to become chief of the hurons  a week in a wherry on the norfolk broads ought to be an attractive book but somehow it is not it proceeds from the leadenhall press and therefore is pretty to look at paper and type are excellent and as for the subject it is full of interest but the worthy northumbrians who sail the broads fail both by word and picture to show us the charm of those still waters and their attempt at fun is simply tiresome the first half of mr hentys volume is occupied with the voyage out this usually dull subject he makes interesting by introducing adventures with cannibals in magellan straits and in the austral group of islands in the pacific these are the best scenes in the book some of the ofttold events of the native war and of te kootis exploits in the vicinity of hawkes bay together with several murders of settlers and the gallant defence of others are graphically delineated it is a book which all young people but especially boys will read with avidity 4 master rockafellars voyage is worth reading by children of the larger growth for it describes most vividly the life of an apprentice  sea and the hardships endured in an emigrant viip it is unnecessary to detail the incidents of mr clark russells masterly book that of thc man abandoned in the boat baling out fresh water by mistake is a graphic touch but we may say they are on a par with the style and that both are firstrate pabulum for boys of sense mr freeman writes of school life the peculiarities of chudleigh are principally a habit on the part of masters and boys of sitting in their shirtsleeves in school the existence of a golflinks the clubmaker speaks execrable scotch and a number of regulations for openair exercise which would one would think destroy all the spontaneity and heartiness of the games however there is much that is good in the book and it contains some valuable warnings for young readersmr fenn has produced a tale of the sort that schoolboys loae although he has written a little in a hurry else he would hardly make the dutchman and prince charlie contemporary rivals the adventures of the middy among the smugglers will not however be the less eagerly devoured 4 the log of the bombastes  contains highly exciting adventures of the sea and carries the reader away to the southern ocean there is an excellent storm some terrible encounters with men and fish the illustration of the combat with the cuttlefish will be delightful to boys and as much miscellaneous incident as heart can wishthe falkland islands have not become hackneyed so far as we know and 4 the little colonists may be popular with children the illustrations are good but the binding is badly sewn a common fault this year in childrens books  ardis claverden  is written in mr stocktons lively style and is not at all a bad story characteristically enough the heroine is a girl of much pluck and energy and is always the leading spirit and she is a nice girl too the four young englishmen who do a good deal to make the book amusing are typical specimens of the englishman of american literature mr stockton makes some mistakes by not being quite at home in the nice differences between conversational english and conversational american miss litchfield has collected several of her short stories from the century and other magazines in which they appeared and has republished them in a small volume the tales themselves are as small in quality as they are in quantity they recall the thin voice of that gnat who was always suggesting to alice through the lookingglass you might make a joke out of that the writer seems to be continually on the point of making not a joke certainly but a story and then stopping short  little venice  itself contains somewhat more generous material and also good descriptions of the beautiful st clair flats in the neighbourhood of the city of detroit  the price i paid for a set of ruskin though excessively slight is a good idea 4 myrtle and  hilarys husband deserve only one epithetmawkish in fact miss litchfield cannot be too much on her guard against the sentimentality and want of literary reserve which are conspicuous in her tales and would spoil any good work she might otherwise do  christmas books a yoting macedonian ia the army of alexander the great by the ra v a j

cassell co a story of stops by mrs davidson of tulloch field  tuer mr church has chosen this christmas to go back to the greeks for his historical tale he relates the adventures of one charidemus a youth of mixed argive and macedonian descent who joins the macedonian army about ne 336 and takes part in the expedition of alexander at least as far as babylon his bosom friend oharondas a theban goes on to india and describes in a letter the campaign against porus the main events of the btory are of course strictly historical but a good deal of variety is lent to the narrative by ingenious inventions charidemus is taken prisoner by memnon at halicarnassus and sees the battle of issus from the persian side charondas is captured at tyre and is very near being sacrificed to melkarth charidemus falls in love with me ninons niece clearista and charondas with miriam a jewess of babylon both the friends ultimately marry the ladies of their choice and settle down to a peaceable old age as  proselytes of the gate in galilee the reader will see that such events as these on the top of alexanders battles furnish forth a feast of marvels mr churchs style is as readable as ever and the history pretty accurate though one or two dates are not easy to determine the slaves of sabinuv is a story of the times of vespasian founded mainly on plutarch most young readers will regard it as quite a  sunday book the adventures of sabinus his wife and two young sons are told in miss yonges usual attractive manner esdras the jewish slave regards with abhorrence both the idolatry of the romans and the christian perversions of the mosaic law  while the romans look upon jews and christians as  birds of a feather and alike contemptible the prejudices however of both jew and roman are ultimately overcome andalmost all the prominent personages of the story embrace christianity though awkwardness of connecting julius sabinus the lingon with flavius clemens the son of flavius sabinus the roman is cleverly concealed and on the whole the tale does credit to miss yonges power of historical imagination of the four pretty little stories which go to make up mies cross and miss atkinsons volume the prettiest are  worth her weight in gold and  the princess with the beautiful hands they are sure to be well liked in the nursery and the moral for in modern fairy tales there is a moral is delicately put forward and not too much insisted on there are some good touches too in the first story when rosalinda is taken as a prisoner to the king of the vultures who declines for the moment to eat her because goats  taste better than little girls he has he says only eaten three little girls in his life and did not care much for them he tries to think if there is any way in which she can be made useful   what could you do said the king not unkindly  oh i could wash and iron the clothes and cook the food you see she was iu such fear she did not think what she was maying until she saw that all the vultures smiled scornfully we dont want our beautiful feathers washed aud ironed by little girls and we dont spoil our food by cooking it said the kidg crossly caut you do anything else yesi could look after the hauy vultures she said so it was settled that this was to be her occupation and the meal that was to be made on her was deferred  youll have to sleep in an old nestsaid the king and wheu darkness set in a vulture picked her up aud dropped her into one  aud there she lay all night in the midst of the down and moss watching the moon sailing in and out of the clouds the illustrations are not good we suppose that a book with the outward appearance of  a little candle  does not aim at being an historical novel but would humbly call itself a book for girls it is at any rate a charming tale of the olden time and takes us to the scotland of two hundred years ago then across to france with the exiled jacobites real and dream personages mix together and the recital of their deeds is excellent reading we catch a glimpse of a gallantlooking and sadfaced officer who is  clavers himself and no other miss ty tiers volumes are usually welcome and  nobodys girls is really one of the best of her later works bab and nancy the friendless heroines are indeed in bad case when first we make their acquaintance all their worldly wealth is buried in a night by a remorseless sandstorm and the buried luck does not return to them till the end of the book by which time they and their laughing brainless cousin dolly have gone through countless adventures miss tytlers charming manner her delicate appreciation of character aud her fine sense of humour make the book most attractive  besom yard which calls itself  a story of trial temptation and deliverance is really not a story at all it is a collection of moral lessons strung together by a slender thread of narrative three american books very different in character and merit come next  santa claus is a good rollicking group of christmas stories full of snow and kindly thoughts aud christmas presents small boys in big boots by the author of  mr barnes of new york is really quite objectionable small boys and girls

recollections of my childhoods days a charming little collection of sketches just such as we should expect from the writeranother book of a like character is miss alice jacksons  in the days of our childhood but this latter is a story of angloindian children first in their faraway birthplace then in old englanda lively enough tale the author of  shreds and patches apologetically tells his readers that  these passages were written for a manuscript magazine issued at irregular intervals for home amusement but there is no need for apology the tales are bright and sparkling and altogether readable the sharp little children and their grownup friends and relatives must surely be cousins at least to the child creations of john strange winter a new and illustrated edition of richard

tales as that of mrs kellys captivity are full of interest though one feels they are to be accepted with a little reservation no deductions unhappily are to be made from the stories of indian

mr ballantyne in  the coxswains bride has produced a new sensation by wrecking a ship in a cave against the roof of which the vessel manages to strike this and the marriage of the coxswain in his seafaring dress fresh from a stormy night in the lifeboat differentiate this story of life on a desert island jack frost and sons is a commendable attempt to recommend charitable exertion for others as enhancing the happiness of a  seasonable  christmas and  a double rescue is also a philanthropic and hopeful story for that distantly approaching festival  the brown owl is fascinating in appearance but we cannot help thinking that it will prove less attractive to children than to their elders there are no fairies at all of the good oldfashioned kind but there is not a little enchantment  and when the great officers of state meirymineral and lord lacee come upon the scene we find ourselves in the realm of political satire mr hueffer has a nimble wit and some humour but we do not feel sure that fairyland is the best place for him  the brown owl is adorned with two charming illustrations by mr f madox brown mr metcalfes book is sufficiently technical to inspire confidence in boyish readers and he provides enough variety of incident in his story of sea life to arrest their attention to be lost on an iceberg and thence picked off by pirates is something fresh as far as our recollection goes to be sure the pirate captain is the gentlestmannered manwhat children call a good  pirateand repents and lives cleanly but he lias some sufficient ruffians with him to keep up appearances mr adams the mate of the merchantman is the spokesman of virtue  comrades true  is more full of matter than most childrens books the hero and heroine are small friends of an artless type full of all the love of scrambling and wandering that healthy country children feel who have exceptional opportunities in that direction conrad and tommy are a capital pair and conrad in

lisht of publicity  and the belief that charmingly as it deals with child hood it is a book that childlovers not children will care for for children in our experience care les for the ways and thoughts of other children than for pure romance or for true stories of grownup people yet the admirable illustrations will sures catch their attention and the young taffy a 1uing on the wall and the

longmans  comost of these stories are graceful and all are well written the writer as the keen eye for nature which the world has learned to expect from one of her name her stories are original too and full of fanct who is master 7 is one of the best and will amuse clever children very much and what is more children of a larger growth the garden behind the moon by howard pyle lawrence  bullenthis is a garden of a very different kind to which we are introduced by a much less silled author he tells of a boy who walked along a moonbeam into the moon itself and of all that the said boy saw when there we regret to say that we have found his adventures extremely dull the baroness orozys three compact little volumes fairylands beauty c dean  son are easy to hold pleasant to read and contain stories which it is pretty certain will please children there is not much to like in the illustrations however one fault in the writing of these stories may be pointed out and that is that the relative pronouns are sometimes used very capriciously and with no obe dience to the laws of grammar katawampus by his honour judge e a parry nutt is an amusing little book written in a style which reminds us of lewis carrolls it is full of comical quips and cranks and carries us easily and pleasantly along to the end where we find that four unruly little children whose naughtiness was entirely caused by kata wampus a malady which could only be cured by the application of a birch rod w ich how ever could not be obtained until a birch tree was grownwere healed bl their illness and carefully fitted with new tempers by the caveman krab the narrative is pleasantly diversified by verses and appropriately illustrated by mr archie macgregor a book of nurery bongs and rhymes edited by mr baringgould methuen  co contain most of the nursery rhymes with which readers of all ages are pleasantly familiar some which are new to us and one or two which are properly speaking ballads if there be a fault to find it in that mr baringgould has not much regard for the feelings of parents who wish their children to make the acquaintance of this part of the literature of their country in an accurate form for he sometimes omits part of a rhyme and on the other hand if he finds one which seems to him lacking in finish he adds a couple of verses of his own he rather misses a point too by not enriching his note to aiken drum by pointing out sir w scotts familiarity with thewe do not quite like to say doggereland making his own readers turn to the antiquary to read of the inscription  a d l l which monkbarns interpreted agricola dionvit libens lubens and edie ochiltree proved to be aiken drums lang ladle many different versions of these rhymes or ballads are in existence there was a good deal of discussion in our own columns some months ago as to which was the best of  the golden ball mr baringgould has printed two the one under the name of  the prickly bush is much the better mr itaringgould does not seem to have got the best version of lucy locket his is lucy locket lost her pocket kitty fisher found it but never a penny was there int except the binding round it in the version which an old man of ninety used to quote to us in our youth the last two lines were not a farthing was it worth but the binding round it also in the second verse of  the bonnie pit laddie we think that the line he site in his cricket and hews in his jacket should be he sits on his cracket and hews in his jacket so we have always heard it the double rhyme is required and a cracket is the pitmans stool the task here given as  whittingham fair is we think more usually called bellingham fair its refrain parley sage rosemary and thyme  must have excited the envy of all contributors to the germ the illustrations are good and effective but we do not like the edges of the pages which are rough and spiky it has been said that one use of war is to teach geography the same may be remarked of under the lone star a story of the retiolution in nicaragua by herbert hayens nelson  sons describing an american filibustering exp edition in an important part of the world too little known it is written from the point of view entertained by these lawless men not from that taken by the inhabitants of the country which they invaded of course the comrades of the author are described as heroes it is of especial interest just now not only because similar expeditions are projected to aid the insurgents in cuba but on account of the renewed attempts to open communication between the atlantic and pacific oceans through the territory of nicaraguahow jack mackenzie won hi epardettes a story of the crimean war by dr gordon stables nelson  sons is yet another tale describing many of the scenes of the crimean campaign in a popular form and in a vivid manner well calculated to excite the enthusiasm of boys and the sympathy of their friends a new zealand courtship and other workaday stories by mr e b od bayley religious tract society are as might be expected from the publishers of a highly moral tendency and would lead us to infer that the standard of conduct is higher at the antipodes than in the mother country all five stories are good enough but the  courtship is not the most happythe best part of a thtane of wessex by mr charles w whistler blaalie  son is though illustrations  the story is not calculated to afford information or instruction and as it contains dreams and apparitions it cannot be looked upon as historical the style is rather peculiar and the author is evidently unaware that it is not easy to tell a story in the first person singularthe secret cave by mrs emilie searchtield nelson  sons is a simple story pleasantly related and founded on events in the time of monmouths rebellionhis first kangaroo by mr arthur serres blackie  son is designed for boys several of the scenes illustrative of colonial life are well placed before the reader especially that describing a  corroboree of the various annuals on our table atalanta edited by mr a b symington  atalanta office is the best the illustrations are excellent and the letterpress is satisfactory the volume opens with a poem of mr blackmores and closes with the conclusion of a tale by mrs parr young england sunday school union contains much wholesome readingwe cannot praise the illustrations in

christmas books that the present season has brought to our table is lighthouses their history and romance by mr w j hardy rt8 mr hardy is an excellent antiquary and his volume is oonsequently not tb production of a bookmaker but the work of a oompotnt obholar woll acquainted with the subject and a very interesting subject it is every one has heard of the suocessive eddystone lighthouses but there is a great deal of romance and adventure attached to the lighthouses all round the coast our only complaint against mr hardy is that he has confine him self to england and ignored scotland and ire land not to speak of france where fresnel invented the dioptrio tem of lighting and the united states to which wo owe the siren it may be presumed that he deemed the subject too extensive within its limits his volume is excellent and it may be sately predicted will be found a favourite with boys mr s  keightley the author of the crimson sign again reminds us that he has to be added to the ranks of the historical novelists though in form an illustrated book for boys there need be no hesitation in reading the cawdjier hutohinson  co on the part of children of a larger growth dealing with that exhaustless treasure house the civil ware of the seventeenth century mr keightley through his hero tom dunoombe convoys tie spirit of the times in excellent ingliah yet we would urge that  trouble in

1081 and that preston must have been meant on p 2 that it is wrong to call a lady laudator tmporis acti and that caprat hs4pin a on p 9 is a literary felony for which no doubt the compositor should be hanged drawn and quartered we have said so much in no carping spirit but because we desire the minutest accuracy in a writer generally admirable in matter and style the goldt roca by ernest glanville chatto  windus is one of the best books of adven ture we have latel see the author has evidently revelled in the multitude of actions fought and perils surmounted by sa and landwhether his hero takes part on the torpedo catcher swift in the most modem struggles of sea monsters or with sirayo the zulu chief at his side penetrates the primaeval wilds of south africa on the quest left him by his uncle to find the treasures of the golden rock there is a sufficient love story too in which frank and his friend webster show mutual loyalty and the heroine is the sort of gracious amazon whom boys

story mr lane has a keen sense of what is acceptable to a juvenile reader and has perhaps never given better proof of it than by editing the red trite story book longmans  co nearly all the stories are good but far the best is the one in which he himself tells of that bravest kindest best and wisest of women who began life by dancing round the good ladies lodge otherwise known as i the fairies tree at domremy and ended it at the stake at rouen for so mr lang and we fear history also will have it we must confess to a lurking hope that the dame den amboises who was five years afterwards reearded by the people of orleans as the maid  herself and sumptuously entertained at the expense of the town whenever she entered its gates was the real maid anything is better than believing that neither her king nor her countrymen raised a fingor to save her mr lang tells the story of urthon from froissart it is a delightful little story and one which children love it would perhaps have been wiser to preserve some of froissarts quaint forms of exproesion the man in white is also good wilsons last fight by mr rider haggard is well told mr crockett contributes two stories neither of which

not today call forth that rapture which invaded the last generation when ia journey to the centre of the earth appeared but they are always w orth reading and those who want a good rattling book of adventure cannot do better than possess themselves of foundling mick a thoroughly satidsatory tale of virtue triumphant mick is a little irish waif who begins the struggle for life in truly disastrous circumstances everything is against him and an ordinary character would have succumbed but mick is no ordinary character circumstances give way before his indomitable will and when he has hardly attained the age of sixteen ho is a successful merchant and financier and the good angel of all who have befriended him the ireland of m jules verne is an interesting study fife itwo storie of life and adventitre for boj edited by alfred h miles hutohinson  co is an excellent collection the only doubt it excites is whether the american element is not a shade too pronounced we do not desire any further importation of american phrases in the language of the rising generation and although of course there is or was a great field for stories of adventure on the prairies  life and adventure at home and at school  should be british for british youth this is not the case in several instances in the book before usthe path in the ravine by mr e s ellis illustrated cassell  co is a circumstantial story lso from america the noble savage here called the dusky miscreant and old ephraim the grizzlybear are much in evidence and there is a characteristically sentimental ending in which the winning ways of a little fairhaired girl of eight who asks after his daughter induce the indian chief to release his white prisoners some knowledge of wvest point and its students is exhibited by the writer in the saga book of lunda illustrated by mr c 0 murray nisbet  co a sequel to the ilds of lunda mrs saxby has produced another spirited account of simple and yet hazardous lives some of the tales a brothers love may be instanced have really an heroic ring in them and their religious bias is nowhere otherwise than obviously sincere the form of a stepmothers strategy by miss everett green hutchinson and its illustrations indicate the christmas book but it reads iather like a novel judged by such a standard it is not without a certain quiet merit though the bitterness of mr challoner against his supposed son geoffrey and the whole entanglement of circumstances to which father ignatius holds the clue are not a little unnatural the vision in which the priest is guided to the proper means of restoring geoffrey to his rights is quite in character with the dignity of a rural mansion and a family of ancient respectabilityin the diinations of kala persad ward lock  bowden mr headon hill has improved upon the ordinary detective story by the introduction of a hindoo whose instinct in the matter of crime is more picturesque than the common methods the divination of the vagus nerve and that of the k odak films are highly ingenious other tales are more commonplace in their machinery but such boys as really take an interest in the forms of crime and methods of criminals will find much ingenuity in the devices of detective zambra and others whether such a study intensely distasteful as it is to most adults of any education be whole some for youth is another matteran old boys yart by mr harold avery cassell  co is a lively collection of stories of schoolboy life grammarschool variety which should be popular but do english boys say hello and i i long  nailing the colours bv mr w e metca jarrold  sons relates how a young lad goes to sea in the merchant service and shows the rough company he sails with that religion and courage may go well together the nautical knowledge of the writer is considerable and the characters of young davenant his grim skipper and others are depicted with plenty of force and distinctnessroy royland or the young castellan w  r chambers is an excellent story by mr george manville fenn telling how a castle in the west was defended in the absence of its owner in king charless service by sir granbys young son and a few faithful followers the details of the siege are told with much spirit and the traitor pawson is well contrasted with the stout combatants on both sides in the great struggle of the

by roma white blanche oram innes  co new relations is one of mrs marshalls pretty stories for girls a little lacking in plot perhaps but brightly written and altogether wholesome and desirable  vikingboys  is in its own way as great a success as mis marshalls charming chronicle few writers understand boys better than mrs saxby and we prophesy that the tale of the vikingboys and their wild deeds will become as popular as the lads of lunda and all the other stories with which mrs saxby has delighted ius the vikingboys are not heroes of old but quite modern lads dwelling in the shetlands who emulate the deeds of their ancestors and play at war geoff and jim harrington are old friends and favourites  we have followed their fortunes for many a year and we find  captain geoff quite as attractive a volume as its predecessors the writer in giving a vivid picture of school life its trials its temptations and its joys is quite at her best while in  little sisters of pity and the somewhat commonplace tales which accompany it she is much less successful miss jean ingelows  stories told to a child are full of charm though at times tinged with sadness they vary in manner as well as in matter and will appeal to a wide circle mr darley dale in his romance of the little doctor takes us to sweden and there delights and astounds us with many marvellous imaginings the gypsy boy who ensnares the little doctor is an uncanny being and we cannot help regretting that mr dale allows his knavish tricks to go unpunished one stormy december night nearly two hundred years ago a solitary horseman was making his way across the wilds of ulster such are the opening words of  cousin isabel a tale of the siege of londonderry and as wo read them we are half reminded of the tales which delighted our youth and in whioh two horsemen were accustomed to ride slowly into the first page a good historical story is a joy to young and old  but it is alas  rare  cousin isabel is neither better nor worse than scores 0f its kind there is not much to be said for or against it  julie is one of those uncomfortable books which are crowded with nursery children and nursery talk the little heroine herself is not without charm but the recital of her woes is almost too saddening she is an incomprise and suffers in silence like all her fellows but that is not all real trials come  she is kidnapped though by friendly hands and persuaded out of her own identity this is more uncomfortable than ever but in the end things of course right themselves with all its faults  julie is a pleasanter book than the witchs den a rambling tale of foolish improbable pranks  brownies and roseleaves is a collection of fanciful tales and verses in the sentimental vein it may please some children  christmas books if it be indiscreet to look a gifthorse in the mouth it were surely unfair to demand too close inquiry into the literary merit of giftbooks for it would seem to be thc fact

feel the full thrill that you should for you know that mr ilentys heroes always come up smiling at thc finish this is therefore a mistake if now and again say once in five books the hero were to perish miserably that particular volume might be received with disfavour in the schoedroom  but the illeffect of this would bc entirely outshadowed by the greater excitement which such a catastrophe

seastory deals among other things with indiamen derelicts pirates slaves and a treasure island mr johnstone takes his readers to new guinea where he introeluces them to savages galore and a valley of gold the new jules verne the castle of thc carpathians london  sampson low  is a capital story even though it shows little of the inventive genius that makes a schoolroom classic of twenty thousand leagues under the sea the science in it consists of some rather tame electrical phenomena with which a wicked baron manages to amaze some villagers in the depths of the carpathians the illusion known as peppers ghost is introduced successfully  and there are plenty of thrilling illustrations a more serious work is ivan the viking by paul du chaillu london  murray the author insists as of yore that the english race is not anglosaxon but scandinavian anel reproduces a letter from mr gladstone who hesitates as ever to commit himself to a statement still he does admit under date of febuary wo that

latest tale is concerned with the troubles and trials of a girl at school and the nocturnal rappings of a traditionary ghost but we think her characters a little unreal a house divided by e m jameson hodder and stoughton 6s is intended for older girls than miss haverfields book and is well written and interesting we follow anthony roden and hester percival from the inception of their loveaffair

the direct grand transasiatic between the european frontier and the capital of the celestial empire in the course of which it is the journalists duty to transmit his news by letter or telegram as he

hoofs have trampedand shows us a vision of strife of treachery of heroism the comanches evil and mighty hover around swoop down and do their utmost the white men resist and fierce is the fight the book ends abruptly and we are thereby encouraged to hope for a sequelon the old frontier being the history of the last raid of the iroquois is much the same kind of book but somewhat longer and

not without interest for grownup people we confess that as we read the christmias hirelings we are filled with surprise not that miss braddon should now write a story for children but that she should have delayed so long to undertake a work for which she is admirably qualified her childcreations are winsome things she thoroughly understands the child wind its joys its sorrows its bewilderinents and without any preaching at all she teaches with a strange force that most ancient of lessonshow that we are tried and judged by children who are far more clear of sight than the adult world with whom black is black and white is white and for whom casuistry is not miss braddon need not fear that her tale lacks interest for grownup people the plot is slight yet effective lhdritier des vaubert par madame p de nanteuil hachette  coevery year madame de nanteuil produces an excellent illustrated novel for young people and displays a remarkable power of writing well about various times and various races on this occasion her story is chiefly laid in the dead cities of the rhcne delta and she is as much at home in the provenqal dialect and the manners of les saintes maries as she has previously shown herself in the habits of northern france it is a curious example of those ways of french printers or editors of which we have often spoken that the british admiral at navarino is

our table shows an increase upon that of the preceding season there isperhaps necessarily since the writer of a boys book has no other object in view than to supply goods for which there is an assured sale in the marketa distressing lack of variety but increase in quantity has not resulted in a falling away in quality mr herbert strang and captain f s breretonboth writers of considerable

better than eitherbetter than kobo his first successful story desmond burke the hero trying to escape from a brutal brother falls into the hands of a scoundrel who sells him as a slave to an indian prince the boya fine character escapes with some of his fellow captives and they seize a vessel and make for calcutta where desmond enters the companys service thenceforward adventure follows adventure and the narration of his heros escapades gives mr strang an opening for a graphic account of the siege of calcutta and the tragedy of the black hole the characters are well drawn and the conversations natural one of clives heroes is a brave bookthe best thing mr strang has done in it he writes of a country he knows in samba hodder and stoughton 5s he writes of a country which we fancy he does not know it is a story of the rubber slaves of the congo and is based on information which mayor may notbe correct but we think that the good taste which mr strang has shown in his other works should have suggested to him that it is a subject which would have been much better left alone it is not in good taste and it is not worthy of its author we should hesitate before putting it into the hands of the boys for whom it is apparently intendedfrom captain brereton as from mr strang come two new books with roberts to candahar a tale of the third afghan war blackie 5s opens at cabul when the british mission under sir louis cavagnari is being attacked by the mutinous troops of the ameer alec dennisson on his way to cabul to meet his father is attacked in a gorge but escapes he is appointed aidedecamp and interpreter to general sir frederick roberts and joins the punitive expedition all trace of major dennisson disappears af ter the massacre at cabul but the youthful alec sets to work to find and rescue him as every hero would and his many adventures and perilous situations out of which his indomitable courage and resource bring him triumphantly make up a book which many boys we fear after a long days reading will smuggle beneath their jackets and finish in bed in  roger the bold a tale of the conquest of mexico blackie 6s captain brereton takes us into a country which will be new to the majority of his readers shortly after the discovery of mexico roger joins an exploration party is taken prisoner and has a narrow escape from death on the altar of the god of war his bravery however saves him and the mexicans offer him the post of cacique and endless treasurewe never knew mexicans so recklessly generousif he will aid them in their fight against the spaniards needless to say he accepts and captain brereton with the reader by his side follows himfighting as only a born fighter couldas he dashes from adventure to adventure at a pace which leaves us breathless but filled with admiration and intensely proud of our country  roger the bold is a fine piece of work there is a strong manly healthy tone in all captain breretons books and his military knowledge gives him a grip of his subject which few other authors of boys books possess gerald the sheriff by charles w whistler warne 6s is a historical romance which is likely to find its way into the hands of parents af terbut not beforeit has been read and possibly reread by their sons the story is placed in the reign of william rufus and deals with the adventures of gerald the sheriff of camelford and edmund son of the thane of crowcombe who outlawed for alleged offences against the forest laws steal geralds own ship and begin a series of hazardous enterprises off our western coast as in his former books mr whistler has caught the atmosphere of the period and mr speeds illustrations are admirable across the spanish main by harry collingwood blackie 5s is a stirring story of adventures on sea in the spacious days of great elizabeth two youths friends from childhood sail with cavendish for the indies early in the voyage their three small ships capture or destroy five spanish frigates after exciting adventures in hispaniola one of the heroes is left by accident on a lonely isl nd but is rescued in time to take part in the capture of a notorious pirate further captures of richly laden galleons attacks on spanish settlements and endless minor escapades follow  across the spanish main  is a capital seastoryone that boys of all ages and all dispositions will enjoy we expect to see it reprinted before long frank brown sea apprentice by frank bullen nisbet 6s though to some extent marred by a suggestion of patronage is a book that will serve a double purpose that of restraining physically weak boys who hanker after sealife because they believe there is nothing to do on board save fight and conquer bold bad pirates and that of encouraging physically strong boys possessed of the genuine seafever and making sailors and potential heroes of them the story of frank brown is well told and it was a story worth telling the adventures of billy topsail by norman duncan hodder and stoughton 5s which deals chiefly with the fisheries off the coast of labrador is the sort of book which wins popularity we imagine among the youth of america though the british schoolboy is likely to find it tiresome billy topsail is too great a heroin  hunting the skipper  spck 5s mr george manville fenn gives a very readable and exciting account of the cruise of the sea fowl sloop mr fenn is a practised hand and his book is never dull the story of the outwitting of captain kingsberry by an american trader and the captains determined chase till he runs his man to earth metaphorically and takes his revenge is well told and the characterisation is good  dick leslies luck by harry collingwood spck 3s 6df is an excellent story of shipwreck and adventure mr collingwood writes of the sea with a sympathy and understanding which are all too rare in writers of boys books and his hero is a fine character well drawn to messrs seeley both givers and recipients

who as privateersman at sea and volunteer on land performs so many surprising feats  but it is well that boys attention should be directed even incidentally to one of the greatest deeds of arms in their countrys history the characters of mr bale and mr medlin are well sketched and there is no cessation of exciting incident throughout the story the same author in  the dash for khartoum tells

recollection of his countrymen edgar and rupert clinton besides taking part in the first suakim and khartoum expeditions are notable for a confusion of identity which even the regulation mole on the person of one of the competitors is incapable of resolving as the tale begins with football at cheltenham in which the heroes bear a manful part to which their endurance in battles and wanderings

as those who read will see mrs marshall so well known as a writer for girls gives us in my lady bountiful an enthusiastic description of a beautiful australian girl who with the aid of her little

sweet william or the castle of mount st michael a tale of early times in normandy we have a charming version of the story ofthe children changed at nursea good old theme capable of infinite variety of treatment  changed lots is a good though somewhat improbable story it sounds decidedly absurd but the tale is so well told that the book is pleasant to read and even excitingit is impossible to say so much for  the young governess a sentimental account of a deformed but noblehearted heroine who disguises herself and goes out as a governess she is neglected insulted and cruelly treated but she manages to survive and to marry a baronet young rich and handsome the book is stilted and unnatural in tone and is not free from vulgarity it has however the merit of being short while fay arlington a confused and confusing chronicle of family troubles is of portentous length is curiously rambling and incoherent and abounds in broken english it would take no ordinary powers to succeed in writing a tale of the times of herod the great and it is no reproach to mrs bewsher to say that her  mischiefmakers or the story of zipporah is not a work of great merit there is little life in the figures which seem to us to be no better than puppets by whose aid a peepshow of that faroff age is presented to us mrs bewshers cleopatra is certainly original the great queen befriends zipporah helps her to flee from the pursuit of antony and thus holds forth   but why confess my shame  know only that a princess descended from the illustrious race of the ptolemies is not made to love a gross brutal aud soulless soldierin vain i give myself up to continual dissipation  of what use is it to change amusements each moment when nothing can cure the wounds of the heart slave to the caprices of the triumvir i am alternately goddess queen bacchante i hunt with him 1 follow bim to the camp but the soul of cleopatra is too elevated to debase itself without being shocked under each disguise i feel the profound humiliation of being obliged to pay court to him as the conqueror of my country yes i must flatter him whom i detest and despise as a man do you think i have sorrows enough but i see that you are impatient your eyes are fixed on the secret door antony was very much surprised to find that there are subterranean passages under this palace communicating with all the theatres but he does not suspect that a veritable labyrinth exists in these walls  and that is why 1 allow him to occupy it follow me this is really very funny in won at last a tale of our own days miss giberne displays considerable powers the plot is not a new one but that does not matter at allit is the treatment which is so admirable there is a fortune at stake and there is plotting and counterplotting  but the interest of the book is not in the money it lies in the vivid comprehension and sympathetic presentment of  everyday anxietiesjust such as hundreds of people are constantly going through we can understand miss gibernes book being a help to manymrs marshalls  little queenie is a pretty story but we could wish that the heroine had not adopted the wornout expedient of getting into a boat which drifts out to sea queenies stepmother who disguises herself as a governess in order to win the affection of the rebellious child is quite in the fashion miss holt has had much experience in the writing of historical novels  she is exceedingly painstaking and accurate  and her new book iine countess maud if carefully studied would enlighten one greatly as to the ways of the fourteenth century but looked upon as a work of art written to please it is scarcely successful the long lists of ladies garments pall upon one and it becomes tiresome to read jnuch of such stuff as this  prithee nell be not thus noyous and troublesome  see thou hast turned my basket upsodown would thou couldst be less overthwart and footrot i the abbots bridge by miss peard also a tale of the fourteenth century is much less learned and much more readable we do not mean that miss peard is ignoranton the contrary she seems to us thoroughly to grasp the spirit of the age of which she writes  but she does not overload her pages with masses of detail her story is full of human interest her people are real men and women and are moved by passions and feelings like to our own the scene is laid in the eastern counties and the abbots bridge leads to the great town of st edmunds bury hal wrangham the hero is a sturdy and upright lad who deserves to win in the battle with his hard and cruel stepmother the opening scene in which the wicked bess would urge beyond their strength hal and his brave dogs is really very finethe author of  the atelier du lys has long since won a reputation  she has never written a dull book and  kinsfolk and others  is quite one of her best the scene is laid in the lake country where stern old mrs garth lived and died the dour northcountrywoman is a fine study as is her granddaughter olive who indeed is the heroine of the bookmiss coleridges  fifty pounds  is of a lower order of merit it is a harmless but not specially interesting storyof village loves and hates and money troubles the editor of  fiftytwo further stories for girls seems anxious lest girls should not receive their proper share in the annual output of the printingpress we should like to reassure him  we are convinced that there need be no cause for anxiety mr miless thick volume contains tales of all sorts none of them is exactly bad a few are good but the most are indifferent perhaps one of the best is the last in the book a curious story from the russian entitled  the bride of the wind while miss doudney wields her pen girls will certainly not be unprovided  the family difficulty and  the love dream of gatty fenning are books for girls and about girls in each the heroine is misunderstood in her youth in each the trouble passes there is a singular charm about the setting of gatty fenning who was born in the meon country under the shadow of the steep chalk downs where the men of the meon  had lived their independent life and worshipped their idols twelve hundred years ago in  who shall serve  a story for the times miss annie swan deals with a subject of the highest importancethe labour question her story opens on the eve of a great strike in a shipbuilding yard with extraordinary insight and sympathy she approaches the matter now from the side of the masters now from that of the men  she weaves more than one lovestory in with though tangle of the fight and the whole is a picture of life ihe burning of rome is probably the best of the many excellent tales that mr church has produced the hero and heroine are the pudens and claudia whose marriage seemed to martial as happily conceived as the mixture of wine with honey but the historical scenes which follow one another in swift succession are of such interest that the readers attention is concentrated rather on them than on the actors of the drama in the opening chapter we are introduced to nero his second wife poppiea and his counsellor tigellinus and a vivid picture is given of the luxurious roman court then follow the burning of rome and the consequent persecution of the christians very touching is the account of the steadfastness and piety of the little band of converts who hold their services in the catacombs another thread of interest which runs through the story is though plot to assassinate nero and its failure on several occasions owing to the timidity or vacillation of one or other of the conspirators the death of popprea the repeal of the edict against the christians and the marriage of pudens and claudia form an agreeable deuoament when we add that among the minor historical persons introduced are seneca piso lucan and flavus subrius the prefect of the praetorians mr churchs admirers will know that he has once more happily combined learning with imagination mr church has also published an expansion of the wellknown stories from homerwith which he began his series of christmas books some fifteen years ago the story of the odyssey is a mixture of close paraphrase and translation of the whole odyssey while  the story of the iliad is naturally more abridged from the original epic mr churchs style is as good as ever and requires no further praise the illustrations as in the earlier book are copies of flaxmans designs printed in imitation of red vasepaintings mr reed has written a stirring story of a boys efforts to find his lost brother  the indefatigable mr george manville fenn has turned historian of a boys expedition in the higher alps the illustrations are as thrilling as the letterpress and the feats of climbing are enough to make one feel giddy to read of  not wanted is a tale of adventure with more of the minor key in it than there would be in a mans story for boys but it is well told and the amnesia happily overcome of the hero lewis harcourt or guy leighton is a distinctive feature mr alfred elwes breaks new ground in describing the adventures of a boy in the interior of corsica as the author remarks  it may seem strange that a fertile island situated in the midst of a sea which was once the chief seat of navigation and is now one of the great highways of the civilised world an island too which is but a few hours journey from the luxuries of a refined life should still remain in the condition in which it is described in these pages the constables tower is a very fair specimen of an historical tale dealing with the days of hubert de burgh and the siege of dover castle the author explains she has taken a liberty in introducing a daughter of huberts at that date but the demoiselle mayette by name is very necessary to the story  christmas book8 in taunton totm nelson  sons and after dgemoor hutchinson  co are alike tales of monmouths rebellion both deal with the well  known battle both take the side of the protestant duke and both tell the story of jeffreys of his browbeating cruelty and downfall but here the likeness ends for mia everett greens  in taunton town deals with homekeeping folk who never leave the west country and with their loves and sor rows while mr edgar pickerings heroes after sedgemoor are sent across the seas to be sold as slaves in the end of course they escape they survive perils by land and sea and their doings are told in good stirring style by mr pickering who writes as pretty a book of adventure as one wants miss everett greens chronicle is adorned by a portrait of king monmouth the adventures of mr pickerings banished rebels are exciting enough but seldom have boys read so thriling a tale as mr d l johnstones the brotherhood of the coas6 chambers a young scot of gentle blood and gentle nurture flees from his country when  early in charles iis reign the unhappy religious troubles began he flits hither and thither he ruffles it for a time in london then sails for the indies where he falls into the power of the dreaded brotherhood of the coast how fortune favours him and how he and his lady fair escape from the pirates must be learned from

marshalls book of that name is no less a person than george frederick handel and mrs mar shall supplies a noble picture of the great man especially dwelling on him as a benefactor of the foundling hospital the scene opens on a bitter night of northeast wind in lambsconduit field at the ate of capt corams house of refuge when little pearl afterwards to be handels pet and favourite is brought in and left as a foundling we hear further on of pearls parentage and more than one love story is woven in with the story of the music but by far the most attractive part of the book is that which deals with handel himself the pictures are excellent the frontispiece being a reproduction of an engraving by faber after iudsons portrait of the musician a knight of the air digby  long is most disappointing the title is enticing and from mr henry coxwell the reader expects a really good tale of airial adven ture but the hero though lie certainly does spend a good deal of time in his balloon occupies himself as any ordinary hero on solid earth might do in making love and in contending with his rival who is a wonderful villain and an adept in love and in fraudulent finance there are too many people hovering about the knight of the air and they do too many things in too confused a manner as for the episode of the flighty fiasco  when the financier and the flying machine meet on haywards heath and do weird things we have done our best to find out its drift but in vainmiss e raymonds romance of the mushroom care arnold takes boys and girls to the depths of the earth with geraldine and gerald the famous twins who go to seek their fortune not in vain the twins and their belongings are unusual to say the least of it never surely in real life was there anything like the

only contains the first series christmas would not be christmas in the aursery at least without a new book from mrs molesworth the familiar red cover seems to be a thing of the past for the carved lions macmillan  co appears clad in dull blue of a solemn and beautiful shade the lions themselves adorn the cover and very stately and grand they are they are mysterious beasts of a mysterious origin they came from the east and when we make their acquaintance they are standing in an old furniture shop in the grim town which is the home of little geraldine the heroine of mrs molesworths pretty and fanciful tale they were carved in dark almost black wood they were nearly as large as life and little geraldine concocted all sorts of fancies about them sometimes she thought that they were enchanted princes sometimes that they were real lions who were only carved wood in the daytime and at night walked about wherever they liked geraldine has childish troubles she is at school and all are not kind her parents are exiled and she is terribly alone but always the lions are her guardian angels and so she fancies they bring her happiness at the last my book of wonders which belongs to  the childrens favourite series published by mr edward arnold would make an excellent readingbook it contains pleasantly written accounts of the tay bridge the tower bridgethat mighty watergate of londonand other

stories about animals arranged in easy lessons each lesson followed by a set of searching questions to trip up the unlucky child who does not think as he reads like the other books of the series  wild and tame can boast of numerous illustrations my honey innes  co by the author of  tipcat would be a novel if it were differently bound but for some good reason no doubt it appears in the harmless guise of a  book for girls  my honey is a wayward headstrong girl who through much tribulation grows into a noble woman the gentle old rector is a beautiful character and the friendship between him

musician and when a rich patron appears who offers to adopt and to train the lad the good elder brother gives him up without a murmur but in a somewhat quixotic manner refuses to allow any one to pay hugos fees and takes the burden on himself many other burdens oppress him he struggles on manfully but in vain till utter ruin stares him in the face then hugo has to choose between his art and his brother and the story of his choice is quite worth reading among the gnomes by dr franz hartmann fisher unwin is a story in lewis carrolls latest manner science enters fairyland and disports itself there in a fantastic and occasionally amusing manner we fear however that the adventures of mr schneider will scarcely be acceptable to young people and will only faintly divert older people for the sake of a friend by miss 1 margaret parker blackie  son is an excellent schoolgirl story mrs lorraines school is at melbourne and a vivacious set of scholars are the australian maidens the warmth with which according to their several natures they all endeavour to undo the effects of their unkind suspicion of one of their number as that most despicable character a sneak is very admirable as are the complications which so nearly unhinge the reason of gentle susie snow she and her friend trix bereeford are charming girls  christma books few christmas books will be more to the taste of the ingenuous boy than in the heart of the rockies by mr g a henty blackie  son he is careful to date his story some eight or tine years previous to the government survey under major powell and his indian episodes might therefore possibly be historical leaping horse and hunting dog as friendly  natives are all the fancy has painted them under the influence of fenimore cooper and straight harry and his mates including the necessary boy hero tom wade combine a maximum of daring and inventiveness with a minimum of debased vernacular mr henty bids fair to break the record  with the number at least of his  historical  tales for the rising generation a foreleaf to when loivon burted same publishers contains a list of thirty there are unless we are mistaken yet others and the number of them is not yet completed happily the quality of mr hentys work if it does not improve at any rate does not fall off and this study of restoration days and the great fire is at least as good as its predecessors mr finnemore contributes some pictures which have the distinction almost unique today of being credible illustrations of the texta plunge into the sahara by mr g demage sampson low  co reads like a translation the illustrations by mr p crampel are very french and it may be added very amusing the french soudan is an unfamiliar field for english boys and they will extract much entertainment and some knowledge from their inexhaustibly goodhumoured companion in the reef of gold arnold mr maurice h hervey supplies an account of travels in the antipodes and south america and especially of the discovery of a golden reef of sandstone formation on a small outlying island of the louisiade group he deprecates criticism of the possibility of such a find based on the general experience that the precious metal lies in quartz in fact the author is a trifle didactic as becomes an exheadmastershipwrecked on their voyage to valparaiso jack brook whose very long legs adorn the frontispiece and his chum mickey obrien the brassbound reefer are carried on to sydney and the yellow god which gives title to mr reginald horsleys book chambers is found in the gold diggings these are in their virgin fertility and the twain make their fortunes after adventures of a bloody character with bushrangers a comic black fellow and a yankee skippers wife provide some of the fun which is not of an overpowering character the tailpieces seem to be clichs of forgotten blocksmr manville rennes diamend dyke same publishers is honest journeywork by an old hand at storytelling that is to say it is not particularly good yet good enough with the help of a young hero of healthy sporting instincts and not less healthy nature a lion or two ostriches niggers a quaint kindly old farmer and the more or less stirring events that are supposed by romancers to make up life in the veldt he has compacted an interesting yarn that boys will read with pleasure if only because they will thus be made acquainte with a certain dog named duke in a sense indeed duke is as much the hero of the story as his master souwester and sivord by mr hugh st leger blackie  son is as racy a tale of life at sea and war adventure as we have met with for some time there is no attempt at fine writing it is from first to last a plainsailing straightforward narrative alive with incident and character and stamped with a veracity that suggests actual experience by the author of the things he describes there is a capital mutiny and of course there is a shipwreck also a firstrate storm or two and plenty of good fun and good fighting altogether it seems the sort of book that boys will revel inthe literary measure of stirring tales of colonial adventure by skipp borlase warne  co may be taken from the titles the black bloodhound and  lured to their doom but if any doubt remains after such gleanings from the table of contents it must be banished by none other than the first sentence which is  a vast sun of apparently melted brass gleams down from out a sky of seeming burnished steel upon a plain a yellow as the stubble of a fresh reaped wheatfield and which is dotted here and there with clumps of gum trees whose trunks and boughs are enigh white as ivory whilst their quivering foliage is almost sage green well to adapt another choice utterance at p 113 we mig draw out skipp borlases literary mmfortunes as exhibited in this book  until we filled a volume but space and time alike forbid suffice it to say that this is not a book for boy or for that matter any other sort of readerin young travellers tales blackie  son mr ascott r hope has essayed with a rashness seldom found in a veteran bookmaker to combine light amusement with useful information of course the blending of instruction with amusement has been attempted many a time but it cannot honestly be said that mr hope has made any better job of a dubious task than his predecessors and rivali boris the bearhunter nelson  sons by mr f widaw combines a great amount of sylvan adventure in which boris a colosel young moujik from archangel plays a dominant part with a serious attempt to popularise the history of his patron and comrade peter the great the writer who has evidently strong russian sympathies succeeds in investing with much interestthat strange mixtureof impulsiveness and caution of civilised aspirations and barbarous intervals of oarse revelryor bloodthirsty vengeance which made up the character of the founder of modern russiamr e d fawcett seems to aspire to the mantle of jules verne and it is no small credit to him that he clothes with someveriimilitude his startling conception of a party of english travellers and their italian friends being entombed some four hundred feet below the surface of the earth and after many adventures and discoveries being shot up again to the level of the sea on the west coast of calabria the oomposition of the party in swauowed by ane earthquake arnold lends itself to this semiscientific minuteness and earnestness of relation for among the adventurers are an eminent italian geologist and an english expert upon earthquakes who are able to supply the adventurers with ready comments on all the wonders they encountermr averys volume of short stories for boys the schools monour sunday school union is quite up to date in the modern varieties of football and

children is one of the very numerous but not always very successful incursions into english history of the rev a j church its merits are that it is written in the flowing easy style of a practised literary hand and is therefore often likely to attract young readers that it is nicely got up moderate in size and adorned with numerous illustrations some of which are successful enough its chief demerit is the looseness of the grip its author has on his subject he tells his familiar anecdotes pleasantly enough but he has not always taken the trouble to use his facts precisely so that lie is coiistantly making little blunders thus lie writes  earl  of hereford when it should be duke bishop of asaph  instead of st asaph he tells us that the famous sword with five crosses used by the maid of orleans was laid up  in the church of chinon when it was really found at ste catherine de fierbois he has implicit faith in the numbers currently assigned to mediaeval armies believing that 100000 men fought at towton he thinks that richard iiis crownwearing ceremony at york marks that he was  crowned a second time by the archbishop of york which is the northern province  and his english as the above sentence shows is often slipshod and careless he repeats the story that warbecks widow was buried at swansea when she was really buried at fyfield near abingdon he says that belgium is  the western part  of the netherlands that zutphen is in the province of quelderland and that raleigh was beheaded in 1516 we quote such trivialities not because we think them great enormities but simply that we may indicate the careless way in which the book has been compiled my new home macmillan  co is one of mrs molesworths charming sketches of child life it is a little melancholy in tone but mrs

difficult to foresee that she will have a stormy childhood the child is however good at heart and learns lifes lessons and the  new home becomes a real home and not a place of torment there are several illustrations all dainty and attractive we fancy we have seen my new home before there are some good stories in snow bird and the water tiger c by margaret compton lawrence  bullen the collection being mainly founded on  government reports of indian life and the folklore contained in the standard works of schoolcraft copway and catlin these tales are very different from the ordinary nursery fiction provided by persons who conceive themselves to be possessed of imagination as is usual in american indian stories animals live in confidential intercourse with men helping them when well disposed or waging war against them if the reverse with strength and cunning we feel ourselves however obliged to protest against  center color  mold mould pretense c being set before our children as english forms of orthography we scarcely expected to find this economy of labor  in a book bearing the names of english publishers miss mary howarth whose stories of norway in the saga

soldierservant stiff wooden old brown whose heart was all gold and who gave his life for the little lad miss crompton paints vividly for us the low hollow land of nether mote on that deadly night when the great tide burst into the deeps and the ghostly grey water overtook messire and his faithful old companionthe disagreeable duke which calls itself a christmas whimsicality for holiday boys and girls is full of rollicking fun and fancy it is more like a dream of laughter than a chronicle of real folks yet beauty and the beast and the robber band eid the disagreeable duke himself seem to us quite familiar we must have met them all iii the flesh somewhere or other before they bad that meeting in the attio which was the beinning of the fray a battle and a boy already familiar to the readers of atalanta is quite a book apart it is a study of character character triumphing over circumstancesdrawn with admirable skill and force and sympathy the scene is chiefly laid in the highlands round about the lake of constance and we first meet little franzl in the childmarket of ravensburg whither he has come to sell to the highest bidder his youth his strength his nimble wit his untiring zeal there in the midst of the motley crowd  he stood alert and sunny calling buy me i buy me i  with his fresh young voice and awaiting his fate his fate stalked up to him in the shape of a suabian peasant the bargain was driven franz was bought and sold and duly registered and became for a year the property of old christian lutz a stern and hard master yet not unjust how franz grew in body and mind and impressed himself on all around and left his mark on the fate of many must be read to be appreciated the book breaks off abruptly rather than comes to a fitting end the reader longs to hear more and wonders whether his longing will ever be gratified banshee castle blackie  son is one of the most fascinating of miss rosa mulhollands many fascinating stories the plot is a little fantastic but we do not quarrel with the book on that account the charm of the tale lies in the telling of it the three heroines are admirably drawn characters they are all quite different and the pearl of them all is dympna the clever little housewife who is also a beauty and a poet and shares her turret chamber with the friendly ghost of her ancestress  miss margreet dympna loves above all her country the wild irish lands the wild irish legends have for her a compelling charm and one is tempted to linger long over the beautiful old tales which miss mulholland knows so well the readers of st nicholas that pleasant childrens magazine which comes to us from the new world will welcome a volume from the pen of miss mary shapes dodge the laud of pluck part i fisher unwin is an attractive collection of stories and sketches for young people bound in warm and cheery yellow it consists of a series of papers on holland  expanded to more than double the proportions of  the land of pluck as printed a few years ago in st nicholas there is a great fascination about the famous little country with its dunes its dykes its windmills its eternal struggle with the sea that nearest of neighbours and most constant of foes the illustrations are many and delightful the frontispiece two boys of holland being an engraving from a fine dutch picture attributed to cuyp mr fisher unwin also publishes a charming little volume of miss dodges verse for boys and girls entitled when life is young several of the verses have already appeared in the pages of st nicholas the rest are now printed for the first time it is a pleasure to find that mrs f a steel who knows india and indian ways so well is not unmindful of the duty of collecting folktales there are some very good ones in tales of the punjab macmillan and it is to be hoped the volume is the forerunner of others some of them have a strong family likeness to stories with which we are already familiar the rats wedding for instance is a good variant though it lacks the bonhomie of hans in luck and valiant vicky of the valiant little tailor  the son of seven mothers too and little anklebone likewise remind us of stories in the grimms marchen though of course the former have an indian setting in india too as in europe there are good and faithful ants whose gratitude load them to separate large quantities of grains of millet seed from an equally large quantity of grains of sand with a punctuality and speed that could never have been attained by one unhappy prince the only complaint that we have to make is that these stories are not often told in the simple and direct way in which such stories should be told simplicity and directness carry conviction with them and are more telling than any other method of narration sometimes mrs steel shows that she is aware of this and uses turns of expression evidently taken down from the mouths of the people but more frequently she seems divided between wardour street medisevalisms such as ho sir confectioner bring me sweets  impudent varlet c and  up to date  vulgarisms such as the cocksparrow was a gay and festive bird the jackal winked a very big wink and oh dearest hubby hub i what have you brought for grub to me and the darligk cub to counterbalance these there is a jackal who speaks of the difficulty of exciting the higher emotions these are small objections to make but in folktales the style of narration is important and the narrator should always keep himself out of the narrative mrs steel intrudes her thoughts and opinions on the reader by saying  for my part i think or  it must be confessed or  if you think this very extraordinary so do i the notes are good and interesting among other things we are told that the white elephant of familiar speech is no other than  the elephantheaded god ganess and as such is or rather was formerly kept by rjas as a pet and fed to surfeit every tuesday with sweet cakes we wish mrs steel had told us how many pounds or stone or hundredweights of sweet cakes a sacred elephant can consume before he is surfeited we regret that we can say no word of praise for the illustrations the mention of some editions of old favourites may close this notice of the books which the season has brought us to messrs macmillan we are indebted for a reprint of giflivers travels most excellently illustrated by mr c e brock whose designs show much power of felicitous invention a valuable introduction by mr h craik combines with mr brocks cuts to remove this edition from the ordinary run of christmas volumesthat

illustrations are excellent and perhaps all the more so because mr gaskin has evidently been a diligent student of the work of mr burnejones let the source of inspiration be what it may the pleasure we derive from seeing these weary and worldworn princesses and goosegirls whose eyes are filled with a deep nay unfathomable woe is great there is a picture too which vividly recalls mr holman hunts  isabella and the pot of basil mr hunts isabella has become andersens tommelise though why andersens tomraelise should have been turned into thumbelina we cannot say why the overdyne which covered her little bed should be translated blanketwhy the toad which was proposed to her as a husband should be translated as the old toad instead of the ugly toad and the mudder in which he dwelled be called a marsh or the skrppeblad dock leaf with which tommelise covered herself be called a shamrock leafare also problems but we do think that the song which she sang to her next lover the muldvarp mole in the north of england  mowdiewarp  oldonborre flyv flyv should not have been rendered cockchafer cockchafer flyaway but  ladybird ladybird fly away home there are certainly many bits of careless translation whatever holger danskes beard may have done in the legend in andersens story it is not described as growing through the table but as having grown fast to it then again tolv skilling should not be translated  twelve shillings a skilling is a coin between a halfpenny and a farthing these are trifles but there are many such and yet the translation is eminently readable and the book so daintily sent forth that it is a joy to have it in the hand tales from shakespeare by charles lamb routledge  sons is announced to contain  one hundred and eightythree illustrations by sir john

pictures which jill form the delight of many a nursery tib and sib is a pretty enough tale of the nursery and also gives a glimpse at the doings of the grownup folk and even contains a mystery which concerns both though children and their elders tib and sib are a funny little pair and deserve to be favouritesrudolph of rosenfeldt a story of the time of william the silent is long confused ill arranged and unutterably dull history and fiction are interwoven but with no master hand the unmasking of father volkmer is really ludicrous heroes of our day is well conceived but badly carried out it is a history of recent winners of the victoria cross  the subject is deeply interesting but unluckily the book is not written in an interesting style  the secret of the magian  or the mystery ofecbatana by a laurie has already appeared as a serial story in the pages of the boys oom paper it is a marvellous tale of treasure lost and found and lost again somewhat after the style of jules verne a brisk young french engineer is the hero and a spectacled german professor the villain villainy meets with its due reward and though picture of the professor falling headlong into the pit of his own digging is truly astounding a dark place of the earth  is quite the best book of adventure we have read for a very long time perhaps strictly speaking it is not a book of adventure  at least the adventure is so wild and weird that it is shown to us in the guise of a dream it is written by mr alfred clark of the forest department ceylon we fancy that it is his first essay but we hope that it will not be his last it is fresh powerful and extraordinarily vivid in presentmentso vivid indeed that we welcome with a sigh of relief the earthquake which breaks up the enchantment the dreamer one hugh harrod an english magistrate in ceylon picks up an old and rare book entitled a relation of the ware of the dutch and portugueses in the island of ceilon by pieter van marten printed at amsterdam 1665 there he reads how in a strange seafight five great ships disappeared and were never beheld again though the sound of their guns was often heard meditating on tbisstrange thing hugh goes afishing and is driven by a gale on to the rocky shore of  an extraordinary unknown foghidden volcanic island there he finds dutchmen dressed and armed in the fashion of the seventeenth century there also are the portuguese  the island is divided between the enemies who contend in deadly fight the unhappy englishman is drawn into the fray and terrible things happen on this terrible island the book is not without lighter touches to relieve the gloom of that dark place but the remarkable thing is that the hatred of the hereditary enemies is so vividly portrayed that the rage of battle is stirred up even in the peaceful reader in the fossicker mr glanville whose lost heiress met with some favour makes further uso of his experience of the rough conditions of life and travel in south africa frank smedley its hero willing to oblige his friend drury goes with him in search of the usaing brother of the young lady to whom drury is engaged and he perseveres in the quest although they hear at cape town that the brother is dead and although drury quickly fems aside to devote himself to a boer damsel both friends pass through appalling adventures nd the risks into which smedley rushes blindly would suffice to kill him ten times over were he an ordinary mortal he encounters ghosts as well as lions and alligators hostile boers and suspicious zulus and his most dangerous enemy is an english villain but he has a charmed life sutlers no serious inconvenience from his wounds or lack of food always has at hand rifle powder and shot which the rivers he wades through do not damp and which are replenished as miraculously as was the widows cruse and at length secures reversion of the love of the lady whom his friend has jilted the story is preposterous throughout  but it is readable by reason of its descriptions of south african scenery and of south african types of people its most interesting and most lifelike personage is a hottentot waif sometimes mistaken for a monkey who attaches himself to smedley and acts as his guide philosopher and slave in his journey to mashonaland and back again mr stockton revels in humour in  the rudder grangers abroad unlike most americans he makes fun of the foibles of his countrymen or countrywomen we should say in the present instance pomonas absurdities and her account of earl cobden are laughable we cannot say much for the other stories a ship with a cargo of stored electricity turning itself into a magnet and attracting a submarine cable which becomes attached to its keel is too much for us no wonder its crew imagined it to be the prey of a  water devil mr manville fenn thoroughly understands and sympathises with boys who in return read his books with avidity burr junior is a history of schoolboy life with considering the subject a large number of exciting incidents in it the charm of the work is that the motives ideas tastes feelings are all thoroughly boyish and there is not a single prig among the young dramatis persona the character sketches are capital the pompous but kindhearted head master the irascible yet goodnatured retired general the exdragoon of a type which short service is making every day rarer the sneaking thief and poacher and the schoolboy whose whole thoughts are given to natural history are all of them instinct with life and realitymajor percy groves has produced a different style of book for while it cannot but interest boys deeply it may be read with equal pleasure and no little instruction by all who delight in the warlike deeds of the soldiers of the end of the last century and the beginning of the present the green jackets  are the rifle brigade and their exploits in various parts of the world are related with great spirit in fiftytwo stories for boys it is needless to say considering the list of authors on the titlepage there is some good reading the book is a miscellany of tales of adventure by sea in war in hunting and on the railway in all parts of the world not the least exciting are those the scenes of which are placed in america most of the stories are very short which is a merit but on the other hand several are poor and without point   the cruise of the crystal boat though by so experienced and popular a writer of boys books as dr gordon stables is to a certain extent a failure there is too much moralising in it to please boys and the scientific part of it is too extravagant to satisfy even the most credulous and imaginative it is a sort of cross between  rasselas and jules verne but it lacks jules vernes chief merit again dr stables selects an oriental prince as his hero and carries him with his faithful henchman and a wise and benevolent oriental sage on a cruise all over the world in an aerial ship worked by electricity yet he is little careful to make their language and modes of thought harmonise with their nationality apart from the fact that the ideas of these the principal actors in the extravaganza are essentially occidental their speech is occasionally a grotesque mixture of eastern hyperbole and anglosaxon slang in short all the dramatis persona re glaringly unnatural not to say impossible

condition of ruperts land in the early part of the century when the rivalry between the northwest and hudsons bay companies involved settlers and indians alike in war and privation the stories of certain scotch settlers highland and lowland are involved in these general troubles and among the grownup characters two young heroes archie and his invalid brother little bill will interest boyish readers mr leighton in the pilots of pomona takes the thoughts of the schoolboy to the straits and skerries the cliffs and caves of the orkney islands the story of halcro and thora is very well told apropos of the  mainland a skipper from portree is mentioned who was taking his brig to the west indies   weel when they had been at gea twa or three months jock cam on deck ae morn in and  donald says he to his mate dye not see lana yonder to starboard    av sir says donald  im just thinkin it will be the west indies youre right there donald the west indies it is says jock  see yonders the

other mainland is there     cesar cascabel is a wonderful production like most of m jules vernes books it is the story of a journey some acrobats wish to travel from california to their native france and having no money they determine to go in their caravan northwards to behring straits cross on the ice and make their way through siberia into europe m jules vernes travellers are generally successful in spito of robbers icebergs and the russian police the bold frenchmen triumphantly reach their goal there is nothing more to be said about the works of this very prolific writer they have long ago been criticised and classed  but we cannot help wishing that they were better translated we are in the land of romance in the remote parts of peru where mr evelyn has placed his white savages and the inca queen who of course turns out to be of european parentage and whose discovery and that of her father enable the young adventurers to turn the tables on their usurping uncle at home it is all a little too unreal but is not so hackneyed in theme as some of the innumerable books of adventure which are produced at this season mrs l t mead cannot write a dull book often indeed she delights us greatly but we cannot profess to find  the children of wilton chase  so attractive as some of her other works ermengarde the elder of the wilton girls is we are told  in many ways a commonplace child we hope however that her talent for intrigue is something more than common she carries on from the beginning to the end of the book an elaborate system of deceit hideous to contemplate basil is a fine fellow as for marjorie she is a veritable little angel but ermengarde and her tortuous ways are in the foreground and shut us out from the sight of pleasanter things joan and jerry are an attractive pair of heroines who bicker in very amusing fashion right through the book joan is poor while jerry or rather geraldine is rich if joan would only pocket her pride and consent to live with her wealthy kindred all would be well but then we should have to forego mrs oreillys book elizabeth by henley j arden is chiefly remarkable for the vivid and sympathetic description of the fen country there is not much of a plot elizabeth exiled from her home and her true love suffers many things in the dreary country which she hates but all rights itself in though end as in most christmas books the author of  duty and affection  takes us back to the days of the napoleonic wars and tells pleasantly enough the story of a little drummerboy  ernests golden thread is too morbid too sad too depressing it is the tale of an excellent little lad whose one desire is to do right his uncle mistrusts him his cousins bully him tramps kidnap him at the last of course his luck tunis but just as his happy days begin we leave him three bright girls which calls itself a story of chance and mischance is a rambling and tiresome chronicle of family ups and downs first the girls were rich then they were poor then they married and lived happy ever after the brothers talboystwo little old gentlemen twins almost exactly alike who call each other brother ned and brother benseem to remind us of a betterknown pair of brothers in another and a better book in brave and true we find four short stories of no great interest the frontispiece is to be avoided  susies service  is a story with a purpose a persistent and obtrusive purpose lt is a temperance tale and the horrors of drink are insisted upon from the first page to the last the book positively reeks with whiskey we hope it is not intended for children  a local lion by austin clare is of a very different type it is a book well worth reading it is quite one of the best of its kind the poor lion andrew elliot is a northcountry ad  a violinist  an amateur and home taught but with a real love for his art he is petted and spoilt by the country folk around  he mistakes his pretty gift for a heavenborn genius forsakes his home and goes out to conquer the world with his fiddle he has a rude awakening and comes back a wiser and better albeit a sadder man his father the old pilot is a grand figure villagers old and young are sketched with a light and unerring hand  and hemcleugh the desolatelooking fishing village on the wild northumbrian shore is shown to us by one who knows and loves the north country we have heard more than once of geoff and jim harrington  the present volume tells of their early schooldays almost too exciting and too full of adventure to be very edifying to the little lads  daisys story  is written we learn from the preface with the earnest desire that it may prove a help to some little traveller zionward we do not doubt the authors good intention but we have a great dislike to her methods daisy at the age of ten begins to keep a diary full and elaborate wherein she records not only her words and deeds but her thoughts and feelings her success and failure her elation and her remorse  an unhealthy practice and good for neither the youthful writer nor the youthful reader  love unfeigned is a curious and inappropriate title for a somewhat vulgar tale of tittletattle the story of wild bryoniethough a little too long is not without merit the heroine a wilful lassie is very attractive she takes a good deal of taming but she is worth it  christmas books tjte children of the castle by

co the tale of christmas books would be incomplete without a story from mrs molesworth who has delighted so many children for so many years the children of the castle with familiar red cover and charming illustrations by mr walter crane begins with great promise the very vision of the grand old castle by the sea enchants us ruby and mavis are sweet little people their ways are full of charm and we prepare ourselves for a treat but we must regretfully say that the book does not improve as it goes onnay quite the reverse stories of home life are attractive and fairy tales have a special charm of their own  but that fairies should intrude on the ordinary life of today appear upstairs and downstairs in and out and take upon themselves the task of ordering the daily doings of the children does not commend itself to us there is something which jars in this mingling of the real and the unreal and we cannot but feel that many children will agree with us mr lang leads us in quite another way lovers of  the blue fairy book of last year and of all good fairy tales will welcome with delight the red fairy book mr langs latest gift to children in a second gleaning of the fields of fairy land says the accomplished editor we cannot expect to find a second perrault but there are good stories enough left and straightway he finds and collects enough stories to make a most inviting volume mr lang has had many able assistants in his pleasant task and has himself condensed the story of  sigurd  from mr william morriss prose version of the volsunga saga a sad story indeed but full of strange charm not many new fairy tales are equal to the old but mr george mac donalds light princess which with its companion stories is now reprinted isa very pretty fancy  and the adventures of prince almero of miss wilhelmina pickering is an original and charming tale of the fairies of the sea told with much grace and riveting our interest throughout the author in her preface makes modest apologies for appearing in print but no apology indeed is needed and we shall hope to see more of her work another apology comes from another writer the author of maggie in mythica solicits indulgence for this her first fairy tale but with every wish to be lenient we cannot truthfully say more of  maggie than that it is a rather poor tale of the wonderland type and not over well told the society for promoting christian knowledge is as usual busily engaged in producing more or less successful christmas books  dorothy the dictator is a rather tiresome chronicle of a large and selfish family who go through endless trials and troubles because they insist on living a luxurious life in a large country house on insufficient means this plan is naturally a failure one after another the sisters attempt the impossible task  even dorothys stern reign comes to an untimely end for the selfabsorbed crew rise up and rebel against their  dictator in the end the family scatters each one to look after himself it is a poor tale a pearl in the shell by austin clare is of a different character the author describes it as a tale of life and love in the northcountrie and we will add that it is well and simply told with force and grace and that it brings vividly before the reader the life of the northern uplands and the ways of the northcountry folk miss mabel fowlers  tale of a somersetshire village entitled  hope is not so interesting  and seven idols by f e reade is one of those books which we neither like nor approve of being the tale of a pack of girls always and eagerly employed in introspectionwe have had enough and more than enough in the last few years of the history of old times retold from parchments and the like it is most difficult to make such books interesting and miss hewitt in  the heart of sheba has certainly not been successful it is the story of the queen of sheba astold in the parchment of arnath the queens brother and it is dulldeadly dull mrs herbert martin has written in  little greatgrandmother  a pretty story of a fascinating little heroine lady betty hartington who lived and died a century ago one of the most amusing and attractive christmas books is mr w s gilberts  songs of a savoyardsongs collected from the many comic operas which have delighted us for so many years from hms pinafore to  the gondoliers mr gilbert adorns the book with many delightfully absurd illustrations and gracefully dedicates it to sir arthur sullivan in just acknowledgment of the distinction his genius has conferred upon these songs during the fourteen years that we have worked together mrs whitney has had a great deal of practice since she wrote  faith gartneys girlhood but her readers will probably agree for the most part in placing that meritorious little american story above all its successors ascutney street is no rival to it traces of morbidity and sentimentality affectations of style and moral tall talk were observable in the formerwork they arecommon in the new one and yet when the author allows herself to tell her quite simple and pretty story straightforwardly forgetting selfconsciousness and mannerism there ib again the genuine ring with which her readers are acquainted unfortunately this is too seldom the case and in trying to be pithy or profound she is oftener than not tiresome and incomprehensible such efforts are quite out of place and only spoil her whole achievement sad liberties are taken with our muchenduring language it was a bit of a happening and  alice has taken such alovingto you are dangerous examples to set before young girls american or english the moral talk is apt to become so extremely tall as to be quite incomprehensible to an ordinary understanding witness the heroines concluding remarks   everything is as good as everything the day isnt over till it has all got lighted up  the world is round and life is as round as the world john  let john unravel this if he can  the australasian writers come out very strongly in the pretty volume over the sea mrs campbell praed and mrs patchett martin have unfortunately chosen almost the same theme and told the story of children lost in queensland dying in each others arms  though as a fact one child out of their two pair is saved these two stories are as prettily told as possible a victorian tale by tasma is also excellent and far less sad  and mr f e weatherly and mr marriott watson contribute stories these two of english life that are above the average of such work although the pathetic note is marked in mr weatherlys nan lady delawarr and two other writers have written tales for  over the sea  which are either distinctly bad or far less good than those which we have named the illustrations in colour are such as children will approve but the cuts in black and white do not correspond with them and are in the way  christmas books nolens vulens or the adventures of don lavington by george manville fenn partridge

the wonderful adventures of the egyptian boy in persia and the rapid transitions from poverty to wealth from greatness to obscurity it is slight in texture but there is a not unpleasant variety in its rather oldfashioned local colouring mr fenn has made a new departure in his amusing story of a girls school although his heroines language savours more of the servants hall than the parlour with her but theres and  if she didnts she is a sufficiently naive and childish specimen of a rather precocious schoolgirl the adventures of achille and the signor are most amusingly set forth in the excellent illustrations by mr gordon browne  miss pringles pearls one of mr milcss series for girls is a circumstantial and readable treatise on the maxim that it is better to be good than prettymr miless second series of boys stories includes examples of the old masters such as the late mr kingston who must have left an inexhaustible store of copy  behind him and some highly promising ones by apparently prentice hands tales of travel and adventure of home and school of the soldier and sailor and herein of chillianwallah and trafalgar both good accounts of the hunter and settler of foreign life and of life in general and experience would seem to exhaust every field of boyish curiosity the book is illustrated and rather better sewn than most christinas books this year archdeacon chiswells story of african slavery is a good deal marred by being localised in an imaginary region which is hard to realize especially as it is said to be to the west of the great southern ocean and yet east africans are spoken of as strangers certain eccentricities of spelling as alright  and o suggest that the author of this innocent little book has forgotten his native tongue or not acquired a complete knowledge of english if it is not though language of his birth dr jordon stables is generally a sufficiently lively writer of boys stories and his present story of sea life is no worse than his average the young sailorsoldier as lord kildoon the marine is called with rather wearisome iteration and his friend the doctor go through many adventures those among the natives of the caroline islands being not the least remarkable  while the british justice done between the american skipper and the natives he is endeavouring to kidnap for the kanaka coolie traffic will be satisfactory to

all things a story carefully contrived skilfully developed and to the last page entertaining to nothing is this first consideration sacrificed there is not a line of intrusive strain after fine writing there is no flimsy pretension to artistic profundity or labour for comic or sensatioal effect no kind of display in short but the quiet accomplishment of the true purpose of the storyteller in sustaining pleased attention to his tale the plot is so natural in its course that exception has been taken to the probability of a main incident that would have been taken for granted as a minor touch of life and nature in any sensation novel for the day is not yet gone by of straining at gnats and swallowing camels two persons in mr lemons story are half brothers one of whom gilbert norwold

treacherously by and the only tangible evidence in the matter being a piece of paper that appears to convict the innocent mr mark lemon upon this makes the highspirited youths blood stir with resentment at injustice if his father knows no more of him than now to revile him as a thief why should he bandy words if a thief why not a liar the only evidence beyond his word is that which seems to tell against him and his brother would dispute his word gerald therefore leaves gilbert to his shame acepts the decree of banishment casts off his name and proudly resolves to found for himself a new name and a new house of tuntarshed honour this may not have been a wise thing to do but young men acting in hot blood are not red for the mature wisdom of their decisions a passionate vow a generous extravagance of action that bside into calm wisdom never more surely than when as in this story there is the influence of a soundhearted womans love at work upon the after life such is the

who is content aimply and unreservedly to give his natural mind free play in the telling mens true lives are not a joke to him and he often speah with a plain human earnestness in his own simple

lemon may almost be regarded as a veteran amongst authors and many people will be eager to test the quality of a first novel by a man of letters who as nfeuilletohute aud dramatic writer has achieved a brilliant reputation some of our best living novelists made their first essays as writers of prose fiction when their years were few and tneir personal experiences limited  vivian grey and  falkland were the productions of mere boys mr dickens and mr kingsley were young men when they ranged themselves amongst the followers of defoe and henry fielding the case was otherwise in the last century  robinson crusoe made its first appearance when the author of the trueborn englishman was in his fiftyninth year  joseph andrews and  the vicar of wakefield  came from writers who had left boyhood far behind them samuel richardson was over fifty years of age when morality was encouraged and virtue rewarded in the pages of  pamela lawrence sterne was a middleaged man when he published the first two volumes of tristram shandy smollett began to write prose fiction at an earlier period of life than most of his contemporaries in art but he had seen and done much ere he penned  the adventures of roderick random and when search in a parish register destroyed the pleasant fiction that evelina was the work of a young lady only seventeen years old it was found that  little burney  had entered her twentysixth year ere she published the tale which won the applause of samuel johnson and burke mr mark lemon therefore by publishing his first novel when he has numbered fifty years and more reminds us of the earlier history of the english novel wait for the end claims attention on another ground the author being also an editor stands in public estimation accredited with many of the piquant jests and some portion of the genial satire with which the contributors to punch have both in recent and more remote years held up to ridicule the tricks and devices of popular novelists thus he is a man who having flung stones now takes up his residence in a house which though it may not be made of glass still has its windows exposed to the return shots of merry fellows bent on fun the hero and the villain of  wait for the end are halfbrothers living at the opening of the tale as undergraduates in the same college the elder brother gerard discovers his younger brother gilbert cheating a foolish freshman at cards and insists that restitution of the dishonestly won money be made to the dupe unless tnis restitution be made gerard declares he will reveal gilberts nefarious conduct to their father sir john norwold a choleric ferocious baronet who will indubitably turn out of doors the son who has dishonoured his name gilbert is unable to repay the winnings but in order that he may do so gerard agrees to join him in raising money on loan instead of having recourse to usurers in london or cambridge after the fashion of undergraduates the brothers borrow money of two rascally tradesmen of the country town adjoining their fathers estate this is the first absurdity of the story besides the personal security of the two young men the lenders insist on having lodged with them a valuable piece of  portable property without the concurrence or knowledge of his elder brother gilbert turns burglar breaks into his fathers house and steals from his mothers room a costly bracelet which is in due course consigned to the knavish miller of morden thus the brothers obtain possession of a small sura of money which without crime or subterfuge of any kind they might easilymuch too easilyhave procured in london the rest of the complicated drama turns on this transaction sir john norwold becomes aware of the theft and attributing it through gilberts vyjany to his elder son drives him from morden hall the oldfashioned fathers  keyurse  of the british melodrania thenceforth becomes the chief power of the story gerard it must be born in mind is represented as a very sensible and courageous as well as thoroughly honourable man but instead of clearing his reputation of the hideous blot put upon it as he might easily have done he emigrates to australia leaving his abominable brother master of the position  to free myself he says to his friend jack spraggatt  i must condemn others to the same fate as that my father has decreed to me this justification is scarcely consistent with the character of the man who resolved to have his brother turned out of morden hall an outcast unless he made restitution of his pilferings at cuds leaving his coat and waistcoat by the side of a river that flows through the paternal estate gerard goes to australia and turns sheepfarmer novelists of a certain sort regard the presence of a coat and waistcoat on a riverbank as conclusive evidence that their former owner has surrendered possession of his life as well as his habiliments if a complete suit of wearing apparel be found near water the fact indicates bathing  but the coat and waistcoat lying on the ground without shirt boots stockings and trousers signify suicide  it being well known that gentlemen when they drown themselves always elect to do so in leggings and braces the disappearance of the heir or morden and the discovery of his castoff clothing being regarded as proof that gerards body has been carried out to sea gilbert obtains the baronetcy on his fathers death and in due course marries and prospers in australia gerard also does well he grows rich marries and has a daughter who at the conclusion of the third volume becomes the wife of gilberts eldest son this is the end for which readers are requested to wait mr lemon should correct in a new edition a few slips of the pen which a fresh eye easily detects thus the author puts the high street of oxford in cambridge he marries lady clara normanton to sir gilbert norwold and afterwards calls her lady norivold it is a mistake to suppose that leases of farms are put up to auction like leases of london houses when jack spraggatt resolves to give up farming in the old country he shows his sister lucy  a silacard headed  the elms whereon was set orth in varied types the startling announcement that mr peter mallett was instructed by the respected tenant of that very productive and eligible farm to sell by auction the remainder of the lease together with all the stock live and dead farm implements c and when jack spraggatt swears an oath to his sister and says  thats  nonsense the author adds in an aside speech  yes he did  it was very wrong but knowing what jack meant the recording angel wrote it down beside uncle tobys oath it has slipped mr lemons memory that uncle tobys oath was not permitted to remain on the record the accusing spirit sterne assures us  which flew

which is to be classed at once as an illiterate in our tongue personality comes through more than the form so that though carlyle ruskin pater meredith kipling broke almost every precept laid down by the grammarians of the kings english these are the men who we have to recognise as masters not the leaderwriters of the times or the schools that periodically rise to try to lead english letters in the direction of some french writer and when such big men arise we bow even if we let fly at them in anonymous press onslaughts these confused thoughts are apt to intrude upon the reader of great days a novel by frank harris as editor essayist critic financier as the author of a splendid work on shakespeare as elizabethan as the best storyteller livingin these capacities we know frank harris now he has become a novelist let me record my honest impression of the book in style it is frankly impressionist curt abrupt told in the manner of the writer of the short story bent chiefly on swift and daring impressions it begins like an autobiography then it appears to be an historical novel an attempt to conjure up england under the reign of  boney next we find a dash of marryat now the whole thing becomes a privateersmans tale a christmas story for adventurous boys great deeds about cutting out french ships running in bales of silk into harbour and all that olly kind of thing etched in with little scenes as vivid as maupassant of sailors life ashore in french cafes which are not for our youngsters at all next we have love not the love of our novelists episodic natural secondary as it were as real love is to men of action and of course our hero is that and then frank harris comes into his own he gives us napoleon a little study very carefully conceived and drawn quite remarkable in its power of presentation and after that we get an equally ariesting study of mr fox fights there are enough for a whole christmas family one splendid seadog business and another between the hero and the bully with the bare knuckles and there are good women too yes frank harris has drawn a  good woman  whom finally the hero marries and all about the book there are characters which stand out and become very memorable to us thus the father of the hero one of the girls of the village the french girl the men around the hero why when it comes to that most of the characters are interesting though all the while we cannot help thinking what a strange motley of a novel it is with its philosophic disputations on jesus more tolstoi its pithy paradoxes its literary manner as were the whole thing a leading article its swift changes of scene and disregard of the unities its power and sometimes grandeur of expression its want of form its charm even its beauty a strange booki a book of the sea which is real a book which lives in the mind something positive this anyhow and thinking of the many novels i have read during the last twelve months i can say honestly that great days seems to me one of the most interesting and powerful in the literary sense of de quincey because it has the true power of creation  great days fiction by frank harris john lane 6s we are not much in love with the hero jack we are not thinking exclusively of the jack morgan of mr frank harris the hero jack is somehow or other generic jack is generally a very vital person in real life in fiction he is nearly always a shadow in great days jack morgan is an algebraical symbol it would be difficult to like him or to loathe him it is as impossible to feel any deep sympathy for him in his vicissitudes as it is to be touched by the fortunes of the symbol x when with its companions in misery it gets multiplied by m or raised to a higher power or compelled with shame to take a lower room the other persons of the drama are almost equally mathematical with the exception of a vivid little group of french people whom jack meets when he is a prisoner of war for jack morgan is taken prisoner by the frenchmen of the great days the revolutionary and napoleonic eras he was privateering when it happened his real line of business is smuggling and his father keeps an inn near dover he has had much to endure from the local gentry so he is pleased with regenerated france he marries the daughter of colonel caressa governor of the prison and a napoleonic enthusiast the marriage is a failure and is really only an episode it helps to swell the rich cloud of misunderstandings that obscure the path to the real heroine later in the story jack gets into touch with charles james fox and very near the end he has an interview with napoleon who tempts him as from an exceeding high mountain he has only to show him how the boulogne flotilla can be got across the book is not one of mr harris best it is moralised henty with thumbnail sketchesgood thumbnail sketchesof big men and some excellent general and particular historical propositions there are naval combats and a fight with fisticuffs the rest is a coldblooded catalogue of the usual problems of life among which mr harris seems to reckon the phenomena of snobbishness almost inordinately high,juvenile_contra
B4925,['3175652'],  tile honour of savelli by s levett yeats s low the honour of savelli is a romance inspired by a loving perusal of dumas the writerwho has already made a creditable reputation by his indian storiesacknowledges this and indeed the form and order of his plot and incidents remind us many a time of certain stages in the history of the famous gascon adventurer what dumass imitators cannot catch is his wit but it is ungrateful to make a comparison for mr levett yeats has written an excellent story he has picked out a suitable epoch of history which admits not only of the introduction of such interesting personages as machiavelli the borgias and the chevalier bayard but which faction being rife and plots and counterplots the order of the day in florence and rome presents abundance of perilous errands for the brave savelli to be entrusted with there are commonplace passagesthe particular accusation which unjustly disgraced the hero at the beginning does not content us and there are improbable onesnotably his failure in spite of abundant opportunity to see through the disguise of madame dentrangues nevertheless mr yeats though shaky as yet on his new ground has written a strring and spirited story which we have read with interest to the end,juvenile_contra
B7035,['8666326'],  foul play new novels by charles read and dion boucicault 3 vols bradbury  evans  foul play is almost too tame a title for this extraordinary labyrinth of schemes and surprises we are inclined to rechristen it on the tenterhooks that would equally describe the position of the characters in the book and the feelings of its readers the very first scene brings us into the midst of the excitement which is not to be allayed till the end of the third volume messrs read and boucicault can spare no time for opening descriptions for laying the groundwork of their plot for introducing us calmly to the persons of their drama these persons are thrust upon us one after another as they are wanted they are sketched in with a free and powerful hand and they uiver with what looks very much like life fader other circumstances they might possibly be real quiet breathing shapes needing but a touch to clothe them with flesh and blood but here they are given up to the exigencies of the plot and they must spend the three volumes of their life in planning desperate things and then doing them they are the ishmaels of fiction their hand against every one and every hand against them at times the wild tangle of plot and counterplot is too much for our endurance the jungle rises far above our heads and we merely hear the buzz of those voices which are whispering their secrets to their confederates forgeries upon forgeries spies upon spies villains who pass for honest men and honest men seeming to be villains double and triple disguises which are detected all at once superhuman ingenuity combined with the absence of the commonest precautions make up an atmosphere of their own in which the story moves and without which the whole would be a mirage of impossibility this is not the art which conceals art or that which looks like nature the book is a marvellous exercise of ingenuity and that is all it is a 3cene where the stage carpenter has triumphed fewer disguises and a little less complication would have produced a more artistic story we should not have been so much struck by the cleverness of messrs read and boucicault but we could have spoken more highly of their work as it is they have given birth to a curiosity but one which has no life in it it may be the talk of the season and so long as it is talked of it will be admired every one will remark that where other novelists have been content to tell how things were done messrs read and boucicault have done the things themselves we do not mean that they have actually scuttled a ship for though their description is vivid we can remember the trial at the old bailey which furnished them with the materials but instead of giving an account of the forged promissory note on which the plot turns they have given us though note itself we may compare every stroke and every letter with the genuine handwriting of john and arthur wardlaw evidently that part of the novel has been written by an expert we do not know which of the two authors has devoted himself for years to the study of handwriting perhaps mr read was working on this in london while mr boucicault was being wrecked on an unknown island in the pacific it may be the other way for all we can tell and the guesses we may make at the separate paternity of any one scene may merely show that we have no data to go upon yet we should particularly like to know which of the two authors wore a collar of rushes and stood up to his neck in water while making ducks his aerial messengers as for giving any idea of the plot that is quite out of our power we doubt if any one could take up all the links in their turn without missing some of them if we except is the original blemish of making robert penfold r succumb without an effort when he is tried for ie forgery there is nothing in the rest of the story ie that is inconsistent with itself but then this d consistency is gained at the cost of what would ie be much better the novelty imparted to the t book lies wholly in the incidents we have made the acquaintance of all the characters before they have the stamp of mr reades old creations too strongly marked upon them it is true that we see them in a new fight that the vivid flashes thrown upon them bring out other phases that their circumstances are different yet the statues in the vatican gallery when seen by torchlight are the same as those seen in the daytime and mr reades characters are always of the same type though their shading gives them another surface the convict in this book is innocent and the convict in  never too late to mend was guilty hut mr read follows the example of the world in treating them too much alike during the period of their sentence helen rolleston too reminds us constantly of mr reades former heroines whenever there is a chance of getting her in positions analogous to theirs the secret of this is that mr read rests exclusively on certain female characteristics and that there is a sameness in his mode of depicting them the caprices the selfdevotion the sudden inspirations the want of any sustained reasoning power which mark his women recur almost regularly in all his books his mannerisms of description appear to numb his observing faculties in this story too he is unduly weighted by a supersubtle plot we say  he without forgetting that another has a share in the work and no doubt a share in the characters but these traits of female character are the work of mr reade whether they are due to his hand or whether the two authors after becoming experts detectives shipwrecked mariners and diffusers of intelligence over a hundred leagues of ocean have ended by changing places bodies and minds with each other the scenes in the island though they are less credible than the rest of the book and though they tantalise us by the minuteness of their detail which retards the solution of the chief mystery are really the part by which the book will be remembered we turn back to those scenes with some genuine interest after we have sated our curiosity with the triple forgeries of arthur wardlaw and the spies employed by helen rolleston to track his spies to their master yet it is impossible to enjoy the description of the island when all the while we are longing to get away from it and we can hardly sympathise with those efforts which when successful will merely open a more arduous labour we have too much before us at once and the whole work is overloaded it is the natural result of this that the end should be tame and that when arthur wardlaw ends as one at least of mr reades characters has ended before we feel that there has been rather a collapse than a ddnouement,juvenile_contra
B1339,"['8488208', '8999187', '2854782']",  marmaduke herbert or the fatal error a novel founded on fact by the countess of blessington 3 vols bentley lady blessington has never written so well as in this novel of marmaduke herbert it is altogether her best book in thc construction as well as writing of it the interest is great and sustained by fair and honest means the narrative once begun its design is never lost sight of the attention never called away some will think that it is even too closely and exclusively pursued and the sentiment of it pushed to extremes but this is a question of art which will always arise we apprehend in connexion with thc school of romance to which the book must be said to belong marmaduke herbert is planned aud executed in the manner of godwin that is to say an elaborate investigation of feelings thoughts and motives with minute detection and analysis of the familiar workings of the heart is built upon a groundwork of romantic incident a certain degree of monotony is inseparable from a plan of this kind  but in the ready acuteness of remark the new and happy turns of reflection exhibited by the writer and the value of the lesson steadily enforced we have found thc look extremely interesting the design of it may be briefly described as an exhibition of the evil entanglements which attend concealment of the truth these are shown to be equal in bitterness to the evil consequences which i attend an act of crime in this respect and  in the autobiographical form of the narrative marmaduke herbert reminds us very much of a novel by lady georgiana fullerton which obtained considerable success a few years siuce but the treat ment differs in this respect that the meutal analysis is more closely carried out less distracted bv irrelevant scenes of passion and better accounted for by peculiarities of temperament and education there are minds in which the effort to be wretched with or without reason predominates over every other quality or feeling  and this in its origin development and growth is excellently portrayed hy lady blescinffton false interest is thus repelled and no claim for exaggerated sympathies on the heros behalf is

frequently have no control our happiness or misery depends on some trifling chance against which no prudence no forethought can guard us and the result of which colours our fate for the remainder of our lives that is the notion with which the feeble will justify their weakness always but the higher truth is sought to be impressed by the moral of th tale that mans conduct is his good or evil angel

in short isa powerfully written novel and may pair oil with its authors own  victims of society  reviews marmnaduhe herbert or the fatal legacy a novel founded on fact by the coun tess of blessington in 3 vols london bentley 1847 this novel displays a great amount of talent it is written in the most vigorous style and a powerful interest is at once c eated which is vell and ably sustained coie recommendation it possesses lies in the fact that it is distinguished from the general run of the novels of the present day by the absence of sentimentality it does not obtrude upon the reader descriptions of dinnerparties and ballrooms introduced in some instancts only to persuade the public that the writer has figured at them such books are very agreeable no doubt to young ladies reclining at their ease upon sofas and ready to be pleased and gratified with any fiction under the face of heaven but they are sickly food for the general reader to the young they seem new but the more experienced novelreader naturally seeks for something more original than a dinner flirtation a ballroom mishap or a toilette reflection the novel before us turns upon a fearful catastrophe the occurrence of which near the commencementof the work poisons as it was intended it should our enjoyment throughout and rouses a painful sensation which mingles strangely with whatever gratification we may receive we feel while the prospect of the greatest happiness is sketched out before us that a gloomy shadow lowers across the level plain that with the perfume of the sweetest flowers is mingled the damp unwholesome atmosphere of death that enter where we will into bower or hall the pale shadow of a murdered girl stands in the threshold pointing to her unwilling murderer and warding off perfect happiness from his path all through life the interest thus created painful as it is is still calculated to arouse intense feelings of curiosity there is a power of fascination in things of this kind our eyes involuntarily turn towards any object which pains us and therefore possesses the power of moving our souls  marmaduke herbert is therefore sure of success public curiosity once excited will be gratified the style of the narrative involuntarily reminds us of the story of caleb williams and this is because though the events are of a different character the incidents upon which the interests of the stories turn resemble each other it is not the actual crime or fault which can be said to be similar but the fact of the concealment of the fault the mere commission of the error in the present instance would not have led to the same results the con cealment of the first step instead of witdrawing the hero from his painful position naturally only flings him stilf more deeply into it one error leads to the commission of another and unhappy himself all through life he renders others equally so the domestic miseries which gradually overtake him from the days of his courtship of the sister of the poor girl of whose dath he had been the innocent cause and constitute a portion of his punishment for his unintentional crime are most ably drawn and do infinite credit to the countess of blessingtons powers of delineation the present novel is we think one of the best of her productions there are no lengthy digressions the story is told well and briefly so that we scarcely ever feel that a superfluous incident is introduced once in the early portion of the novel this occurs but it is a slight fault and we do not therefore insist more strongly upon it there are however one or two remarks which we feel ourselves called upon to make respecting the delineation of some of the characters we can allow a great deal of licence to the author who is engtiged in the task of bringing before us a woman educated in the camp brought up with officers and accustomed to their trodle of life we feel that she runs the chance of becoming mannish even coarse that some of the delicacy of her sex will be rubbed off but lady blessington has in airs scuddamore passed far beyond the mark her character is not well drawn because it is inconsistent she appears at first under very different auspices to what she does afterwards the woman in real life could not have lost sight of her feminine characteristics so wholly as she did or adopted the cool imperturbability only pardonable in a man which she manifests but even supposing this allowable it does not agree with her kind and gentle care of her niece on the first occasion when she is introduced to us nor has lady blessington at all accounted for her change of manner so abrupt and incomprehensible it seems as though the adventure had been intended to be prolonged but bad been accidentally cut short another objection we have to make is that our authoress frequently enters into details upon the subject of the dead body which would look far better in the columns of a newspaper than in the pages of a threevolume novel they are shocking to our taste our feelings are revolted and only at such itites do we turn with abhorrence from the pages there is an excess of brutality in the manner of the man too who brings tidings of the body which is exaggerated in the extreme besides it was unnecessary and as the messenger had no reference to the story it could only have been introduced for the sake of producing a startling effect it is intended to harrow up our feelings the more by witnessing how our heros conscience reproaches and upbraids itself during the scene in which he is compelled to behold the sufferings of his wife and mother while listening to the mans dreadful details but by a little art a better effect might have been prtduced without the introduction of the messengers speeches besides the few faults we have hinted at there is nothing at which we can have any cause for murmuring the story is powerfully told and scattered through the work are many graphic scenes and many beautiful passages as a specimen of both we extract the following  at length 1 reached the opening of the cavern i entered it and laid down the lantern which cast its faint but lurid light on the grotesque rocks around a sickening dread stole over me at the thought of the change which six months must have ef fected in the ccurse i was about to touch and i drew back with instinctive disgust and horror at the task i had to fulfil nevertheless that task must be performed however loathsome however appalling the operation might be and i moved towards the opening of the inner cavern with the intention of drawing out the body when the loud hooting of the owl so startled me that i nearly fell to the earth ashamed of iny pusillanimity i once more approached the spot knelt down and though shuddering while i did so drew forth the corpse by the feet at that moment a huge bat dew against the lantern which i had placed on a projecting rock upset it and extinguished the light for some time i felt unable to move and almost incapable of thinking my hand still clasping the icy feet at length i recovered myself sufficiently to grope in the direction in which the lantern had fallen and after a considerable time spent in searching for it i found it and struck a light with a tinder box which i had fortunately put into my pocket in fear of accident i dared not look on the face of the dead the shawl 1 had wrapped around it still enveloped it and most thankful was i that 1 was spared the horror of beholding its altered state i commenced digging a grave large drops of perspiration dropping from my forehead while vith the pickaxe i endeavoured to loosen the compact earth to enable the spade to penetrate it while i thus laboured huge bats were continually flitting around me and from time to time the screech owls sent forth their lugubrious cries i dug deep into the earth and though ready to drop with fatigue from the hard and unusual labour i desisted not until i had penetrated some five feet beneath the surface i then averting my head while i did so raised the body in my arms its extreme lightness astonished me but the cause was revealed when the shawl accidentally falling aside exposed one of the arms and hands of the deceased owing i suppose to some peculiar quality in the earth or air in which the corpse had rested it had become dried up like those of a mummy though shocked at beholding the withered discolorred limbs it was less dreadful than to see it in an advanced state of decomposition as i expected and emitting that fearful odour which marks the decay of mortality nothing of this  assailed my olfactory nerves and i was grateful to providence for being spared it i placed the matting as a lining in the grave and then descending with my lifeless burden using as much tenderness towards it as if it were still susceptible of feeling i placed it gently in its last earthly restingplace and read the burialservice over it the sound of my own voice as i pronounced the words of that sacred and touching service powerfully affected me no human accent gave the response but the birds of night shrieked dismally while i prayed i then covered the corpse with a piece of matting and commenced filling up the grave with the earth i had previously dug shrinking during the operation at the thought that the cloak and matting alone intervened between the corpse and the clay i was shovelling over it i would have given heaps of gold had i possessed them to have had a coffin in which to place the cold remains but this was not possible and although i shuddered at every spadefull of earth i threw into the grave i nevertheless continued my painful labour until the floor of the cavern resumed its former appearance i then strewed dust over the spot and arming myself with the pickaxes spade and lantern bade a sorrowful farewell to it never shall i forget that night l an unusual stillness prevailedunbroken save by the occasional bark of some cottagers dog or the cry of some bird of night scarcely a breeze moved the leaves of the high trees whose long shadows fell like giants across the road in some parts so close as to exclude the light i hurried on through this solitude my own footsteps sounding so loud us to startle me and the beating of my own heart making itself audible sometimes a low sighing or murmuring of the heavy branches of the trees moved by an occasional gust of wind dashing down through some deep ravine from the mountains striking my ear with so sad a sound that my superstitious forebodings connected it with a supernatural warning of the danger of my mother and i would hurry more rapidly than before until breathless and exhausted i was coum pelled to rest for a few minutes those fitful gusts of the night wind followed again by a long stillness had something so inexpressibly solemn and imposing in them that they made me shudder and when some mountain torrent rutnhed down the precipitous path it had formed for itself leaping wildly from crag to crag and dashing its white foam around i felt as if it were some mysterious agent endowed with power from which i wished to escape and again i hurried on until out of hearing of its deafening noise then blaming my unmanly weakness i would turn back for a moment by the dark and funeral mountain pines and the next instant breaking into light its white masses like huge heaps of snow falling from some alpine height into the valley beneath with the sound of a mighty flood and angry with in self for even the momentary delay i would resume my rapid pace while the fresh mountain air failed to cool my fevered brow or burning lip at length the spire of the village church near my home became visible its little vane shining brightlyin the moonlight often in the days of my childhood had it guided my path home from the rambles i delighted in  and now weary and fainting i hailed it with an emotion that brought tears into my eyes i trembled violently as i approached the house i longed yet i dreaded to pass its threshold toe know my fate all my future happiness seemed to hang on the answer that awaited the question my tremulous lips refused to utter  have i still a mother a deathlike silence reigned around the garden gate was unlatched and i stealthily entered it and passing through parterres of flowers that looked snowy

B7148,"['8745274', '9440116']",  memoir of jane cameron female convict by a prison matron author of female life in prison in two volumes hurst and blackett jane cameron is a fictitious name and the prison matron has been careful to omit dates and modify details so as to disguise the identity of the heroine and her associates but this narrative as we are assured and os we can well believe is truthful in every important particular  a faith full chronicle of a womans fall and rescue it is a dismal painful book yet one that ought to be widely read and seriously thought over it has been undertaken with a view of showing  how the poor and ignorant are  led into crime and are in innumerable instances taught to  regard it as simply a business the evil nature of which  is to them not apparent and in that way to suggest  a  clue to the mystery of temptation and demonstrate to  philanthropists where the first effort should be made to  turn the weak and erring from the danger and this is done as well as a book can do it by the honest and eloi quent writing of the authoress of  female life in prison  the poor creature whose history is here told under the name of jane cameron was born in croileys land in the i new vennel glasgow a nest of tall buildings brimful of every description of vice so full that in one room alone some years ago it was estimated twelve robberies were on an average committed every week while in the moro respectable of the number it is common for fonr or five and often ten or twelve men women and children to eat drink sleep and live her mother rented one of these rooms with some fitness called houses since there were so roany inhabitants in each and supported herself by letting out heaps of shavings to any of both sexes who were able to pay twopence or threepence a night for them  and from the time when she was five years old jane used to bc sent out to beg of passersby in though neighbouring and less disreputable streets  iou should beg

before this her own mother had ran away and she had been left to earn her own living in the way that she had never been taught to regard as dishonest or immoral and she had twice been in prison learning there nothing but evil  prisons naethm they take care of ye and gie ye eno  to eatmore than ye get at hame theres naethin to  frighten ye a bitas they told her and as she found to be the case and the occasional teachings of chaplains and matrons was altogether neutralised by the constant influence of experienced thieves there was good enough latent in jane camerons disposition to be brought out and made the groundwork of an honest life had proper care been taken to put her in the right but no care was taken and she was left in the hour of her greatest need to the tender mercies of thieves and outcasts hiey came np to her room where she lay on the shavings in a comer with ber baby and talked to her and bede her bo cheerful for hed get strong enough presently they pitied her

but on the second day i luved it  awfully  but the very need of winning food for thc poor little thing drove the parent into more desperate ways of vice and when after a few months of miserable life the child was taken from her the wretched mother was a hardened criminal the little spark of better nature  died out with the child she had loved a sickening tale is that of ber subsequent career hardly relieved by such an interlude as the one in which we hear of thc holiday trip to london in which she and her new cush black barney an englishman indulged after a successful robbery of more than a hundred pounds when they rode about the city and its suburbs in cab feasted at hotels and visited all the playhouses and other places of amusement as gaily and honestly if the eojoyment of stolen

who labour with ali their strength to retrieve their former errors and for the truehearted friends who strive to bring them back to virtue there is much to dishearten philanthropists in the callousness and instability of many with whom so much care is taken but if there is joy in heaven over ono sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons that need no repentance there is encouragement enough for the brave reformers upon earth who set themselves to raise up the fallen and if this true womanly book can quicken public zeal on behalf of the criminals who can by

in her dealings with that difficult question  the criminal and what is to become of him to lose sight of justice to the poor who are not criminal and who naturally may inquire wherefore the dishonest the unchaste the corrupt should be cockered and petted and have sympathy strained for them and bulwarks built round them while the honest the chaste and the wholesome folk who are the salt of the

matrons first book is her second one less genuine more made up  will not a third come in due course of time and a fourth  and so on till the records of low highway and byway crime in number outnumber the muses  some question of the kind must make its way when following this awful record of the career of an abandoned female creature rescued at last by a guardian angel the book is obviously a joint production its writer keeping herself in the background owns to having availed herself of male cooperation to verify localitiesto secure the details of the  seamy side of predatory life in glasgow nevertheless we cannot help asking whether she may not be in the foreground as the miss watton to whose experiences this tale must be owing it may not be unfit to restate an old argument of ours to ask to what extent the anatomy of profligacy by popular exposure in lighter forms than those of official inquiry justice and redress thrives so as to prevent the perpetuation of profligacy high or low an abuse is a great theme for a book which is to sell but in laying out its features do those who lay them out sufficiently remember that they are also laying out a path along which any one may walk no matter how high no matter how low a plain coarse path which any walker may follow to ftis oxen ends the dishingup of crime in fiction has been always amenable to thc comment of those who have sat at the banquet but in the case before us it becomes a little difficult to separate poetry to use goethes phrase from truth our  prison matron announces herself as having presented a story certain details of which she also announces have been mystified by her thus her book as it stands is neither fact nor fiction but what a booklet it be taken ever so lightly ever so critically ever so judicially what a tale of crime and sorrow and expiationthe life told from without of a female thief of a child cradled in infamy thrust out into the abyss of want later an unwedded mother when yet a girltaking to daring desperate hardened crime the  prison matron says that  jane cameron was rescued at last it may be so but the tale of the rescue so much resembles a novel that we cannot but read it with a certain suspicion there can be no doubt however as to the painful interest of the tale which moreover is very well written,juvenile_contra

was aware of this and at first she hoped unobserved by them yet she soon became conscious she was followed and she fancied known she was somewhat reassured as to this last point by hearing one say to the other  a beautiful figure by jove in an audible whisper just as they passed her they then slackened their pace and seemed determined that she should pass them again she drew her veil closer and thicker over her face and attempted to walk steadily by she at first hoped and believed that they were no longer following but soon again she heard themn close behind and talking in french to each other evidently about her though not so pointedly as to have been remarked by one ig norant of that language which they lo doubt supposed her to be she could not bear the idea of being known which she had no doubt would be the case if she was traced to the bazaar she therefore turned from it sharp round a corner in the direction of her own orome hurried her pace by degrees even to a run and never

character of his early friend who on his part had always been very patient under the much more annoying faults to which oakley himself wvas subject he had met germain accidentally the day before and the first advances he had then made to a reconciliation had been at once received with that cordiality which gerni tins goodnatured and placable disposition would have led one to expect oakley had felt much happier since this interview bad taken place and his present visit was intended not only as a further peaceoffering but as an advance towaids renewed intimacy this apiable temper of mind was a little ruffled by tinding fitzalbert there it is imnpossible to conceive any two men who had a more thorough dislike of each other fitzd bert to be sure on his side was a pococurante in every thing and scarcely troubled his head about oakley when be was not as he called it oppressed with his presence but it was observed that when that was the case his jokes flowed less  naturally and there was more sharpness and less ease in his conversation oakley had a thorough contempt for the character of fitzalbert joined to a certain dread of his satire wilich did not the less exist because lhe would never have acknowledged it even to himself fitzalbert prepared to evacuate upon this irruption of his enemy then you are not for tennis this morning eh germain said he a strange idea at the instant occurred to him and lie afterwards said that he could not account by what chain of thought it first struck his fancy  by the by he added  do you remember that devilish fine girl wve gave chase to

once there is no mistaking that air and figure when once seen the light springy walk too nobody knew what had become of her i always heard she was of a low family who knows but she may be very comeatable   this was said carelessly and with no other object than to annoy oakley and with the view of watching its effect he advanced towards the mirror over the chimneypiece and whilst still speaki ng and apparently examinin germaiiis dinner engagements which stuck round the frame he stole a glance in the glass but the impending storm which he saw on oalkleys lrow was so much more formidable and threatening than lie had expected that his retreat was like that of a man who has no ob jection to admire a tempest from a distance but is not prepared unnecessarily to expose himself to its violence he therefore wished germain an abrupt good morning at the same time however wvhistling  di tanti pilpiti with the most successful precision towards the conclusion of the tale oakley

by the exertion of the most extraordinary sel f commratid she had so far recovered as to attempt entering oakleys room she beheld him stretched on the bed his eyes half closed his countenance which was naturally  pale but little altered she glided in so softly that he was not at first conscious of her entrance she dropped gently on her knees b  the side of his bed and taking his band in hers

B1197,['6662006'],  general literature and art traditions and hearthside stories of west cornwall by w bottrell penzance  w cornish london  trubner ever since the brothers grimm published the german popular stories of the rhineland under the title of kinderwid haustndrchen nursery tales and popular fiction of all ages have been looked on in a new light it was soon seen that much of early mythology was embodied in them the  sleeping beauty for instance can be traced back to the early myth which symbolises spring being awakened by the suns touch doing away the sleep of winter the process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls of the ionian chieftains did no otherwise in any case these stories illustrate the social life of our own immediate ancestors in the time when reading had not taken the

though that which gives the title to his book is most fully worked out and is very subtle in treatment recalling here andi there the  septimius  of his model there is one blot in the book the material ghastli ness of the endingof one story the romance of certain old clothes which is more like poe than hawthorne and which we think the author will feel on reflection would have gained in impressiveness by the omission of the last detail and the substitution of a mere look of frozen terror on the dead face the incident as it stands mars the whole conception of perdita with which it is entirely out of keeping eglantine makes no advance but rather retrogression in its authors literary work for it is by no means so good a novel as any of its three precursors there are tokens throughout of too much facility in mere production of copy and too little pains in reducing that copy to symmetrical form to say nothing whatever of artistic conscientiousness in detail which is not atoned for by the occasional introduction of clever sentences and paragraphs the story if it may be so called is an autobiographical mono logue with but little interest since the only attempts at special delineation of character depict types which are tediously common in the modern novel such as the gracious and insincere matron of society and the mature young lady who affects gushing childishness and in these days of realistic painting it is not too much to ask even a lady author to be correct in details meant to give local colour and finish the daughter of a great scientific philosopher of wide general learning as the narrator of the story is supposed to be would not again and again cite the differential calculus  as the tremendously abstruse subject which her fathers distinguished visitors habitually discussed with him they would be just as likely to discuss the rule of three nor would she include gibbons english history as forming along with the decline and fall part of the favourite reading of her model coastguardsman at least it was inconsiderate if such were the case not to make the learned mr leslie seize on the book hitherto unknown to bibliography and give it to the reading public which would only too gladly welcome such a discovery it may be carpingly minute criticism to say that the st bees hood which the model broad church parson of the book wears and of which the author who attempts dutch painting makes a good deal is not purple but a wonderful combination of red and white but that a writer wlio has evidently a turn for marketing and cookery with a hearty relish for her victuals should give as a proof of the utter imbecility of her gushing lady that young persons belief that eggs arc or ought to be sold by the pound strikes us as showing very little grasp of the economical bearings of the subject would it surprise her to hear that more than one american legislature has recently enacted that all eggs are henceforth to be sold by the pound and that the average dozen must turn a given weight on the ground that the present system of selling by mere number irrespective of size is unfair to the purchaser and a permanent discouragement to careful breeding since no advantage is now gained in the market by the farmer who brings the finest and heaviest eggs for sale over his competitor who looks to quantity alone several other questions social and religious are settled in the book just as decisively and with exactly the same amount of intelligent understanding as this one and we would cheerfully give all the judgments and the longwinded reasons for their formation in exchange for a little more life and movement in the somewhat wooden puppets of the tale  jocelyns mista7ke derives its interest almost wholly from its central figure which is a very good study of character mrs spender has not sought to devise novel situations for her plot and has contented herself with using materials which have served many authors before but she has employed them better than usual the main situation in the book for example is not very different from that in a once popular story e laiu wyndham yet there is no likeness at all in treatment so that the sense of triteness does not strike the reader mrs spenders english is unusually good and she has learned the art of working her opinions on men and things into the web of her story in stead of merely intercalating homilies after the fashion of too many of her sisters with the certainty of having them skipped by the judicious reader who desires in the emphatic language of a schoolboy uttered in the present critics hearing more story and less jaw the jocelyn of the book is very skilfully drawn an impetuous wilful passionate imaginative woman in whom the perceptive faculties are far more matured than the reflective who feels but does not reason and who is from temperament what frenchmen call tate montee and americans high falutinc in season and out of season the chief success of the book is the manner in which the author conciliates the sympathies of her readers in favour of the very defective heroine and makes them understand how she could win and retain the affections of two men of exceptional mark and power though of different types and that without her having brain enough with all her imagination and fluency to appreciate the best qualities of either one particularly happy touch quite true to nature is that where jocelyn spoils her application for the post of governess by springing on her hobby at a chance word of her proposed employer and delivering a lecture then and there on the development of woman mfore we think might have been made of the contrast between the fiery and courageous heroine and her vacillating brother but where it is brought out at all it is well done finally the toile of the book is entirely high and sound and though it does not belong to the small first rank of novels that will live it rises in type and diction far above the ephemeral stories of the season olt of society is a commonplace and rather dull book written in a style which is alternately fine and slipshod gorgeous in adjectives and hazy in grammar it belongs to the school of transpontine melodrama according to which hardness selfishness and vice are habitual characteristics of those who move or try to move in refined and wealthy circles while generosity and virtue must be souglht among those who are out of society that a life of much ease and little responsibility is unfiavourable to loftiness of aim and energy of action is doubtless true enough but mrs pulleyne must know very little indeed of modern engrland if she imagines that the line can be drawn as she draws it the artisans who refuse to associate with labourers or even to use the same houses of call the shopboys who rob tills to pay gambling debts the working men who correct their wives with iron clogs are on the whole not more admirable citizens than mrs pulleynes aristocrats and are real flesh and blood while her characters despite of the dedication of her book to a lady of princely rank are clearly evolved from a not very vivid imagination and do not by any means convey the impression of being studies from life and personal contact especially as she has not mastered the somewhat intricate system of english titles of rank robert forrcster is the work of a very inexperienced hand and the best counsel for the author is to attempt a play and to put the manuscript into the hands of some practised manager or actor in order to see how much and what would be cut out curiously enough there is a chapter in the book wherein the heroine by her frank criticisms induces a lady friend to give up novelwriting as not possessing the necessary faculty and being unable to see what is expedient in a book meant to win public approval the actual story in robert forester scarcely occupies onefifth of the volume and the remainder is entirely taken up with digressions sometimes on scenery and more often on what the characters could should might ought or would have thought or done while their actual doings are compressible into a very small bulk indeed thus in one chapter of the book two persons engaged to two other persons meet for an avowal of their preference for one another and nearly twelve pages are given to a chapter which immediately follows this whose whole contents consist of the fact that their conversation was overheard by one of the other pair and that she did not like it ten words in the chapter whiich describes the meeting would have been enough and this is just the place where an experienced manager would have ruthlessly cut down the copy were it a play nor are the descriptions of scenery vivid enough to be worth the space they occupy we have three living novelists who can write of scenery so as to delight their readers air black perhaps first mir blackmore a good second and amr george macdonald third though if his admirable poetical vignettes of landscape be taken into account he might be assigned the highest place it aliss thompson will read any of these writers and endeavour to analyse their method in

into the bush wvhen after various adventures the remaining two get back to mombasa they would have been received with that consoling comfortable kindness people extend to their compatriots in a strange savage land and they would have gone home on different boats the ghost story is equally unconvincing wthy should a zulu haunt the unfortunate pair because he and rawley have died together  the reader is heartily glad that rawley is dead and sorry dingaans more valuable life should have been thrown away in a search for him but the fate of neither is of any importance when the bones of the two men are discovered the haunt ceases from haunting  you cannot help wondering what mr brett young supposes ghosts and bones have to do with each other and how rawleys fate could matter to a

hand never falters he knows his people and you do not doubt they would have behaved after this fierce passionate humorous manner but the jewel has a flaw the mere writing that woven background of words is often poor the prologueas far as the writing goesis put together better than any other part as i read it i thought that ernest goodwin was at last creating his sentences with the care of a firstrate writer but the first page of the tale proper disillusioned me the phraseology became stilted anl rhetorical at times as the vivid scenes were thrown on to the canvas the writing improved but as a whole it showed signs of insufficient care mr goodwin had not stopped to consider whether the language he was using was the finest possible whether the scenes could not have been cut deeper i

board schools  and in their collected form they furnish material for coming to a fairly de6nite conclusion about the value of the elementary system at any rate they present many of the salient facts in a concrete shape and serve conveniently as an indication of our national gains and losses mr morley has inspected a number of typical schools in various parts of the metropolis and by dint of keeping his eyes open watching everything that he saw in a sympathetic spirit and taking copious notes he has put together a serviceable and diverting if somewhat slangy report much of what he says might have been gleaned from the bluebooks of the education department but there is a great deal more which is not to be found in the official records incidentally he mentions the cost the number and variety of the schools the curriculum the quality of the teaching the characteristics of masters mistresses and parents  and in place of mere bald statistics he lets us see the interior of the hive and draws a thousand pictures from the life which are sometimes more informing because more familiar and unreserved than the reports of her majestys inspectors in brief these thumbnail sketches of

another in which the i in national system is justified of its children is u1 the system justified throughout and on the m whole  it is safe to say that a very large d majority of englishmen in spite of certain strictures in regard to religious teaching and of certain misgivings as to the overeducation of the masses are satisfied with the general outcome of the policy adopted in 1870 the deliberate intent of the nation is that its poorest children shall be systematically trained to citizenship and that by the same means aided by a simple process of continuation the clever minority shall be trained to teach the next generation or to start on a higher commercial or technical career or if that is their bent to pass out by way of the universities as for the fear of overeducating the masses we share it in common with all highly organised nations amongst whom we were the last to accept a national system it may be that the danger is real and that the overeducation of individuals by cultivating their intellect beyond their natural gifts and in excess of their economic needs is not a mere unsubstantial chimaera so far as there is any force in this objection the evil may be and

multiplication of cheap books and periodicals and the stimulus has been manifested not merely in the production of schoolbooks which are printed at the rate of millions every year and of fiction which

public demand for literary works that it undoubtedly goes far to account for one of the most noteworthy incidents of our recent literary development the enormous output of cheap and good reprints here

essential to the storyteller and in which in fact lies the differ i encebetween the real and the false legend making the latter however cleverly constructed dull and uninteresting when compared with the former andersen writes as if he thoroughly believed that there was a time when beasts and birds talked like christian men  when i fairies danced anl mermaids sung in this lies the  charm of his legends and tales anrd for this and be 1 cause they invariably carry a wholesome moral without thrusting it offinsively forward teaching it rather by the example than by precept do we heartily recommend this volume to young persons and to the regards of all who are looking for an acceptable present for their young friends the translator who wve understand is a lady has performed her task with a hearty appreciation of the characteristics of the author which she has carefully preserved by rendering the simple language of the original into a pure and simple english so well fitted to convey legends and tales such as these and always so charming because so intelligible to children as specimens both of author and translator anl as in themselves worthy of perusal we extract some of these legends what poetry there is in the daisy listen to my story  in the country close by the road 4 side there stands a summerhouseyou must certainly have i seen it in front is a little garden full of flowers enclosed by i white palings with green knobs and on a bank outside the i palings there grew amidst the freshest of grass a little daisy i the sun shone as brightly and warmly upon the daisy as upon i the splendid large flowers within the garden and therefore it grew hourly so that one morning it stood fully open with its delicate white gleaming leaves which like rays surrounded the t little yellow sun in their centre it never occurred to the 1 little flower that no one saw her hidden as she was among i the grass she was quite contented  she turned towards the i warm sun looked at it and listened to the lark who wasf singing in the air the daisy was as happy as if it were they day of some high festival and yet it was only monday the c children were at school  and whilst they sat upon their forms hi and learned their lessons the little flower upon her green stalk n learned from the warm sun and every thing around her how 1 good god is meanwhile the little lark expressed clearly and 0 beautifully all she felt in silence and the flower looked up a with a sort of reverence to the happy bird who could fly and d sing it did not distress her that she could not do the same a  i can see and listen thought she  the sun shines on mne h and the wind kisses me oh how richly am i blessed 94 there stood within the palings several grand stifflooking t flowers the less fragrance they had the more airs they gave fl themselves the peonies puffed themselves out in order to ai make themselves larger than the roses the tulips had the b gayest colours of all they were perfectly aware of it and held ti themselves as straight as a candle that they might be the better 01 seen they took no notice at all of the little flower outside c the palings but she looked all the more upon them thinking y4 how rich and beautiful they are yes that noble bird will st surely fly down and visit them how happy am 1 who live al so near them and see their beauty  just at that moment vi ji quirrevit the lark did fly down but he came not to the peonies nor the tulips no he flew down to the poor little ac daisay in the grass who was almost frightened from pure joy in and knew not what to think she was so surprised the little to bird hopped about and sang  oh how soft is this grasm rtand what a sweet little flower blooms here with its golden of heart and silver garment  for the yellow centre of the daisy rn looked just like gold and the little petals around gleamed silver n white ihow happy the little daisy was  no one can imagine of how happy the bird kissed her with his beak sang to her le and then flew up again into the blue sky it was a full quarhe ter of an hour ere the flower recovered herself half ashamed n and yet completely happy she looked at the flowers in the th garden they must certainly be aware of the honour and haput piness that had been conferred upon herthey must know tir j how delighted she was but the tulips held themselves twice al as stiff as before and their faces grew quite red with anger as i to the peonies they were so thickheadedit was indeed well he that they could not speak or the little daisy would have heard something not very pleasant the poor little flower could see  well that they were in an illhumour and she was much vexed at it soon after a girl came into the garden with a knife i sharp and bright she went up to the tulips and cut off one after another  oh  that is horrible sighed the daisy  it  is now all over with them the girl then went away with the i tulips how glad was the daisy that she grew in the grass lit outside the palings and was a despised little flower  she felt e really thankful and when the sun set she folded her leaves is went to sleep and dreamed all night of the sun and the beaul tiful bird the next morning when our little flower fresh ir and cheerful again spread out all her white leaves in the sunshine and clear blue air she heard the voice of the bird but he is sung so mournfully alas  the poor lark had good reason for e sorrow he had been caught and put into a cage close by the ly open window lie sang of the joys of a free and unrestrained i flightlie sang of the young green corn in the tields and of the pleasure of being born up by his wings in the open air the poor bird was certainly very unhappyhe sat a prisoner in his narrow cage  the little daisy would so of illingiv have  helped him but how could she  ah that she knew not she squite forgot how beautiful all around her was how warmly the sun shone how pretty and white her leaves were alas  she could only think of the imprisoned bird for whom it was not in her power to do anything all at once two little boys 1 came out of the garden one of them had a knife in his hand e as large and as sharp as that with which the girl had cut the y tulips they went straight up to the little daisy who could e not imagine what they wanted  here we can cut a nice r piece of turf for the lark said one of the boys and he began n to cut deep all round the daisy leaving her in the centre it i tear out the flower said the other boy and the little s 1 daisy trembled all over for fear for she knew that if she were e torn out she would die and she wished so much to live as she e was to be put into the cage with the imprisoned lark  no g leave it alone  said the first  it looks so pretty  and so e it was left alone and was put into the larks cage but the s poor bird loudly lamented the loss of its freedom and beat e its wings against the iron bars of its cage and the little flower e could not speak could not say a single word of comfort to ihim much as she wished to do so thus passed the whole imorning  there is no water here said the imprisoned vlark they have all gone out and forgotten me not a drop 1 of water to drink  my throat is dry and burning there is fire and ice within me and the air is so heavy  alas  i must i die i must leave the warm sunshine the fresh green trees and all the beautiful things which god has created  and then he pierced his beak into the cool grass in order to refresh him self a little and his eye fell upon the daisy and the bird bowed to her and said  thou too wilt wither here thou poor little flower  they have given me thee and the piece of green iaround thee instead of the whole world which i possessed before  every little blade of grass is to be to me a green i treethy every white petal a fragrant flower alas  thou only remindest me of what i have lost  oh that i could comfort him  thought the daisy but she could not move yet the fragrance which came from her delicate blossom was stronger than is usual with this flower the bird noticed it and although panting with thirst he tore the green blades in very anguish he did not touch the flower it was evening and yet no one came to bring the poor bird a drop of water he stretched out his slender wings and shook them convulsivelyhis song was a mournful  pipi his little head bent towards the flower and the birds heart broke from thirst and desire the flower could not now as on the preceding evening fold together her leaves and sleep she bent down sad and sick to the ground the boys did not come till the next morning and when they saw the bird was dead they wept bitterly they dug a pretty grave which they adorned with flower petals the birds corpse was put into a pretty red box royally was the poor bird buried whilst he yet lived and song they forgot himleft him suffering in his cage and now he was highly honoured and bitterly bewailed but the piece of turf with the daisy in it was thrown out into the street no one thought of her who had felt pnost for the little bird and who had so much wished to comfort him what a moral in the buckwheat if after a tempest you chance to walk through a field where buckwheat is growing you may observe that it is burnt as black as though a flame of fire had passed over it and should i you ask the reason the peasant will tell you that the lightning has done it but how is it that the lightning has i done it  i will tell you what the sparrow told me and the sparrow heard the story from an old willowtree which grew and still grows close to a field of buckwheat this willowtree is tall and highly respectable but at the same time old and wrinkled its trunk had been riven asunder from top to bottom grass and brambles grow out of the gap the tree bends forward and the branches hang down almost to the ground looking like long green hair there were different kinds of corn growing in the fields around the willowrye wheat and oatsthe beautiful oats whose ears when they are ripe look like a number of little yellow canarybirds sitting upon one branch the cornears were richly blessed and the fuller they were the lower they bowed their heads in pious humility but there was also a field of buckwheat lying just in front of the old willowtree the buckwheat bowed not like the rest of the cornhe stood stiff and proud  i am quite as rich as the wheat said he i and besides i am so i much more handsome my flowers are as beautiful as the i blossoms of the appletree it is delightful to look at me and l my companions do you know anything more beautiful than l we are you old willowtree  and the willowtree bent his l head as much as to say  yes indeed i do  but the f buckwheat was puffed up with pride and said  the stupid  tree he is so old that grass is growing out of his body  c now ctnne a dreadful storm all the flowers of the field folded their leaves or bent their heads whilst it passed over them 1 the buckwheat lowever in his pride still stood erect t  bow thv head as we do  said the flowers  i have no c need said the buckwheat  bow thy head as we do said  i the corn  the angel of storms comes flying hitherward hei h has win s which reach from the clouds to the earth he will it strike thee down before thou hast time to entreat for mercy n  no i will not bow said the buckwheat close thy i p flowers and fold thy leaves said the old willowtree look a not into the flash when the cloud breaks even men dare not n do that for in the flash one looks into gods heaven and that t sight can dazzle even human eves  what then would it prove tl to mere vegetables like us if we should dare to do so we al who are so inferior to men  so inferior indeed  said the ir buckwheat now then i vid look right into gods nr heaven and in his pride and haughtiness he did gaze upon c the lightning without shrinking such was the flash that it southeast seemed as if the whole world was in flames when the tem southeast pest was over flowers and corn greatly refreshed by the rain re once more breathed pure air but the buckwheat had been ta burnit as black as a coal by the lightning it stood on the field e a dead useless plant and the old willowtree waved its branrelse to and fro in the wind  and large drops of water th fell from the green leaves as though the tree wept and the of svarrows asksd  winv weepest thou  it is so beautiful here  to see howvthe sun shines  how the clo uds pass ever the clear i sky  hvw sweet is the fragrance of the flowers 1whv then a eellest thou old willowtree  ard the willow tree told of 11 ti iuek wleat s prise anl hao zhl iil e and of the crux lisol law a ei1 full hal i  re  a is lorv liar ir orthe sparrowsthey told it to me one evening when i asked ul them for a tale endt what sly satire in n the emperors new clothes iad many years ago there was an emperor who was so exces mst sively fond of new clothes that he spent all his money in dress pt he did not trouble himself in the least about his soldiers nor ith did he care to go either to the theatre or the chase except for iv the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new ud clothes he had a different suit for each hour of the day and nd as of any other king or emperor one is accustomed to say he  he is sitting in council it was always said of him  the he emperor is sitting in his wardrobe time passed away tie merrily in the large town which was his capital strangers arrived every day at the court one day two rogues calling themselves weavers made their appearance they gave out that they knew how to weave stuffs of the most beautiful colours and elaborate patterns the clothes manufactured from re which should have the wonderful property of remaining in as visible to every one who was unfit for the office he held or id who was extraordinarily simple in character  these must he indeed be splendid clothes  thought the emperor  had i as i such a suit i might at once find out what men in my realms he are unfit for their office and also be able to distinguish the v wise from the foolish  this stuff must be woven for me im r mediately and he caused large sums to be given to both id the weavers in order that they might begin their work directly to so the two pretended weavers set up two looms and affected be to work very busily though in reality they did nothing at all ie they asked for the most delicate silk and the purest gold it thread put both into their own knapsacks and then con e tinned their pretended work at the empty looms until late at e night  i should like to know how the weavers are getting g on with my cloth said the emperor to himself after some ie little time had elapsed he was however rather embarrassed is when he remembered that a simpleton or one unfit for his goffice would be unable to see the manufacture  to be sure ht lie thought i he had nothing to risk in his own person but n yet he would prefer sending somebody else to bring him in 0 telligence about the weavers and their work before he e troubled himself in the affair all the people throughout d the city had heard of the wonderful property the cloth was to n possess and all were anxious to learn how wise or how ignos rant their neighbours might prove to be  i will send my e faithful old minister to the weavers said the emperor at last i after some deliberation  he will be best able to see how the cloth looks for he is a man of sense and no one can be more i suitable for his office than he is so the faithful old minister went into the hall where the knaves were working with all their might at their empty looms v what can be the meaning of this  thought the old man opening his eyes very wide d i cannot discover the least bit of thread on the looms however he did not express his thoughts aloud the impos1 tors requested him very courteously to be so good as to come nearer their looms and then asked him whether the design pleased him and whether the colours were not very beautiful at the same time pointing to the empty frames the poor old minister looked and looked he could not discover any thing on the looms for a very good reason viz there was nothing there  what  thought he again is it possible that i am a simpleton  i have never thought so myself and no one must know it now if i am so can it be that i am unfit for my office no that must not be said either i will never confess that i could not see thestuff 1 well sirminister said one of the knaves still pretending to work  you do not say whether the stuff plleases you  oh it is excellent  replied the old minister loking at the loom through his spec tacles  this pattern and the coloursyes i will tell the emperor without delay how very beautiful i think them w e shall be much obliged to you said the impostors and then they named the different colours and described the pattern of the pretended stuff the old minister listened attentively to their words in order that he might repeat them to the eimtperor and then the knaves asked for more silk and gold saving that was neeesary to complete what they had begun llowcvcr they put all that was given them into their knapi s9c1 mnld c tinued to work vwith as much aippmrent diligence kfjrc t iir cq1ty looms the enpietor now rent au other officer of his court to see how the men were getting on i and to ascertain whether the cloth would soon be ready it t was just the same with this gentleman as with the minister he i surveyed the looms on all sides but could see nothing at all  but the empty frames does not the stuff appear as beautiful l to you as it did to my lord the minister  asked the imposx tors of the emperors second ambassador at the same time  making the same gestures as before and talking of the design i and colours which were not there  i certainly am not stupid i thought the messenger  it must be that i am not fit for i my good profitable office that is very odd however no l one shall know any thing about it and accordingly he i praised the stuff he could not see and declared that lie was i delighted with both colours and patterns  indeed please your imperial majesty said he to his sovereign when he returned  the cloth which the weavers are preparing is extraordinarily magnificent the whole city was talking of the 4 splendid cloth which the emperor had ordered to he woven at his own expense and now the emperor himself wished to see the costly manufacture whilst it was still on the loom accompanied by a select number of officers of the court among whom were the two honest men who had already admired the cloth he went to the crafty impostors who as soon as they were aware of the emperors approach went on working more diligently than ever although they still did not pass a single thread through the looms is not the work absolutely magnificent   said the two officers of the crown already mentioned if your majesty will only be pleased to look at it what al splendid design what glorious colours and at the samz l time they pointed to the empty frames for they imagined that i every one else could see this exquisite piece of workmanship  how is this  said the emperor to himself  i can see nothing  this is indeed a terrible affair  am i a simpleton or am i unfit to be an emperor  that would be the worst thing that could happenoh the cloth is charming said he aloud  it has my complete approbation and he smiled most graciously and looked closely at the empty looms for on no account would lie say that he could not see what two of the officers of his court had praised so much all his retinue now strained their eyes hoping to discover something on the looms but they could see no more than the others nevertheless they all exclaimed  oli how beautiful  and advised his majesty to have some new clothes made from this splendid material for the approaching procession magnificent charming  excellent  resounded on all sides and every one was uncommonly gay the euperor shared in the general satisfaction and presented the impostors with the ribbon of an order of knighthood to be worn in their buttonholes and the title of  gentlemen weavers the rogues sat up the whole of the night before the day on which the procession was to take place and had sixteen lights burning so that every one might see how anxious they were to finish the emperors new suit they pretended to roll the cloth off the looms cut the air with their scissors  and sewed with needles without any thread in them 1 see  cried they at last  the emperors new clothes are ready  and now the emperor with all the grandees of his court came to the weavers  andl the rogues raised their arms as if in the act of holding something up sayings  here are your majestys trowsers here is the scarf here is the mantle  the whole suit is as light as a cobweb one might fancy one has nothing at all on when dressed in it that however is the great virtue of this delicate cloth  yes indeed  said all the courtiers although not one of them could see any thing of this exquisite manufacture  if your imperial majesty will be graciously pleased to take off your clothes we will fit on the new suit in front of the lookingglass the emperor was accordingly undressed and the rogues pretended to array him in his new suit the emperor turning round from side to side before the lookingglass h how splendid his majesty looks in his new clothes and how well they fit  every one cried out  what a design what colours  these are indeed royal robes   the canopy which is to be born over your majesty in the procession is waiting announced the chief master of the ceremonies  i am quite ready answered the emperor 1 do my new clothes fit well  asked he turning himself round again before the lookingglass in order that he might appear to be examining his handsome suit the lords of the bedchamber who were to carry his majestys train felt about ou the ground as if they were lifting up the ends of the mantle and pretended to be carrying something for they would by no means betray anything like simplicity or unfitness for their office so now the emperor walked under his high canopy in the midst of the procession through the streets of his capital and all the people standing by and those at the windows cried out  oh how beautiful are our emperors new clothes  what a magnificent train there is to the mantle and how gracefully the scarf hangs  in short no one would allow that he could not see these muchadmired clothes because in doing so he would have declared himself either a simpleton or unfit for his office certainly none of the emperors various suits had ever made so great an impression as these invisible ones but the emperor has nothing at all on  said a little child  listen to the voice of innocence  exclaimed his father and what the child had said was whispered from one to another  but he has nothing at all on  at last cried out all the people the emperor was vexed for he knew that the people were right but he thought the processionx must go on now and the lords of the bedchamber took greater pains than ever to appear holding up a train although in reality there was no train to hold  the literary examiner danish fairy legends and tales by hans chris tian andersen pickering this is a charming little book of fairy tales and excellently well translated but why the tales should he called danish we do not perceive  except inasmuch as a dane is the author there is an occasional northern colouring but only so far as it could not be helped all the rest is so free from everything national or exclusive that we do not remember to have met with any production so given up to a sense of the variety of being that exists in the universe at times it is even painfully so we have so strong a sense given us of the feelings of ducks and ducklings  of swans and storks  of mermen and mermaidens  of nightingales flowers and daisies  even of slugs and cuttlefish  aud of what all sorts of animated creatures round about us think do and might say if they could speak that ones consciousness as a human being almost becomes lost in the crowd we begin to feel as mrs gulliver did when her husband returned from houynhnm land  and think we might as well take to being of a different species we need not say that it implies a rare and surprising art to convey such impressions as these when johnson laughed at goldsmith for thinking of writing a story in which u little fish should be the actors the author of animateil xetture very properly told him that it was not so easy a matter as he thought it  and that if he johnson were to write such a story he would make his little fish talk like  great whales there is no such confusion of ideas in mr hans christian andersen his whales and his little fish all talk in character we are not sure that we ourselves after reading his book could not have talked at pleasure like sharks minnows mermaids bulls ducks or green teas for his vegetables have as much conversational character as his ducks and geese nay his very pegtops and balls are full of individuality there is a pathetic daisy in his story of that name who is quite a  sweet creature for the pastoral beauty of her tongue  and in another story there is a leatter ball of so aristocratical a character that when proposals are made to her by a pegtop because they happen to have been companions in the same drawer she indignantly asks him whether he is aware that her father and mother were morocco slipjiers and that she has  cork in her body we are here however it may be said confusing the specific and the superinduced character mr andersen keeps all clear he has so just a sense of the necessity of adhering to verisimilitude and of the forgetfulness of it on the part of writers in general that he introduces one of his stories with a remark that ought to become proverbial  in china the emperor is chinese esome of his descriptive touches recall the wonderful observation and exquisitely graphic felicity of mr dickens there is a wretched little hut in the tale of the ugly duclding  so wretched that it knew not on which side to fall and therefore remained standing admirable is the picture of the stork parading about on his long red legs discoursingin egyptian which language he had learned from his mother who does not feel that egyptian ls the very language that by way of accomplishment a stork would know  the touches of tnis kind are innumerable the fault of the book if we must find one is that all the stories have too much meaning  that they overflow with intention and moral not always obviously sometimes obscurely but still with incessant intelligence you desire occasionally something more childish and less clever and some of the stories nre too long but the genius and refinement are undeniable we must give an extract and are somewhat at a loss so many of the teles nave such strone chums but with all the fairy fancy of the volume in general perhaps the beet story

account of the remote shetlauds the group of islands stretching away far to the nohll of the scotch mainland must always be comparatively secluded and solitary the difficulty of intercommunication at some seasons of the year is enhanced by the impossibility uf the trade ever payimz for adequate vesscls the shetland people will lways therefore be cast upon their own small resources for their instruction and social progress mrs edmondston tells us the number of the entire populationthat only of a fifth or sixth rate towni shetland contains about 33000 inhabitants scattered over the islands in hawlet3 a1nd isolated dwellings there is only g small town with a population of 3000 the lald is generally low sloping to the shore everywhere w11th the exception of a few precipitous headlands of

elements of educa tion that the skletlauder is counted a sharp fellow everywhere there are twelve parish clergyinet of the established church of scotland assisted in a few instancs by missionaries on the church extension schemes a small number of persons profess other creeds as methodists and dissenters from the establishment but there are no roman catholics in many of the parishes which have a radius of seven to twelve miles or where a stormy tideway rolls between the several districts or different islmnds of which such parishes ire composed there are two or three churches in which it is the ininisters duty to officiate this he can accomplish only on successive sabbaths in turn fairisle and foula have a visit from him only once a year in all the parishes thee is a school attached to the establislhed church as in the other districts of scotland  but there are supplementary schools under the superintendence of other educational committees so that there are now it is understood hardly any grown persons throughout the islands who cannot read and the generation now springing up very generally acquire writing the latter is an art so obviously invaluable to the absent and their friends that the poor shetlanders often make considerable sacrifices to attain it we regret however that the authoress cannot give a better account of their morals than will be found in the next passage their connexion with the shipping tradefor half the male population are seamenmight explain the prevalence of some vices but not necessarily of lies and petty larcenies it must on the whole be admitted they are by no means a religious people they seem to be totally deficient in that deep reverential impression of sacred things which has so long and so favourably distilguished the scottish peasantry though almost universally sober and decorous in their dejneanour it is a general matter of complaint by their religious instructors that they do not appear to be actuated by the principles or animated by the sentiments of the blessed faith they profess on the one hand overt crimes of con siderable nmanitude are very rare we leave the doors of our dwellings during the whole year v it

but for the providential abuand anc of ilacks and piltacks to be sure many a delicate female and hungry little babe at times turned almost with loathing from fish without any addition of bread or pola toes and many times the weather was so stormy that in their greatest need the men could not put off a boat but on the whole these islanders were chiefly by means of this food preserved from much of the suffering other destitute districts underwent even in seasons of ordinary produc tiveness from the land when a few days perchance a week or two elapses without ash in a shetland cottage the family

and hold his hand about our corn only on christmasday or ata wedding are sillacks and piltacks inadmissible on a shetland cottars table the ponies of the islands are better known on the mainland than any other of their denizens of the land and many persons can verify mrs edmonstons opinion of their wit from our ample experience of the dispositions and habits of the shetland pony indeed in this his unsophisticated state we are persnaded that any mischievous or vicious propensi ties of whi h we have sometimes heard him accused have been superinduced by artificial culture and improper management when he is treated with uniform patience and kindly perseverance he displays as much tractability 3nd suavity as other wellknlwn and valuable qualities a good riding pony is the great luxury of shetland life among the gentry and it is one they all have in greater or less perfection boys and girls easily learn to manage their own steed the distances from church and between the different country mansions are so great that walking especially in winter is out of the question indeed the shetlanders seem to consider it not at all necemary or incumbent on them to exercise their own powers of locomotion when their ponies can carry them anywhere so much more swiftly and comfortably the horses properly appertaining to each arc great petx with the younger members of a family all sorts of

B1270,['6641829'],  strangers at lisconnel by jane barlow hodder  stoughton an authority on idylls says rather testily   after the use made of the word by tennyson in his idylls of the king which are epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragic in their incidents it becomes very difficult to say what may not be called an idyll this is cowardly to put the mildest censure on it surely a man and a scholar after reading poems epic in their style and treatment and romantic and tragio in their incidents should find it very easy to say  there are compositions whioh may not be called idylls of such are these poems of the king i will not believe that even the shade of tennyson could be set aquiver by a quiet polite comment to that effect meanwhile it is here not so important to decide what is not an idyll as it is to deoide what an idyll is the word  idyll looked into is seen to mean  a little picture   and all the best idyllmakers from theocritus to jane barlow have given us little pictures for a little pioture it might naturally be supposed that one would ohoose a little subject a cottage rather than a castle little claus rather than big claus this again is what the best idyllmakers have always done even when the doing of it must have gone somewhat against the grain the great pastoral poet of greece makes an infamous act the theme of his eulogy because the doer of it was ptolemy the great pastoral poet of greece was partial to royalty but he did not make royalty dominate in his idylls lycidas was a goatherd goatherds harvestmen fishermenthese we meet in the famed idylls of greece very different they are from their brother  craftsmen whom we have known in the flesh if theocritus has drawn them truthfully the explanation of this fact is to be found in the time and the clime in which they lived their world was younger than ours by two thousand years the sky above them was a sicilian one well might they in the worlds youth and worlds garden live a life so free from care that they had to  make up  their sorrows 1 it is profitless perhaps but it is rather tempting to conjecture what would have happened to them if they had been sent  jumping oer times  the bold phrase is shaksperes to our time and if they had been brought to a standstill at lisconnel among goatherds harvestmen and fishermen in a world older by two thousand years with an irish sky over this bit of it among folk whose life is so laden with care that they have to  make up  their joys my feeling is that even lycidas who goatherd as he was could recite poems of his own composition upon occasion would have succumbed to what to any but a grey eye or soan irish eye would seem lamentably lacking in matter for poetry it is impossible to praise in excess the consummate skill with which miss barlow has made anew little pictures of the loveliest with this drear lisconnel for background and in the foreground nothing brighter than the blue of mrs kilfoyles cloak for what painters call a point of colour they who echo the famous german who said ich hasse ail zweitenmale may put down strangers at lisconnel at once  for it is nothing but what it calls itself  a second series of irish idylls no better than the first because better could not be but as good a fact which should be emphasised because there are people who think that as good could not be jerry dunnes basket is as witty as any story in the first series and is notable on another account till it appeared daudets little tale called  la mule du pape  was probably the best story of this kind yet told it is now the second best miss barlows being by just as much better than it as an irish toss of the head is bettermore sweet and commendablethan a french kick  jerry dunnes basket tells of an irish toss of the head and  la mule du pape  tells of a french kick of the pathetic stories more especially among them  mrs kilfoyles cloak  a good turn  boys wages  con the quare one i should like to write at great length but space forbids it is here possible only to give a few of the many passages in these tales and others which one marks as showing  the quality  of them we are taken out of the bogland for a look abrpad  the road climbs to the top of a hill and stops there abruptly as if it had been travelling all the while merely to look at the view there is only one writer living who could have written that and only one writer living who could have written this  the shower was a vicious one with the sting of sleet and hail in its drops pelted about by gusts that ruffled up the puddles into ripples all set on end like the feathers of a frightened hen as a sample of miss barlows own satire which is real irish point take this  ody was leaning against the wall critically examining brian kilfoyles blackthorn and forming a poor opinion of it with considerable satisfaction not that he bore brian any illwill but because this was his method of attaining to contentment with his own possessions sometimes there is a sounding of the profundities what was there in it asks thady before the beginnin of everything thady was a small anxiouslooking child whose pale and peaky face his mother often likened regretfully to a haporth of soap after a weeks washing he had spent a surprisingly considerable part of his six years in metaphysical speculations and was always disposed to make a personal grievance of the difficulties in which they constantly landed him his tone was now rather peremptory as he repeated what was there in it before the beginnin of everythin   sure nothin at all said his elder brother peter to whom the answer seemed quite simple and satisfactory but joanna looked as if ene had caught sight of some distant object which provoked hard staring   then what was there before the beginnin of nothin   pursued thady 4 dunno said peter indifferently  unless it was more nothin   sure not at all that wouldnt be the way of it joanna said dreamily yet with decision  if there was nothin but nothin in it thered ha been apt to not be eer an anythin ever whered it ha come from y dont be tellin the child lies peter why for one thing she said her tone sharpening polemically and taking a touch of triumph there was always god almighty in it and the divil maybe thats what you call nothin  peter evaded this point saying what peter said will be found in the tale called con the quare one i do not give it for two reasons i want the reader to go to the book and i want to give another passage you are to know that a theft has been perpetrated in lisconnel a thief has appeared there his appearance is followed by that of policemen it might seem on the face of things that the arrival of two active and stalwart civil servants would have been welcomed as happening just in the nick of time yet it argues an alien ignorance to suppose such a view of the matter by any means possible the men in invisible green tunics belonged completely to the category of pitatyblights rintwarnins fevers and the like devastators of life that dog a man more or less all through it but close in on him a pitiful quarry when the bad seasons come and the childer and the old crathurs are starvin wid the hunger and his own heart is broke therefore to accept assistance from them in their official capacity would have been a proceeding most reprehensibly unnatural to put a private quarrel or injury into the hands of the peelers were a disloyal making of terms with the public foe a condoning of great permanent wrongs for the sake of a trivial temporary convenience lisconnel has never been skilled in the profitable and useful art of utilising its enemies not that anybody was more than vaguely conscious of these sentiments much less attempted to express them in set terms when a policeman appeared there was an inquiring mood what people said among themselves was  musha cock bim up i hope hell get his health till i would be tellin him or words to that effect while in reply to his questions they made statements superficially so clear and simple and essentially so bewilderingly involved that the longest experience could do little more for a constable than teach him the futility of wasting his time in attempts to disentangle them there is a very general idea in england that irelands history has been written by moore lecky froude keating and some others and there has grown up a practice of late years of rather industriously studying these writers who are some of them interesting but are none of them quite reliable it is a curious fact that the writer who is the best historian that ireland has yet bad miss jane barlow is not only more reliable than any of the historians named above but is also immeasurably more interesting than any of them froude is considered by those who do not trust him wholly to have had a pretty wit it becomes very ugly when compared with wit like the above perhaps it is after all not for nothing that irish wit is accounted

B982,['6552330'],  droll stories from the abbeys of touraine translated into english complete and un  abridged london chatto  windus 1874 people who reproduce recondite or obsolete literary garbage occupy a position which it is easy for them to defend and which it is difficult to assail to find fault with their wares is to advertise them and to expose the reviewer to the easy charge of prudery it often happens too that there is here and there a jewel hidden in the dunghills of the past some pure song among the many base ones of th6ophile vian some fact of historical value in the gossip of mrs aphra behn it is a pity that the student should not have such books always beside him as if the poorest student had not easy access to them in public libraries still there is this shadow of au excuse for many reprints of books which are meant to appeal only to prurient curiosity and when they are pro duced with some care and costliness in type and paper the chances are that they will not fall into the hands of readers whom they are likely to injure none of the excuses we have mentioned can be urged by the translator and the pub lishers of balzacs contes drolatiques the translator says in his preface in france the work has long been regarded as a classicas a faithful picture of the last days of the mayen dge when kings and princesses brave gentlemen and haughty ladies laughed openly at stories and jokes which are considered disgraceful by their more fastidious descendants in england the difficulties of the language employed and the quaintness and peculiarity of its style have placed it beyond the reach of all but those thoroughly acquainted with the french of the sixteenth century taking into consideration the vast amount of historical information enshrined in its pages the archaeological value it must alwats possess for the student and the dramatic interest of its stories the translator has thought that an english edition of balzacs chef dceuvre would be acceptable to many no doubt it would and no doubt a translation of the marquis de sades chefdceuvres or of any other  scrofulous french novel would be acceptable to many but the translator like everyone else must be per fectly aware that the historical information of the book is absolutely worthless that it has no archaeological value at all except in the same sense as esmoncd has archaeological value that is as an imitation of the style and manners of the past and the style and lan guage of the contes drolatiques are not nearly so successful in this direction as esmond is the old french is like no old french in par ticular indeed it resembles nothing so much as the bastard old english of lady novelists who put ys for is and spell the ye and begin all the substantives with a capital letter there is no philological instruction to be got from this kind of thing and even if there were it would be lost in a translation to be sure the translator does his best by using some fine old examples of wellknown errors in english grammar such as  the wise man would lay at full length in a ditch to translate balzacs conte8 drolatiques then is inexcusable on historical or antiquarian grounds even beroalde de verville has the value of being the exponent of the nastiness of a past age but there is no historical value in a modern imitation of beroalde de verville and even if the cn ies were useful to the student a student so advanced ought to be able to read them in the original french nor has the book the excuse of being published at a price beyond the humblest purse or in a form meant to please the lover of beautiful typography it is got up like the boys books that are current at christmas and an illiterate but wellmeaning grand mother might probably give it to a boy now even the author would have objected to this for when balzac in the preface to the first edition defended his work as a work of art he also said that it was intended pour lea lecteura choiie the present translation appeals to the public at large to a public which has none of the education that would enable it to appreciate the art without taking harm from the grossness the contes drolatique is a fair example of the baser work of the romantic school of 1830 it deals with mediaeval themes and the author thoroughly enters into the horror and the lust which inform the grotesque of the middle ages in the voice and with a cracked imitation of the ringing laugh of rabelais he tells tales more filthy than any in the collection of the cure of meudon and morehateful in theircruelty than most that disgrace the records of crime in the middle ages theserecords are dreadful enough but they are at least human in their earnestness men were cruel because they were terrified but it is scarcely human to take such themes for art a gross age laughed grossly but there is something apish in the imitative and affected ribaldry of a refined age a cruel age acted with cruelty but there is something of the tiger in the artist who in a humane age gloats over torture like all balzac did his contes drolatiques are works of patient art look at the story of la succube it is a masterpiece of the romantic school the blind gropings of pedants in the mysteries of nature and of law are reproduced with the skill of michelet a glamour of moorish colour a savour of exotic fragrance hangs about the vampire but in place of the indignation of michelet there is only a sound of mocking laughter and everywhere in the book in every page we are reminded that this is the work of that balzac after reading whom saintebeuve said he felt like one unclean the book is full of art but to translate it for english people is to perpetrate another of the many crimes that are done in the name of art in this sabbat of satyrs and obscene witches among these foul scandals of monasteries and shadows of nameless sins there appears here and there the face of a woman that is not wholly vile or of a knight that was not merely a lecher but there is none of the tender poetry the pure love that redeem the coarseness of boccaccio the romantic school has scarcely produced a more hideous work or one so likely to do mischief in an english form the volume is illustrated with dores famous woodeuts now very worn and ob scure mr hamerton and mr ruskin did full justice to these drawings while they were still confined to a book that was not likely to find its way into schoolrooms it may be observed that the publishers have chosen to mutilate mr ruskins observations in their catalogue he did not end when he had said  nothing more witty nor more inventively horrible has yet been produced but went on thus in the evil literature or by the art of man nor can i conceive it possible to go beyond either in their spe

B8078,"['6175432', '4850829']",  mrs matthews  or family mysteries a novel bv mrs trollope 3 vols london 1851 mrs trollopes works of fiction aie generally improbable in their plot exaggerated in their cha racters and somewhat coarse and vulgar in their treatment but there has hitherto been an energy and pungency about them which carry the reader with her she is often disagreeable but has never before been dull if one has a dislike to any particular class of persons it is especially amusing to follow mrs trollope through a three volume caricature of them but in the quiet and peaceful walks of taletelling this authoress is by no means so engaging a prizefighter hitting knockdown blows in the ring was a person of some interest to that happily extinct race of corinthians  who loved to see  punishment given and received but if the athlete doffed the champions belt and as has whilome happened took his seat in the house of commons he became a very dull inconsiderable unit now mrs trollope in  family mysteries is like a prizefighter turned legislator or justice of the peace there are indeed occasional very occasional snatches of satirical pugnacity she makes a high church clergyman connive at his sons running away with the daughter of a rich neighbour and she pictures the reverend gentleman as worldly obsequious and polemical she draws also a priest such as priest never was setting aside however these scintillations of mrs trollopes chronic hostility to the ministers of every creed and of every church the book is very much of the orderunreadable the story opens with a description of how mary king a mature spinster who bad seen half a century of winters engages to marry mr mathews a well to do bachelor of sixtytwo because her father pathetically implores her to do so upon the score that this overripe paternity was in grievous fear that when he was dead there would be nobody to sign receipts for rent or to see that the home meadows were properly drained mrs trollope however always makes the plot of her books turn upon a marriage settlement and the staid and wary mary king battles through a long chapter for  bookmoney ret pinmoney to the extent of jf500 ayear submitting in return to allow her intended a right to dispose of the united family fortune after her death to a certain illegitimate grandson of her sexagenarian lover mary king spinster had for thirtyfive years enjoyed a queerlooking room up stairs stuffed full of books  and there she had lived and worked she had laid up hidden stores of most unfeminine learning read latin with a heterodox fluency and spanish portuguese and other unknown tongues by the aid of her huge lexicons and borrowed grammars but mary king had once been nearly in love a certain john anderson had looked his wishes but had started for india and had not spoken them john anderson now writes to mary kingbecome a matrona letter telling ber that he had married and had survived his wife that he himself was now dying and that he had confided his daughter with about 7000 to her care after a long time the orphan arrives and so does the illegitimate grandchild and the mnage at weldon grange is complete then there is a sir charles otterborne whose principal peculiarities are an affectation of great cordiality a propensity to shake peoples arms out of their clavicle and a liking to the dice box there is lady otterborne pale anxiouslooking and with a thought a memory or a secret in her heart there is the handsome intellectual herbert the son of this couple and the hero of the novel moreover there are lords squires and retired merchants making up the county society the reader very soon discovers that janet anderson is every inch a heroine and that stephen cornington the grandson notwithstanding his superhuman beauty and very respectful flatteries is in every thought and act a swindler the instinct of a heroine of course preserves ber from falling in love with a swindler however handsome dashing and soft in song but herbert otterborneah that is a diferent matter herbert however is engaged to be married to emily steyton who is to receive jf80000 on the day of her marriage now emily steyton is very beautiful and very rich but she has two faults the first is if that be a fault in a lady that most imperiously she will have her own way the second that she falls in love with every new man she meets flirts desperately in drawingrooms loses her way in the woods during the progress of a picnic party and is brought back after some hours absence by the handsomest man in the companyhe not being her betrothed the end of this young ladys career is that she elopes with a very estimable young man of very pliable temperthe son of the parish parson that her father immediately forgives her and she becomes a happy wife the moral of course is that there is nothing for female happiness like a good heartless round of most compromising flirtation and a plunge into matrimony at last the swindler after hectoring about and making mrs matthews and everybody else very uncomfortable is found out st last there is a weakly worked scene of bis attempting to rob the house wherein he is frustrated by the hero of the piece sir herbert otterborne of course herbert and janet are duly married in the third volume herbert had only consented tb marry the heiress in ordr to release his father frbm his

very literally had made everything she had on 44 four cause tb borrow a significant phrase for if she had not her mantuamakers bill must have been paid by charity but no opportunity was afforded her for mrs mathews rather abruptly turning her back upon her addressed mr price   i suppose this wedding will take place in london sir  this looked very much as if mrs matthews was not in a good humour for as she probably knew perfectly well it would have been very difficult for her to have said anything more painfully grating to the feelings of mr price than these words mr prices wishes were probably none of them very vehement or impassioned but rarely or never had he wished anything more earnestly than that the heir of the manorhouse and the heiress of the lodge should be united in the band of holy matrimony in his church aud that he himself should pronounce the nuptial benediction  did sir charles say so  demanded he with his usual gentle accent but not without betraying a little agitation  i am not quite sure whether he did or not replied his tormentor but it is much more likely i think than that tlny should be married here poor miss louisa actually turned pale as she listened to these words for she was honoured by the intended bride with a greater degree of intimacy than she bestowed upon any gther young lady in the neighbourhood and in her very heart of hearts she had both hoped and expected that she should be selected as one of the bridesmaids had mrs matthews happened to look at her at that moment instead of looking at her mother she would hardly have had the cruelty to persevere in her fabulous statement for the woebegone expression of her pretty little face was piteous to behold but unfortunately the attention of mrs matthews was just then attracted to the generally very unmeaning countenance of her mamma but which at that moment was considerably less unmeaning than usual for her eyes were earnestly directed to the thin and not very new black silk of which poor janets homemade suit was composed and there was much too decided an expression ot scorn in the curl of her lip and her countenance to have been called unmeaning at that moment mrs matthews saw it all and understood it all which might be an evidence perhaps of the acuteness of her observation  but the result was certainly not an evidence of the goodness of her temper for abruptly turning to mr price she said in her clear distinct voice which rarely permitted any word she uttered to be unheard or its meaning misunderstood  things seem to be going rather sharply against though oxford gentry mr price particularly in out neighbourhood if all that i hear be true i am told that dr belton is to be the new dean and he is eositively the roost thoroughly lowchurch divine that we ave  dont call him a divine my good lady i do mo9t humbly beg and entreat tint i may not near any such epithet applied to him we have fieldpreachers mrs mathews fieldpreachers and streetpreachers in abundance who are ten times more orthodox than he is cried mr price with a degree of vehemence that brought a deep flush to the very roots of his grey hair  he is an absolute infidel on many points ho added with a sijjh  and a most audacious dissenter on othersand as to the rubric i know that he said     never mind what he has said mr price and if you will believe me you had better begin to speak of him with a little more civility and a great deal more caution for if they are going to make a dean of him now you may be very sure that it will not be very long before he is rhaden bishop and when that is done mr price i feel quite sure that your own sense ot propriety will make you very sorry for anything you have ever spoken against him you know sir we are told that  a binhoj must be blamelen and that upon such authority as you will not choose to deny but do not let us talk any more about it there can be no doubt i believe that dr belton will be a bishop and therefore though less we any of us say against him the better poor imr price was fortunately rather a thin man and his pulse constitutionally beat time very temperately for had it been otherwise he might have been in danger of an attack of apoplexy for he was at that moment as greatly irritated as lt was in his nature to be and very justly too perhaps mrs matthews was aware of this for she suddenly let him alone and was meditating making a generous atonement for all her misdemeanours by looking at and admiring the immortal hearthrug when must unluckily she perceived that the eyes of miss louisa were now engaged erecisely in the same manner that those of her mamma bad een a few minutes before in short mrs matthews very clearly perceived that ihe dress and accoutrements of john andersons daughter were undergoing a scrutiny which they were by no means particularly well calculated to stand and this was a great deal more than it was in her nature to bear with patience she felt it the more too because she wss conscious that she had been herself most culpably unobservant on this point she had looked certainly more than once in the face of janet and found it lovely she had studied its varying expression and found more than one look that set her thinking a great deal more about the looks ef the father in days past than of the dress of the daughter in days present but thia was ber own fault and not that of neat nice welldressed mrs price and her fair louisa i and had mrs matthews been a little more reasonable abd a little less revengeful she would not have left the parsonage so mightily wellpleased with the idea of having made herself as disagreeable to its inhabitants as it was well possible for her to do during the very moderate interval that shs permitted her

B3378,"['8868540', '6657197']",  memoirs of a highland lady literature edited by lady strachey murray we were once shown a picture by raeburn of an elderly scotchman an elderly scotch gentlewoman and a beautiful scotch girl they were said the owner an uncle who had fought under clive his maiden sister and their nieceall johnstones of alva if memory serves aright that group has been recalled by this most charming book which like the picture suggests a scotch jane austen much more janeaustenish than susan ferrier its author elizabeth grant was born in edinburgh may 7th 1797 had an unhappy first love in 1815 was married in 1829 in bombay cathedral to col afterwards general henry smith of baltiboys lived thereafter in ireland and died november 16th 1885 she was the eldest of the five childrentwo sons and three daughtersof sir john peter grant of eothiemurchus 1774  1848 by his english wife jane ironside whose father was a long  descended clergyman at houghtonle spring sir john peter the only son of a doctor had succeeded in 1790 to the rothiemurchus property by the death of his uncle he was an edinburgh advocate and london barrister sat as whig member for grimsby and tavistock and in 1827 having frittered away his 2000 a year and gone bankrupt was appointed a judge in bombay and knighted later he was chief justice at calcutta these memoirs written by mrs smith for her children during 184567 come down only to 1830 and record her life in london at thorley hall hertfordshire at the doune in rothiemurchus on speyside at university college oxford of which dr james griffith one of her numberless cousins was master in london again in edinburgh and in india they have already been privately printed and now are generously given to the world with a brieftoo briefintroduction by a niece lady strachey no book of the kind has proved more delightful  if ever i write a novel mrs smith says once and about 1826 she and a sister mary did between them produce  a bundle of rubbish for some forgotten inspector and received 40 in return that rubbish might repay recovery but a novel by her yes we could wish she had written a novel as it is these five hundred pages would set up a dozen presentday novelists and might have furnished themes to the great poets of the past here is one that is truly wordsworthian the young people were not of rothiemurchus they lived up in glen feshie a great way from our march and they had not long been married he was either a small farmer or the son of one or merely shepherd to a more wealthy man i am not sure which but his business was to mind a large hock that pastured on the mountainsat the beginning of a heavy snowstorm our young husband departed on his round of duty the wife was preparing for her first baby  she was also busy with her wheel the first work of a newlymarried notable highland girl being the spinning and the dyeing of a plaid for her husband she baked the bread she trimmed her fire and she busked her house then took her wheel and by the light of a splinter of quick fir laid on a small projecting slab within the chimney she wore away the long dark hours of that dreary winters night ever as the storm lulled for a while she bent to listen for the voice she expected at the door which poor young thing she was never to hear again for he never returned from those wild mountains they sought him for days  no trace of him could be discovered when the snow melted and the summer flowers burst into bloom party after party set out in quest of his remains all unsuccessfully it was not till late in autumn when our gamekeeper was on the braeriach shooting grouse that he saw on a shelf of rock midway down a precipice a plaided figure it was all that was left of the missing shepherd and his collie lay dead beside him deceived by the snow he had wandered miles away from his own ground and must have died from exhaustion after a fall on to this sheltered spot his widow was past all knowledge of his fate  her anxiety had brought on premature childbirth fever ensued and though she recovered her strength her mind was gone she lived in the belief of the speedy return of her husband went cheerfully about her usual work preparing things for him going through the same routine as on the day she lost him  baking sweeping putting on fresh peats and ending with her wheel by the side of the clean hearth in the evening she would show her balls of yarn with pride to the kind neighbours who looked in upon her and the little caps she was trimming for the baby that was lying alongside the bones of its father in the kirkyard sometimes in the evening they said she would look wearily round and sigh heavily and wander a little in her talk but in the morning she was early up and busy as ever she was never in want for every one helped her but though she was so much pitied she was in their sober way much blamed the highlanders are fatalists what is to be must be  what happens must be born patiently we must  dree our weird all of us this needs no praise of ours for it could not have been told more beautifully and it is but one of passages innumerable that cast a vivid and direct light on the olden manners and thoughts of the highlanders there was no deep religious feeling among them in those predisruption days fairy legends old clan tales forebodings and prophecies were quite as much believed in as the bible the minister of duthil possessed only two english sermons though he altered the texts to give them an air of variety his brother of alvie known as parson john used often for lack of matter to treat his congregation to a screed from the newspapers once learning in the weektime that he had been spreading false rumours he next sunday after the psalm and the prayer and the solemn giving out of the text raised his hands and ejaculated  my brethren it was a lees i told you last sabbath day the fusion of classes from duke to peasant was singular yet not so singular among people where of two brothers one from a footboy had risen to be general whilst the other was only a retired private with a pension of sixpence a day and with a daughter a kitchenmaid in the house where her uncle visited these were grants and of grants grants grants nearly seventy figure in the excellent index not all of them quite entitled to the surname thus there was annie grant the accidental daughter of mrs smiths great  great  uncle a bare  footed herdlassie once she was admitted on terms of perfect equality to sir john peters family and marrying an indian general became a welcome guest at newstead and kensington palace the consumption of whisky was vast at the doune one bottle of it every morning was placed on the sidetable and another was the allowance in the pantry in 1809 some of the volunteer officers appeared  for the first time in the drawingroom to teaand sober the very poorest cottages could offer whisky and all the men engaged in the wood manufacture drank it in goblets three times a day one day a woman  with a child in her arms and another bit thing at her knee came up to the house  the horn cup was duly handed to her she took a  gey guid drap herself and then gave a little to each of tne babies  my goodness child said my mother to the wee thing that was trotting by the mothers side 4doesnt it bite you  ay but i like the bite replied the creature the book is not purely highland scattered here and there in its five hundred pages are all sorts of glimpses of wellknown even great people shelley was at university when in 1810 elizabeth grant went to stay there with her cousin she describes him as slovenly and very insubordinate and as making when reprimanded extraordinary gestures expressive of humility under reproof so as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the lecturing tutor at the hampstead villa of an uncle william frere she sometimes in 1823 met that poor mad poet coleridge who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist edward irving too came there he struck her as very dirty and joanna baillie  a nice old lady scott she was never in company with and the idea of the highlands given by  waverley seemed to her utterly at variance with truth none the less this passage under 18178 ii interesting  walter scott went out very little and when he did go he was not agreeable generally sitting very silent looking dull and listless unless an occasional flash lighted up his countenance in his own house he was another character especially if he liked his guests it was odd but sir walter never had the reputation in edinburgh he had elsewherewas not the lion i mean his wonderful works were looked for read with avidity praised on all hands yet the author made far less noise at home than he did abroad the fat vulgar mrs jobson whose low husband had made his large fortune at dundee by pickling herrings on being congratulated at the approaching marriage of her daughter to sir walters son said the young people were attached otherwise her jane might have looked higher it was  only a baronetcy and quite a late creation  then there are stories of lady eldon and her sisterinlaw lady stowellone thrifty one something more for the first when her husband was earning thousands a year would make the carters hold up the coalbags and shake them as they were emptied into the cellars she herself standing at the window of her lords fine mansion and giving a little nod as each empty sack was laid on the pavement whilst the second grudged her husband his clean daily shirt and used herself to take a nights wear out of the cast one for a bedgown the future lady byron burnss bonnieleslie one of the cleverest women of her age mrs thrale catalani mrs siddons sir augustus deete the original we believe of harry richmonds father basil hall john clerk of eldin jeffrey canning the abbe sieves and many more emerge and disappear in connexion with prince augustus anice point of etiquette comes up  that with royalty to dinner one must not have fingerglasses for nobody ever washes before royalty still after all we like the highland folk best there was old lovat who when on a visit to cluny in 1809 took the strange whim that he was a turkey hen  44 and so he had made a nest of straw in his carriage and filled it with eggs and a large stone and there he sat hatching never leaving his station but twice a day like other fowl and having his supplies of food brought to him they had at last to get lady clunys henwife to watch a proper moment to throw out all the eggs and to put some young chickens in their elace when lovat satisfied he had accomplished ia task went about clucking and strutting in the midst of them there was elizabeths greatgreatgrandfather patrick grant surnamed macalpine 16651743 who never slept at night without praying for two men rob roy and the duke of gordon rob roy having helped him at a pinch to best the mackintosh macalpine whose soft white womanish hands could draw blood from any other mans fingernails himself always went about with twentyfour gaily dressed followers  he was judge and jury in one and with halter or dirk these carried out his stern sentences he married twicefirst the highborn mary grant and then in old age a lowborn rachel grant who after his death fared ill at the hands of the wife of the  spreckled laird her stepson  once after the service in the kirk was over poor lady rachel stepped up with her fan in her hand to the corner of the kirkyard where all oar graves are made and taking off her highheeled slipper she tapped with it on the stone laid over her husbands grave crying out through her tears  macalpine macalpine  rise up for ae halfhour and see me richted   she had born him four sons the third of whom elizabeth saw often for he lived until 1813 or a hundred and fortyeight years from the birth of his father this was dapper little capt lewis grant who was also twice married and who lived with his first wife for years without speaking a word though they occupied the same rooms and every night played backgammon together and there was in 1814 a very old mrs macintosh of borlam  mackintosh of borium a daughterinlaw of the brigadier who lived at kin gussie with her daughter the widow of a major macpherson and a comely widow too   the leddy borlam was said to be not far from ninety years of age upright active slender richly dressed for her station and with a pleasant countenance her handsome silks caused many a sly remark she was the widow of a neighbouring freebooter whom sir thomas dick lauder endeavoured to portray as  lochandhu there were many tales current of his doings in our part of the country a cave he hid his treasures in was still open on the hill at belleville for he did not deal in black cattle only  no traveller was safe when borlam wanted his wife was said to have been frequently occupied in picking out the marks in the fine holland ruffled shirts it was his especial coxcombry to appear in and it was more than whispered that he had given her braivs enough to last beyond a lifetime  seemingly a true suspicion for the lady borlams silks would stand alone and she had plenty of them with them she wore the highland mutch the high clear cap of fine muslin trimmed in her case with flanders lace and calm as a princess she moved about in her illgotten gear she was a wonderful old woman keen merry kindly and as cute as an irishwoman never tripping in her talk or giving the remotest hint of the true character of her lamented husband we had marked for quotation a score of other things as the dutchlike interior of the inn at seaham the floating of the timber to the spey the floaters ball the eagles  ospreys that built upon lochaneilein the bediamonded aldermanesses at margate with their tumblers of brandyandwater the middleaged beauty who wriggled about like an eel at the mention of any of her numerous fancied admirers and the horrible upbringing of the grant children icy baths through the winter the fathers whip on occasion the dark closet and starvation for thirty whole hours till some detested spinach was eaten but we must leave a few lines for faultfindinga very few will suffice the typethat of the private issueis cramped and repellent a future edition should be in two volumes with a portrait if possible of mrs smith and with views of the doune thorley hall belugas c though not without interest the thirty pages on the tour in holland might perhaps be omitted and the sixty on india  but there should certainly be a few footnotes explanatory and sometimes corrective the northern meeting was started in 1788 not soon after 1797 the eothiemurchus spectre is a headless fiend whom to see is madness and to meet inexorable death the account of the sobieski brothers is ludicrously wrong alike by their own legend and by known facts certain books like the autobiography of mrs fletcher might here and there be cited with advantage a small hexameter on p 125 must be a misprint and  expletives is oddly misused on p 230 but what we should like best of all is a little more information about the writer of these 1 memoirs we admire them greatly but cannot feel certain we should have loved their author  memoirs of a highland lady the autobiography of elizabeth grant of kathie murehua 1797  1830 a highland lady edited by lady otracney jolin murray the grants of kothiemurchus are a younger branch of that great house of grant which by judicious obedience to the powers that were succeededin keeping their lands in the north at tunes when more hotheaded dans were disinherited rothiemurchus itself is a beautiful place among pine woods and the stock which dwelled there has always been a vigorous one giving many honest soldiers and less conspicuously honest lawyers to history this book is the autobiography of a lady of the house written many years latera sort of chronicle of youth and childhood and the doings of highland gentlefolk in england and at home in the faroff days of the early century the extraordinary thing about the chronicle is its entire simplicity one might compare it with the gossip of dorothy osborne or the memoirs of another highland lady of the same clan mrs grant of laggan who told the story of the princes arrival at gortuleg after culloden but it would be hard to parallel the unadorned veracity miss grant of rothiemurchus has no care for tiie figure she cuts in the readers eye she confesses to naive tastes in literature with absolute frankness she never affects interest or knowledge she does not possess and she is quite open with her dislikes in its way the ohronicleisa very intimate one for it tells the whole inner history of a respectably important family tells it too with no omission of darker scenes till one is fairly forced into a lively interest in the whole kin we hear of the early days in lincolns inn fields and of the holidays at wateringplaces then of the long years in the highlands varied with seasons in edinburgh and occasional jaunts further south and then at the last of the money troubles consequent upon an injudicious union of highland hospitality with political ambition of the indian judgeship for the father and of the marriage of the diarist when eliza grant takes final leave of us it is not easy to separate the purely literary qualities of the book from the extraneous interest of the matter the style is without art but direct vivid and at times fired with a genuine emotion parts might have been left put without hurting the book but as it was originally published for the family there is reason for its completeness but even as it stands there is a certain rough unity of effect in each part of the memoirs which is the product not of art but of a faithful memory by far the best are the rothiemurchus chapters but the early days in england were not without interest the children were brought up on a spartan planup at six cold water summer and winter and a breakfast of porridge but they were a set of little madcaps even in those primdays and were none the worse for the training the long journeys between the highlands and london gave food for childs fancy what impressed the small elizabeth in edinburgh was the  size and brightness and cleanliness of the houses and the quantity of gooseberries to be bought for a penny nowadays the houses are not particularly bright and clean and the present writer never found gooseberries cheaper there than elsewhere she meets lord lovat is much impressed and little wonder for he was the good man who persisted in believing himself a hen and sat hatching eggs by the hour in a nest which he had made in his carriage in 1810 she went with her sister to orford to stay with the master of university and a dreary place she found it  two facts struck me young as i was during our residence in oxford she writes  the ultra  tory politics and the stupidity and frivolity of the society she carried on a childs flirtation with a young gentleman who played the french horn and she was much shocked by young mr shelley  the ringleader in every species of mischief within our grave walls was mr shelley afterwards so celebrated though i should think to the end halfcrazy he was very insubordinate at university always infringing some rule the breaking of which he knew would not be overlooked he was slovenly in his dress and when spoken to about these and other irregularities he was in the habit of making such extraordinary gestures expressive of his humility under reproof as to overset first the gravity and then the temper of the tutor soon after the whole family retired to the highlands for good and the next few chapters give a very pleasant account of life at kothiemurchus where civilisation had not yet wholly driven away old customs on the way to the north the father read childe harold then newly out to the children   i was not given to poetry generally says the chronicler then as now it required  thoughts that rouse aud words that burn to affect me with aught but weariness but when after a second reading of this passage my father closed the pamphlet for a moment saying  thia is poetry i felt that he was right and resolved to look the whole poem over some day at leisure  the whole tale of the journey is excellently and freshly done and so too the account of the simple household and its retainers among them  old john mackintosh who brought in all the wood and peat for the fires pumped the water turned the mangle lighted the oven brewed the beer bottled the whiskey kept the yard tidy and stood enraptured listening to us playing on the harp like daavid  the grants were a remarkable clan for the cotters and foresters sons had a ueer habit of suddenly leaving home and generally getting somehow or other to india whence they returned generals and baronets and men of fortune nothing indeed in the whole book is so extra ordinary as the impression given of the vigour of these highland adventurers who rarely returned from the great world beyond the hills without some very substantial prize distinctions between classes too were not rigid in the north miss grant has a deep scorn of the english lower and middle classes but in scotland all are gentlefolka belief which probably originated in the clan feeling which bound the humblest grant to his chief  and certainly we find barefooted highland girls making great marriages and every social barrier turned topsyturvy there are many vivid little descriptions of scene and life in these pages for miss grant had a seeing eye and some skill in words take this of the highland kirk the girls had a custom in the springy of washing their beautiful hair with a decoction of the young buds of the birch trees i do not know if it improved or hurt the hair but it agreeably scented the kirk which at other times was wont to be overpowered by the combined odours of snuff ana peatreek for the men snuffed immensely during the delivery of the english sermon they fed their noses with quills fastened by strings to the lids of their mulls spooning up the snuff in quantities and without waste the old women snuffed too and groaned a great deal to express their mental sufferings their grief for all the blackslidings supposed to be thundered at from the pulpit lapses from faith was their grand selfaccusation lapses from virtue were alas little commented on temperance and chastity were not in the highland code of morality both in the highlands and in edinburgh where the family went in the season there was no lack of great folk to be seen across the river at kinrara the famous duchess of gordonthe friend of burnsentertained large house parties the writers comments on people are forcible and plainspoken she objected to lord tweeddale because he had that flat maitland face which when it once gets into a family never can be got out of it the account of the old edinburgh society is entertaining she classifies it into setsthe exclusive the cardplaying the quiet countrygentleman the fashionable and the

about whom she has many stories to tell and sir walter himself there is also a welldrawn portrait of canning whom she met in holland she is most fearless in confessing her opinions she confesses that she found waverley intolerably dull peter the great she thought only a  lunatic barbarian   coleridge whom she met at highgate is a poor mad poet who never held his tongue but stood pouring out a deluge of words meaning nothing with eyes on fire and his silver hair streaming down to his waist the chief thing that impressed her about edward irving was that he was  very dirty she is severe on the two sobieski stuarts and is highly scornful about their pedigree but one might say something on the other side her sister jane goes to abbotsford on a visit jane was in an ecstasy the whole time sir walter scott took to her as who would not p they rode together on two rough ponies with the ettrick shepherd and all the dogs and sir walter gave her all the border legends and she corrected his mistakes about the highlands we h ive left ourselves little space to quote any of miss grants stories the book is not all comedy for the account of the final parting from rothiemurchus has a pathetic simplicity which cannot fail to move the most casual reader but the prevailing tone is a cheerful one and we would take leave of the pleasant company by setting down two out of the many excellent tales  a coach was started by some enterprising person to run from the dukes arms at dunkeld to blair during the summer season the announcement read as follows pleasing intelligence the duchess of athol starts every morning from the  dukes arms at eight oclock the other is told of lord eldin  some one having died a man of birth and fortune in the west country celebrated in his life for drawing

york dix  edwards london low co shall we of the old world ever receive a report of the doings at salt lake city in which it will be reasonable to put our trust  deep as our interest is in any picture of the mormons at home and certain as the sale of any fair account of these strange people would be we have received nothing beyond surface views or wretched caricatures yet when the war closes finally we know scarcely any topic likely to engage the hearts of good and thoughtful sersons more deeply than this question of lormon life its moral nature its mode of action and its share of success the mormons  who are nearly to a man and woman of anglosaxon bloodhave departed from the midst of us and set up a new system in the depths of the wildernessshaking off our laws our customs our letters and our god these extraordinary people have made for themselves a new scheme of life based on new ideas all of them contrary to our oldworld wisdom and some of them most repugnant to our domestic instincts can the new scheme work  while the mormons were merely a theological sectliving by the light of those social laws which are common to all european nations they excited interest by their passions their tenacity and their despair but the interests of this world are stronger in many minds than the interests of the world to come our curiosity about the saints has deepened a thousand times since it became noised abroad that these people who only yesterday as it were sailed from our shores leaving mothers and sisters in the old land have returned in the depths of the american wilderness to the eastern system of many wives at first europe was incredulous on this subject of polygamy however wide its usage in the east however high its sanction in the past a home of many wives was thought to be repugnant to anglosaxon nature and was pronounced impossible with anglosaxon women doubts also aroseand some of those doubts remainas to the real meaning of the mormon act of  sealing  several women to one man wedlock in the common use of words cannot be always meant by this act as we hear of poor aged and decrepit females being sealed to young and prosperous mormon saints sealing may confer some very pleasant and very substantial earthly rights but its chief function as the people who practice it seem to believe is a spiritual one like baptism or confirmation it appears to be taught in the mormon churches that a woman cannot be saved unless she be first sealed to one of the mormon saints thus sealing becomes a needful sacrament in the mormon system the observance is an act of grace and a probation for heaven yet when the cases of spiritual wifehood are allowed for on a liberal scale the fact remains unquestioned and unquestionable that in salt latte city a great number of men of our race and blood nearly all who can afford the costdo marry several wiveslive with them in the old patriarchal fashionand have children by them according to the rights and usages of our old world ways it is a strange and an exciting fact to discover in the middle of the nineteenth century in the very centre of the territory of the great republic and among the least imaginative people in existence we want to know how this system works do the wives live in oriental union or do they quarrel like kilkenny cats  do the husbands live in peace in their western harems in health and freedom  are the homes clean and cosy the children well trained and obedient such questions occur to the mind even before the other and higher questions about faith and salvation but unhappily we have no answer at least none that we can trustto these deeplyexciting queries mrs ferris whose book we opened with expectation is evidently not a fair witness and her letters are four years old she had good opportunities she accompanied her husband who had received an appointment as united states secretary for utah to the salt lake city she remained in the valley of the salt lake six months living on familiar terms with the mormons both men and women but then she carried her foregone conclusions with her before she and her husband reached the mormon settlements she had condemned the mormons in her heart that mrs ferris who prides herself on having played the fine lady in the prairie is not a very philosophical observeris not very nice in her mannersis not very delicate in her feelings every page of this odd book bears witness but as she professes to state what she saw and heard among the mormons we must take her with her faults and make the best we can of her evidence with all its drawbacks of vanity inconsequence and ill taste here is a note written from salt lake which may serve very well as a keynote for our quotations  we have made one disagreeable discovery polygamy is not only practised but openly justified and advocated on religious grounds   wc are unquestionably in the midst of a society of fanatics who are controlled by a gang of licentious villains and it will require all our circumspection to get along smoothly   that we are closely watched i ain well persuaded the very day arter we arrived while wholly absorbed in reading the news from home i was suddenly startled by a pair or eyes glaring in at the west windowbelonging to amaliguant looking man who was engnged in training some vines on that side of the house of course he desisted when he found himself observed but i detected him afterwards repeating the same thing in a very furtive manner if this man has not committed murder it has been for want of opportunity nothing is ever proved against the poor vinetrainer he does his work and goes his way but he gets deeper and deeper in the ill opinion of his judge the lady at whose house mrs ferris had been good enough to take up her abode is judged after the same fashion as the vinedresser  mrs farnham is a good mormon in all points except that she is bitterly opposed to polygamy but this may be only pretence to render us unguarded she may after all be as much a spy upon us as the cutthroat who gazed in at the window as mrs ferris wisely sent her pretty criticisms on her new friends through the mormon postoffice to her friends in new york and elsewhere and probably uttered much smalltalk in the same lively style at mrs farnhams table the reader will scarcely feel surprised that the saints began to look shy at the fair judge of their misdeeds but the saints were not very reserved either if we may believe their censor  i find the women very conversable she says  we were treated with distinguished attention  the company generally seemed to exert themselves to make the evening pleasant to us she says on another occasion mrs ferris we are afraid was scarcely doing her best to make things pleasant to her hosts we proceed to show the reader mrs ferriss view of a mormon home  on the opposite side of the way directly west of us in a small adobe house resides phineas young a brother of the governor familiarly known however by the uncomplimentary designation of old phin this man called soon after our arrival and manifested a disposition to treat us with civility i learned from mrs farnham that he had had 6ome seven or eight wives that his first or real wife still lives in the states and that the others had all left him but one whether he had been reduced to this low number by necessity or inclination i do not know i further learntd that the present mrs phin desired to make my acquaintance so an evening was appointed and thiy both called we found him very sociable with much general information and full of anecdote of the roving life to which all thc mormons have been more or uss subjected isle had a great deal to say of gentile persecutionsa theme which i find them ready enough to talk about among other things he gave us a history of the privations to which those saints were subject who were the pioneers in the valley it seems they were driven nearly to the point of starvation and had to dig seejo roots  a root extensively used by the indians from which they have received the name of diggers he gave quite a graphic description of the destruction which threatened their first crops by the ravages of an ugly cricket until the ravagers were in turn destroyed by flocks of white gulls which came over the mountain topsa thing which he assured us had never before been seen mr f asked him where they came from that he said was a mysteryhe did not doubt they were created for the occasion the man is a jesuit after all while marvelling about these mysterious gulls i could see him slyly watching the effect the narrative might have upon his audience i found time to have some side chat with mrs phin and learned she had been previously married to a man by the name of canfield nnd that she had persuaded him to take her sister to whom the was much attached as his second wife thinking they could get along harmoniously canfield finally concluded that two were not enough and took in a third and then abused the two sisters isle then went off to californin searching for gold and came back emptyhanded upon which she left him and took refuge under the shadow of  old phin such is the substance of the story told by the woman herself leaving discreetly untold no doubt the most salient points of her history we have charitably supplied the italics being unwilling to allow the most careless reader to escape the proofs of mrs ferriss good taste and feminine acuteness another great personage among the mormons to whom we are introduced is elder snow  isle resides

coffee for the rest of the bevy the latest acquisition to this highlyfavoured household and of course the reigning sultana for the time was the only one of them with whom he condescended to correspond during his absence her education however had not attained the dignity of an ability to read and either because the other inmates of the harem were in like predicament or that she was uni willing they should see these loving epistles she took them to the neighbours to bo translated like all other mormon missionaries he was a beggar and i thc story is that he has been so successful in his mendicity that the cottages are to give place to a large adobe mansion which will make a more convenient seraglio such is elder snow and yet he could talk about the works of art in rome and paris with some apparent appreciation of their beauties like our other visitors he expressed a wish that our sojourn might be rendered agreeable but not a word of invitation to visit his family or that his wife would be happy to see me really we feel for mrs ferris she wished to see the ladies of the snow family in order to abuse to mock and to spit upon themand the elder who possibly saw as deeply into the ladys purpose as she saw into his character refrained from asking her to his home it was very provoking  ol when she gets a chance however with the mormon women we do mrs ferric the justice to say that she

oracle said  she was only sealed for the sake of salvation she further informed me that brigham had more wives in this way than anybody knew ofthat he did not even i know himself the sealing to him being considered a  more certain guarantee for salvation because he was i the reigning prophet and was sure to remain faithful  one scarcely knows whether to be amazed most at though profane profligacy of the leaders or the super stitiotis credulity of their dupes the effect of the  mormon creed is evidently to gather together a low class of villains and a still lower class of dupes nnd it follows that the latter are easily governed though only disturbing element is that the viii dns may quarrel among themselves and so far as i can learn this has happened on more than one occasion  a further effect will probably be to operate as a j botany bay to society generally by relieving it of j its superabundance of both classes i among the pleasant people to be met with at salt lake was

j of mormon female portraits and the reader will t  f  smile after the scornful closing of the above   passage to seethe sort of girl who had been   i made a fool of hy the saint speaking of the   i elderly lady from old salem and the young  i lady with  good taste in dress mrs ferris  j goes on rousing her virtuous indignation until   i it is assuaged by a small act of politeness j f j  if thc worthy marshal had stopped here i could e  tolerate him very well considering we are sojourners   in thc mormon capital but lie has still another wife and i learn from my universal referee that in the states she was one of the strong mindediu fine n pseudolecturer on progressivismwho was so fully persuaded that womankind were in a false position that sdie has ended in making herself what she t i is the marshal keeps her and her baby on his   farming establishment in juab about eighty miles t i from herc isle spends six weeks of his time there and then the same time with his family here and so alternates between the two today he has been in partly on business nnd partly to make a friendly call and i felt disposed to be hateful towards him but he appeared so cordial and friendly and gave us such warm and pressing invitations to visit his family differing in this respect from the rest of these vagabonds that he partially succeeded in disarming resentment mrs ferris went to the homes of the mormons and to their public parties as we think few of our readers have ever assisted at a mormon evening party we are tempted with their consent to introduce them into the charmed circle of the saints  we went sufficiently late not to be among the first arrivals and were ushered into an anteroom to be divested of cloaks and shawls from this a short flight of steps brought us into a long saloon where six cotillions were in active motion another short flight lauded us on a raised platform which overlooked the dancingparty and here a band of music were in thc full tide of performance this dais was well accommodated with seats including two or three sofas on which were elders and apostles reclining with a few of their concubines brigham was there and had his hat on according to his usual habit we were treated with distinguished attention the company generally seemed to exert themselves to make the evening pleasant to us our old acquaintance judge snow was there with mrs s his only wife and i took advantage of our familiar footing with both to inquire out all the peculiarities of the evening elder kimble one of the chief 1 men was present and very sociable he has a  harem numbering some twentyfive or thirty but j strange to say has continued to treat his real wife 1 so thc story goes as superior to the rest she was  at his right hand on the present occasion and looked careworn and sad  on his left was one of his sealed  ones a keen shrewdlooking woman from phila delphia and who in the few words of conversation i had with her evinced some intelligence near them j sat a delicate woman with raven hair and piercing  black eyes who proved to be eliza snow the  mormon poetess and who belongs to brighams harem polygamy cannot be a subject calculated to protluce pottic inspirationat least the effusions  which appear under her name in the deseret news would scare the muses out of their senses i found i mrs orson hyde a pleasant woman of much simplicity of manners and to her husbands credit bc it said ho lives with her alone although one of the twelve apostles another of the twelve amasa lyman was pointed out a man of grossly sensual appearance this man lives in san bernardino and has a straggling harem extending at convenient 1 points from that place to salt lake he collects the 1 tithings in california and is constantly going back  and forth a heavy darkcoloured beetlebrowed  man was pointed out as elder john taylor who had been badly wounded when the prophet was murdered  in illinois isle had his wile on one arm on the l other was a young widow from tennessee reputed to be wealthy and reputed also to have been lately  sealed to this pious elder the cotillions upon the i floor when we went in were soon danced out and the i  dancers came crowding upon the platformand here  i happened what seemed to me the crowning incident  i of the evening parley pratt marched up with four j wives and introduced them successively as mrs  j pratts the thing was done with such an easy 1  nonchalant air that i had difficulty in keeping from  laughing outright the thought came over me with   what scorn these people who are here first and i foremost would be banished from society at home i  did the man do this to show what he could do or i because lie thought politeness required it of him  j i dont know some however only introduced the first wife and i internally thanked them for the forbearance one thing was peculiarit was only the first wives that tried to make themselves familiar with me dancing continued fast and furious till a late hour each man danced with two women at a time and took the lead in all the chassis promenades so it seems that even in their amusements women take a subordinate position these passages will amuse the reader they are fresh and feminine and we are sorry that we cannot treat the volume from which we draw them as a serious book now that peace has returned to europe perhaps some vivid and vivacious

wife to put herself t to the trouble of preparing a supplementary volume and even the promise of revelations upon the exciting topic of polygamy scarcely disposes us to approach these pages with any other feeling than that of suspicion that tile publication of the book is dictated rather by womanly vanity than a real desire to supply any useful information however as everything respecting that interesting people possesses very great interest in our eyes we lhave carefully perused mrs ferriss journal in the hope of picking up one or two facts about tie mormons with which we were not previously familiar the party headed by lieutenant ferris started from st louis up the missouri on the 12th of august 1852 landing at fort wayne they proceeded to independanec and in a very few days were journeying westward across  the plains by the middle of october they begin to hear sometiling about the m1ormons we lave heard some not very encouraging stories about the mormons it is said tiev do reall plracticee polygamy and some of the traders we meet express regret that mr f has brought his wife along fearing it may lay the foumidation for the same difficulties that occurred with the former officers the story is that the wife of the frmer secretary was invited to a house where there were six women with young babies all belonging to one husband and that she took offence at it i

lancshire house who had fought on behalf of religious liberty in the low countries before he left leyden with the puritans though he never joined their church he was the staunch iend and sworn defender of that little band of heroic men and women who landed from the may flower in now egland in the year 1620 as the best linguist among the pirim squalified to treat with the indians and s the bet soldier he took the command in their expeditions  his capital exploit s the old chronicle terms it was the salvation of the planters at weymouth from extermination the hostility of the india had been provoked by the injustice of some greedy london adventurers who were striving to monopolise the advantages of the fur trade the colony was saved by the wiadom and courage of miles standish he died in 1656 at the age of seventytwo he was twice married and the tradition has been handed down that some time after the death of his first wife he employed the friendly services of one john alden to pay court in his name to a fair lady who however fell in love with his ambassador and priscilla mullins became the wife of john alden that courtship is the subject of professor longfellows new poem which tells how a brave and passionate campaigner the captaiu of plymouth read julius cmi3ar while his friend the fairhaired scholar and lover hiding the secret of his own heart went forth vainly to plead the cause of miles standish with the puritan maiden priscilla so through the plymouth woods john alden went on his errand came to an open space and saw the disc of the ocean sailless sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east wind saw the newbuilt house and people at work in a meadow heard as he drew near the door the musical voice of priscilla ainging the hundredth psalm the grand old puritan anthem music that luther sang to the sacred words of the psalmist full of the breath of the lord consoling and comforting many then as he opened the door he beheld the form of the maiden seated beside her wheel and the carded wool like a snowdrift piled at her knee her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle while with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion open wide on her lap lay the wellworn psalmbook of ainsworth printed in amsterdam the words and the music together roughhewn angular notes like stones in the wall of a churchyard darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses such was the book from whose pages she sang the old puritan anthem she the puritan girl in the solitude of the forest making the humble house and the modest apparel of homespun beautiful with her beauty and rich with the wealth of her being so he entered the house and the hum of the wheel and the singing suddenly ceased for priscilla aroused by his step on the threshold rose as he entered and gave him her hand in signal of welcome saying  i knew it was you when i heard your step in the passage for i was thinking of you as i sat there singing and spinning awkward and dumb with delight that a thought of him had been migled thus in the ad psalm that came from the heart of the maiden silent before her he stood and gave her the flowers for an answer fidin no words for his thought he remembered that day in the winter after the first great snow when he broke a path from the village reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house and laughed at his snowy locks and gave him a seat by the fireside grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snowstorm had he but spoken then perhaps not in vain had he spoken now it was all too late  the golden moment had vanished so he stood there abashed and gave her the flowers for an answer john alden did his duty by his friend but as he warmed and glowed in his simple and eloquent language quite forgetful of self and full of the praise of his rival archly the maiden smiled and with eyes overruning with laughter said in a tremulous voice  why dont you speak for yourself john  0 here was for the true heart of the puritan youth temptation of satan he plunged into the wood he saw the mayflower at anchor  rocked on the rising tide 1 and ready to ail on the morrow there was the  hand  of the lord he would put satan behind him  back will i go oer the ocean this dreary land will abandon her whom i may not love and him whom my heart has offended better to be inmy grave in the green old churchyard in england clos by my mothers side and among the dust of my kindred better be dead and forgotten than living in shame and dishonor sacred and safe and unseen in the dark of the narrow chamber with me my secret shall lie like a buried jewel that glimmers bright on the hand that is dust in the chambers of silence and darknesyes as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter the redoubtable captain of plymouth choked with rage when john alden faithfully repeating all that bad been said came to the last words in his story but in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway bringing in uttermost haste a mesaa of urgent importance rumours of dangerand war and hostile incursions of indians straightway the captain paused and without further question or parley took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron buckled the belt round his waist and frownig fiercely departed alden was left alone he heard the clank of the scabbard growing fainter and fainter and dying aa in the distance then heg roes from his seat and looked forth into the darkness felt the cool air blow on his cheek that was hot with the insult lifted his eyes to the heavens and folding his hands as in childhood prayed in the silence of night to the father who seeth in seret meanwhile the choleric captain strode wrathful away to the council found it already emblez  impatiently waiting his coming len in the middle of life austere and grave in deportment only one of them old the hill that was

contemptuous jrking the indian arows he filled it with powder and bullets full to the very jaws and handed it back to the savage syis in thundering tones  here take it this is your answer silen y out of the room then glided the glistening savage bearing the serpents skin and seeming hmuself like a serpent winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest the captain marched and the mayflower sailed but john alden did not return home in her for as he stood with one foot upon her boat he saw priscilla fixed were her eyes upon his as if she divined his intention fixed with a look so sad so reproachful imploring and patient that with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose as from the verge of a crag where one step more is destruction strange is the heart of man with its quick mysterious instincts strange is the life of man and fatal or fated are moments whereupon turn as on hinges the gates of the wall adamantine 0 strong hearts and true not one went back in the mayflowerlong in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel much endeared to them all as something living and human then as if filled with the spirit and wrapped in a vision prophetic baring his hoary head the excellent elder of plymouth said  let us pray  and they prayed and thanked the lord and took couae mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock and above them bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death and their kindred seemed to awake in their graves and to join in the prayer that they1 uttered sun illumined and white on the eastern verge of the ocean gleamed the departing sail like a marble slab in a graveyard buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping lo  as they turned to depart they saw the form of an indian watching tem from the mhul but while they spake with each other pointing with outstretched hands and saying look he had vanished between the puritan youth and the puritan maid a little talk in the crowd followed they went home as friends together and he on the way told her his own despair and the direful wrath of miles standish whereat the maiden smiled and said between laughing and earnest  he is a little chimney and heated hot in a moment  but as he gently rebuked her and told her how much he had sufferedhow he had even determined to sail that day in the may flower and had remained for her sake on hearing the dangers that threatenedall her manner was changed and she said with a faltering accent  truly i thank you for this how good you have been to me always  thus as a pilgrim devout who toward jerusalem journeys taking three steps in advance and one reluctantly backward urged by importunate zeal and withheld by pangs of contrition slowly but steadily onyw  receding yet ever advancing journeyed this puritan youth to the holy land of his longings urged by the fervour of love and withheld by remorseful misgivings it is easy to divine the journeys end for this couple of simple and singlehearted lovers miles standish coming into an ambush fought a battle with the indians in which the chief fell with both hands clutching the greensward seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers false tidings of the death of the stout captain came to priscilla at her spinningwbeel while she was winding a skein from john aldens hands there was an end then of the tangle in their lives nevertheless the captain of plymouth as one restored from the grave stood in hist armour at the church door on their weddingday a willing and a welcome guest the bride was mounted on her husbands snowwhite steer nay she should ride like a queen not plod along like a peasant somewhat alarmed at first but reassured by the others placing her hand on the cushion her foot in the hand of her husband gayly with joyous laugh priscilla mounted her palfrey i nothing is wanting now he said with a smile  but the distaff then you would be in truth my queen my beautiful bertha  onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation i happy husband and wife and friends conversing together t pleasantly murmured the brook as they crowed the ford in the foresta pleased with the image that passed like a dream of love through its bosom tremulous floating in air oer the depths of the azure abysses t dovthrough the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors gleafing on purple grapes that from branches above them sus v pended 1 mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the fir t tree wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of eshcol an like a

in the name f of hexameter sing song and relies for effect almost wholly  on the fixed position of the two last accents in each line accords well with the spirit of the poem english verse depends so entirely upon accent that professor longfellow has no reon to concern himself though it be hexameter he writes about the length of syllables who can tell for emple why in a line like this merrily sang the birds and the tender voices of women il the definite article is now a long syllable in a spondee and in the very next foot a short syllable in a dactyl coneorated with hymns the common care of the hoeholdin the line nxt following the same article dogs double ro r in the sm way e bglish hemet can only be at the bat a batrd metre written with dangerous aility and very boo metal upon which to stamp the superscription of a poet yet let us own that it is well apted to the purpose of professor longfellow who writes not for the few but for the many and whose power over a vast army of readers lies in the steadiness with which he abides by the level of the weaker wit giving the charm of his own refined taste to commonplace reflection he never ventures upon thought of which the perfect meaning is not obvious to all men of ordinary apprehension he is glad to escape from the intricacies into which he might be led by a too perfect crystallisation of his verse and in a singsong that permits the utmost easiness of expression he can walk at the level of all ordinary thoughts and cares using the homeliest words when it so pleases him and using them with the rae tact of a true poet for the same reason this poem of miles standish like other of professor longfellows works abounds in iteration words or thoughts on which he would have us dwell recur lines are repeated as they were by the old ballad writers who had a rude audience to sing to and took good care not to puzzle them or let them over look in any portion of its course the main thread of their story the rhetorical artifice derives its beauty from the clearness with which it tends to lay open the heanr of any subject to the meanest apprehension it is this poets evident determination never to write what shall be caviare to the multitude all men can feel but few can think all men can assent gladly to what they know to be a truth and there are high truths known of all familiarly and current through the language of the people in a stream of acceptable commonplaces professor longfellow asks for no new effort of thought he takes the good he finds upon the common way and makes its beauty visible if it be a defect in him to possess little of the subtlety that has distinguished the worlds greatest poets we may say that he owes to that defect some part of his great popularity but from the weaker men who

possibly furnish as indeed they have furnished metrical occasion to a witty countryman for two admirable parodies all this might happen and yet mr i longfellows poetry be really appreciated to the best of our ability we have endeavoured to appreciate him and in that endeavour have taken up as he bids us  with a heart for every fate successive pieces of his we have more than once tried to extricate the plot of  the spanish student to unravel the intention  of the golden legend and to feel satisfied j with the treatment of evangelinebut in all these poems we have constantly felt that we were  not achieving but pursuing and that no reasonable versifier ought to ask his critics or even his readers from time to time to  learn to labour and to wait the burden which the previous sorrows of mr longfellow laid upon us was really as great as we could bear under the addition of the last volume slight though it be the most benevolent reader however well disposed towards sorrow will timi it difficult to acquiesce judging from his poems our conception of mr longfellow for some time has been that he is an invalid poet who is morbidly partial to what has been called  the nightside of nature it is his fantastic pleasure to lie upon a bed of faded roses which are tinged by the illusive light of a very watery moon  within his breast he informs us  there is re no light but the cold light of stars syste lc matically and apparently from poetic principle tl he avoids everything of a cheerful and en it couraging tone listening only for  voices of tithe night for  inuftied drums beating funeral of marches for the footsteps of weak ghosts which co seem doomed to walk the earth and make an tin appearance when summoned for the purposes ob of poetry with more of sorrow than of anger pr these unsubstantial creatures regard the pale afl poetlay their cold hands upon his or lean he upon his cold shoulder or patiently sit to be yo photographed in vacant chairs which his iniagi  1 i nation has provided a muse in deep mourn st  ing is in constant attendance upon himprompt fri 1 ing his memory with images of the past and ca  reflections of a peculiarly sepulchral or mori in bund or lachrymose kind there is in his st immediate fancy either a chapel or a cloister fo  which he employs not for any specific religious ca  office but as an interesting object or motive to ai 1 sentiment hence he has the unusual luxury p 1 of hearing a bell tolling at intervalshe imagines friars chanting  solemn masses singing a  pray for this poor soul and is enabled  to ly suffer and be strong more especially how ai  ever it is  from the cool cisterns of the mid a night air his spirit draws repose at the d i dead hour of night he goes out in the world di  and listens to the chimes or the clocks tolling n  that ghostbeloved hour his favourite station tc is a bridge which suggests to him a long train li 1 of unhappy calculation how many unhappy a persons may have crossed that bridge  each h bearing his burden of sorrow there is no satis i factory proof but a description of his own i feelings repeated interjections a few wavering c shadows with a broken imageof course of n  moonlightenable him to extend this thought  to the length of fifteen stanzas and make up r what we suppose we must call a poem  i if the world of things into which mr i longfellow misleads us is pale and cold c   and ghastly full of ruins of fires and graves   and wrecksor a world of feeble twilight i  where the embracing sunbeams chastely play t  equally dismal is his world of persons the 1  principal tendency of his poems is to make his   characters fall in love  and the issue to actor   and reader is invariable disappointment weak   love and romantic patience are the agents  i  which mr longfellow chiefly employs in this   service for hearts and souls in lamentable    attitudes and under inconceivably painful cir i j cunistances he solicits public emotionfor i a nameless  struggling hearts  weary souls  e and sometimes even for  a poor barefooted soul y bleeding over the shards and thorns of existe euee in the poem of  evangeline he ree niorselessly heaps upon his characters the ii  threefold distress of mind body or estate tl j which every sensible person prays to be preii served from evangeline when not swooning e or under the influence of moonlight is a pero petual example of distress of mind and bener diet bellefontaine the poor young ladys father o is in his last stage a sad instance of distress ie both of body and estate why all this wretchn edness should be thought requisite the reader h  at first is at a loss to understand when how it i ever persevering with the poem he begins to ll discover that mr longor to borrow a witty to j and truer name mr  protractedfellow has u  ordained this distress for the sake of a subsc fis quent piece of description or as the vehicle for  ly one or two exceedingly moral speeches the le reader feels that he has been very unworthily ie even allowing that he has been poetically ij practised upon n nor do the exhortations to calmness and resignation which are so plentiful in mr longfellow make us other than lugubrious they are uttered in so melancholy a tone that it is quite impossible for the reader to believe they are meant when the old priest by way of consoling evangeline for the unaccountable conduct of her lover informs the young lady that  affection never is wasted it is quite obvious that his meaning is and the event proves that she should continue to waste her affection which the poor girl like too many of her sex deluded unhappily does that odd youth too whose brow is sad and whose  blue eye beneath are we correct in understanding his eyelid flashes like a falchion from its sheathwho for no apparent reason carries a banner with a strange device utters in a very weak way through a number of stanzas rather bad latin and ultimately is found  lifeless yet serene in the twilight can he be considered by any sensible reader as anything but a very sad and most unfortunate poetical instance   the psalm of life which the heart of an t american young juan is supposed to be capable of repeating to the psalmist cannot with any justice be called an encouraging poem allusions to deith dust the grave muffled drums funeral marches soldiers perishing the dead past burying its dead and shipwrecked mariners are in our opinion images calculated to deter any reader from a desire to make his life in the least sublime and to leave so dismal a world as rapidly as he can never troubling himself as to his footprints in fact mr longfellows admonitions remind us of mr snodgrasss entreaties to his seconds dont call in the police said mr snodgrass  promise me you wont of course not replied mr tupnian dont despair from reading my poems exclaims mr longfellow to his readers  of course not replies the reader it is in its feeble fftoc rather than in its forms or metres that the vice of mr longfellows poetry lies these last are pretty imitations  but never can be mistaken for the original types of tegner goethe heine or chamisso t indeed if we compare the moonlight scenes of s evangeline with the truthful daylight pictures  of the  herman and dorothea or auerbachs  delicious barflissieif we set the golden  legend bv chaniissos poem or with goethes i faustthe building of the ship beside  the lay of the bellthe ballads by those  of heinethe difference between a composition i and an originalbetween reality and fantasy  is painfully evident  mr longfellow is not one of the poets in  whom gods or men can take much pleasure  our principal objection to him is that he is so a unobjectionable a writer his poems do not  stir exalt and strengthen us they only make  men continually passiveand women continually sr resignedwe do not believe in his vapoury  elysium and cannot reduce our imagination to  the level of his earth i not for men however does the american  poet gracefully rise and take down his shal dowy harp from the willows he is especially ir the young ladies poet for them to an old  german or swedish tune he adapts his melody o yet we doubt if even his most enamoured y readers will feel what mr longfellow calls is  the spell of glamour in consequence of the c present performance  evangeline with all ir i its faults was not wanting in a certain underle glow of poetic light  hiawatha to a certain extent might be pronounced poetical and by the aid of music it was possible to acquire a taste even for  a rainy day and one or two of the smaller poems how the author could be so careless of his reputation as to put forth n the greater part of the poetry which makes up fr this last volume we cannot at all understand d sad though it bc to think it has been written w it is sadder to know that it has been published e and must be reviewed w yet mr longfellow in some degree relieves  h us of a disagreeable duty by pleading guilty and a pronouncing judgement upon himself a mun  ber of classical and modern examples were  before him  full of promptings and sugges s tiona he recalls a suggestion t of prometheus how undaunted  on olympuss shining bastions j  his audacious foot he planted subsequently there occurs to him the fate  of r milton and cervantes  t natures priests and ru1ante i by affliction touched and saddened a very natural question then presents itself j to the poetnamely this what is the use of perseverance in the art of poetry the occupation being laborious and the end in a worldly point of view too frequently ignominious  mr longfellow asks j shall it then be unavailing all this toil for human culture   the only rhynie which echo could produce l in reply would be sepulture or the one mr  fc longfellow has chosen j  oer lifes barren crags the  ulture   the vulture of course meaning the critic  through the cloudrack dark and trailing  seen above the poet sailing j j an afterthought changes the image but presents us with the same result contrasting  very sadly mr longfellows earlier and his   later periods   fair they seemed those songs sonorous when they came to mo unbidden  voices single and in chorus like the wild birds siikinj oer us in the dark of brunches hidden disenchantment idsillusion  must each noble aspiration come at last to this conclusion jarring discord wild confusion lassitude renunciation  sot with steelier fall nor faster from the suns so re nu dominions not through brighter realms nor vaster in swift ruin and disaster icarus fell with shattered pinions  the poem upon which in our vulturine capacity the author no doubt expects us to poetivorously write is entitled  the courtship of miles standish and displays mr longfellows method of debasing a fine old hero and diluting an historical fact in the hands of a true poet the deeds of that resolute little band which miles standish commanded and out of which grew all that is great and admirable in the american people might form a worthy subject for a drama or an epic the sailing of the mayflower and the lauding of the pilgrim fathers are events surely far greater in results and better capable of being poetized than the sailing of the argo or the wanderings of ulysses all that the genius of mr longfellow can elicit from them is matter for an exceedingly weak and protracted lovestory how capt miles standish the stalwart being left a widower  weary and dreary foll in love with an angel whose name is priscilla but whose surname we do not know how he was rejected and how he ultimately forgave is fully related ia hexameter verse the opening lines of though poem introduce capt miles in boots of cordovan leather buried in thought with his hands behind him and striding to and fro  with a martial air his personal appearance is thus given short of stature he was but strongly built and athlete brown as a nut was his face but his russet bearii was already flaked with patchesof snovn3hdjei wiiojiiiiei in november near the captain is  seated john alden his friend and household companion writing with delight and speed at a table of pine by the window the mayflower in fact is to sail for england on thc following day and john is writing against time the captain interrupts his friend from tune to time by calling his attention to his armour  john however i answered but looked not up from his writing the captain persisted in conversation de scribing what could be seen from the window there aro my soldiers my great invincible army i twelve men all equipped having each his rest and his i matchlock i eighteen shillings a month together with diet and pillage after informing his friends that he was quite j ready for the indians and  the sooner they j try it the better capt miles standish is    silent and at last takes down from a shelf of books  the commentaries of ciesar out of the j latin translated by arthur golding of lon j don all is then silent except  the hurrying  pen of the stripling after john alden had  folded the last of his letters capt standish i relieves his heart by a communication as  follows tis not good for a man to be alone say the scriptures this i have said before and again and again i repeat it  every hour in the day i think it and feel it and say it since rose standish died my life has been weary and  dreary i sick at heart have i been beyond the healing of friendship  oft in my lonely hours have i thought of the maiden i priscilla  she is alone in the world her father and mother and brother  died in the winter together  i saw her going and coming i now to the grave of the dead and now to the bed of thu   dying patient courageous and strong and said to myself that i if ever   there were angels on earth as there are angels in heaven two have i seen and known and the angel whose name is priscilla holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned long have i cherished the thought but never have dared  to reveal it j being a coward in this though valiant enough for the most part go to the damsel priscilla the loveliest malden of riv mouth say that a blunt old captain a man not of words but of actions offers his hand and his heart the hand and heart of a soldier sot in these words you know but this in short is my meaning i am a maker of war and not a maker of phrases the reason of his not making the proposal in proprid persona the captain thus explains i can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender  but march up to a woman with such a proposal i dare not  j im not afraid of bullets nor shot from the mouth of a   cannon  i but of a thundering no pointblank from the mouth  i of a woman  1 i that i confess im afraid of nor am i ashamed to confess  1  it   now john alden is in lovewithpriscilla him self and as he passes into the woods where bluebirds and robins were building towns in the  populous treeshe has a conflict with himself friendship however gains the day and he j pleads the cause of his friend the maiden asks very naturally why the captain sends an  ambassador at all i i then john alden began explaining and smoothing the matter  making it worse as he went by saying the captain was busy had no time for such thingssuch things the words grating harshly fell on the ear of priscilla and swift as a flash she made answer  has he no time for such things as you call it before he is married would he be likely to find it or make it after the wedding  that is the way with you men  you dont understand us you cannot the ambassador argues that the captain is of good family and gives his name and address he was a gentleman born could trace his pedigree plainly back to hugh standish of duxbury hall in lancashire england who was the son of ralph and the grandson of thurston de standish a young lady might think him undersized but he was not to be laughed at and scorned because he was little of stature for he was great of heart magnanimous courtly courageous it might have been expected such  simple and eloquent language would have melted the heart of any one but priscilla miss priscilla but smiled and as described in the poem said fair reader just guess why dont you speak for yourself john  mr longfellows previous poems have been objected to on the score of being wanting in passion  the courtship of miles standish is not chargeable with this fault miles is in a terrible passion up leapt the captain of plymouth and stamped on the floor till his armour clanged on the wall where it hung with a sound of sinister omen all his pentup wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion even as a handgrenade that scatters destruction around it wildly he shouted and loud john alden you have betrayed me  me miles standish your friend have supplanted defrauded betrayed me  one of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of wat tyler  who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor  yours is the greater treason for yours is a treason to friendship  you who lived under my roof whom i cherished and loved as a brother you who have fed at my board and drunk at my cup to whose keeping i have entrusted my honour my thoughts the most sacred and secret you too brutus  ah woe to the name of friendship hereafter  brutus was caesars friend and you were minc but henceforward let there be nothing between us save war and implacable 1 hatred miles at first determines to leave the country as all rejected lovers do the scene is one of the best described in the poem  there with his boat was the master already a little impatient lest he should lose the tide or though wind might shift to the eastward squarebuilt hearty and strong with an odour of ocean about him speaking with this one and that and cramming letters and parcels into his pockets capacious and messages mingled together into his narrow brain till at last he was wholly bewildered nearer the boat stood alden with one foot placed on the gunwale one still firm on the rock and talking nt times with the sailors seated erect on the thwarts all ready and eager for starting he too was eager to go and thus put an end to his anguish  thinking to fly from despair that swifter than keel is or canvas thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him but as he gazed on the crowd he beheld the form of  priscilla standing dejected among them unconscious of all that was  passing  fixed were her eyes upon his as if she divined his intention fixed with a look so sad so reproachful imploring and i patient  that with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose 1 as from the verge of a crag where one step more is i destruction  strange is the heart of man with its quick mysterious i instincts i strange is the life of man and fatal or fated are moments i whereupon tum as on hinges the gates of the wall i adamantine second thoughts and the sight of a remarkj able cloud in the sky which  rolls itself up as  a fist determine miles to remain for priscillas sake the poem ends with the wedding of priscilla and john and exhibits miles in a very forgiving light there is just one line in the poem which is pretty flowers are called children lost in the woods and covered with leaves in their slumber the smaller poems are not striking many of them have appeared before the author well terms them  birds of passage the two best are the poem of  the two angels which has one fine line the sombre houses hearsed with plumes of smoke and the ropewalk part of which we give in that building long and low with its windows all arow like the portholes of a hulk human spiders spin and spin backward down their thread so thin dropping each a hempen bulk at the end an open door squares of sunshine on the floor light the long and dusky lane  and the whirring of a wheel dull and drowsy makes me feel all its spokes are in my brain as the spinners to the end downward go and reascend gleam the long threads in the sun while within this brain of mine cobwebs brighter and more tine by the busy wheel are spun two fair maidens in a swing like white doves upon the wing first before my vision pass  laughing as their gentle hands closely clasp the twisted strands at their shadow on the grass then a booth of mountebanks with its smell of tan and planks and a girl poised high in air on a cord in spangled dress with a faded loveliness and a weary look of care then a homestead among farms and a woman with bare arms drawing water from a well as the bucket mounts apace with it mounts her own fair face as at some magicians spell the ballad of victor galbraith is bold and ringing and  santa filomena or  santa philomena a poem on miss nightingale is rather pretty the remainder of these poems are only as the author describes them thoughts in attitudes imperious voices soft and deep and serious repetitions in fact of poetical common place,juvenile_contra

B6393,"['4974176', '6168872', '4416964', '9031648']",  fiction i passages in the life of mrs magiaret maitland of i sunnyside written by herself in 3 vols london colburn 1849 tins is of a class of novels which we hold in great esteemwhose purpose is the quiet gradual and natural development of a domestic drama such as might be played at any time in any country town within the four seas we have little regard for the spasmodic romances which strain after a new excitement in every chapter and to maintain the readers curiosity are compelled to make each one more outrageous than its predecessor such tales as that betorc us are better calculated to make a permanent impression upon the memory while they are far more wholesome entertainment than the class of which they are antipodes galt is manifestly our authoresss model and the only fault we have to find with her is that she has been too faithful to her teacher and has not sufficiently trusted to her own indubitable powers which would have enabled her had she dared to be original like most imnitators of a style she has copied not alone the excellences but the detects also of her model and the former she has somewhat weakened by over elaboration one of the most remarkable characteristics of galt was a terseness of expression which enabled him to throw a 1rge thought into a small sentence so that frequently he was almost epigrammatic now the authoress of them passages has not this faculty of condensation and so while closely adhering to the cast of thought which made galt so dear to his readers she puts it into many more words hence it would have been better for her fame if she had compressed this novel into two volumes as well she might have done the incidents not being very numerous may we hope that in her next endeavour she will remember that it is no longer essential to a novel that it should fill exactly three volumes it may be one or two or three or four according to the actual necessities of the plot the passages in the life of mrs margaret maitland display an uncommon insight into character and unusual power in its portraiture the development of that of the supposed narrator witl whom we contract an acquaintance gradually and learn to know better every day just as with friends in real life is a masterpiece the maiden gentlewoman is here exhibited to us as she is more often found in the world than in the pages of fictions a good kind unselfish selfsacriticing being living to serve others and finding her happiness in that service there is in her no one peculiarity or oddity but yet he stands out in the memory as distinctly individualised as if she bad been one of the beings whom we had ipersonally known and loved and not a mere shadow conjured by the fancy of a novelist the dominic is another reality of the same race as scorrs but how different in species so it is with many of the others of the mystery that makes the plot of this novel we will not dropl a hint save that there is an appearance and a disappearalcle and a revelation all profoundly interesting which must be sought in the volumes themselves it is riot perhaps a work that will satisfy the circulating library cormorant whose jaded appetite seeks some stirnulara of strangeness or horror but it will charm the donmestic circle gathered round the christmas fireside arid moreover will be to them a right wholesome entertainment for its teachings and its morals are perfect we regret only that it should be so very scotch we cannot afford more than one passage as a specimen t of the style though we might

london lawyerasked the vicar of little millbrook to recommend him a neat wellconducted maiden of good person and address to do the lighter duties of his house he recommended jessie uart and in the

active girl like jessie hart did all a footmans work for half thc money with half the noise and looked a hundred times prettier whilst doing it this indeed was the worst part of the matter she looked a great deal too piquante her light figureher slender waisther small handsher elastic stepher graceful carriagewere all so pleasant and attractive that it was difficult not to follow her with your eyes as she moved about the room doing her spiriting gently and with a ready cheerfulness which made you feel that it was no taskwork to her there was something too very open in her manner she waa not forward or immodest but there was a dangerous kind of unreserve about her which might have been misunderstood it was in reality nothing but frankness and cordialitybut with people less singleminded than herself it placed ber at a disadvantage andit ruined ber at last how mr arnold may tell it has been necessary that i should write this much in explanation to render intelligible what fell from the good mans lips he asked me if i knew that jessie hart had returned home and i answered that i had heard a vague story about her returnbut that i hoped what i heard was untrue  untrue alas sullivan

B8926,['8663690'],  johnny robinson the story of the childhood and sclwoldays of an  intelligent artisan by the journeyman engineer 2 vols tinsley brothers  the journeyman engineer who is known favourably to many readers by  some habits and customs of the working classes gives us a picture of the boyhood of a prosperous london artisans child from his infancy to the commencement of his apprenticeship to a working engineer to rouse and hold the readers interest the book makes just no use of the ordinary devices of romantic artists but achieves its purpose by a simple statement of the ordinary experiences of a boy who passes his earlier years in a mechanics home and in the schools generally frequented by the more carefullyreared children of our superior london workmen how johnny robinson fares under the penal hand of a worthy mother the birch of the kindly dame who teaches him his letters and the canes of the masters who ground him in the three fundamental departments of learning is minutely set forth for the enlightenment of leaders who like to study the ways and manners of our poorer classes and for the entertainment of such youngsters as those whom the book describes the characters of johnnys schoolmates are delineated and contrasted with considerable ability and in his enumeration of the moral dangers that beset the humble but respectable lads of our large cities the journeyman engineer  gives us some noteworthy particulars concerning a vicious literature that is specially provided for their entertainment and injury but while the effects of cheap literature have been chiefly beneficial it has like other good things its attendant evils and chiefest among these in the present day is the extensive circulation of the kind of publications classed under the expressive heading of  thieves literature these works which are having a most pernicious effect upon boys in the working class rank of life are published in penny weekly numbers and at the commencement of their present runwhich set in soon after the abolition of the paper dutythey were published under such general but suggestive titles as black bess or the knight of the road and  the dashing highwayman general titles however were soon abandoned and these works now appeal directly to the class whose minds they chiefly corrupt by bearing such titles as  the boy brigand the boy piratethe wild boys of london and others of a like character the sole object of these works is the glorification of all descriptions of vice and criminality the boy hero is invariably represented as a daring and successful criminal leading a life of pleasurable excitement admired and obeyed by men beloved of women and eventually settling down with a rich and beautiful wife and the other rewards generally reserved for the virtuous heroes of ordinary works of fiction the whole tone of such publications ia eminently calculated to turn the spirit of adventure which characterises english boys to their own destruction as it teaches them to emulate not the deeds of great men but of notorious criminals the extent to which these publications circulate can only be fully realised by those inside the working classes and speaking from an intimate acquaintance with these classes i can confidently say that eighty per cent of the boys in this rank of life between eight and fifteen years of age who do read now read works of this class cases in which boys are led to commit robberies through the perusal of these publications are occasionally made known through the medium of the police intelligence but these are a very small proportion of the number of such cases that actually occur such robberies being for the most part from parents who do not as a rule make them public the depredations of the boys who are thus led into crime are committed either with a view to obtaining money wherewith to purchase the books or to carry out the lessons taught in them by setting up as  boy brigands or pirates on their own account and in connexion with this point it may be noticed that there is one feature in the publication of thieves literature that directly tends to induce the classes who are its principal readers to steal with a number of one of them the first two numbers of a new work of the same class is often  given away and these works being written upon the most intense  tobecontinued  principle the result of this dodge is that those who commence to take in one of these works are almost invariably involved into taking several others of the same class asit would beagainstthe nature of a reader of thieves literature to rest content without knowing the result of the  terrible encounter between the boy king of the mountains and the chief of the black bandits at the most exciting part of which the last of the two givenaway numbers of  the boy king of the mountains had terminated and thus it often happens that one boy is taking in five or six of these works at the same time and as the pocketmoney of workingclass boys is too limited in amount to allow of the expenditure of fivepence or sixpence a week in one article and the teaching of the works which they read is in effect that no boy of the least spirit would for a moment hesitate about committing a robbery these boys often resort to dishonest means to raise funds for the purchase of their favourite books what mr hughes accomplished for the boys of our upper ten thousand  the journeyman engineer has achieved for boys of our working classes,juvenile_contra

B9054,['6734679'],  the celtic twilight men and women dhoula and faeries by w b yeats lawrence  bullen it was math the magicianthe same math that formed the maiden blodeuwedd from the blossoms of the oak and the broom and the meadowsweetwho made a boat once out of a little sedge and seaweed and set sail on another sea than we know today mr yeats is perhaps the one true follower of math that we have left and he proves his daring as a magician in nothing so much as in this last book of his in it he dares to show us the materials of his craft the little sedge and seaweed from which he built his magic bark of oisin and cuchulain and if we are no nearer the secret at the end of this book than we were at the beginning it is assuredly our fault and not his the celtic twilight will still remain to the saxon intelligence at any rate as much a mystery as ever its men and women will remainonly men and women the dhouls and fairies will be no more intelligible or conceivable than before but to those who believe in math that is in the imagination before all it is different they soon fall under the spell a rhyme or so and the thing is done and mr yeats knows his art and begins with rhyme  44 the host is riding from knockoarea and over the grave of cloothnabarc  caolte tosoing his burning hair and niam calling  away como away  44 4 and brood uo more where though fire ia bright filling thy heart with a mortal dream  for breasts are heaviug aud eyes aglara  away come away to the dim twilight  this invocation is only too effective it makes one expect other ghosts and enchantments more rare and elusive and more mediaeval than can possibly belong to this latter end of the celtic twilight on the very next page it is true mr yeats determines his boundary explicitly in prose but the promise of his verse is not to be gainsaid and its effect is to make one keep hoping for all the ancient mystery of celtic tradition still lurking as one half ventured to believe in the fields and watersides of connaught and leinster that unhappily no longer exists as it did only the merest fragments remain and this book is a melancholy witness of how little that is for mr yeats makes no effort to build up these fragments he takes them as he finds them as they appear to him to give his own account of himself and his book next to the desire he says which every artist feels to create for himself a little world out of the beautiful pleasant and significant things of this marred and clumsy universe i have desired to show in a vision something of the face of ireland to any of my own people who care for things of this kind i have therefore written down accurately and candidly much that i have heard and seen and except by way of commentary nothing that i have merely imagined this distinction between the writers impressions and his imaginations is worth noting seeing how much impressionism as against the purely imaginative use of subjectmatter is now in vogue mr yeats is not the only one among our younger contemporaries perhaps who has implied a difference between the two but none other that i know of has elected to make it in actual practice a question betwixt prose and verse however like many other poets his imeressions though expressed in prose will e found often to end in imaginationseven in lyrical imaginations in some passages of the book indeed the reader who has known mr yeats hitherto only as poet and rhymer will be very likely to hesitate and wonder whether this thing had not been better adapted to another vehicle as for instance in the striking conclusion of his second apologue   when all is said and done how do we not know but that our own unreason may be better than anothers truth  for it has been warmed on our hearths and in our souls and is ready for the wild bees of truth to hive in it and make their sweet honey come into the world again wild bees wild bees but in the main the form is excellently wellfitted to the subjectmatter of the book as in the opening chapter which gives a characteristic account of one ptddy flynn a little brighteyed old man he lived in a leaky and oneroomed cabin in the village of ballisodare which is he was wont to say the most gentlewhereby he meant faery place in the whole of county sligo    he was a great teller of tale j and unlike our common romancers knew how to empty heaven hell and purgatory faeryland and earth to people his stories he did not live in a shrunken world but knew of no less ample circumstance than did nomer himself perhaps the gaelic people shall by his like bring back again the ancient simplicity and amplitude of imagination what is literature but the expression of moods by the vehicle of symbol and incident and are there not moods which need heaven hell purgatory and faeryland for their expression no less than this dilapidated earth f  au  impressionist in the ordinary sense it is clear of course as any reader of his previous books must know mr yeats could never be and though in this book he pretends to give us impressions rather than imaginations of the twilight of the gael his natural temper of idealism is such that not one of these sketches but is constantly turning its matter of fact into matter of imagination there is no want of humour either in the tales of the  gentry or fairy people or of the ghosts who range so delightfully through mr yeatss pages there is an excellent set of them in a chapter on  village ghosts in whose doings the villagers with true irish philosophy have even learned to take a humorous pleasure of these ghosts one was a wicked seacaptain who 44 stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall in the shape of a snipe making the most horrible noises he was only dislodged when the wall was broken down  then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling how much more original this is than most of the ghosts in borderland so too with others who inhabit the same village of h in leinster which is so well described by mr yeats that we cannot resist stealing the passage 44 history has in no manner been burdened by this ancient village with its crooked lanes its old abbey churchyard full of long grass its green background of small firtrees and its juay where lie a few tarry fishingluggers n the annals of entomology it is well known for a small bay lies westward a little where he who watohes night after night may see a certain rare moth fluttering along the edge of the tide just at the end of evening or the beginning of dawn a hundred years ago it was carried here from italy by smugglers in a cargo of silks and laces there is a curious halfghostly fascination about this elusive moth that makes one at once expect mr yeats to turn it to account as a symbol of the tricksy spirit of celtic lore which he pursues but no  singularly enough he severely discounts both moth and mothhunter in a way that is quite unlike him for every poet is in a sense a mothhunter though indeed it is not given to many to have so rare a moth of a muse as that which haunts mr yeatss celtic twilight ernest rhys,juvenile_contra

the south to a manufacturing town in lancashire the poetical methodism of thisgirl111011011101 uncomplaining affectionthe mixture of rudeness and of reverence with which she looks up to the delicatelynurtured lady make up an admirable picture the author of  mary barton  seems bent on doing for lancashire and the lancashire dialect what miss edgeworth did for ireland and scott for the land across the border there has been no use of english patois in english fiction comparable to hers she has strong lancashire sympathies tooif they be classsympathies such as propel her to a somewhat disproportionate exposure of the trials and sufferings of the poor her excess is a generous one and not accompanied by that offensive caricaturing of her more  conventional  heroes and heroines which must always bring the sincerity of the caricaturist displaying it under question in another point the author of  north and south is open to remonstrance she deals with difficulties of morals needlessly and too fearlessly because as we have again and again said the riddle propounded cannot be solved in fiction  and because by all onesided handling of such matters  when passions become engaged and generous feelings are persuaded nnd when the temptation must be dwelled upon as cruel in apology for the offence  there is always a danger of unmooring the eager and the inexperienced from their anchorage the flat lie which margaret hale is made to tell in order to secure the escape of her brother is gratuitous painfulstaggering as an incident and without useful result as a lesson we cannot in our hearts blame margaret yet the author by the sufferings which followed as consequence takes pains to show how blameworthy margaret was a kindred dilemma it will be recollected is to be found in the authors  ruth which in place of aiding interfered with the advocacy of the cause which was the argument of that novel here the motive of the incident is less obvious in real actual life blameable cowardly and selfish is the man who turns away from dealing with difficulties so terrible they must be faced with such honour such charity such disposition to excuse and such power to weigh good and evil as can be summoned  but to thrust them forward in fiction where only artistic truth is possible amounts in deed if not in purpose to a wilful  playing with fire it should be added however that the tenor and tissue of our authors writings are such as to satisfy us that no wilfulness has been in her mind but an earnest if a mistaken desire to do good,juvenile_contra
B331,['9447034'],  1 the doctors wife ts new novels by the author of lady audleys secretc 3 vols maxwell  co in the october of 1862 we noticed lady audley  secret and in october 1864 we are about to review the authors sixth novelwhich strange to say has not appeared in a second edition a week before the date of announced publication  lady audleys secret aurora floyd  eleanors vic tory john marchmont legacy henry dunbar the doctors wife make eighteen volumes in two years there is no secret in the mechanism of the doctors wife from first to last there is neither mystery nor an attempt at mystification in this respect the tale differs from moat of miss braddon stories but otherwise the book bears a strong resemblance to her previous novels indeed its principal characters incidents and positions are reproductions of the old materials crime is the mainspring which sets the puppets in motion the chief actors are vicious and at the close of the story the moral teacher assigns impunity to one sinner and wealth to another just to encourage the others bigamy plays no part in the drama but as was the case in  henry dunbar the heroine is the daughter of a convicted forger after obtaining his liberation on a ticketofleave from portland this convict murders his childs lover and makes good bis escape to america in addition to forgery and murder the proceedings are enlivened by some innocent conjugal infidelity and an unsuccessful attempt at seduction by disappointing her heartless seducer and making her false wife stop short of adulterous intercourse with the man whom she prefers to her generous and devoted husband miss braddon lays claim to rank amongst writers of morality a notable damsel is isabel sleaford the forgers daughter and heroine she has eyes of a  bright orange colour her hair is blueblackand when the reader is first introduced to her a curl of this wondrous hair is seen straggling on her white throather throat very white with the dead yet yellowish whiteness of ivory in other matters the girl is more in the usual way of dirty london life she seldom wears clean linen rarely washes her hands and has some young brothers who are said to smell of outdoor amusements slender is the education which a father steadily pursuing the profession of a forger has bestowed on this yellowandblue child but she is very romantic yearns to be somebody particular and has been so thoroughly visited by the novels of thackeray mr dickens and sir e b lytton that she hopes some fine day to meet an earl in the old kent road who will take her into his cabriolet and forthwith make her a countess it may not be supposed that miss braddon wishes to insinuate that the works of the three novelists just named are more likely than her own healthy writings to stultify and demoralise a young lady on the contrary she takes every opportunity to speak a handsome word for those writers every fifth page of her book containing an allusion to the works of  boz and the names of ernest maltravers and edith dombey appearing not less than a hundred times in the course of the tale no blame therefore is cast on the authors because their works have had a deleterious effect in the case of miss isabel sleaford who hopes to become a grand lady in spite of her indolence and dislike of soap and water not only does miss isabel cherish this hope but the hope is fulfilled the author ridicules the girls folly and then brings about the accomplishment of her expectations first of all a young surgeon prosperous and of good repute falls in love with her at first sight and marries her without troubling himself to ascertain the fortunes of her papa who is serving his time at portland it is well known that professional men living in quiet country towns are wont to take unto themselves wives of whose private histories they know nothing the main work of the first volume is to accomplish this marriage very dreary reading is this first volume but it has one or two pleasant points in it miss braddon expresses contempt for  sensation literature and satirises the artifices by which mr sigismund smith writer for penny papers panders to the lust of his ignoble readers surely the author of lady audleys secret could point to novels published in three volumes which are as rich in impossible horrors as any of the tales devoured by the vulgar people  who like their literatureas they like their tobaccovery strong having accepted the country surgeon without loving him isabel wearies of his society before the end of their first week of married life the doctor is manly intelligent goodlooking and warmly respected by his neighbours but he is devoid of enthusiasm for shelley and is fond of pickled onions  he was her lord and master observes miss braddon though his fingers were square at the tips and had an abnormal capacity for the consumption of onions  spring onions all the year round onions isabel thought for those obnoxious bulbs seemed always in season at graybridge who can say that the convicts daughter had no good reason for hating this surgeon   she was only a week married  and already as she stood at the window listening to the slipslop of the everlasting rain she began to think that she had made a mistake ere many weeks have passed the young woman knows she has made a mistake and longs to be quit of her husband so that she may live happily with mr roland lansdell to whom she has given her heart a poet superbly handsome of aristocratic family and possessing a fine landed estate mr roland lansdell sees isabels yellow eyes converses with her is charmed with her romantic disposition and resolves to make her his mistress volume ii and partof volume iii are devoted to the romantic intercourse of isabel with the rich gentleman whose expensive costume and luxurious dinners are contrasted with the rustic clothes and plain fare of the country apothecary mad with vanity of the most contemptible kind isabel has clandestine interviews with mr lansdell and learns to loathe the bare thought of her husband whose name she makes the object of ignominious scandal at length mr lansdell proposes flight to the young wife  but isabel firmly rejects the proposal she loves mr lansdell she tells him so she accepts his addresses but she avont be wickedshe wont be his mistress actually miss braddon is under the impression that her heroine is guiltless of conjugal infidelity because she confines herself to sinning in thought and to certain acts which dishonour her husband without entitling him to the relief of the divorce court the termination of the story is not less immoral and foolish isabels father is liberated from portland hunts her out and demands money from her purse to satisfy this request she asks and obtains 50 from the man who still hopes to be her seducer the father not only takes the money but eventually robs mr lansdell of his life through mr lansdells evidence the convict was sentenced at the old bailey and now the forger encountering once more the  languid swell who mixed himself up in business that didnt concern him falls upon him with a bludgeon and beats him so ferociously that the blows after an interval of a few days result in death whilst mr lansdell is dying isabels husband is also drawing near his end brought on by typhoid fever the doctor dies with his last breath uttering avords of endearment to isabel and scarcely has the vital spark fled when isabel pays a visit to the dying roland lansdell who made her a faithless wife and almost made her his mistress the interview between the lovers is intended to be most pathetic the widow whose husband lies unburied assuring mr lansdell that he has no need to ask her forgiveness and mr lansdell commending the lady to the protection of his family mr lansdell dies penitent leaving the bulk of his vast property to isabel and his murderer escapes to america thus freed from her plebeian husband

B2502,['8702714'],  hindoo tales or the adventures of ten princes freely translated from the san scrit of the dasakuinaracharitam by p w jacob strahan  co wk gladly welcome this handy translation of the  dasakumaracharitra feeling sure that the more english readers become acquainted with indian literature the better will they be able to understand indian questions to appreciate and sympathise with the thoughts and feelings of the many millions of their indian fellow subjects with most of the versions of oriental works intended for scholars and students the general reader is not likely to have much inclination to make acquaintance but a free translation of a storybook like that which is now before us ought to find general f kvour very free indeed the translation is but mr jacob is fully justified in remarking that many parts of the original  are written in such a turgid  oriental stylo that a close translation would bo quite unsuitable to the english reader we have no fault to find with him on that score but we are surprised that an interpreter who professes to have translated so difficult a piece of sanskrit as the adventures of ten princes should have stated that it  has not so far as he can ascertain  been translated into any european language we do not expect  every schoolboy  to be aware but it seems strange that an advanced sanskritist should be unaware that the work in question has been translated into french by m hippolyte fauche in vol ii of  vue tetrade icc paris 1802 and that it has already been treated by no less a scholar than prof wilson in very much the same style as that in which mr jacob has now treated it as m fauches translation however is but little known here while prof wilsons abridged paraphrase is not easily to be obtained it forms pp 100289 of vol iv of his collected works we can conscientiously recommend mr jacobs attractive little book as prof wilson remarks the stories now before us  are interesting as pictures of hindu society for ceuturies probably anterior to the mohammedan conquest not very flattering pictures are they he proceeds to say for pro fligacy and superstition seem to be their most characteristic features but still there are redeeming traits their heroes being brave and enterprising devoted to their friends and kindred and tenderly attached to the objects of their affection seen from another point of view the stories wear a more attractive aspect inasmuch as they ofter a valuable contribution to the stock of materials available for the use of those engaged in the comparative study of folklore one of the beat of the stories and the most useful for such purposes is that of mantragupta who one night finds a terrible enchanter standing beside a flickering fire  his head covered with a large mass of tangled hair his body begrimed with the dust of charcoal and a girdle of human bones round his waist from this unpleasant magician the hero saves a fair princess sending the enchanters head flying at the moment when he is about to cut off hers after performing this useful act he naturally marries her but before long she is carried away captive by a neighbouring king who proposes to make her his wife the monarchs intentions however are frustrated by the fact that she suddenly becomes  possessed by an evil spirit whose rage is greatest whenever the king visits her when mantragupta hears this he disguises himself as an ascetic proceeds to the kings court and induces the amorous sovereign to follow his instructions these are that the king shall visit a certain tank at midnight and bathe in its waters by this means he will acquire  a new and beautiful body acceptable to the lady and she will no more be troubled with the evil spirit the monarch does as he is bid and is pulled under water aud strangled by his instructor who has lain in wait for him in a hole constructed for the purpose in the dam then mantragupta conies forward and exhibits himself as the improved king to the royal attendants who have been drawn up in the neighbourhood and who  though they had expected a miracle were scarcely prepared for such a great change after which he assumes the reins of government is married in state to his own wife and becomes the delight of his subjects who are never weary of pointing out how much the temper of their sovereign has improved together with his personal appearance very curious also are the two stories told by mitragupta to the rakshasa in proof of his assertions that there is nothing more cruel than  a wicked womans heart and nothing so conducive to  the advantage of a householder  as  good qualities in a wife according to the first story a certain man had saved his wifes life by enabling her to escape from her brothersinlaw who wished to eat her and had preserved it by draughts of his own blood when no other aliment could be obtained during their flight in spite of all this she transferred her affections from him to a mere torso of a man a wretched being whom he had found in the forest left to die there by robbers who had cut off his hands feet and nose so one day she pushed her husband into a well then she carried away the cripple on her back and proceeded to pass him off though much against his will as her lawful spouse mean time her real husband escaped i from the well and followed her about the country when at last he came up with her she promptly gave him in charge as the ruffian who had mutilated her poor dear husband the cripple and the innocent man would have been put to an ignominious death had he not appealed to the cripple who at once  with many tears declared the kindness with which he had been treated by the supposed criminal and the wickedness of the woman who had forced him to live with her as her husband the second story is that of the wealthy young brahman who  in the country of the dravidas plays the wellknown part of  ccelebs in search of a wife in order to find a suitable spouse he wanders from one town or village to another  taking very little with him but a small bag containing two or three pounds of rice in the husk and whenever he sees a maiden of his own caste whom he admires he says to her  my dear could you make me a good dinner with this rice  time passes by and the rice remains uncooked  but at last he finds a maiden whose personal charms completely captivate him but although urged by love he is still restrained by prudence so he addresses her with his usual formula she at once takes the rice gently rubs it so as  to get off the husk unbroken sends her nurse to sell the husk to the goldsmiths and to purchase with the proceeds  a little firewood a few cheap dishes an earthen pipkin and a wooden mortar with a long pestle all of which objects must have been very cheap or bran very dear then she gracefully cleanses and washes the rice lights a fire and boils the grain puts out the fire sells the charcoal obtained from it and lays out its price in  herbs ghee curds

all the julia de ltoubignes and charlotteandwerters in the whole romantic world of letters we have been entreated by several soft readers to walk as a short cut to the temple of pure feeling through

very comfortably settled in life and in tinfirst passage with a comely wife and a decent allowance of bairns in fact a very moderate allowance for a gentleman of his cloth his children being four only in number mrs blair and himself are unlucky iii their rearing of them and three of the little cherubs are carried off with the measles or some such inelegant but fatal disorder it occurs to us that mrs blair is not like most mothers if the book is to be credited  for it states that  after the death of the last of these three infants mrs blair dried her tears  however this was her business and not ours and perhaps her subsequent regular death may be some atonement she dies in the third or fourth page which is certainly early work and indeed we had fears that the denouement was coming at the wron end of the book  but we soon found as we shall explain anon that the minister had to undergo  severer chastening or in other words that with all the domestic happiness of the dean and chapter thefirst chapter all the ecstasies were to come immediately after the ladys death what  edinburgh lr does the rev mr blair dowrhv after closing  the stiffening eyelids over the soft but ghastly orbs

house and after staring about him for a moment on the green he leapt hastily over the little brook that skirts it and plunged within the shade of the trees the breeze was rustling the black boughs high over his head and whistling along die bare ground beneath him he rushed he knew not whither on and on between those naked brown trunks till he was in the heart of the wood and there at last he tossed himself down on his back among the withered fern leaves and mouldering firtones mr blair in this situation dreams with his eyes open of a young radiant woman mrs blair that was  blushing trembling smiling panting on his bosom whispering to him all ber hopes and fears and pride and love and tenderness and meekness like a bride and  all that sort of thingile soon returned home in considerably better spirits and his servants let him in and went to bed the minister takes on sadly and really appears to grieve after the style of la roche and almost as perfectly as the original

grave she reads the inscription on the tomb and then reflectsand then moralises  and then philosophizesand then sighs and passionate sobs burst together unchecked and unresisted and the bruised heart

B5186,['9435559'],  i maurice dering or the quadrilateral a novel by the author of guy livingstone tinsley brothersthis is a clever vigorous novel the descriptions are struck off in a few graphic words which set the objects whether they be men or things before the reader in their bodily presentment the story turns on the firm friendship of four men for each other and the mischief wrought by a wicked woman the friends are well sketched paul chetwynd the cynic who is always ready to be good and generous and who has plenty of common sensephilip gascoigne the fine gentleman who can be and do anything up to a certain point who has talent but no power of perseverance maurice dering the officer and gentleman who has a true loyal nature with a sense of duty and selfdenial which would have made him a real hero if he had not taken the business of providence into his own hands and made himself the executioner of the hautdauires and like all mortal improvers of the ways of providence  doing evil that good may come the characters are all highly coloured and loaded with epithets which is a mode of begging the question and biassing the judgement of the reader which has made works of fiction forbidden fruit to many strict and conscientious people sometimes an epithet is graphic and illustrative but when used in profusion it is only a lazy mode to save the trouble of correct delineation the author of  maurice dering uses epithets alike for the purpose of palliating vice and indicating virtue  maurice dering is not however a pleasant book there is a want of refinement or rather we should say a want of the power to discriminate right from wrong an inherent coarseness which mars the pleasure of the reader the effect left after closing the book is neither wholesome nor satisfactory the heroes of the novel are much better than the heroines who are indeed a sorry set the writer draws them as entirely worthless and makes many excuses for them there is not one good or wellprincipled woman in the book if we except alice leslie a shadowy sketch who scarcely appears upon the scene georgie gascoigne is a weak selfish vain woman a coquette to the core of her nature who never lets a fair chance of a flirtation blipa woman whose love is no compliment to a man at the commencement of the story she is engaged to marry philip gascoigne of the quadrilateral maurice dering has secretly loved her but he has exchanged into a regiment going to india to put himself out of the reach of temptation georgie has a cousin ida who is engaged to be married to another of the four friendsthe rev geoffrey luttrell an honest frank simplehearted sporting clergyman much more orthodox on points of shooting and salmonfishing than on divinity ida is a thoroughlywicked woman and the demon of the story she is madly in love with dering georgie has a narrow escape from the pranks of a vicious horse which she has wilfully insisted on mounting maurice dering saves her there is a capital description of the  race for two lives during this crisis two persons discover maurice derings secret one is his friend paul chetwynd  the other is ida who thereupon becomes georgies deadly enemy for life not deterred either by her own betrothal and approaching marriage nor by the discovery that maurice dering loves another she seeks an opportunity to be alone with him and reveals her love dering behaves like a gentleman under the embarrassing circumstances the author colours his epithets very black for this sin against all that is sacred in female reticence but it is quite the most innocent act she does in the whole story georgie shows every disposition to throw over the man she is engaged to marry for the sake of her newlydiscovered conquest maurice dering is able to stand firm under all his temptations and to act as groomsman to his friend and to witness the fair idas marriage though even at the crisis of the bervice  those wonderful deep eyes were lifted under the bridal veil and shot one straight swift glance to the spot where in the background stood maurice dering poor man he is sorely beleaguered by women but he makes his escape to india where in pursuit of what the author terms the  big game he after a time regains his serenity and after an encounter with a great shebear which nearly kills him he is nursed by a fair girl who loves him and he forgets georgie and engages himself to alice leslie meanwhile georgie though married continues to be a coquette caring for nothing but admiration her husband adores her and thinks she can do no wrong in general when a husband adores his wife and abstains from matrimonial snubbings which are an antidote to the flattery of society the wife becomes either insufferably conceited or gets into mischief there is a certain gerald annesley a handsome blackguard who has known georgie in former times and who has stirred the first romantic feelings of her heart he renewb acquaintance with her and ida sets herself deliberately to assist in the ruin of her cousin she helps annesley in his designs and by her influence over georgie she almost drags her into the snare laid for her maurice dering comes to england to arrange about his marriage gascoigne having been ordered to spa by his physician for a hopeless malady which is slowly destroying his life all the friends meet there also gerald annesley bent on making georgie elope with him the sketch of spa and the visitors hi dramatic and vivid paul chetwynd becomes aware of the danger of georgie he and maurice dering agree that nothing but the death of annesley can save her he is too inflexible and she too weak for a mere separation to avail dering being a dead shot is the one who agrees to make a quarrel and challenge annesley the duel is well described but it ls a murder pure and simple dering goes into it knowing that he intends to kill his adversary annesley receives a mortal wound and fires into the air a packet of letters which is delivered to maurice after the funeral reveals idas wickedness and her plots against her cousin to which she had nearly fallen a victim the two friends sit in judgement upon her and proceed to execute their sentence in the spirit of the four mousguetaires judging mi ladi at the crisis the unsuspecting husband of ida comes up and is in time to hear what had been carefully kept from him ida behaves like a french heroine or a fiend but the shock of hearing that maurice is engaged to be married brings on an attack of the heart and she falls dead the author immediately begins to be sorry for her and to mitigate her wickedness by descriptions of the dead womans lovely face the lovely chiselled face with the composureof  eternal peace upon it the indian mutiny breaks out maurice derings fancy is one of the early victims of those nameless horrors maurice dering returns to avenge himself and he is described as presiding over a butchery of prisoners who had laid down their arms which will make the reader feel sick and faint the curtain drops upon the muddled lives and faded happiness of all the four friends a most depressing and melancholy result attributed by the author entirely to the wickedness of ida the author can well describe short sharp decisive acts and gestures but a sustained gradually workedout course of action and emotion is beyond his powers or he does not choose to bestow the necessary labour the key to all the misery and wickedness of the present work is very inadequate ida the evil genius of the piece is left in block the want of workmanship in making out her actions and her motives ir very palpable and the author supplies the place of work by patches of colour and theatrical looks and attributes the book clever as it is cannot be called either pleasant or

B3017,['9083860'],  fiction the winged victory by sarah grand heinemann os net at any rate sarah grand has not sought as have some other novelists to put readers off with inferior matter in this time of all times her novel besides being what all fiction should beentertaining and recreativecontains much thought fitting for consideration today in fact we may credit her not only with having fulfilled the purpose of a novel but also with having produced at the same time a novel with a purpose to say that she had accomplished both things satisfactorily would be to number the book among the classics and that we cannot do for after gladly bestowing so much of appreciation we must unburden ourselves of our main criticism and then proceed to the consideration of her work in some detail her novel will accomplish its purpose we believe in widening the outlook of the average novelreader but to our mind in addition to other faults she has omitted the pith of the matter had she more plainly analysed the nature of the soil from which the roots of the tragedy drew their nourishment it would have been more helpful as she makes one of her characters say  causes are the things to attack not effects she does in fact inform us that the feet of her wingless victory were clay in so far as her motive power was largely the spirit of revenge on those who were responsible for the sufferings of the poor she had the intellect which  kims the surface it is reserved for the spirit whose advances she had slighted to plumb the depths she had taken her fate into her own hands when she preferred intellectual ascendancy to spiritual enlightenment but the whole setting is in a clay soil impervious to light and air the matter of the girls birth is wrapped in secrecy no less foolish than is usual in such cases the secrecy was as much a matter of the conventions as was the luxury with which even the authors best characters surrounded themselves while bemoaning the lot of the poor in not having more of the worlds goods forgetting at the same time how uneconomically they indulged themselves in superabundance the authors 4 big  man closes a sumptuous repast with what would have been blasphemous prayer had he been really big enough to understand the most elementary economy the income which he spent on himself must have been many times more than the average one of 222 for a man and his wife and three children we have no wish to be thought extremists to allow him but the average income would probably have quenched entirely his utility it is the authors blindness to the awful responsibility of her hero that we deplore the authors conception of the world is obviously that of a place where the intolerableness of conditions must be mitigated with the object of its becoming as efficient a school as possible for fitting its pupils for a heaven hereafter and else where in other words the author does not consider that the ideal of heaven on earth is ever likely to come within the range of practical politics the fact that we do not agree with her detracts not a whit from the value o4 the work considered from the authors own point of view and so from that point we will consider it the heroine possesses as did adnam the hero of 4 adnams orchard to which the book is the sequel in a literal sense if not in that usual in fictionan overabundance of excellence which however it is not very hard to credit her with though some of her qualities are difficult of acceptance in the light of her lowly origin in 4 adnams orchard  we had much dissertation on the land here the heroine ella banks who will be remembered as a lacemaker in the former book continues her calling though in very different circumstances the book opens with her being met by the duke of castlefield sayes solicitor who drives her straightway to the west end mansion which has been placed at her disposal society with the capital sthe sign manual of all that is sinfulis induced by the patronage of royalty to frequent her lace exhibition with the inevitable consequence that the protegee receives many unwelcome attentionsthe outcome of one of which involves her in homicide meanwhile she awaits the return of her lover the dukes son her marriage with whom she looks upon as the copingstone of the design by which she will accomplish her object of freeing the lace trade from the sweating conditions imposed on it by the profiteering middlemen meanwhile the duke lavishes wealth and caresses on her and pajrs her clandestine visits late at nightuntil at last the heroine awakens to the fact that scandal is busy with her name at once she believes that there is truth in the rumour which assigns discreditable motives to the dukes attentions in consequence she consents to marry the son without the fathers knowledge and immediately after is made aware that she is the dukes lovechild how the knot is cut we prefer to leave the reader to find out lest this which is to our mind a greater improbability than many which have preceded it should deter any one from the perusal of what after all is a novel far better worth reading than many based upon more likely happenings having very briefly outlined the plot we must allude to some of the admirable characterization there are delineations of the good and bad sides of society which are worthy to be mentioned along with the great names of thackeray and meredith the old lordly reprobate and his parasitic tailors model are two instances and not far behind these are the galaxy of coarseminded women on the other hand we have the princess who betrays her teutonic blood to a degree which will hardly be acceptable today but she is nevertheless a true and lovable presentment the touches with which character are delineated are excellent throughout but we can refer only to a few there ia the solicitorwho was so obviously a man who did not receive orders but was instructedwith his twitching nose reminiscent of a rabbit lady ami an epitome of her caste in all time she felt secure in the established order of good and evil considered that if there were people not equally wellsatisfied with things as they are those people were in the wrong and must be brought to heel and viewing the process from the height of a position whence unpleasant details were not visible to the naked eye she indignantly set aside as impertinent any difference of opinion on the subject that might reach her and was not tobe warned  then the duke her husband he might with justice have called himself a busy man and such business as his has its own importance many lives would have been disarranged and much inconvenience entailed had he neglected it but it was the business of a system of a great machine which ho had not set in motion and could not control it controlled him he was the tool of a machine which was working with results that he knew to be bad in many ways in great measure an ineffectual machine into the defective parts of which he meant to look but never did to any purpose besides his part in the working of the machine was obligatory and obligatory work is not soulsatisfying as an object in life peculiar to himself would have been how he found his real object in life we shall leave readers to discover for themselves some of the traits depicted are easily fitted to people well known a few years ago  but if they have been lifted from life they have been so mixed up as to render them void of any offence occasionally the characters appear to have got out of hand and we like them better freed of the authors control but they appear later to be ruthlessly subjugated to conform with the exigencies of the plot in an age when there is so much more writing and talking than thinking the novel strikes us as overlong towards the end and yet one cannot suggest any of the 650 pages which can safely be skipped,juvenile_contra

it will therefore be unnecessary to repeat here the judgement then lronounced and the more so as it has been amply confirmed by public opinion which has received that publication into the catalogue of its favourites e ilia wyndham is not however quite equal to its immediate predecessor although a very able pej formance it was evidently composed with less care because with more haste character is not so minutely elaborated nor are the pictures so perfect the samne labour has not been bestowed in aftercorrection nor has the pen been so fearless in blotting as it is wont to be in the same hands but these defects are comparative only it is when we test the author by his or her own standard that we are compelled to find fault by the side of his contemporaries lie appears to great advantage not inferior to the best of them in his excellencies while his defects are fewer than are to be seen in any this is ligh praise but it is a sincere opinion based not upon a hasty perusal of one only of his vorks but produced by close observation of his literary career from the appearance of the  two old mens tales  to the three volumes now before us when we commenced the critic three years since it was our design to present a skeleton of the plots of the various fictions that might come before us for review but a little experience satisfied us that the plan was one which could not be carried out without great injustice to authors and annoyance to readers so abbreviated a story that might be interesting enough with the lights and shades thrown in at the telling would not unfrequently seem tame and bald in the outline while without satisfying the curiosity of the reader it would take off the edge of appetite for the perusal of the work the end being already revealed to him we have found it to be in practice the most convenient course to indicate only so much of the subject of the fiction as will serve to show the class to which it belongs and to express such a general opinion of its merits as may enable the reader to determine whether it is one which he will buy or borrow emilia wyndham belongs to the class of domestic novels it is intended to portray actual life with of course the usual allowance of a little exaggeration and some improbabilities in the order of events accorded to the novelist as a necessity the style of the work and three of the most striking characters

conclusion that the close of though tah will ilipleifc no enenot even the fusty critic  and this in spite ofthe touch of poetical justice vhioli as we have said some thousand times is essentially unjust  emilia wyndham literature emilia wyndham a paragon of goodnes and beauty loves and is beloved by colonel lennox one of those supercilious specimens of modern chivalry who profess not to know a wood anemone despise a garden terrace tecause it has not an esplanade a thousand feet high breasting the ocean and looks upon all men of business as a class to be avoide the character of emilias father will be best described by an extract  i was promised some grouse for supper tonight and here is only an odious roast fowl t why i am very sorry you should be disappointed mr wyndham was the reply  but when the man asked halfaguinea a brace for them i really felt inclined to be shabby and send him away without his reckoning  every thing one particularly likes is always halfaguinea a brace with women and then turning round  what have you there before you maam sweetbreads hiumph emilia is that an apricot tart no papacherry i think are apricots too madam halfaguinea a halfdozen because i rather expressed a wish for some i think yesterday  this exhibition of domestic fretfulness and tyranny occurs ill the presence of colonel lennox and of mr danby a london solicitor who i ias arrived at the oaks to avert a catastrophe which mr wyndhams thoughtless dissatisfied nature and his habitual extravagance pandered to by a rascally attorney is rapidly bringing about mr danby is described as a thin spare man whose clothes rather hung upon than dressed him and with hair either rusted or grizzled yet a man of superior ablities and deep feelingsfeelings which emilia first called forti from their hidden depths to infuse a new and lifebreathing warmth into that heart which before was as dry as the parchment upon which he endorsed his conveyances emilia has a bosom friend lisa hesketh daughter of sir thomas and lady maria she is petite exquisitely beautiful and undisciplined  the most beautiful heap of elegant and softlooking things and the sweetest little face among them all that could well be imagined an extract from one of lisa hieskeths characteristic letters to emilia will convey the best idea of her disposition it is written on the occasion of her fathers appointment as amassador to the court of st petersburg  oh ill make mischief among them all at st petersburgsee if i dontand ill marry some grand russian princeprince ruffanutffapuffaslowsky dont you see the princess coming walking up to you in a grand london partyyoull only be poor little mrs colonel len   dont beat mehanging on your husbands arm with may be a paltry bit of a red ribbon just rping at his buttonhole and a paltry sir as a handle to his name an shall come up to you with my graindcc emilia wyndham by the author of  two old mens tales  mount bo0rel c 3 vol henry colburn all sorts of sheepskins and twonecked eagles and dragons and georges and michaels and monster adorning his breast and covered from head to foot with stars and garters and youll look so humble and so afraid and i shall be so sweetly condescending it will scarcely be anticipated after these juvenile confidences that isa hesketfl weds colonel lennox and the good and beautiful emilia is married to the man of red tapes and rusty black suit yet such events are quickly brought about by the ruin and sickness of mr wyndham the death of his lady and the selfishness and harshness of au uncle colonel lennox has joined his regiment without explaining himselfit was too much trouble to do soand to procure a shelter for her father sunk under misfortune to a fretful drivelling lunatic and a home for herself emilia at length accepts that offered to her in chancerylane while leniox on his return from the peninsula disgusted with what he considers to be her want of faith marries the pretty but thoughtless lisa unlike most novels of which matrimony is the climax in the present instance it is only the steppingstone to the mature development of the characters we have so slighty sketched the friends although moving in such different spheres of life continue faithful to one another  while as might be expected the illassorted unions they have made areproductive at first of any thing but happiness lisa s want of character and principle conduct her to the very verge of guilt but emilia resolved to save her toils in her career of love and goodness with unequalled nobleness and depth of purpose an lago of a mother unfortunately rouses distrust and jealousy during these proceedings in mr danby s bosom and his life is a life of doubt and misery till one great catastrophe averted in timean elopement prevented by emiliaplaces all parties in their proper light and restores husbands and wives to love and duty it is difficult to imagne any thing better told or more carefully and skilfully wrought out tan this wedded relationship of mr danby and emilia wyndham and we are fully prepared to agree with the author that it was much better that these pairs once united should have remained united and have learned to love one another than that they should have changed partners and found mutual failings and mutual discontent and fresh reason for changing again in every new form of married life they might have tried  lisa hesketh an emilia wyndham are characters modelled by no extraordinary coincidence upon the same plan as eveleen and her better principled sister in 1 the confessions of a pretty woman lisas mother s like eveleens mother a dressy vain coquette violenttempered mother whom she could neither love nor respect but the development of the characters is managed with superior skil told with infinitely more power and wrought out without a blemish in the important points of taste and feeling there is actually nothing to mar an admirable picture of manners and a very striking story of everyday fashionable life there is no aristocratic slang no violation of decency no forced hotbed sentimentality every thing is natural and well told there are passages that speak worlds as to the sex of the author as  man is born bred reared dyed double dyed in jealousyit is the universal passion and again 4if husbands now and then received a lesson in their turn and learned to correct themselves as well as their wives and still more so in a sentence the only one we should perhaps have wished to have seen oniitted  there is something in woman that seems born for the knapsack that every virtue has its attendant vice is as thus placed a sophism every sentiment inay be in excess or in deficiency hence it is that extravagance may accompany generosity or covetousness economy it is the abuse not the use that is vicious and hence the practice of virtues without their attendant vices is not only as the author puts it rare excellent and beautiful but it is essential to the healthy performance of the moral and intellectual functions and is the standard of perfection in the natural constitution of man here is an observation highly creditable to a female pen  a passion for naturea deep imaginative passion for her wild scenes and so ary beauty very often lies hidden under the rough coat of the fisherman the velveteen shootingjacket and even under the scarlet coat though the scarlet coat has more of the show and vanity of life in it and is often though not always the covering for that vulgar and most unpoetic feeling the love of fashionthe same may be said of the battue   in such employments wholesome healthy tastes and many sound and manly virtues are exercised naturewild beautiful romantic naturenever speaks to the human heart altogether in vain there is a world of charity in these observations which are worthy of the author of  the natural history of enthusiasm and we see the same correct feeling slily coming to the surface in two other sentences people who live in such little dark ugly rooms have not even a right to esteem themselves happy happiness is the right as well as the attribute only of those who are clothed in purple and fine linen and fare sumptuously every day but we must quit this delightful novel leaving it toits own merits to recommend it to a host of admirers every lady should read it  the literary examiner extiliav wpdaam

healthy colouring the exquisite unaffectedness of art which we so admired in mow sorel are her with a purer style in the writing and an eaier flow in the story telling ehilia wyndham is a masterpiece the characters are few the incidents those of every day and the philosophy homely enough the book has no lofty igts but we can never cease to know the people in it or to be better for having known them their tale is of suffering and trial surmounted by duty and affection it deals with the extremes of passion and of selfcontrol and a healthy oldworld wisdom most quaintly interspersed throws rich fragrance into it the teller of the story comes in between its intemperate beats its desperate follies its hard endurances and its loving mistakes like the good friar in the tragedy of veroina with his elegant sermon and his basket of flowers it is not a tragedy as we have said but there is hardly a page that does not tremble with tureatened disasters or that does not on the other hand in some chance thought still comfort and reassure the imagination we have been powerfully affected by this tale but what moves the heart thus betters it also and there is much beyond the amusement of a passing hour in such a book as emilia iv ndham the mere story is 8s slight anddependingso much on the subtler developments of feeling and character that a bare outline would do it no sort of justice but it turns upon the lifestruggle of a highminded devoted girl whose noble performance of what she sees to be her duty conducts her at last through the roughest and most unpromising paths through the sternest and saddest sacrifices through the most affecting patience and selfdenial to a solid and sacred happiness the germ of this idea is common enough but we question if it has ever been unfolded into such sweetness or adorned with so much of that inestimable wisdom which belongs to the common and daily trials and to the needful mutual forbearances of hearth and home the heroine is introduced in this brief description it harmonises very quietly but beautifully with the after current of the tale b milia had not regular features but no one could deny that she was a very fine girl full of health and animation with two very expressive eyes of whatever colouryou please to call them for no one could ever decide the mattera sweet delicate mouth expressive of both sense lemper and feelinga nice steady routed chinabundance of brown haira colour like a rosea light elatic but somewhat fullformed figure with a pair of the moot beauful arms in the world which last advantage gave a singular elegance to ber gestures however when you were with her or talking to her you seemed as little to think of what she looked like as she did herself early in the book she is driven to a marriage of duty not affection and mr danby is a hero fit to pair off with such a heroine he is nothing more nor less than a london attorney wealthy and intelligent but awkward in his manners limited in his social experiences and a slave to his busioes habits a dry laborious diffident recluse but with a noble heart lying under the crust of his strange life and this is awakened suddenly by the sig of emilia wyodham to this chacry lain cymos she plays the iphigeaia she im at first a star and dwells apart but misery makes his world hers and she descends to him and calls to him in her distress perhaps we
