B8478,"['8959292', '3200389']",  the voyage out by virginia woolf duckworth fe co 6s there is some good work in  the voyage out not to mention erudition the favourite reading of the ships steward was huxley herbert spencer and henry george while he turned to emerson and mr hardy for relaxation the central idea of gathering a small company into the isolated world of a passenger ship and later in a south american island and leaving them to explore each others natures is full of possibilities the author has sketched her characters with a few deft strokes but the incidents are too loosely put together and there is a great deal of superfluous material the language is not always grammatical and sometimes forcible to the verge of coarseness but there is a considerable amount of shrewd observation and clever cynicism the pathos of the heroines death is the more poignant for the restraint with which it is treated and such egotism as that of the young man who says of his novelwriting   i m good secondrate  about as good as thackeray i should say is delightful in its frankness  the voyage out by virginia woolf cs duckworth it is the detail and intricacy of this essentially human lootlk that gives it its strength and individuality the man characters with their various and distinctive ersonalities miss w oolf describes so intimately and with so sure a touch that the reader is made familiar with each one in turn onscious of eat hi trivial affectation and all the lights and shades of the different natures our first acquaintance with the principal characters in the story is made on their journey out to south america in a small cargo steamer the captains daughter is a girl of twentyfour whose innocence or rather ignorance of the world and its ways is equivalent to a childs and the author tells of her awakening and development cleverly and sympathetically the conversation is perhaps the only thing in a very realistic book that somewhat lacks realism but it is so sparklingly vivacious so witty and entertaining that we are likely to forget the fact that the average individual has neither such a quick understanding nor such skill at making epigrams and similes as the human beings who people mliss woolfs story and enjoy the dialogue just because it is brilliant and humorous the keynote to the book is the authors clear and complete knowledge of her fellowcreatures and an alertness for the minor things of lifethe tangled undergrowth of little incidentsthat make each separate existence at once so commonplace and so unique,britain
B4376,"['6787468', '8802397']",  fiction the spoils of poynton by henry james heinemann the works of mr henry james are a series of exquisite disappointments to say that they are exquisite is to say what all know each phrase is sought out and each shade of character finely observedhave not many reviewers said it  he is admirable in his cleverness his conscientiousness and his right selfrespect he seeks the phrase but he is never the fool of the phrase no bright and dluring collocation of words like some dancing lignt has ever misled him ho does not go out with his gun potting at the gonerol publichas never brought down hts brace of tall curates with the two volumes fired in rapid successionand they mako bigger bags in the crockett cabbageplot mr henry james writes for the few and belongs to though very few it is indeed almost a pity that so many dunces have been banged bullied and frightened into saying that they like though work of mr henry james but that he is really too subtle it is a pity because in the first place no dunce ever liked though work of mr henry james and in though second place because the trouble with mr honry james is that he is not subtle enough for instance he seems to have feared at times that his style wanted warmth geniality spontaneity and thus fearing ho gives us an occasional didnt for  did not this is not subtle and it misses its effect his horoos and horoines again tako that course of action which best satisfies good tasto and feeling but though rejected tlio other course is considered they deliberate they choose they aro painfully anxious to have tlio good approval of everybody thoir most spirited action is discounted by nervousness and long selfcommunion we find ourselves liking thom less than we ought to like them they are all right but they have to take so much trouble to bo all right mr henry james is subtle enough to work out the difficult sum correctly but not subtle enough to rub out though working on his slate and loavo only though effective answer his characters are not marionettes they do live and move and havo their being but they know all the time that mr honry james is looking they aro not sufficiently disengaged and projected if he were half as good nobody would mind and six lines of stereotyped approval for he woidd still be good would be his portion but he has a point of view an insight a right judgment a hatred of the common u stylo ho makes and uses his phruso liko a niastor and lie takes caro wore his gifts and his conscientiousness less ho would disappoint less as it is ono cannot forgive him the least thingsuch forgiveness would be an insult it is perhaps possible that his croativo faculty and his critical faculty work simultaneously each to the prejudice of the other  and that it would be better if he first made and then corrected however that may be his work i always exquisite and yet always something of a disappointment  the spoils of poynton  are furniture objects of art they have been collected through long years with tove and knowledge by mrs gareth and her husband poynton is a beautiful treasurehouse a little heaven mrs gareth is now a widow when her son owen marries she will have to give up poynton and all that therein is to him and his bride and to retire to ricksa lesser place formerly the residence of an aunt and furnished as all aunts always furnish now mrs gareth is the real collector these spoils are almost her reason for living she loves them understands them respects them to one who could equal her affection and appreciation to one worthy of these beautiful things she could surrender them her haunting horror is that she will have to surrender to mona brigstock of the brigstocks of waterbath of whom owen appears to be becoming fond if poynton is a little heaven waterbath so far as the house is concerned is simply hades without the picturesquenesscheap tasteless full of gimcracks mona is beautiful wooden expressionless grasping knows that the spoils are very valuable and is incapable of considering them or anything else otherwise than commercially owen is a handsome heavy honest fool of ponderous probity but also of an almost incredible weakness and fleda is the other girl worthy as mrs gareth knew of the spoils and worthy of far more there is the germ of the book most of the people and some of the motives when mr henry james makes out a little list of his achievements and it would be difficult to imagine anything more unlikely he must not omit mrs gareth he has seldom if ever given us anything better the character is clear objective original she is a woman of refined taste and is sometimes almost slangy sho is capable of great sacrifices and is guilty of conduct thatwell the brigstocks say its simply stealing says owen plaintively and we are inclined to agree with the brigstocks yet only at the end do we remember that there are things in her which baldly stated and at first sight might appear paradoxical throughout sho has boon quite true and convincing it is the misfortune of mr henry james that he draws those people best whom he does not quite like there is much that is good in the delineation of owen and fleda but they do not convince as mrs gareth convinces the story contains at least two strong dramatic situations the humour is delightful the style is mr henry james if it disappoints it is for want of a little moro warmth and humanity because though reader cries out for someone who shall bo admirablo without being nervous and hesitating and nover finds that person if though prosont writor may add a personal noto on another point it is a pity that mr heinemann should dofaco by an absurd stamp on though titlepage such a book as thi3 when ho sends it out for review  the spoils of poynton new novels by henry james i heinemann tne first impression produced on the reader by mr jamess latest novel is that he is looking at things through glasses not quite suited to his focus the next that it must have cost though author a deal of trouble to writo if you debar yourself from theuse of 44 spade 4 implement of husbandry or 44 adjective shovel it is not always easy to find an english phrase that will legitimately denote the article and when you do find one the chances are that your render will not be sufficiently in thehabit of associating it with the object indicated to be able without conscious effort to proceed from it to the idea of that object and conscious effort is just what the novelreader does not want the odd thing is that the story is really simple enough mrs gereth is a widow who has spent her married life in making a palace of art at poynton the bouse and all the pretty things in it have become her only sons property and the question that torments her is whether he will marry some one not only capable of appreciating her  lordly pleasurehouse but also willing to allow its1 creator to continue in undisturbed enjoyment of it unfortunately he being a person of dull perceptions settles upon a girl who has been brought up in an atmosphere of opulent bad taste but is sharp enough to see that mrs gereths bricdbrac is worth holding fast to mean time that lady has pitched upon a damsel who combines the qualifications which she requires in a daughterinlaw and the story amounts practically to a narrative of the contest for the spoils of poynton between mona brigstocke and mrs gereth fighting behind her protigie fleda vetch we cannot exactly congratulate mr james this time on his taste in nomenclature the situation is further complicated by the fact that the elder lady when retiring from the house in consequence of her sons engagement carries off a large and important selection from the portable property contained in it the struggle is well balanced and the reader is never justified till it is over in anticipating one end or the other to it the more obvious characters owen gereth and mona are concrete enough if not very interesting they are the matter mrs gereth the force is decidedly more of an abstraction and not wholly a pleasant one if we rightly decypher the plau of campaign which she enjoins upon fleda as for fleda herself well the mind and heart of a girl such as mr james seems to have in his eye is an unexplored region to any man so anything may be put there and no one has any right to say it cannot be there the only real fault in the construction of the book is the fire at the end a catastrophe of that kind has no business in a novel unless it be either cause or effect now here so far as the story goes it is neither,britain
B4696,['8510875'],  new novels checkmate a novel in three volumes by j sheridan le fanu hurst and blackett checkmate is a very well written novel of its kind and the mechanism of the plot is constructed with most wonderful ingenuity an illegitimate member of an old and wealthy family commits a murder of the thurtell type and then of course goes abroad where he meets with a skilful surgeon who cuts his face into a new shape thus disguised lie inherits a large fortune and returning to london appears upon the scene in the character of a thirdrate count of monte christo his energies and his wealth are however devoted to a most laudable object for we find him endeavouring by fair means or foul to marry a daughter of the house with which lie has a sinister connection and to restore the family to its original splendour by settling upon her the million or two of which he stands possessed the design is a meritorious one but in the execution of it the hero bungles dreadfully partly because he is rash enough to commit a second and absolutely unnecessary murder and partly because he employs as his agents several very low jew moneylenders at the very moment when his schemes seem most likely to succeed he is checkmated by the production of some most marvellous evidence as to the remodelling of his features which conclusively identifies him as an escaped assassin to be arrested for murder would indeed checkmate most men but the janus of mr lo fanu has the ingenuity to convert  checkmate into a stalemate by poisoning himself in prison and leaving his princely fortune to the lady upon whom in the most outrageously illegal manner he has been endeavouring to force his hand such a life i indeed  arduous and direful there is some ingenuity or rather novelty in the notion which is the hinge of mr lc fanus plot of  criminal who baffles the detective police by submitting to the taliacotian operation and the various crimes with which the story brims over are certainly very skilfully manipulated but we have at present far too many novels of this kind and are hardly disposed to welcome another very heartily however well it may be written or however ingeniously constructed no matter how skilfully the l newgate calendar  may be dressed up it remains the  newgate calendar after all novels nf this stamp are interesting no doubt in a certain sense  but such merit as they have is even at its best of alow order dumas is facile princeps in his school and the  count of monte christo is a masterpiece which no one need regret to have read once the same can hardly be said of dumas other works and it certainly cannot be said of the productions of our english school of melodramatic novelists anyone who has read twenty such novels as checkmate has contrived to waste a very great deal of time which might easily have been better spent even if such reading does no harm it certainly does no good and it would seem as if the taste for this highlyflavoured kind of fiction like the taste for opium and for drams grows with indulgence mr le fanu shows undoubted ability and it is a pity that he should not exercise it in i higher field the labour involved in halfadozen such melodramas as  checkmate  might produce one work which could be read not only with interest but with pleasure and even with profit for the present we have had enough and more than enough of murder bigamy forgery and so forth and it is almost time that a good writeras mr le fanu isshould essay something a little less transpontine life is or ought to be the province of the novelist and life consists of something more than a perpetual attempt to evade the grasp of a detective officer,britain

B8156,"['9429962', '4364890']",  the small house at allington new novels by anthony trollope with illustrations smith elder  co the small house at allington has already been as thronged with interested visitors as strawberry hill the ten days before the sale nearly everybody has heard of it most people have read it and now that it has come before the public complete in two beautiful volumes with mr millaiss illustrations retained those who have possessed their soul in patience until it should be completed will be able to reap their reward whilst those who have taken it in monthly fractions will go over the ground again with something of regret recognising the old landmarks where the story broke off leaving them hungry and impatient at the months pause that must intervene before the next instalment certainly if the dietary rule  to rise from table with an appetite holds good for the reading of novels the small house at allington has strenuously enforced it and many readers at the moment would have rashly offered to forfeit three weeks in the month if they might thus have learned the progress of the story a little further ahead it is characteristic of this story that the characters are all living human beings and there has been as much speculation whether lily dale would marry johnny eames as about any marriage on the tapis as the morning pott phrases it in any town or village in great britain readers have made it a personal question and there have been vehement discussions as to the probability of her forgiving adolphus crosbie and being happy with him at last after he had been punished sufficiently for the sake of the moral and had profited by his sufferings so as to come to his right mind many hoped that he would break loose from his slavery to lady alexandrina and her family before the weddingday and go back to his lawful queen mr trollope has shown great skill in the management of the character of adolphus crosbie he has kept the reader in charity with him in spite of all hus sins even his faithlessness to lily is made so natural that the candid reader cannot feel himself a pharisee and hug himself with complacency that he is not even like adolphus crosbie the temptation to which he yielded was so suited to his weakness and the point of view from which he saw things is given so fairly that it is impossible not to understand how he fell from his own steadfastness under the enchantments of de courcy castle there is no false excuse made for him no palliation offered except the truth which appeals to each  consider thyself lest thou also be tempted the whole of that passage of life in de courcy castle under the high pressure got up for those distinguished visitors lady dumbello and mr plantagenet palliser is admirably true as a sketch of manners and customs in a great house of that class and true to the human nature of the different characters concerned in the story the gradual development of crosbies mistake the recoil upon himself the retribution which arises from the nature of things and not from any machinery of human justice are vt ry subtly and skilfully indicated it shows too what one is glad to have shownthe genuine human conscience that lives and moves under all the apparent selfish indifference of society to matters not immediately personal the drawing of the characters in  the small house at allington is vigorous and lifelike the scene of lord de guest in his encounter with the bull the familyscenes at the gazebees house in st johns wood the buying of carpets and the other pre matrimonial arrangements are very clever the scenes at lilys home with mrs dale the squire and the two young ladies are good but the reader regards them with respect rather than with lively interest whilst the scenes at the boardinghouse are vulgar and absolutely unpleasant except for poor mrs roper there cannot be the smallest interest the secret of this falling off is that in the picture of life in burton crescent mr trollope has put no touches of kindly feeling like those with which he redeems the poor old worldly illused countess and even mitigates ones detestation of lady alexandrina by showing the very damp and dreary home to which she was brought as for johnny eames himself he is rather a bore no woman could ever feel the smallest interest in him unless it were a kind elderly woman like lady julia de guest his entanglement with amelia roper is fatal to all his pretensions as a hero and he behaves as ill to her as he knows how mr trollope feels it necessary to apologise for two kisses bestowed on that young lady but they are the only redeeming traits in the whole affair with all his faults the readers sympathy is with crosbie he goes through his bad business with lady alexandrina in a dignified manner accepting the consequences of his own fault with patience and a manly endeavour to make the best of things the story cannot be considered as concluded in the interest of a wide circle of readers we demand with emphasis of mr trollope that he tell us the further fortunes of the characters in the small house at allington the only chapter we do not wish to have reopened is that which concerns the inmates of burton crescent the illustrations are admirable for grace and truthfulness our favourite ia perhaps the one which illustrates crosbiea married life lally alexandrina sitting in discontent and crosbie standing in sorrowful dissatisfaction on the hearthrug tell a tale that needs no words to endorse it the scene on the bridge with lady julia and poor johnny eames is equally good the expression of kindness and sympathy thrown into the plain face of a middleaged woman gives it a positive beauty  the small iiouse at allington does anybody want to know where to find the best and nicest girls in all eiglandthe kindest the purest the pleasantest young ladies we have ever met wnith at least in a book  they used to live in the  small house at allington for aught we knowmr trollope knows better than we domiss lily dale who became mliss dale when her sister married the doctor at guestwicklives with her iiiother still and if there are no better and nobler men in the world than such as mr trollope has yet introduced to her acquaintance we would have this most loveable of women abide still in her maiden home crosbie adolphus crosbie of sebrifghts club is a selfish heartless coward a slave to the vain pursuit of social ambition johnny eames with all his frankness and good feeling is deficientt in strength of mind neither of these in our opinion could be worthy of lily dale no one shall ever call her his wife if mr trollope her guardian will follow our advice when he has to lead her forth again as we hope he means to do in his next novel of this series we like the custom which he has adopted on the precedent set by mr thackeray inl certain of his worksthat of bringring into a later story among its background figrures a few of the most interesting characters of a former tale there is the dear ol0 warden that pattern of christian mneekness and fidelity whom crosbie meets at the cathedral door of barchester towers  there is the pushing and prosperous archdeacon with his daughter lady dumbello a mere monument of fashionable elegance a superb and stately belgra via doll in the same manner if mr trollope pleases we shall again see lily dale she will make the most agreeable and estimable of old maids it will be such a comfort to her mother the widow that lily should remain at the small houseit will be such a blessing to the children of dr and mrs crofts at guestwickthat for mlrs dales sake and for bells sake whom we care to see happy as well as lily we would rather not have her married and carried away this is what comes of being an angel your friends will never let you go about your own business and the allington people cannot spare lily dale of course they were angry with mr crosbie when he broke his promise and nearly broke her heart but they must have secretly rejoiced tat she would stay in their village probably for life the rader cannot help sympathising with the allingtonian interest nor can he believe that it would have been happier for the girl herself to have got a fashionable london husband and a showy house in princess royalterrace tyburnia where 1ady alexandrina crbi tasted the bitter fruits of her conquest it is a question after all whether the nice people should invariably be married there is such a state as singlebleswoedsd for either sex and we hold with st paul that if it is a good thing to be married it is also a good thing not to be marred uies where the couple are personally so fitted to each other that neithe he nor she can live a good life apart this is not the case  lily dale though it may be so with one or other of her lovers and we do not like either of them well enough to give her sp to them the best man in the book is dr crofts who really deserves to of such a wife as bell but he is a lucky fellow indeed to obtaie lily for a bell swur and no worse motherinltaw than the widow dale the country doctor with his hard work and mode income who connects himself with this falitly of the smal house comes off with the happiest lot lord de guest is a fine specimen of the pi ount gede man and so is mr dale of the great house but lord do cots is a tyrant a miser and a blackguard as men of an6 cls sometimes be there is n typical earl though mr 1rofop x his former stories gave us a typical archdeacon and ot bw siastical officer tb smell hon a by acato troisg tw smith rider  co bglt we cannot say that he shows equal discrimination in every other instance his portraitiures of the uneducated vulgar and elypcially of the cockney whom mr dickens understands so ell are o10 better than a coarse caricature the people at mrs vpers boardinghouse are not to be compared with those at  lltodgerss or with some in mr thackerays earlier sketches tr tdloies humnour is of a fine and delicate quality the edge of whiich is sadly blunted when he attempts to use it upon such niriterrl as the lupexes and the cradells in the burtoncrescent chalpters of this novel or the shopnmen bagsmen andl london pelit ices of recent fiction and their female relatives his talent is that of quiet domestic comedy  when he ventures into farcietl exaggeration he always makes a mistake w1ith less ptwbr of syupaxthy than dickens he is unalle to interest his rctader in the feelings and fortunes of a lowlived sort of folk they sell wholly unattractive and contemptible when they fall iiito his hands as they did in the insolent writiigs of theodore hook tlhat mr trollope however entertains a sincere respect for thee working classes we will not doubt though he appears to dislike the families of small tradesmen whose meanness and ignorant vanity he sometimes labours to expose he had better let it alone  the time for satirising entire classes of english society has sone by the period of twentyfive or thirty yearrs since boz and titiiarsh began to write has vastly improved the average standard of intelligence and good manners in the lower middleclass population of this country servility and brutality are now the rare exception where once they are said to have been the rule we shall all please god  be ladies and gentlemen in the good time comling then shall we meet with honour and veracity behind the dignified counter and with the highest graces of chivalry on the cabstand where the gallant coachman putting his tennlvson into his pocket shall descend to open the door of his vehicle with a bow andl gather up his reins for an undisputed sixpenny fare in the meantime we could wish mr trollope with his liberal political opinions and kindly nature to refrain from drawing odious and uncoinely pictures of the little people of the cockney world but if we take away the burtoncrescent boardinghouse with its sordid habits and ridiculous airsif we keep this novelist to the domestic interiors of cultivated society in town and country or to the clubs of pallmall and the official parlours of whitehall where he is so thoroughly at homewhat a truth of portraiture what a pleasant and wellassured familiarity are there in mr trollopes sketches of the wluper middle class we do not hesitate to pronounce them better in some respects than those either of dickens or thackeray both of whom are undoubtedly superior to mr trollope in humour and wit in imagination land creative power we may turn for example to that entertaining first volume of the con 1 ill in which lovel the widower alternately with franiley parsonage delights and edifies the judicious reader in the former how much hearty fun how much sly and sarcastic wisdom how much dramatic force  but in the latter particularly in those connubial trials and counsels of the rev mark robarts and his wife how just an appreciation of the private household of a wellbred english family with its decorous virtues and the cares and duties of its social position to be strictly observed this indeed is mr trollopes peculiar theme he is far less successful when he seeks to delineate the boisterous and eccentric ways of that bohemian region where pendennis and warrington sojourned in their frank carnerade7ie upon town on the other hand mr trollope is wonderfully well acquainted with the little politics of the ladies their petty ambitions jealousies and tender affections and with their confidential talk by themselves the honest maidenly conversations between the two sisters bell and lily about their respective lovers contrasted with the combined maieuvres of lady de courcy and her daughters who want to secure a husband for alexandrina and their subsequent behaviour towards him when he cannot escape from the match are related with that profound knowledge of womankind in which mr trollope excels most other novelists of either the male or the female sex mrs dale too is a real true woman in her virtues and her faults a widow but forty years of age with a pair of children and left rather poor she has fancied it her duty to renounce all the pleasumres of life and shut herself up in a proud humility which gives offence to her late husbands brother who wishes to bestow a part of his own fortune upon the girls his nieces and to provide them a handsome establishment in the world the tenancy of the small house at allingtonnext to the jilting of lily dale by crosbie is the proper subject of the story mirs dale very naturally quarrels with herbrotherinlaw the squire whohas sought to usurp something like a paternal authority over miss bell with the benevolent design of compelling her to accept the heir to his estates the daughters like brave highspirited girls as they are taking their mothers prt and rebelling against the dictatorial patronage of their uncle support her resolution to quit the small house in which he has allowed her to live rentfree it is just one of those family dispates in which all parties have meant well but some pique or scruple has arisen and being exaggerated by a warm temper has set them at variance without any serious cause again we remark that mr trollope understands this sort of imbroglio which is of the very essence of light comedy more perfectly than it is under stood by most other writers of fiction he makes it in fact one of the principal motives in all his best stones he develops the deects of temper in all the transactions of domestic life temper tad woman are certainly two of the most important elements of the inodern novel and mr trollope is master of both we might perhaps regret the speed with which mr trollope produces new stories of very unequal merit if this last were not undeniably the best some of his tales it must be confessed have been quite unworthy of his geniusclumsy and unmeaning daubs upon the canvas of farcical fiction which requires a broader brush and more vigorous hand in the genteel comedy style of painting with finer strokes and on a smoother surface the novel we have now before us is a masterpiece of art enough has been said of the management of its characters and incidents to show the interest of the plot which should not be revealed prematurely to those who have the book still to read its greatest charm as we mentioned in the outset of this review lies in the two ldaughters of the widow dale who are the most natural young women the most attractive and the best behaved without a grain of either prudery or sentimentalism that any contemporary novelist has invented we begs that the author will go on to manufacture a great many more good and pleasant girls of the same quality and let us have the world stocked with them as early as possible to keep out the intolerable shedevils on the one hand and the impracticable shei saints on the other who swarm in the opposite ranks of the criminal and the  serious  novel there is something very beautiful in the simplest movements of poor lily after she is smitten with that cruel injury which has bruised the noble flower and cast it down in the garden of her home once only for a moment she has wept on her mothers bosom without a word of anger or complaint then she has lifted up her head and smiled through all her sorrow a longr illness has spared her the bitter condolence of her neighbours the appointed time for crosbies marriage with her rival has come round lily wakes in the morning by her mothers side it is the 14th of february mamma she said how cold theyll be her mother had announced to her the fact of the black frost and these were the first words she spoke   i fear their hearts will be cold also said mrs dale she ought not to have said so she was transgressing the acknowledged rule of the house in saying any word that could be construed as being inimca to crosbie or his bride  why should their hearts be cold oh mamma that is a terrible thing to say why should their hearts be cold i hope it may not be so of course you do of course we all hope it he was not cold hearted at any rate a man is not coldhearted because he does not know himself mamma i want you to wish for their happiness

not be happythat is that he and i would not be happy together if we were married  he was very foolish to fall in love with me and s was i very foolish to let him love me at a moments noticewithou a thought as it were i was so proud of having him that i gave myself up to him at a moments notioe without giving him a chance of thinking of it in a week or two it was done who could expect that such an engagement should be lasting      bell she said stopping her other speech suddenly at what oclock do people get married in london    and then she remembered that that other lady might at this very moment possess the name which she had once been so proud to think that she would bear herself i think ill get up now bell only is so frightfully cold that rm afraid theres a beautiful fire but the

B4968,"['8993792', '2867530', '4341412', '4987878']",  untold the last of the saxon kings loudon saturday june 17 1848 reviews by the athor of rienzi  the last of the barons c 3 vols bentley x will be a misfortune attending the criticism of this new and in many respects able work of sir e bulwer ly ton that those who write on itand indeed those who read itcan scarcely determine whether to treat it as history or as fiction if as history it is written with too much of the air of mere invention if as fiction it includes too many of the details ofthe chronicler this is an evil attending the choice of the subjectand one which though many have made the attempt only one author of the class has been able in any great degree to overcome to this rare and almost wonderful exception it is not necessary that we should more expressly refer but we must add that even in that case the experiment however generally successful occasioned many important distortions and perversions of factsand we will venture to say that it has produced especially in the present generation much doubt confusion and error as to characters opinions and events these observations are in a manner challenged by sir e b lyttons dedicatory preface and by the notes which he has placed at the foot of his page and appended to each of his volumes they appear to set up a claim for his fiction notwithstanding his denial of the pretension to the dignity and importance of history we hold it impossible to reconcile the two satisfactorily either let us have a production of mere fancy or let us have a book depending mainly on its facts and statements the value of which can be measured by ordinary and known standards the author commences with informing us that he has abandoned thc usual course of historical narrative in his incidentshe makes a merit of perverting what has hitherto been received in relation to the connexion between harold and edith we admit at once that for his purpose he had 1 reason for making the changebecause itrenders the story not merely more interesting but on every account more readable on this point sir e b lytton observes  the love tory of harold nnd edith is told differently from the wellknown legend which implies a leis pure connexion but the whole legend respecting the edeva faira edith the fair whose name meets us in the doomsday roll rests upon very slight authority considering its popular acceptance and the reasons for my alterations will be sufficiently obvious in a work intended not only for general perusal but which on many accounts i hope may be entrusted fearlessly to the young that is to wy he made this important deviation because he did not wish to have his novel banished from drawingroom tables and the boudoirs of he ordinary readers of such productions we should have complained less of aberrations of this kind if the writer had not been rather ostentatious of his authorities from hich he clearly means it to be inferred that n all the main incidents of his story he has adhered to the most authentic representations e do not dispute that in many instances he lias done sobut we think that he has thereby rendered his work less attractive his archaegy spoils his book as a fictionjust as his departures from the same injure it as history he has thus put a curb on his imagination both regardspersons and eventsand would have produced a better and more popular work had he subjected himself to none of these restraints as it is the old figure of a man dancing a hornpipe in fetters recurs to the reader we may be surprised that he can do so well thus loaded but feel sure that he could have done much better unencumbered in fact the author has most succeeded where he has most rejected the inconvenient restraints to which he elsewhere submitted and those portions of his three volumes will be read with most pleasure where he has given way to the variety and gracefulness of his own fancy and the vigour and boldness of his own imagination the description for instance of all that relates to the war of harold against gryffyth in wales is unsurpassed in interest and power by anything from his pen we will select our first specimen from this part of vol ii premising that gryffyth his queen and his starving followers have been shut up in a mountain fastness and that harold by a monk and a young norman has sent them a message of mercy on submission  as the monk ceased the thrill of the audience was perceptible and a deep silence waa followed by a general murmur as if to constrain the king then the pride of the despot chief rose up to second the wrath of the suspecting man the red spot flushed the dark cheek and he tossed the neglected hair from his brow he made one stride towards thc monk and said in a voice loud and deep and slow rolling far up the hillmonk thou hast said and now hear the reply ofthe son of llewellyn the true heir of roderic the great who from the heights of eryri saw all the lands of the cvmrian sleeping under the dragon of uther king was i bom and king will i die i will not ride by the bide of the saxon to the feet of edward the son of the spoiler i will not to purchase base

command the fruits of our own fields no die we may but not mute and revengeletw go back whispering warrior go back false son of cymryand tell harold to look well to his walla and his trenches we will

he deems us hold a feast in his walls which the vultures of snowdon illume their pinions to share  rash man and unhappy cried the monk what curse drawest thou down on thy head wilt thou be the murderer of thy men in strife unavailing and vain  heaven holds thee guilty of all the blood thou shalt causeto be shed be dumb hush thy screech lying raven exclaimed gryffyth his eyes darting tire and his slight form dilating  once priest and monk went before us to inspire not to daunt and our cry alleluia  was taught us by the saints ofthe church on the day when saxons fierce and many as harolds fell on the field of maesgarmon no the curse is on the head of the invader not on those who defend hearth and altar yea as the song to the bard the cursk leaps through my veins and rushes forth from my lips by the land they have ravaged by the gore they have spilt on these crags our last refuge below the earn on yon heights where the dead stir to hear mei launch the curse of the

to the last the ploughshare may pass over our cities but the soil shall be trod by our steps and our deeds keep our language alive in the songs of our bards nor in the great judgement day shall any race but the race of cymry rise from their graves in this corner of earth to answer for the sins of the brave so impressive the voice so grand the brow and sublime the wild gesture of the king as he thus spoke that not only the monk himself was awed  not only though he understood not the words did the norman knight bow his head as a child when the lightning he fears as by instinct flashes out from the cloudbut even the sullen and widespreading discontent at work among most of the chiefs was arrested for a moment but the spearmen and multitude above excited by the tidings of safety to life and worn out by repeated defeat and the dread fear of famine too remote to hear the king were listening eagerly to the insidious addresses of the two stealthy conspirators creeping from rank to rank and already they begun to sway and move and sweep slowly down towards the king recovering his surprise the norman again neared gryffyth and began to reurge his mission of peace but the chief waived him back sternly and said aloud though in saxon no secrets can pass between harold and me thus much alone take thou back as answeri thank the earl for myself my queen and my people noble have been his courtesies as foe as foe i thank himas king defy the torque he hath returned to my hand he shall see again ere the sun set messengers ye aro answered withdraw and speed fast that we may pass not your steps on the road the monk sighed and cast a look of holy compassion over the circle nnd a pleased man was he to see in the faces of most there that the king was alone in his fierce defiance then lifting again the rood he turned away and with him went the norman the above and nearly all that belongs to it is inventionand very admirably invented it is we know nothing much more animating and inspiring than the whole that relates to the catking as gryftyth is called by the norman his struggles his defeats and his suffering we venture to think that sir e b lytton w much mistaken when he represents not merely the clergy but the young soldiers and courtiers of the reign of the confessor as well acquainted with the literature of greece and rome it is true that as regards abbots and monks he is in compensation very severe he does justice to such ecclesiastics as lanfranc and aclred but he makes an abbot who figures prominently in one or two scenes ignorant ofthe commonest rudiments of latinwhile a younger brother in his company is lost in wonder at the learning of his superior the following is a short part of their dialogue  the kings norman favourites at least honoured the church that is true said an abbot 4 and an it were not for two things i should love the norman better than the saxon what are they my father asked an aspiring young monk inprints quoth the abbot proud of the one latin word he thought he knew but that as we see was an error they cannot speak so as to be understood and i fear me much they incline to mere carnal learning here was a sanctified groancount william himself spoke to me in latin  continued the abbot raising his eyebrows did he wonderful  exclaimed several voices and what did you answer holy fathermarrysaid the abbot solemnly i replied inprinisgood said the young monk with a look of profound admiration we have introduced this extract by way of contrast with the learning attributed to other classes even of gryftyth the catking of wales we are told that his mind had turned from the literature of rome to the legends and songs and chronicles of his land nnd other personages both saxon and norman refer to greek and latin authors with fur too much familiarity homeric fables and homeric personages are mentioned and alluded to by the characters and though we may be willing to admit that more learning existed among our anglosaxon forefathers than has by many been supposed yet we most seriously doubt whether it is consistent with the state of knowledge of the time to put quotations from horace into the mouth of a young soldierstill more that he should employ such in conversation with a rude saxon from the weald of kent of course what the author introduces on his own account and in his own person in the progress of the narrative is not liable to any such objection  and whether it did or did not require to be translated in ad 1052 it is quite clear that sir e b lytton is of opinion that it requires to be translated in ad 1848for we cannot call to mind an instance in which he has employed a scrap of latin where he has not done his readers the favour to render it into english whatever might be the case in england in the eleventh century wo are sure that greek was not studied in italy even in thc thirteenth centuryand that dante knew nothing of homer unless at secondhand in connexion with this matter we may here not unfitly notice the great number of saxon and anglosaxon words employed by sir e b lytton without explanation even where explanation seemed most necessary if the absence of this explanation should have the effect of inducing the readers of  harold to make themselves in some degree proficients in the great and noble language of their remote ancestors so much thc better  but in the mean time it might not have been improper to have added an interpretation in brackets or otherwise  provided it were really necessary that the author should go out of his way to employ terms so little understood by the great body of persons to whom he addresses himself sometimes the context will enable the reader to guess what is meant but generally we think he will be quite at a loss for the meaning we copy a fewand but a fewregarding which we are confident even welleducated persons will be at some loss weregeld lithtmen ceorl suhcendinen cyst mane uses dour cnehts quern  which with many more are of perpetual occurrence we say nothing of such words as thegn which might have been more intelligibly and less cacophonously written thaneor of zemmes which sir e b lytton himself seems sometimes to use indifferently with gemsbut we should like to know what is gained by the rejection of a word having the same meaning and in daily employment the author seems to have crammed himself from mr deyncourts folios as he admits in his prefatory epistleand then fancied that matters familiar to him must also be well known to others this is an ordinary error the great reputation which the author has justly acquired enables him easily to afford that such minor faults and blemishes should be pointed out for this reason we tell him that northeast is not to suppose because he sees in a plan of london of the middle of the sixteenth century two rings marked down for the baiting of bulls and bears and because the sport may be mentioned by fitzstephen that these places existed on the same spot in the middle of the eleventh century his mention of these rings forms part of a very interesting but not a very accurate description of london before the conquest in his first volume the truth is that we have no sufficient materials for such a description and on this account we are willing to take sir e b lyttons fanciful representation which is highly picturesque he is seldom at fault when he relies on himself and his own resources one instance to the contrary may however be pointed out near the end of his second volume where william then count or dukeof normandy challenges harold to bend his bowan exertion to which the saxon noble is not accustomed and which therefore he declines the meaning of bending a bow is not as sir e b lytton seems to imagine the pulling of a clothyard arrow to the head after the bow has been strung it is stringing a bow an operation requiring both art and strength and dangerous to the weak and the unskilful of the story itself we have said little because the rude outline of nearly the whole of it is to be found in historyif history it deserve at that early date to be called the loves of harold and edith form but a small portion of the tale and as that is the most imaginative portion so iu several respects it is the best the character of the heroine is delicately and touchingly drawn  and her feminine sweetness and tenderness are excellently set off by and contrasted with the more masculine proportions and appearance of hilda her magical and mysterious grandmotherwho from first to last acts a very prominent part in all that relates to harolds affection and to his ambition she is a very grand personage who adheres to the saxon faith rejecting the christian creed and resorts to all the solemn and awful incantations belonging to her ancient superstitious it must be confessed that she now and then reminds us of norna in sir w scotts  pirate and of meg merrilies in his  guy mannering but it is only for a momentand in such a manner as could not have been avoided by the author what follows is a small part of a scene in which the two lovers and hilda are introduced in the second volume   there is no joy for me returned edith plaintively and i have that on my heart she added with a sudden and almost fierce change of tone  which at last i will dare to speak i reproach thee hilda that thou hast marred all my life that thou hast duped me with dreams and let me alone in despair speak on said hilda calmly as a nurse to a froward child hast thou not told me from the first dawn of my wondering reason that mv life and lot were interwoven withwith the word mad and daring must out with those of harold the peerless  but for that which my fancy took from thy lips as a law i had never been so vain and so frantic i had never watched each play of his face and treasured each word from his lips i had never made my life but a part of his lifeall my soul but the shadow of his sun but for that i had hailed the calm of the cloisterbut for that i had glided in peace to my grave and nownow o hilda edith paused and that break had more eloquence than any words she could command and she resumed quickly thou knowest that these hopes were but dreamsthat the law ever stood between him and meand that it was guilt to love him i knew the law answered hilda but the law of fools is to the wise as the cobweb swung over the brake to the wing of the bird ye are sibbe to each other some five times removed and therefore an old man at rome saith that ye ought not to wed when the shavelings obey the old man at rome and put aside their own wives and frillas and abstain from the wine cup and the chase and the brawl i will stoop to hear of their lawswith disrelish it may be but without scorn it is no sin to love harold and no monk and no law shall prevent your union on the day appointed to bring ye together form and heart hilda hilda madden me not with joy cried edith starting up in rapturous emotion her young face dyed with blushes and all her renovated beauty so celestial that hilda herself was almost awed as if by the vision of freya the northern venus charmed by a spell from the halls of asgard  but that day is distant renewed the vaia what mattera what matters cried the pure child of nature i ask but hope enoughoh enough if we are but wedded on the borders of the grave  lo then said hilda behold the sunfthts dawns again as she spoke the vaia stretchy her arm and through the intersticed columns of th fane edith saw the large shadow of a man cast over the still sward presently into the space of the eire came harold her beloved his face was pale jjiv grief yet recent but perhaps more than everdiiajv was in his step and command on his brow for he felt that now alone with him rested the might of saxon england and what royal robe so invests with imperial majesty the form of man as the pare sense of power responsible in an earnest soulthon comest said hilda in the hour i predicted atthe setting ofthe sun and the rising of the star vak1 said harold gloomily  i will not oppose my sense to thy prophecies for who shall judge of that powet of which he knows not the elements  or despaetht marvel of which he cannot detect the imposture the earlier portion of the story is perhaps too much made up of obscure history to be very interesting and the only incidents in the first volume that may be said really to belong to a novel consist of the return of earl godwin and his four sons from banishment and the declaration by harold of his love for edithwho as we have seen stood within the forbidden degrees of consanguinity to him the incidents acquire a more rapid movement in the second volumeand the interest is powerfully wound up in the third they therefore who pause and look back when they have arrived at the end of 300 pages will feel dissatisfied let them wait until they have finished the whole and their dissatisfaction will then be that they have come to the end of the work it is not unusual in productions of this clan to find that the person intended for the hero ii not the hero in fact such in a degree is the case with harold in various parts of that story he is not so much its hero as william duke of normandy the victor at hastings and sir e b lytton has drawn the character of william with such force and fullness that when ht and harold are together it is not to be disputed that william attracts more attention if not interest than his younger rival we do not say that the affections of the reader are not with harold but the genius the resources the mental power and subtlety of william engross our admirationand would make us feel certain even if we knew nothing historically of the issue that he must triumph we admit all along the courage and generosity of harold but as the author tells us his parts are comparatively slowand when in normandy he was outwitted and would have been more so hut for the sagacity and penetration of his little nephew haco this may be true as history bot it is not right as artand here we have a particular example of the difficulties of the historical novel we cannot go thoroughly and heartily along with any hero whom we expect to set duped and who we know in the end will be conquered  iarold the last of the saxon kings in three volumes london bentley 1848 it is by no means our intention to enter into any lengthened investigation of the merits of this work nor is it necessary so to do sir bulwver lytton is not a new aspirant after literary honours but as we had long since been given to understand that he had made his last appearance before the literary world the present emanation from his pen naturally attracts a considerable share of attention nor is it without good reason that this attention is excited the present woi k may worthily rank with its predecessors on the score of merit cast long back in our history the plot unravels itself before our eyes as naturally as if it were a tale of yesterday our author tells us he had long pondered upon the idea of founding an historical romance upon the norman invasion and accordingly having done so he has rendered the subject completely his own and has thus been enabled to present us with details minute and graphic concerning that period of our history the auce was one fraught with interest as being the last hours of the old saxon mnonarchy the legend of harold and edith is related but differently to the received opinion concerning it and this has been done out of consideration to the younger portions of the reading public into whose hands such a work may naturally be expected to faul superstition has much to do with the agency by which the events are brought about but it would seem almost impossible to discover these superstitions from the narratives of these timesthey were believed in thought to have a part in every action of life so that unless we consent to listen to the voice of superstition we must not expect to obtain a correct idea of our saxon forefathers no terror is sought to be inepired by these ghostly aids they are simply used as valuable assistants in times of emergency the author has succeeded in portraying a very beautiful character in edith she is firm noble and affectionate loving wvith an unselfish love that teaches her that the splendour of affection is manifested not by basking in the enjoyment it affords butt where necessary in sacrificing it upon a high and holy shrine her love for harold was too strong to wish to plunge him into danger for her sake even though it brought her all she coveted on earththe desire to be near him harold is a very fine creation admirably sustained throughout we may on the whole pronounce harald to be one of the most striking of sir bulwer lyltons ever striking novels there is something highly classical in the style which tells at once of the bent of the atithors mind and the high and ennobling studies to which hie has been accustomed  harold the last ofthe saxon kinqa vy sir e bulwer lytton london bentley 1i a somewhat affected and pedantic dedicatory epistle sir edward flulwer lytton informs us that this nvwel is meant to instruct the ignorant reader as well ts to delight the mere seeker after amusement he also threatens us with a series of similar stories in which the earlier history of england is to be done into romance4 furnishing what lie considers genuine pictures of old english morals men and manners and exposing to the ignorant eye of his fellowcountrymen the true motives and characters of the great personages who have hitherto been doomed to be described only by professed historians and chroniclers a man more utterly inadequate to the task than the brilliant author of pelhamn we can scarcely conceive that one who looks upon pelham as a gentleman upon the last days of pomopeii as a elaaical story and upon lucretia as a tale favourable to virtue should also look upon himself as brmed to somprobend the motie of th dark and the mediaeval ages is perhaps not a thing to create much surprise but at the same time we cannot but regard it as a mere literary hallucination to which we cordially trust that the public voice will give no encouragement whatever if indeed the public find it half such hard work to get through the first volume of harold as we have found it ourselves we have small fear for the result if they smile with us at the authors pedantry at his amusing patronising kindness towards the simple reader at the benevolence with which he translates a latin sentence for the benefit of the unlearned at the hodgepodge of old phraseology and the style of the chroniclers intermingled with the true bulwerian sentiment and language at the affectation with which dialogue and narrative is interlarded with scraps of norman french saxon technicalities and names of common objects and cant ejaculations if they yawn with us over the authors tedious historical disquisitions over the ossianic raptures of hilda and his very lively and exciting fragments on verbal derivations and the literary references which thickly strew his pages if besides all this they can see into the secret bitter dislike of that devoted spirit of religion which with whatever personal weaknesses was the animating spirit of the confessorking we have little expectation that the world will petition sir edward to continue his coquetting with the muse of history or to turn the events of our annals into a salmngundi of truth ard falsehood from all this our readers will not suppose that we have found the perusal of harold the last of the saxon kings a very pleasant refreshment in the hot weather of july in truth we have toiled through its pages with a dogged perseverance but with little pleasure and no interest here and there indeed the story becomes more lively and brilliant and the volumes are not without many passages worthy of the fame of its author especially towards the terniination when sir edward drops more and more his assumed office of annalist and writes like a man of common sense his tale becomes more readable and lifelike until all at once with the beginning of some new chapter the style of the modern novelist is laid aside and a foolish bad imitation of the antique cast of chronicle is thrust upon the reluctant attention we need scarcely say that sir e b lyttons ideas of the religious principles of the time of his story are in the last degree superficial and incorrect he writes as much nonsense about plriests and monks and relics and churchservices as the scribblers of the vulgarest tales about jesuits and convents his portraits of such mien as king edward and his notions of the sentiments by which he was guided are as laughable misconceptions of matters of fact as ever came forth from the pen of romancer or polemic the scene of the monarchs deathbed is one of the choicest specimens of absurdity we ever were fated to read it will please and edify our readers to see sir edwards ideas as to how a christian king dies  the king lay for some moments silent but evidently striving to recollect his thoughts meanwhile the two arch prelates bent over him stigand eagerly alred fondly then raising himself on one arm while with the other he pointed to harold at the foot of the bed the king said  your hearts i see are with harold the earl so be it je loctroi at these words he fell back on his pillow a loud shriek burst from his wifes lips all crowded around he lay as the dead at the cry and the indescribable movement of the throng the physician came quick from the lower part of the hall he made his way abruptly to the bedside and said chidingly  air give him air the throng parted the leech moistened the kings pale lips with the cordial but no breath seemed to come forth no pulse seemed to beat and while the two prelates knelt before the human body and by the blessed rood the rest descended the dais and hatened to depart harold only remained but he had passed from the foot to the head of the bed  the crowd had gained the centre of the hall when a sound that startled them as if it had come from the grave chained every footstepthe sound of the kings voice loud terribly distinct and full as with the vigour of youth restored all turned their eyes appalled all stood spellbound there mate the king upright on the bed his face men above the kneeling prelates and his eyes bright and shining down the hail  yyu he odd dellberatelyi ea ts shall be a nl vision or a sale malon pant me almigbty one the power of speech to tell it he aused a

standing mute and with the paleness of dead men by the side of my bed  these words were said so calmly and as it were so rationally that their import became doubly awful from the cold precision of the tone a shudder passed through the assembly and each man shrunk from the kings eye which seemed to each man to dwell on himself suddenly that eye altered in it cold beam suddenly the voice changed its

truthtelling correctness veneration for the relics of saints is of course a fertile theme for ridicule throughout the story ania the poor king is painted as ready to sacrifice the lives and i appiness of living thousands for the sake of the bones of the deceased the efforts of the writer to show up the confessor as a drivelling child of superstition are indeed sufficient proof of his inadequacy to the task he has undertaken the following conversation between edward and harold is but one of a whole clas of passages  when the son of leofric had left the chamber the king rose wearily and said in norman french to which language he always yearningly returned when with those who could speak it  beaufrre and bin aimw in what trifles must a king pass his life i and all this while matters grave and urgent demand me know that eadmer the cheapman waits without and bath brought me dear and good man the thumb of st jude what thought of delight and this unmannerly son of strife with his jays voice and wolfs eyes screaming at me for earldoms ioh the folly of man  naught naught very nought i sir and king said harold i it ill becomes me to arraign your pious desires but these relics are of vast qost our coasts are ill defended and the dane yet lays claim to tour kingdom three thousand pounds of silver and more does it need to repair even the old wall of london and southweorc  three thousand

sighed  vex not yourself my lord i will see to the defences of london for thanks to your grace my revenues are large while my wants are simple i seek you now to pray your leave to visit my earldom my lithsmen murmur at my absence and grievances many and sore have arisen in my exile the king stared in terror and his look was that of a child when about to be left in the dark  nay nay i cannot spare thee beau frare thou curbest all these stiff thegns thou leavest me time for the devout moreover thy father thy father i will not be left to thy father i love him not  my father sid harold mournfully  returns to his own earldom and of all our house you will have but the mild face of your queen by your aide the kings lip writhed at that hinted rebuke or implied consolation  dith the queen he aid after a sught pause is pious and good and she bath never gainsaid my will and h bath et before her as a model the chate susanmak a i u worthy man from youth upward have walked in the purk teps of joseph but added the king with a touch of hu feeling in his voice  cant thou not conceive harold theo who art a warrior what it would be to see ever beore thea th face of thy deadliest foe the one against whom all thy sm glee of life and death had turned into memories of hyssop and gal   my sister  exclaimed harold in indignant amaze  my sister thy deadliest foe i she who never once murmured at neglect disgrace she whose youth bath been consumed in prayers for thee and thy realmmy sister  0 king i dream  thou dreamest not carnal man said the king peevishly dreams are the gifts of the saints and are not granted to such as thou dost thou think that in the prime of my manhood i could have youth and beauty forced on my sight and hear mans law and mans voice say  they are thine and thine only and not feel that war was brought to my hearth and a snare set on my bed and that the fiend had set watch on my soul  verily i tell thee man of battle that thou hast known no strife as awful as mine and achieved no victory as hard and as holy and now when my beard is silver anrd the adam of old is expelled at the precincts of death now thinkest thou that i can be reminded of the strife and temptation of yore without bitterness and shame when days were spent in fasting and nights in fierce grayer and in the face of woman i saw the devices of satan   edward coloured as he spoke and his voice trembled with the accents of what seemed hate harold gazed on him mutelv and felt that at last he had won the secret that had ever perplexed him and that in seeking to be above the humanity of love the wouldbe saint had indeed turned love into the hues of hate a thought of anguish and a memory of pain the kling recovered himself in a few momnents and said with some dignity i but god and his saints alone should know the secrets ot the household what i have said was wrung from me bury it in thy heart leave me then harold sith so it must be put thine earldoom in order attend to the monasteries and the poor and return soon as for algar what sayest thou   i fear me answered the largesouled harold with a victorious effort of justice over resentment  that if you reject his stit you will drive him into some perilous extremes despite his rash and proud spirit he is brave against foes and beloved by the ceorls who oft like best the frank and hasty spirit w herefore some power and lordship it were wise to give without dispossessing others and not more wise than due for llii father served you well  and bath endowed more houses ot god than any earl in the kingdom but algar is no

ancta mariathe thumb of st jude in nil jlustice however we must give a quotation or two displuaying the mrore trutiltul and agreeable qualities of tle better parts of the story such an one is the scene whihi followvs describing a saxon dinner of olden das  a monk of the order of st benedict then most in favour ushered the noble visitor into the cell of the abbot who after gazing at him a moment in wonder and delight clasped him to his breast and kissed him heartily on brow and cheek  ah guillaune he exclaimed in the norman tongue  this is indeed a grace for which to sing jubilate thou canst not guess how welcome is the face of a countryman in this horrible land ot illcooking and exile  talking of grace my dear father and food said de graville loosening the cincture of the tight vest which gave him the shape of a waspfor even at that early 1eriod small waists were in vogue with the warlike fops of the french continent talking of grace the sooner thou savst it over some friendly refection the more will the latin sound unctuous and musical i have journeyed since daybreak and am now hungered and faint  alack alack cried the abbot plaintively  thou knowest little my son what hardships we endure in these parts how larded our larders and how nefarious our fare the flesh of swine salted  the flesh of beelzebub cried mallet de gravilte aghast  but comfort thee i have stores on my sumptermiulespoulardee and fishes and other not despicable comestibles and a few flasks of wine not pressed laud the saints  from the vines of this country wherefore wilt thou see to it and instruct thy cooks how to season the cheer  no cooks have 1 to trust to replied the abbot  of cooking know they here as much as of latin natheless i will go and do my best with the stewpans meanwhile thou wilt at least have rest and the bath for the saxons even in their convents are a clean race and learned the bath from the dane  that i have noted said the knight  for even at the smallest house at which i have lodged in my way from london the host bath eourteonslv offered me the bath and the hostess linen curious and fragrant and to say truth the poor people are hospitable and kind despite their uncouth hate of the foreigner nor is their meat to be despised plentiful and succulent but pardex as thou sayest little helped by the art of dressing wherefore my father i will wile the time till the pomlardes be roasted and the fish broiled or stewed by the ablutions thou pfferaet me i shall tarry with thee some hours for i have much to learn  the abbot then led the sire de graville by the hand to the cell of honour and guestship and having seen that the bath prepared was of warmth sufficientfor both norman and saxon hardy men as they seem to us from afar so shuddered at the touch of cold water that a bath of natural temperature as well as a hard bed was sometimes imposed as a penancethe good father went his way to examine the sumptermules and admonish the muchsuffering and bewildered laybrother who officiated as cookand who speaking neither norman nor latin scarce made out one word in ten of his superiors elaborate exhortations  mallets squire with a change of raiment and goodly coffers of soaps unguents and odours took his way to the knight for a norman of birth was accustomed to much per sonal attendance and had all respect for the body and it was nearly an hour before in a long gown of fur reshaven dainty and decked the sire de graville bowed and sighed and prayed before the refection set out in the abbots cell so the two normans despite the sharp appetite of the lay man ate with great gravity and decorum drawing forth the morsels served to them on spits with silent examination sel dom more than tasting with looks of patient dissatisfaction each of the comestibles sipping rather than drinking nibbling rather than devouring washing their fingers in rosewater with nice care at the close and waving them afterwards gracefully in the air to allow the moisture somewhat to exhale before they wiped off the lingering dews with their napkins then they exchanged looks and sighed in concert as if recalling the polished manners of normandy still retained in that desolate exile and their temperate meal thus concluded dishes wines and attendants vanished and their talk commenced such another is the story of a contest in feats of strength and skill between duke william and harold when the latter went to normandy to claim the restoration of his kinsmen who had been hostages in williams hands  one day as during a short truce with the defenders of the place they were besieging the normans were diverting their leisure with martial games in which taillefer shone preeminent while harold and william stood without their tent watching the animated field the duke abruptly exclaimed to mallet de graville  bring me my bow now harold let me see if thou canst bend it the bow was brought and saxon and norman gathered round the spot i fasten thy glove to yonder tree mallet said the duke taking that mighty bow in his hand and carefully feeling the string then he drew the arc to his ear and the tree itself seemed to shake at the shock as the shaft piercing the glove lodged half way in the trunk i such are not our weapons said the earl  and ill would it become me unpractised so to peril our english ho nour as to strive against the arm that could bend that arc and wing that arrow but that i may show these norman knights that at least we have some weapon wherewith we can parry shaft and smite assailer bring me forth godrith my shield and my danish axe taking the shield and axe which the saxon brought to him haiold then stationed himself before the tree  now fair duke said he smiling i choose thou thy longest shaftbid thy ten doughtiest archers take their bows round this tree will i move and let each shaft be aimed at whatever space in my mailless body i leave unguarded by my shield i no said william hastily  that were murder i it is but the common peril of war said harold simply and he walked to the tree i the blood mounted to williams brow and the lions thirst of carnage parched his throat  an he will have it so said he beckoning to his archers  let not normandy be shamed watch well and let every shaft go home avoid only the head and the heart such orgulous vaunting is best cured by bloodletting the archers nodded and took their post each at a separate quarter and deadly indeed seemed the danger of the earl for as he moved though he kept his back guarded by the tree some parts of his form the shield left exposed and it would have been impossible in his quickshifting movements for the archers so to aim as to wound but to spare life yet the earl seemed to take no peculiar care to avoid the peril lifting his bare head fearlessly above the shield and including in one gaze of his steadfast eye calmly bright even at the distance all the shafts of the archers at one moment five of the arrows hissed through the air and with such wonderful quickness had the shield turned to each that three fell to the ground blunted against it and two broke on its surface but william waiting for the first discharge and seeing full mark at harolds shoulder as the buckler turned now sent forth his terrible shaft the noble taillefer with a poets true sympathy cried i saxon beware but the watchful saxon needed not the warning as it in disdain harold met not the shaft with his sild but swinging high the mighty axe which with most men required both arms to wield it he advanced a step and clove the rushing arrow in twain  before williams loud oath of wrath and surprise left his lips the five shafts of the remaining archers fell as vainly as their predecessors against the nimble shield on the whole we should say that harold is an utter failure sir edward lytton is not the man for the task he has not a breath of the spirit of the middle ages within his breast and thus writes at haphazard when he would expound the motives and feelings of the personages of his story he sees nothing of their characters and conduct but a few external peculiarities unlike any thing that ever came across his own limited experience and associated in his mind with ideas with which they hand no real connexion whatsoever he has also adopted a foolsb medley of styles of composition which destroys the readableness ot his book as much as its incorrectness destroys its historical utility the result is that harold is about as much a picture of anglosaxon and norman times as lord eglintouns gimcrack tournament was a revival of the genuine sports of antique days added to this sir edward has been so worried by the critics of the press for the immoral tendencies of his previously publishied novel lucretia that he has determined to make harold a terribly moral  book and bhas converted the connexion between the saxon king and edith into a pure sentimental affection anmd this by way of historical accuracy  rzctxor iihrold the last of thie saxon kin lrs b3y sir e if lo rron hart in 3 vols ljondon 184s bentley iiaving received from sir e buser lytton a very polite note stating that he had requested his publisher to send us a copy of his harold for review wc should have felt some surprise that it had not reached ius hut that the same thing has occtirrcd in some halfdozen other instances proving that it is not an accidental neglect but the result of that unaccountable and strangely implacable hostility which tiie critic has from the beginning until now encountered from two or three publishers who have no cause that we are aware of for their enmity as we are not consciotus of having dealt with other than the most perfect fairness with any book to which their names have been appended luring the five years tniz critic has been fulfilling the duties of a literary journal that their hostility unkind and uncalled for as it is has not in any way affected our conduct towards them every reader can bear testimony for still have the hooks they publish received the same impartial notice and filled the same prominent kakce in our columns as if they had extended to us the same courtesy as they show to our other literary journal and as other publishers show to this although compelled to borrow their looks from circulating libraries they have not been either neglected or unjustly treated in our columns nor even if the same hostility be continued unmitigated will any different rule govern our conduct for the future we notice the fact now only because the present instance is a remarkable one and to account to the author and to our readers for a brevity of notice compelled by the inconvenient circumstances under which this review is written harold differs materially from any other of sir e b lyttons fictions it is in its design an epic and in its composition a chronicle the author has successfully endeavoured to combine the unity of the one with the individuality of the other the period chosen is peculiarly adapted for an epic whether in prose or in poetry the catastrophe is a great historical event gradually evolved out of the incidents that occupy the narrative the interest rises with every chapter and at the close becomes intense but sir e b lytrton has in this romance attempted much more than merely an attractive story he has sought to embody history to present an accurate as well as a vivid and lifelike picture of the times to realise them as it were to his readers imagination and to his own hence harold is something more than a sofabook it is a work for the study and might worthily take its place upon the historical shelf in the library so careful has been the author to preserve the strictest accuracy in the appointments of his romance that he has adduced at the bottom of the page the authorities from which his information is taken so laborious a work may not please the mere novelreader so much as a flimsy creation of the fancy but it will be more valued by those whose approval is most valuable and will secure for it a more lasting existence as it is a book which wvill be read by every body we will not attempt to anticipate their enjoyment by any account of the plot suffice it to observe that britons saxons normans and northmen are introduced with their several distinctive characteristics giving immense variety to the picture and that harold is sketched with a mastery of minute traits of character gradually developed which the author has not sur passed if lie has equalled in any former fiction we present one specimen only the death of edward the confessor the king who had already undergone the last holy offices of the church was lying quite quiet his eyes half closed breathing low but regularly he had been spechless the two preceding days on this he had uttered a few words which showed returning consciousness his hand reclined on the coverlid was clasped in his wies wbo was praying fervently something in tonne touch of her hand or the sound of her murmur stirre the king from the growing lethargy and his as oaeni fixed on the kneeling lady ah  said he netly  ever good ever meek  think not i did ot love thee hearts will be read yonder we shall have our guer don the lady looked up through her streaming tears edward released his hand and laid it on her head as in benediction then motioning to the  abbot of westminster he drew from his finger the ring which the palmers had brought to him and murmured scarce audibly be this kept in the house of st peter in memory of me  he is alive now to usspeak whispered more than one thegn one abbot to alred and to stigand and stigand as the harder and more worldly man of the two moved up and bending over the pillow between aired and the king said 0 royal son about to win the crown to which that of earth is but an idiots wreath of withered leaves not yet may thy soul forsake us whom commendest thou to us as shepherd to thy bereaven flock  whom shall we admonish to tread in those traces thy footsteps leave below  the king made a slight gesture of impatience and the queen forgetful of all but her womanly sorrow raised her eye and finger in reproof that the dying was thus disturbed but the stake was too weighty the suspense too keen for that reverent delicacy in those around and the thegns pressed on each other and a murmur rose which murmured the name of harold  bethink thee my son said aired in a tender voice tremulous with emotion  the young atheling is too much an infant yet for these anxious times edward signed his head in assent  then said the norman bishop of london who till that moment had stood in the rear almost forgotten amongst the crowd of saxon prelates but who himself had been all eyes and ears  then said bishop william advancing  if thine own royal line so fail who so near to thy love who so worthy to succeed as william thy cousin the count of the normans  dark was the scowl on the brow of every thegn and a muttered  no no never the norman  was heard distinctly harolds face flushed and his band was on the hilt of his ateghar but no other sign gave he of his interest in the question the king lay for some moments silent but evidently striving to recollect his thoughts meanwhile the two archprelates bent over himstigand eagerly aired fondly then raising himself on one arm while with the other he pointed to harold at the foot of the bed the king said your hearts i see are with harold the earl so be it je ldctroi at those words he fell back on his pillow a loud shriek burst from his wifes lips all crowded aroundhe lay as the dead he recovered for a short time and there sat the king upright on the bed his face seen above the kneeling prelates and his eyes i bright and shining down the hall yea he said deliberately 4yea as this shall be a real vision or a false illusion grant me almighty one the power of speech to tell it he paused a moment and thus resumed  it was on the banks of the frozen seine this day thirtyandone winters ago that two holy monks to whom the gift of pro phecy was vouchsafed told me of direful woes that should fall on england

B1832,['4380498'],  the moonstone although the style of the book before us alone is undoubtedly such as would secure for it a prominent place among modern works of fiction its merits in this respect are likely to be lost sight of in the very remarkable plot to the construction of which mr wilkie collins has brought endless ingenuity and labour most of those who read the moonstone  are likely to regard it less as a work of literature than as an elaborate puzzle at the explanation of which they will endeavour to arrive with all possible haste the arrangement of the materials of which the author has availed himself is admirable but we doubt whether as the reader follows the course of the plot he will not become painfully sensible of the unsatisfactory foundation upon which the whole superstructure is based at the commencement of the novel we find ourselves in a mystery and we can scarcely be said to emerge from it even at that portion of the third volume where marriage and happiness is brought home to everybody the story of  the moonstone  i in some particulars founded upon the traditions which are said to be associated with two of the royal diamonds of europe one of the stones in the russian imperial sceptre and the kohinoorand this tradition underlies the whole of the novel indian stories described the moonstone as having been set in the forehead of an indian fourhanded god who on the temple where it stood at somnauth being destroyed in the eleventh century was removed by three brahmins to benares here vishnu appeared to the three brahmins in a dream commanded that the diamond should be watched by three priests in turn night and day for ever and predicted disaster to any one who laid hold of the gem and to all of his house and name who removed it the descendants of the three brahmins continue the watch until on the destruction of the shrine by arungzebe in the eighteenth century it passes into the hands of an officer of the moonstone  romadce by wilkie collin author of  the womw in white no io rmadak ac three tab london tinhay rank and ultimately into the possession of tippoo who placed it as an ornament in the handle of his dagger the gem being all the time watched by three brahmin priests in disguise at the taking of seringapatam john hernoastle an english officer is met by one of his relations at the treasury of the palace and under rather suspicious circumstances two indians are found lying across the entrance dead and a third is sinking down from the stab which he had just received from a dagger having a stone in its handle which hernoastle grasps dripping with blood the dying man cries  the moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours john herncastle in time acquires rank in the army and returns to england to be shunned by his relations and known as the wicked colonel he is continually in danger of his life at the hands of three indians who are continually dogging his footsteps but by depositing the moonstone in a bank and leaving directions with a solicitor that in the event of anything happening to him the diamond is to be sent to amsterdam and there broken up a course that would utterly defeat the plans of the brahmin he manages to continue his worthless existence until he dies of extreme old age before his death the colonel suffers a rebuff at the house of his sister lady verinder for

ablewhite a gentleman who devotes himself to philanthropy and to taking the chair at ladies meetings in favour of franklin to isn she becomes engaged among the other amusements in which the lovers indulge is a singular taste for door painting by a new process which franklin has brought from abroad with him the diamond is handed over to rachel and at the birthday dinnerparty there happens to be present a distinguidsd eastern traveller to whom the story of the moonstone is not unknown and who discovers in the three indian jugglers who again appear upon the scene brahimins of high cote and the descendants of the three custodians of the diamond rachel wears the moonstone and evincing that obstinacy which is a main feature in her character she will allow no one to take charge of it places it at night in a cabinet in her sittingroom and in the morning finds it stolen there is no trace to be found of the thief the indians are thrown into prison as vagrants but nothing is found upon them sergeant cuff an eminent detective is brought down friud london but rachel refuses to give him any information and strange to say she completely onto her old lover and will hold no communication with him sergeant cuffs suspicions point to rachel herself he thinks that she has used the diamond for the purpose of raising motey to pat her debts and thae she has been aided by rosanna spearman one of the servants a deformed girl who had been brought up as a thief and whom lady verinder had received from a reformatory xnny circumstances point to rosainna as the guilty person the newlypainted door leading to rachels sittingroom has bean smeared and the smear must have been made by thi thiin the night clothing of all the servante is found eorredt but rosanna is known to have purchased sode cloth at the vtiaseand to have been engaged in her own room making aomethi in addition the detective discover that she bhs bought a tin box and chain and sinks them i the shivering sads on th coast and not

mysterj unexplained in time however all is cleared up a oommunicative assistant to a country doctor had whilst his master wine delirious taken down his ravings and got at the fact that one of the gentlemen at the birthday dinnerpartywe will not disclose the authors secret by saying whowas drugged with opium the assistant is of opinion and finds his view fortified by a passage from carpenters physiology that the dadmul was stolen under the inflreace of the drug and that it is not impossible that another dose way result in the sleeper i  all that he did on the prewis occasion the eperz i

adopted are rsultflss as the sleoini drops the piece of glass upon the floor and sinks off to shop rachels solicitor andl friend 3fr bruff however has good reason for suspecting that the diamond has been pawned with a moneylender of questionable character mr luker of lambeth and lodged by that gentleman with his bankers if mr bruffs object was to recover for his client a gem worth 30yxi and if he was a sensible man it is probable that he would have availed himself of the control which he afterwards shows be possessed over mr luker or of the assistance of the police and by means of a searchwarrant got hold of the moonstone mar bruff however did not act as most sensible mortals and any attorney would have done but he conducts himself as if the great object of his existence had been as it no doubt was to protract the interest of the story he seems to have confused himself between the law appertaining to pawnbrokers and those principles of equity jurisprudence relating to the payment of mortgage moneys and under the impression that the moonstone could not be redeemed until a year has elapsed from its deposit he arranges that at the end of a year a watch shall be placed at the bankers to find out who redeems the diamond and ultimately dees discover the thief although we may leave ourselves open to the charge which those who are wise after the fact are always met with we doubt whether any number of people would proceed as mr wilkie collins makes his characters act serg cuff plays the detective of romance admirably but it is questionable whether his brethren of scotlandyard do not generally set about their duty with more dash and infinitely less science than he displays  the moonstone  is made up like mr wilkie collinss other novels of distinct narratives by the more prominent characters that of betteredge lady verinders old servant is the most important of the contributions and it is on the whole very pleasing we could have wished however that the old steward had less to say about robinson crusoe miss clacks narrative is intended to convey the idea of a meddlesome fanatic but it is merely a broad burlesque of the character,britain

B7717,['2437219'],  book notices fiction the work of j c snaith mistress dorothy marvi n lady barbarity ward lock iq i  fortune nelson 1910 araminta mrs fitz smith elder i910 william jordan junior henry nortiecote broke of covenden constable 19068 perhaps if we knew the exact dates on which the above books were severally written we should find the duality of the author less perplexing by virtue of three books published by messrs constable a year or two ago mr snaith ranks with messrs wells conrad bennett and galsworthy as the fifth great novelist of our age his other books are amusing clever wellwritten wellcomposedall thats merry and bright and they bear about the same relation to literature as mr rackhams illustrations do to art araminta is the best of themthe style is pretty and the idea graceful but the work is too superficial to pass for comedy it has not the touch of merediths short stories mrs fitz again has its good scenesthe naughtiness of the king of illyria is delightfulbut the book is an obvious potboiler the character of sir richard pendragon in fortunt is whimsical and stirring but even in this very jolly book it is obvious that mr snaith does not take himself seriously as a writer of romance he does not approach his work with the imperturbable seriousness of dumas or stevenson his romances are as void of any undercurrent of thought or passion as those of cutcliffe hyne or conan doyle ingenuity seeks in vain for one fiery outburst from the author of william 7ordan for one surpassing phrase to electrify this pleasant business of love and adventure knights and highwaymen it is hard to believe that the same pen that wrote such commonplace as mistress dorothy alarvin has given us two immortal descriptions of heroes who denied the world to save their genius what of it  it is enough for one lifetime to have produced broke of covinden henry nortbcote and william 7ordan 7unior of these books the first alone has achieved any measure of success or fame it is the earliest worst written and least important yet it has fine comedy and profound tragedy the influence of meredith is very apparent in the picture of broke a more rigid more passionate stupider sir willoughby patterne in one passage an invocation to the audience at the olympian theatre the author lapses into a travesty of merediths very style the tutor one of natures gentlemen and gods poets who rescues the youngest most intelligent and least ugly of brokes six daughters from the horrors of a manage de cowenance is closely modelled on vernon whitford all this detracts a little from the excellence of the book and certain abominations of style which have also to be mentioned detract from it still more take for instance this sentence  a gallant but intrepid hound who took a somewhat informal departure from this life because he chose to cross a railway when hounds were in full cry at the moment the express from london had chosen to cross it also this is terrible we hear too of  a game rejoicing in the euphonious name of pingpong and of  that mysterious zoological specimen the consummate ass dickens himself never committed worse excesses than these in the way of cheap irony and we may add that mr snaith would be well advised to go through all his books and scratch out the word  somewhat  wherever it occurs nevertheless there is grandeur in the scheme of broke of covenden it is thrilling to read how blow upon blow fell upon the all but indomitable pride of the hero and not till the end will lie vield and the characters are more vivid more passionate than merediths meredith would never have shown us the fire in delias soul admirable too is uncle charles a bibulous and kindhearted nobleman beloved by everyone but his wife a literary lady who writes for the spectator whose character the author draws with more ferocity than finesse in a humorous chapter this insufferable dame is smacked by her longsuffering husband alas that the author should add  not in the authentic place  broke of covenden may then be classed as a fine book but imitative henry nortbcote and william 7ordan 7unior resemble nothing but each other written in a style of fantastic beauty they both describe the soul of genius battling to keep its purity untainted in the material world they are spiritual tragedies already in broke of covenden the author is apt to make his characters speak not as they would have spoken but rather as their souls would have spoken already in the description of brokes final desolation we have a foretaste of the authors power of expressing the psychical  there were occasional fierce gushes of rain driven by the wind against the windowpanes of the cottage he mistook them for waves of blood breaking over the walls of his mind in the two later books the whole atmosphere is spiritual the real things are the things of the soul and the phenomenal world becomes a hideous and obscuring dream henry northcote is an advocate penniless and unknown in the prelude a dying and destitute stranger who has heard his oratory in hyde park comes to visit him they talk together about jesus and the need of a new failure a great renunciator like him  to restore the sense of illusion and to show that the strife for the perfect is not a chimaera of the madhouse the stranger vanishes and the same night northcote is given his chance he is to defend a prostitute from a charge of murder the case seems as hopeless as it is sordid the woman is guilty beyond all doubt but to northcote it seems an unholy thing that a woman should be hanged he exerts his amazing genius and procures a verdict of  not guilty the trial scene is dramatic and northcotes speech with its vision of an ideal jury and christ as foreman is great literature but northcote realises that he has worked not for his ideal but for himself his ideal self dies and the ideal self of the woman he has rescued perishes at the same time we leave him an incendiary and a murderer established on the road to worldly success the grim story is relieved by passages of a peculiar humour a humour that reminds one now of dickens now of baudelaires poemes en prose and like the book itself baffles all description hard as it is to give an account of henry northcote in a few lines it is harder still to suggest the characteristics of william 7ordan 7unior judged by the standard of the souls grand effort towards perfection henry northcote the advocate fails and william jordan junior the poet succeeds despite imprisonment poverty sickness and ridicule air snaith is perhaps the only writer of prose who has understood the poetic character his prose in its faults and merits is a poets prose throughout and the character of his poet must be founded on some mighty experience the frail boy is brought up by his aged father in a little bookshop he lives with the heroes of the iliad in a world of poetry and dreams he is terrified of the  streetpeople and as unfit for school or business as a fairy yet gifted with dauntless resolution he lives down his terrors one by one and does not die till he has written the poem it was his mission on earth to write there is nothing in literature like this story of a sublime spirit imprisoned in a wasting frame even the humour is unique who can ever forget the conversation of mr octavius crumpett the publisher with queen victorias favourite novelist  the novelist is in distress he has been offered a title mr crumpett tells him that he should accept it for the honour of literature the great author acquiesces with a sigh he says he can hardly imagine sir william shakespeare and no friendship in literature is more truly pathetic and charming than that of the poet ith the young matthew arnold dodsonan episode which keeps the story human and relieves the mad and stifling tragedy of its close in these days those who would proclaim  one genius more  can hardly hope for a hearing however just their arguments or good their cause we have no desire to be extravagant in our laudation of mr snaith he has given us only three books that are literature and only one masterpiecewilliam 7ordan 7unior but that work is unique and it is a masterpiece and it is all but unknown,britain
B5245,"['8926001', '9435954']",  annals of a quiet neighboured by george mac donald ma author of  david elgin brod  ia three volumes hurst and blackett this is a republication of a story written for dr guthries sunday magazine mr macdonald has never published anything that did not sustain the credit he earned as a poet years ago when he wrote  within and without he is a poet with true spiritual insight into life a largehearted earnest man who is steadily and slowly winning his way to the public recognition of his power that is wide already but not yet so wide and so thorough as it will be when he fairly comes into his own his writings until now have all breathed naturally his own sound and liberal religious spirit but in this book he is rather like a man who has given up natural breathing and gasps under the constraint of stays or a tight neckcloth either the sense that he wa writing fiction to be read on sundays by scotch people who had thought the stories in  good words profane or the conditions under which he was required to work must be made answerable for the comparative failure the book is one that only a man of genius could bave written it is full of good thought and good writing but it is the work of an artist in fetters who is obliged to have a perfect incumbent for his hero and to give at least one of the incumbents sermons in the course of his tale mr macdonald struggles to break through the conventional sunday crust with some romance for which he makes apology wherever it appears and which does not cotna to any kindly growth he tries aiso to realise his own large wholesome notion of a pattern priest but after all full as it is of good we put the book aside as a mistake it was net a mistake in the sunday magazine where it gate to hundreds of dull people a few gleams of the light they seldom or never see but it was a mistake to reprint it for it will not range fairly with mr macdonalds works in which his genius was free and he was all

lepetathismmy 71j rssmvmii light inside me mmmtnt mis ehildaen t  annals of a quiet neighbourhood by george mdonald ma 3 vols hurst  blackett these annals of n quiet neighbourhood are very quietly told so quietly that the recital becomes at times monotonous the authors reflections aro those of an amiable unworldly and piously disposed thinker but they are often obscurely and ambiguously expressed the writer lacks the condensing power of our old and quaint writers who in a few words could give utterance to sentiments for which mr mdonald requires many pages the experiences of a clergyman in a quiet country parish must sometimes be of a more exciting character than can bc found in lengthy colloquies with parishioners or spiritual disquisitions on natural objects though authors first walk in his new quiet neighbourhood suggests to him an incessant flow of analogies drawn from everything on which his eye rests for instance he comes upon a bank bordered by pollards  now he complains  pollards always make me miserable in the first place they look ill used in the next place they look tame in the third place they look very ugly i had not learned then to honour them on the ground that they yield not a jot to the adversity of their circumstances that if they must be pollards they still will be trees and what they may not do with grace they will yet do with bounty that in short their life bursts forth despite of all that is done to repress and destroy their individuality when you have once learned to honour anything love i3 not far off at least that has always been my experience but as i said before i had not yet learned to honour pollards and therefore they made me miserable fortunately at this juncture an old countryman comes past who requests leave to look on the new 2rtwms face and the parson overhears a little child say he should like to be a painter  to help god paint the sky both these remarks  give rise to a renewal of moral reflections but j happily they are of a more cheerful tendency i than before the good man work3 very hard  and doubtless does an infinite amount of good  particularly to the poorer part of his congre gation but he is most anxious his readers  should know all his good qualities and being a very transparent character every feeling of  his mind is so visible that he might have spared himself and his readers the long explanations he so constantly gives of his actions and motives really he is however indefatigable in his attentions to his poor and we are quite glad for his own sake to hear what comfortable luncheons he finds in the vicarage between the services on sundays and how careful he is to have the church well wanned where he preaches such long sermons one of these discourses is given at full length and it is not a particularly original specimen of its kind some of the worthy incumbents ideas are certainly peculiar he considers it a great mistake to teach children that they have soulsthe consequence being  that they think of their souls as of something which is not themselves for what a man has cannot be himself hence when they are told that their souls go to heaven they think of their selves as lying in the grave they ought to be taught that they have bodies and that their bodies die while they themselves live on then they will not think that they will be laid in the grave it is making altogether too much of the body and is indicative of an evil tendency to materialism that we talk ns if we possessed souls instead of being souls no doubt this is very good in the abstract but sundayschool teachers would we think hesitate before adopting it without qualification  the story which carries though authors sentiments is a very slight one it is the mere connecting link of the thoughts and facts that present themselves to the authors mind it is not well sustained it is disjointed mid is perpetually falling to the ground there is an air of feebleness about it and a seeming want of practice is discernible in the recital that is somewhat surprising considering that the author has already exercised his pen in several previous works the annals of a quiet neighbourhood moreover can scarcely be called a novel the story is so subservient to the religious conversations  but as it was written originally for a sunday publication this was to be expected there arc two or three incidents that if well worked up might have risen to the level of the romantic and even of the sensational the characters are numerous among them is a decidedly disagreeablesome may think even a wickedold lady whose illused and of course beautiful daughter seeks a change from her magnificent but uncomfortable home by giving herself and ultimately her money to the worthy but prosy vicar then we have a pedantic and precocious child of twelve years of age who flings herself into a pond during the clergymans first visit to see if he will jump in after her and who talks bitterly of other peoples matrimonial prospects in a very unjuvenile manner these are the principals but they have numerous supernumeraries in the shape of old people who have prosy chat with their pastor and young ones who ask for his advice and do not take it the solemn pastor unbends occasionally once to the extent of giving a christmas party to his congregation in which are conspicuous countrydances carols plenty of tea and supper and wordsworths ballads this kind of book will probably find admittance into many a family circle where works of fiction do not generally meet with a cordial reception the intention of the writer is good but the execution falls short of the intent,britain

B1890,['8691054'],  poor miss finch a novel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many novelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation novel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation novel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr wilkie collins has done as much before and has done it far betterbut that it should be done in so proper a spirit poor miss finch as possibly our readers know is a blind girlblind almost from birth she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss novels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior novelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss novels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a novel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to novelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective novel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five novels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his novels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of his best tales can we foresee the plot or even guess at its result save in so far as he chooses to help us there is no sameness about him nor does he ever inflict upon us a mauvais quart dkeure armadale the woman in white and  man and wife are as good as those who read six novels a year have any right to expect and better by far than those can expect who read a novel a month and if  poor miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a novel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a novel to have been written by any one else,britain

we possess in english and one that is of especial value since the tales are not merely translations the word  english however is somewhat misleadingso many of the tales are scotch it would be of interest also to know the actual source of the tales which mr jacobs heard in australia many of the tales are of course familiar to all students of folklore in english forms and i am not sure that mr jacobs versions are always the best occasionally too one seems to miss the genuine ring not of the folktale but of the folktelling and there are certain omissions thatunless mr jacobs is as i hope contemplating a second volumeare difficult to account for but despite small faults of commission and omission faults one only notices because the work is so good thc volume is most welcome only one protest  tom tit tot mr jacobs declares is  superior to any of the continental variants with which he is acquainted it may be that i am prejudiced and that therefore the german variant which delighted me as a child still seems to me the best be this as it may to me at least  rumpelstilzchen  seems more graceful more humorous and more dramatic than tom tit tot but whatever the grownup folk may say the little folk will be of only one opinion concerning these  talesthey will receive them with a chorus of delight and after all are not children the best as they are also the most honest of critics  the admirable illustrations by j d batten are worthy of the tales no wellregulated nursery should be without these old old stories in their charming new dress  tattercoats from more erglish fairy tales more english fairy talfs collected and edited by iosepii jacobs illtistratel by j  batten d nutt mr jacobs has kept some of the best of his tales for this volume adhering to his former plan and stoutly defending it in his preface he has given them for the most part in the racy speech of the people but always keeping in mind that they are meant to be read and liked by children he refuses to draw a line between scottish and english border tales and so  rashincoatie  and  habitrot  are here it is a delightful and at the same time a very amusing collection full of humour and insight into peasant character and customs but none of the tales are here for any such serious reason but simply because they are good to read and listen to nfr batten never entered more thoroughly into the spirit of the tales than he has done in this volume which should be fully as popular as any of mr jacobs former oncs  celtic fain tales solectod and edited bv joseph jacobs editor of folklore illustrated by john d batten nutt tales and lng ends by av carew hazlitt sonnenschein  co mn jacobs tolls us in the preface that his chief difficulty has been that of selecting where there is so much ready to hand his collection consists of twentysix stories representing ireland scotland wales and cornwall but chiefly ireland and scotland in fact though brythons have here onl five storiesfour from wales  the shepherd of myddvai the wooing of olwen the brewery of eggshells and  beth gellort and one from cornwall  the tale of ivan mr jacobs however explains that it is not his fault that little wales is not better represented and hopes that the eisteddfod may do something for welsh folklore by offering prizes for collecting folktales in the principality this has been done to some extent but with no great rosults as yet at least so far as though public is concerned thus the eisteddfod held in london a few years ago awarded a prize to the rev elias owen for work done in this field  but what has becomo of it  we are not awaro that it has ever boon published then as to complete stories of any length we feel pretty certain that there are none such to be found in wales at the present day and this is our idea also as to though time not long ago when that peculiar collector of folklore wirt sikes flourished mr jacobs gives his readers clearly to understand whero ho has found his tales and how he has dealt with them modifying or excising though original translations from celtic hero and there where he found them ovorliteral for his avowed object is not to appeal to english folklorists and scholars but to intorost and please a more youthful class of roaders and wo certainly think that he has boen eminently successful mr batten has also done his part admirably and both he and mr jacobs leave one under the impression that they have not themselves escaped the fascination whereby  though captive celt has enslaved his captor in though realm of imagination though present volume accordingly attempts to begin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years and it may bo trusted to act in some measure as an antidote to the ruthless unreason of the budding golthers of our day by no means the least interesting portion of the volume is that consisting of the thirty pages of notes to the stories these it is neodloss to say are not quite exhaustive but it would be invidious to suggest here a variety of small additions which occur to us as of interest to the specialist all the notes aro decidedly instructive reading and some such as that in which the origin of the beth gelert story of llewelyn and his greyhound is traced break new ground others illustrate accidentally the position of mr jacobs in the folklore world for our readers are doubtless aware that folklorists aro divided in opinion on the question of parallel developments as against borrowing wo may cite the following passage as both explaining what we mean and dealing with a curious feature of folktales it occurs in mr jacobss notes on the story of  hudden and dudden p 248  it is indeed curious to find as m cosquin points out a cunning fellow tied in a sack getting out by crying i wont marry the princess in countries so far apart as ireland sicilyafghanistanand jamaicait is indeed impossible to think these are disconnected and for drolls of this kind a good case has been made out for the borrowing hypotheses by m cosquin and mr clouston who borrowed from whom is another and more difficult question which has to be judged on its merits in each individual case probably in this instance all would agree that there has been borrowing by somebody  but in some cases the other theory namely that of parallel developments in a similarity of circumstances is held by some students of folklore and to these mr jacobs at the recent international folklore congress gave the name of  casualists what is to bo the name of the other partythat to which he himself belongs probably some such name as  niigrationists  would do as well as any other but the difference between the two schools is only one of degree the migrationists being as they themselves think more sensitive to though numerical argument from a calculation of though chances against independent developments in each particular instance before we turn to mr hazlitts book we may bo permitted to express our regret that leisure was not found to revise the printers errols moro carefully for if words which are not english are introduced into an english book pains should be taken to have them spelled in some way recognised in the languages to which the belong  if you must needs speak of  the cymru you should know that it means  the wales and that you have to write  the cymry  if you wish to allude in that way to  the welsh people we have seen more than ono way of spelling the gaelic word for antiquary or storyteller but ve have never before seen it made into theenachie similarly  archroologia britannia and similar slips in the notes look strange and ought to disappear in future editions of which thore will we doubt not be many as the volume cannot fail to become popular and deservedly so it is difficult to know for what class of readers mr hazlitts book is designed not surely for students of folklore for in the preamble to robin hood on his 242nd page mr hazlitt says that  in dealing with this ancient and favourite tradition the editor has for the first time made use of such material only as appeared to him authentic so exactly half the book is valueless for scientific purposes unless as we gather from other parts of it mr hazlitts command of english is not always so complete as to enable him to say what he means students of folklore too require much more precise information than is here afforded and will naturally prefer to go to the fountain head for these interesting but wellknown old stories neither can the book be intended for young persons  or children for various incidents are related with  the masculine frankness of the old time nor yet for lovers of ballad poetry for none such when reading a selection of ballads from the  reliques which have been digested into prose whatever that may mean  would admit that  the probability is that many of the ancient tales here found present themselves for the first time in an intelligible form or that the handling of say for instance the nutbrowne maid is faithful and judicious and has made it capable of yielding to the lover of the ballad and folktale a store at once of entertainment and instruction what possible instruction is to he obtained from a translation which changes 0 lord what is th s worldys blysse tfhat ohangeth as the mone  my somers day in lusty may is derked bel ore the none 1 here you saye

we are not so soon to depart  if the until death us dopart of the marriage service had not been altered into u until death us do part almost every one would havo known that to depart means to part if mr hazlitt knew it he should have completed the work of modernization hy saying  part here to our mind however such treatment of our old ballads is both barbarous and unnecessary never yet have we seen the child of fair intelligence who could not after taking thought read and got pleasure out of  chevy chace  adam bel the  battle of otterburn and many others which have had both poetry and point taken out of them by mr hazlitt for a bit of fine confused writing showing a great deal of appreciation of and contempt for theso ballads and legends we commend our readers to the preface it is

world the fate of the children of lir a second volume would have been justified and the black horse and how cormac macart went to fairy  are two others in this second series that must fascinate all

celtic fairy tales nutt age in a book first meant for children mr batten is as good as ever the illustrations to  powel prince of dyfed and  paddy okelly are capital he knows how to relieve his most fearsome pictures by a touch of humour  english fairy tales by joseph jacobs illustrated by j d batten nutt the flyleaf of this book tells us how to get into it the difficulty however will not be how to get into it but how to get out of it for from first to last almost without an exception these stories are delightful there are old friends among them which never can appear too often there are others with which we have hitherto only had a bowing acquaintance and there are one or two which are entirely new we are not quite sure about the whole party being englishone or two seem to have strayed out of grimms  kinder und hausmiirchen and to have been a little weakened on the way some of them judging from the point of view of folklore might certainly have been more appropriately included in a scotch collection mr jacobs explains their appearance thus  i have also included some stories that have only been found in lowland scotch i have felt justified in doing this as of the twentyone folktales contained in chamberss  popular rhymes of scotland no less than sixteen are also to be found in an english form the reasoning here is not strong but the stories are good we can imagine mr jacobs feeling the same pious joy that thrilled the old north  country steward who recounting to his absent lord the depredations caused by a foray made by the scots when  the falsehearted thieving loons  drove away flocks and herds over the border wound up by saying  but thankit be the lord we have outstolen them the more stories of this kind that are  lifted  into books that the public are likely to read the better and as mr jacobs informs his readers that some day he is going  to treat the subject of the english folktale on a larger scale with all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus  his readers may for the present wink at an english fairy tale called the laidly worm which is avowedly patched up out of a ballad by mr lamb of norham  with touches from the more ancient version  kempton  mr jacobs has performed the service of compiling an excellent version of  jack th giantkiller from two old chapbooks itt the british museum it is in all substantial points the same as that of which grimm gives a summary in the notes on english folktales at the end of the  hausmarchen a satisfactory version has long been needed for the chapbooks which told the story well seem to have been altogether superseded by those which told it badly we wonder no one took the trouble to go to the british museum with this object before all the illustrations to this book are good but that which shows jack entering the giants castle wearing the cap which makes him invisible is very good indeed and decidedly original in the preface to the  cauld lad of hilton mr jacobs speaks of him as the contrariest brownie ever known but he was not more contrary than brownies always are or were  they always behaved just as the  cauld lad  did if they found things orderly and clean they at once proceeded to break furniture and crockery to turn everything topsyturvy and play uncomfortable tricks of all kinds if however the servants were dirty and disorderly and went to bed leaving their work undone the brownie immediately began to put all in good order a brownies mission was therefore to demoralise servants by showing them that it was wise policy to leave their work undone the servants who had to do with the cauld lad of hilton castlenot hall by the way as mr jacobs has it must have been good ones or they would have suffered no inconvenience from the nightly visitant the brownie of hilton was however supposed to be the ghost of a poor lad working about the place who had been murdered there which may account for the servants anxiety to get rid of him another part of a brownies mission seems to have been to teach ingratitude for any present of clothes or of anything more substantial than a little milk or food always resulted in depriving the household of his services if a fault can be found with this book it is that we do not always quite like the way in which the stories are told mr jacobs says in his preface generally speaking it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse will speak when she tells fairy tales this being the case the critic can but ask himself two questions has mr jacobs done this satisfactorily  and is it a thing that it is well to do  he has done it very well if he wishes his nurse to be a rather vulgar one of the present day it is not prudent however to adopt this form of narration unless the imaginary nurse be made to use a simple and rather antiquated phraseology as a nurse of a hundred years ago whose style was formed on the bible might have done all the events recorded in fairy tales are supposed to have taken place long ago and seem to demand a somewhat archaic or to say the least oldfashioned form of speech the critics sense of fitness was always a little ruffled ly mr dasents method of telling a tale and the same irritation is felt upon perusing such sentences as these   dartersays she  put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em a little  or  go you and get one o them there pies or  she sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry   or  he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents but that did not btop long or this in  childe rowland  and the thing to do is this  after you have entered the land of fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the burd ellen you must out with your fathers brand and off with their head or this from  jack and the beanstalk    right you are said the man  and here they are the very beans themselves he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of strangelooking beans  as you are so sharp said he i dont mind doing a swop with youyour cow for these beans  walker  says jack   wouldnt you like it  it is to be hoped that when mr jacobs republishes these stories with the  necessary paraphernalia referred to already he will carefully do away with the only thing that damps the readers pleasure in them by carefully revising the nurses language  literature fairy tales indian fairy tales edited by joseph jacobs nutt fairy tales from the far east by theo gift lawrence  bullen fairy tales in other lands by julia goddard cassell  co scenes in fairyland by canon atkinson macmillan  co household tales and fairy stories routledge  sons mr jacobs has put together a good collection of stories some of which were gathered into the fold of literature more than two thousand years ago in the  kathasarit sagara of somadeva while others are the jetsam and flotsam of the present day rescued by miss frere miss stokes major temple c here too are to be found some of the fables of bidpai and the jatakas being interpreted  kathasarit sagara means  ocean of the streams of story did somadevas title mean that all known stories of all known lands had streamed into the ocean of his collection and found a home there and in the country in which it was formed mr jacobs is evidently inclined to hold the contrary opinion and to believe that all other countries derived their fairy tales and fables from india the majority of the tales in this volume he writes  havo been known in the west in some form or other and the problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in farthest west and east surely if as mr jacobs asserts they existed or began to exist at one and the same time in farthest west and east there is no problem to solve for it would be manifest that they were not transmitted from one country to another but that each had its own independent origin some mr jacobs continues aa benfey in germany m cosquin in france and mr clouston in england have declared that india is the home of the fairy tale and that all european fairy tales have been brought from thence by crusaders by mongol missionaries by gipsies by jews by traders by travellers we are happy to find that mr jacobs though he exhibits a strong leaning towards this theory does not go so far as these writers were it true indeed we should have to believe that for more centuries than we dare to contemplate the children of rich and poor alike in europe went supperless to bed so far as food for the imagination was concerned and that the patient peasantry spent the long dark hours when work was impossible unamused and unamusing we do not believe that they waited until the lord of the land brought back a story from the crusades or an argosy of stories put into port from the far east we prefer to believe with the grimmsthe farseeing fathers of all literature of research of this kindthat while the possibility nay in particular instances the probability of a story passing from one people to another and there firmly rooting itself on the foreign soil is not to be denied the property in fairy tales is common to all and that the  selfsame stories crop up again and again in places most widely remote from each other like a spring which forces its way up in spots which lie far apart and just as wherever the eye can pierce we tind domestic animals grain field and kitchen utensils household furniture armsin fact all the things without which social life would be impossibleso do we also rind sagas and stories corresponding with each other in a striking and yet independent manner they are just as much a necessity of existence as these things and only where avarice and the jarring wheels of machinery benumb every other thought can one imagine it possible to live without them this being the case in comparing the stories of various countries it is by no means necessary to attribute a storys origin to the country in which it appears to have been first current we must always remember that the number of rootstories is extremely limited so that a good deal of similarity must naturally be looked for the jatakas or birth stories of

sometimes pleasantly and judiciously at others we are tempted to ask her to study one of the stories she has selected  the tortoise that could not hold its tongue that story bytheby in the original is told in three or four pages theo gift tells it in twentynine she ignores chronology and eastern local colour with absolute frankness and courage in one sense to ignore facts of time and space is to catch the very spirit of fairyland in another to talk of perambulators in a tale which was not new when it was committed to writing in the fifth century ad gives a shock to any reader who cares about the fitness of things deserts in theo giftrs stories seem to have a good deal of juicy grass interspersed with the sand  farmyards appear to be very like english farmyards  cows are called buttercup  and buttermilk aud clover seem to be going there is a story indeed which begins once upon a time in the days when the great great greatgrandfathers of our great great greatgrandfathers were just having their first breeches made there lived a farmer with one daughter of whom he was very fond he was a rich farmer and his fields were full of corn and clover and his orchards of apples and plums  and he had plenty of horses and cattle and sheep and poultry and pigs and pigeons and a yarddog and kitchen cat and every one of them was so well fed and cared for that even the geese in the pond said   this is the best place in the whole country to live in and so said the sage and onions too this is a hopelessly lower class nineteenth century presentment a great many more greatgreatgreatgrandfathers are needed to take us back to the time when these stories were  human natures daily food and a great deal more study to imbue us with its spirit and yet in spite of aberrations of this kind the book is often entertaining and well written we must not omit to commend mr oswald von glenns illustrations the ten little stories miss goddard has printed will be welcomed in the nursery and probably all the better liked for bearing a strong family likeness to other stories which have long reigned supreme in that domain if the  beauty  brings down the  beast on the father by asking for a few samples of the great wall of china instead of the conventional rose the story is still pleasant reading and the beast though much less interesting is as placable as the beast of our early affections if the japanese red riding hood becomes a  blue mantle and the wolf turns into the allegory of the nile the story is still a story in addition to these departures from the wellbeaten track we have a scandinavian somewhere close to the north pole jack the giantkilleronly he ought not to have been called jan an egyptian puss in boots which becomes a cat in yellow slippers and a persian jack and the beanstalk in which the beanstalk is turned into a carrot with a bushy top and jack has to descend underground instead of climbing up to dangerous heights this little book is sent forth with no hint of any desire to do more than amuse children from beginning to end there is not a word as to the origin of the stories or any of their incidents we accept it on its own showing the stories are prettily told fairyland appears to be easily entered from the moorland parish over which canon atkinson has for forty and odd years presided and yorkshire scenery and dialect come largely into play in his volume when they do not coin words for themselves the hero and heroine use those in vogue in cleveland they  scuttle people off home and encounter other people who stump about cannily and laugh a ramshackle laugh the fairies too wash their clothes at  the kerd of the country side and bittle them on the big flat stones near by this is pleasant enough but when  miss mary who does lessons is surprised over things and continually expresses her surprise by exclaiming  whatever will nurse say we wish she had done these lessons to more purpose miss mary is disappointing  instead of being witty she is snappish when she opens her mouth it is most frequently to say  psha and in spite of her various experiences in fairyland she cannot be persuaded to believe in fairies a book of this kind makes us hasten to renew our allegiance to the incomparable alice and the sweet unreasonableness of lewis carroll it is unreasonableness which never runs too long in the same groove but for ever surprises us with some unexpected change of venue while alices good manners and politeness under trying circumstances are unfailing 4 scenes in fairyland shows a considerable amount of invention and fancy were it reduced to onethird of its present length it would be infinitely better this is a description of an ingenious variation of ball playing  then came gamea with ballsnot tennis or bowls or croquet or anything so  mortal as tehat but it was a game played in the air where the different balls chased each other as the players desired and the balls were all lustrous azure and golden and rosy and lovely green  and they wound in and out and up and down aud over and under  and when after the most amusing and intricate pursuings one players caught another playerssay a golden ball caught a blue oneit just opened and took it bodily in and became twice the size it was before and the player whose ball got most of the other balls and grew to be ad big as a great school globe as it might he was the winner it was mr lang who said that fairy 44 tales consist of but very few incidents grouped together in a kaleidoscopic variety of arrangement and

collections of perrault madame daulnoy grimm and a good collection of english fairy tales and he will henceforth see little that is new in any book of the kind the christmas book of fairy tales seems indeed to be produced with as much regularity and in much the same way as the christmas pudding we almost think we could give the recipe by which  household tales was compounded take four or five stories from perrault dilute those which seem to require it with good wholesome commonplace mix thoroughly with these an equal number from madame daulnoy a handful from grimm and a sprinkling from mlle de la force or any one else who is preferred then stir in a number of old english stories and ballads and boil the mixture for six hours by the study fire dish up in blue or scarlet and gold covers garnishing liberally with wellused illustrations  then serve 4 cinderella is one of the stories which have been diluted is it possible that a child can like this  44 thero was many years ago in

nutt mr jacobs though he be editor of oklore looks not to the gay science for spiritual guidaince lie is happily conscious of the literary qiuaslity of the material he handles and remembers that rimitive man had as keen a sense of art as his mental developmnent and the hitter struggle for life would lermit and sol he has selected and edited his celtic airy taes not to illuminate the genesis of the human brain but with the far more laudable object of amusing the young herein he should be successfcal at any rate he has contrived to entertain the old and perhaps the young are not vastly more ritical mr jacobs has thrown his net wide and has gathered in stories from the printed works of campbell kennedy hyde curtin and the rest nor has he shrunk from editing and adapting such work as he elected to reprint indeed his book is completely purged of pedantry his single aim being to amuse he has ingeniously blent the comic and the romantic and has positively published a book without an afterthought a conspicuous triumph in these days of moralities true in his preface he murmurs something about a union of hearts but he obtrudes no  views and one little excursion into the prevailing vice may be condoned the book has its blemishes the story of beth gellert for instance is wholly out of place mr jacobs version is a bald paraphraseworthy of a boardschool boyof the hon w r spencers poem taken from an obviously literary source the narrative chimes neither in diction nor in eftect with the genuine folktale in vain does mr jacobs inform you that the story is an apologue which is met with in every country from india to wales the question may scarce be answered authoritatively and there seems no reason why it should not be a record of actual experience the tidelity of the dog the sudden anger of the master may easily be matched outside the radius of folklore and once you grant the story the moral follows as a matter of course a child of six could hardly hear of elerts death and not take it as a warning against human iinpctulositv but even if it be a recurrence of the old type its sctting is so modern and the atsence of the supernatural and the inconsequent so marked that it were far better away however it serves to suggest to mr jacobs a learned note which we trust no child will be induced to read now and then too the diction generally studied and correct descends into the commonest slang but these are venial errors  and the book in their despite is as pleasant a collection as you could wish to imeet the stories are both quaint and picturesque of

 co xheke is one advantage in writing a story as a serialthe individual portions have an elaboration and finish which a novel written in the piece does not always obtain at the hands of the author these  last chronicles are very carefully written and the characters have remarkable substance and vitality it is not given to every one to create characters out of the workaaay worldneither better nor worse than persons whom we all meet every dayand yet to be able so to lay bare their hearts and etories that the reader accepts them as friends and acquaintances follows their fortunes through the volume specially devoted to them remembers the subordinate persons and is glad to hear their story at length as soon as mr trollope is pleased like another scheherazade to take up one of the threads of the old story and weave a new one from it the series of barsetshire chronicles have all been singularly real in their interest and veraciously like nature in the living characters introduced each chronicle has a central history with slighter sketches grouped round it the story of the subordinate personages has each in their turn been worked out at length the interest has been kept up the electric current has gone without break through the circle from the days of thc dear old warden of hirams hospital at barchester to these last chronicles of barset wherein mr harding full of years and goodness drops into an honoured grave in the meanwhile all the personages of the town and country have in their turn appeared before the reader and if the reader does not believe in barsetshire and all who live thereinlady lufton the rev mr robarts the great duke of omnium and the still greater marchioness of hartletop the dean of barchester the archdeacon grantley the poor bishop and his wife the terrible mrs proudiev along with others as numerous as a list of runners entered for the derbythe fault is not in mr trollope but in himself how many both men and women have desired to know the sequel to the story of lily dale and what numerous sympathisers and wellwishers has not johnny eames had in his crossed love and constancy but one has always felt that poor johnny would never grow up into a marriageable hero one only hoped he might not fall a victim to one of the designing young females with whom he had a curious tendency to perilous flirtation everybody who ever read  the small house at allington has bestowed many a passing thought on what would be the end of crosbie whether he would ever have the chance of marrying lily dale and whether she could would or ought to accept him it tells of great gifts that mr trollope should thus endow his characters with flesh and bloodandindividuality of interest make their surroundings graphic and tangible and yet make the men and women stand out from their background and live and move like human beings but it is evidence of still higher powers when the fortunes of these inhabitants of mr trollopes county of barsetshire obtain such a thorough hold on the interest of readers that they are anxious to hear more about them more even than mr trollope is willing to tell for he declares on his titlepage and in his closing paragraphs that the present is the last word he will ever say about barsetshire and its inhabitants we only hope he will not keep his word for he leaves  distant wilds still opening to the view and we hope he will tell us a great deal more about many persons mentioned in the present chronicle the hero of the present history is poor mr crawley the perpetual curate of hagglestock with whom acquaintance was first made in framley parsonage the sketch there introduced of the proud spartanlike poverty of the man with his learning his uprightness his devotion to his calling was very striking the strong counsel and rugged help he gave to his softer and weaker brother in the time of his trouble and temptation made for him a permanent niche in the memory and reverence of the reader but we hoped that we had left him comfortable and that after his wife had tided over that dangerous illness things would never be so bad with them again we hoped there would be promotion or at any rate a better income for them from some quarter but here in this  last chronicle we find them worse off than ever in a mess of debt and in a slough of discomfort which seems utterly hopeless and fathomless how things have grown to be so bad wc are not distinctly told nor the occasion when mr crawley consented to ask help and money not as a loan but as a gift from dean arabin but so it has fallen out the dean has given him money almost to the amount of onehalf of his poor yearly stipend and mr crawley has accepted it with much pain and confusion of soul keeping the money by him for weeks unused in the hope of being able by some miracle to do without it altogether but at last driven to extremity he has sent a cheque for 20 to the bank with his own name written at the back received and paid away the money and behold the cheque is proved to have been stolen  when asked how it came into his hands the poor man is bewildered he makes a statement which is at once disproved and he afterwards hazards the guess that it was a portion of the money given to him by the dean the dean now on his eastern travels is written to and denies all knowledge of the cheque matters look very black the man who lost the cheque institutes a prosecution no one except the prosecutor really believes mr crawley to be guilty but the difficulty of thinking him innocent admits of no explanation he has made two opposite statements neither of them true and this man who has so little money that he can barely buy bread to eat is unable to explain how he came by a cheque for 20 the interest of the story grows patheticalmost tragic the character of mr crawley is very clever the pride the misery the soreheartedness the excellence and utter perverseness of the man do not diminish the interest aud reverence of the reader for him he is felt to be a higher class of man than any of the pleasanter and more prosperous clergy around him though they do themselves honour by their staunch friendship in his sore need their shades of character are skilfully kept up and the whole conduct of the story is able and successful in drawing and sustaining the character of mr crawley mr trollope has given evidence of more subtle power than is to be found in any of his other people of course the mystery is solved at last in the simplest and most natural manner mr crawley is not only cleared but he is left at the end of the book in a new coat and a comfortable living we hope we have not heard the last of him for we should like to hear what will be the influence of prosperity upon him there are incidental sketches that are charming mr crawleys passage of arms with the bishops wife is delightful but justice is done even to mrs proudie and the reader parts from her without malice though to be sure she does the only thing possible to redeem sympathy the story of lily dale comes to a conclusion in one sense and on the whole it is satisfactory the meeting with crosbie is very well managed but in spite of all that mr trollope says we persist in hoping that she will find a good man whom she can make into hero enough to marry him a womans heart ought to be too deep to be drained of its love by one false lover whom she dressed and decorated entirely out of her own stores there is much delicate painting in this second appearance of lily dale and she loses none of the readers interest many other old acquaintances are disposed of poetical justice is executed on the unhappy crosbie he is reduced to his real proportions and the reader feels rather sorry for him than not we have spoken heartily of all we liked in these last chronicles but there are some four or five chanters which seem to have been introduced neck and shoulders apropos of nothing at all johnny eames is taken out to dinner by an artist conway dalrymple and all that ensues is simply a disagree able interruption to the course of the stoiyj on which it acts as a patch unskilfully laid on of incongruous colour and different material johnny eames loses somewhat in the readers regard but miss clara van siever madalina demolines with the two old harridans their mothers musselborough bangles dobbs broughton and mrs dobbs broughton even conway himself and all the story of the mock loves of madalina and mrs dobbs broughton are altogether out of place no one ever wishes to hear of them further their introduction is a

B8219,['9012145'],  janitii fair  a novel without a hero bv william makepeace thackeray bradbury  evans our readers will remember that we have already no 1030 p 783 introduced them to this latest of mr thackerays works at that time it had reached only its seventh monthly numberand the characters had of course not grown to the full proportions which they have since attained under the authors hands the mere sketches of that period have since been largely filled in and elaborately wrought up and for that reason we now return to the work in its completed state as in many respects one of the most remarkable works of modern fiction for some years mr thackeray has been a marked man in lettersbut known rather as an amusing sketcher than as a serious artist light playful contributions to periodical literature and two amusing books of travel were insufficient to make a reputation but a reputation he must now be held to have established by his vanity fair it is his greatest effort and his greatest success the strength which lay within him he has here put forth for the first time the work before us retains traces of the writers old faulta fault fostered no doubt by the carelessness and impromptu proper to serial publicationviz a sort of indifference to the serious claims of literature a cavalier impertinence of manner as if he were playing with his subject nothing could be more impertinent for instance than mr thackerays second number  in which he relapsed into his old magazine manner and postponed the continuation of his narrative to imitations of some of his cotemporary writers of fiction fit subjects for ridicule such writers may bebut the ridicule is misplaced in the work which mr thackeray had in hand considered as a work of art in the same number he becomes suddenly aware of the discrepancy between the costume of the period in which he has laid his scene and the costume in which he has depicted the characters in his pictorial illustrations all he does on the discovery is to notify the fact in a note and flippantly pretend that the real costume was too hideous for his purpose he has been guilty however of the same confusion of periods throughout the work sometimes we are in the early part of the present centuryat others we are palpably in 1848 writing from month to month encourages such laches but for the sake of such a reputation as mr thackeray has now arrived at it will be well that he should he more upon his guard jjje style of  vanity fair is winning easy nicoline felicitous and humorous its pleaunt pages are nowhere distorted by rant the jnjbortndulges in no sentimentalitiesinflicts fine writing on his readers trusting to the force of truth and humour he is the quietest 0f contemporary writersa merit worth noting  a literary age which has a tendency to mistake spasm for force the book has abundant faults of its ownand we shall presently notice some of them but they are not the faults most current in our literature the writer is quite free from theatricality no glare from the footlights is thrown upon human nature exaggerating and distorting it he is guiltless too kt us be thankful for such a boon in the sense here intendedof a  purpose unfettered by political or social theories his views of men ind classes are not cramped the rich in his pages are not necessarily viciousthe poor not aga consequence of their poverty virtuous and highminded againmany jesters take advantage of their cap and bells and adopt as their motto ridentem dicere falsum quid vetat under the plea that laughter is not a serious thing and what is laughingly spoken is not to be critically judged they have sacrificed troth to their joke no advocate of any cause however should be more scrupulously watched than he who laughing teaches against the dogmas of the politician philosopher or theologian the reader is on his defence these come in such a questionable shape that we mut examine them their seriousness alarms m we scrutinise proofs and combat conclusion but the jester is privileged he throws ui off our guard by the smile of his approach and insinuates conviction by the bribery of laughter the laughter passes but the error may remain it has gained admittance into our unsuspecting mindsand is left there unsuspected it is a muchdisputed question whether or not ridicule be a test of truth i to us the question appears answered by saying that if the ridicule be developed ab intra from the argumentnot thrown on it ab extrait is a test if a wit descries the latent absurdity grinning under a moral mask and exposes it he has confuted the argument if he himself grins and makes faces at the mask he may excite laughter hut has not carried confutation a famous illustration of the former method is the reply made to that philosopher who argued with a sort of seductive plausibility that the emotion inspired in the heart of man by the sight of womans bosom is owing to association of ideasto his dim remembrance of having drawn his first nourishment from that sacred source  if said the wit who sawor believed he sawa fallacy lurking under the suggestion a child brought up by hand were to see a wooden spoon he would in that case experience the same emotionsit is one of thackerays peculiar excellencies that he almost always ridicules ab intra an absurdity is stated by him u the quietest and gravest manner as if he were himself a believer in it like others andenforced by such means of selfaccumulation as leave it tounmitigated contempt his irony of this kind  perfect  but it is a weapon which he uses ar too exclusively he has shown himself as we nave said a satirist but not an artist with himself we exclaim  o brother wearers of gotley are there not moments when one grows c of grinning and tumbling and the jingling of bells there is nothing so sad as a constant miue laughter becomes wearisome when too much prolonged  for it is then a sort of hlaskeny against the divine beauty which is in life mr thackeray grows serious and pathetic at tunesbut almost as if he were ashamed of it like a man caught in tears at the theatre it is one weakness of the satirist that he is commonly afraid of the ridicule of others we have said that mr thackeray is a satirist not an artistand from that characteristic may be deduced many of his deficiencies for instance the reader of  vanity fair will have observed that we have in it nothing but scenes and sketchesonly glimpses not views there is constant succession of description but no development of story the passions are taken at their culminating point not exhibited in the process of growth the incidents are seldom transacted before our eyes but each is taken as a fait accompli nor is there anything like proportion kept the writer opens a chapter and his pen runs on easily fed by a full and observant mindbut recording the suggestions ofthe moment rather than building up the various portions of an edifice already planned and in which each part has its due significance mr thackeray is deficient too in passion a deficiency that sits lightly on a satirist but is serious in a writer of fiction he has no command over this qualityapparently but little knowledge of it the curtain of the tragedy of life has seldom risen before him or he has looked on its representations with an incurious eye altogether one may say that mr thackeray has not very curiously or patiently observed moral phenomena life he has seen both at home and abroad and he has reflected on what he has seen we feel that he is painting after nature  and this conviction it is which makes his work so delightful nothing is permanently interesting but truth as a consequence of mr thackerays satirical tendency may be noted the prodigality of vice and folly to be found in his pagesand which affords no true representation of human nature but only the exaggeration of a feature it has been made a serious reproach against this writer that he has arrived at such a pitch of misanthropy or doubt as to think with chamfort that anhonestman is a variety ofthe human species it is not the first time that this great defect of art has been conspicuous in the writings of mr thackeray the  snob papers undertaken to expose the folly of a class gradually expanded under the writers satiric heat till they found snobbery every where and marked every body for a snob good instincts and impulses came under the ridicule which should have branded a folly or a vice and long ere the  papers came to a close all feeling of sincerity was gone the author who began with a moral was content at last to get a laughand ruined his moral by laughing in holy places so with this hook the writer began no doubt with the wholesome intention of lashing the vices and follies of vanity fair in a more restrictive senseregarded as one of the social phases but gradually all the districts of society are swept into his vanity fair  and there is nothing good in it this is false and unwholesome teaching what a mass of scoundrels blacklegs fools and humbugs mr thackeray has crowded together there is scarcely a good or estimable person in the book and as little of affection as of virtue even the heroine ameliawith whom the writer seems to have been somewhat enamoured a feeling of which he is likely to have the monopolyis thoroughly selfish as well as silly the one fine exception is major dobbina sketch not unworthy of the hand that drew  my uncle toby as we have said mr thackerays humour is peculiarly his own he never frames and glazes an idea the simplest words and in the simplest manner are used to bring out his meaning and everything seems to flow from him as water from a rock we may add that when he chooses to be pathetic a quality of the same kind gives wonderful effect to his pathos how beautiful is the scene in which amelia has resolved at length to part from her child   one day when things had come to a very bad passwhen the creditors were pressing the mother in hysteric grief the father in more than usual gloom the inmates of the family avoiding each other each secretly oppressed with his private unhappiness and notion of wrongthe father and daughter happened to be left alone together and amelia thought to comfort her father by telling him what she had done she had written to josephan answer must come in three or four months he was always generous though careless he could not refuse when he knew how straightened were the circumstances of his parents then the poor old gentleman revealed the whole truth to herthat his son was still paying the annuity which his own imprudence had flung away he had not dared to tell it sooner he thought amelias ghastly and terrified look when with a trembling miserable voice he made the confession conveyed reproaches to him for his concealment ah said he with quivering lips and turning away you despise your old father nowo papa it is not that amelia cried out falling on his neck and kissing him many times  you are always good and kind you did it for the best it is not for the moneyit iso my god my god  have mercy upon me and give me strength to bear this trial and she kissed him again wildly and went away still the father did not know what that explanation meant and the burst of anguish with which the poor girl left him it was that she was conquered the sentence was passed the child must go from her to othersto forget her her heart and her treasureber joy hope love worshipher god almost she must give him up and thenand then she would go to george and they would watch over the child and wait for him until he came to them in heaven she put on her bonnet scarcely knowing what she did and went out to walk in the lanes by which george used to come back from school and where she was in the habit of going on his return to meet the boy it was may a half holiday the leaves were all coming out the weather was brilliant the boy came running to ber flushed with health singing bis bundle of schoolbooks hanging by a thong there lie was both her arms were round him no it was impossible they could not be going to part  what is the matter mother said ho you look very pale nothing my child she said and stooped down and kissed him that night amelia made the boy read the story of samuel to her and how hannah his mother having weaned him brought him to eli the high priest to minister before the lord and he read the song of gratitude which hannah sang and which says  who it is who maketh poor and maketh rich and bringeth low and exaltethbow the poor shall be raised up out of the dust aud how in his own might no man shall be strong then he read how samuels mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up to offer the yearly sacrifice and then in her sweet simple way georges mother made commentaries to the boy upon this affecting story how hannah though she loved her son so much yet gave bim up because of her vow and how she must always have thought of bim as she sat at home far away making the little coat and samuel she was sure never forgot his mother and how happy she must have been as the time came and the years pass away very quick when she should see her boy and how good and wise he had grown this little sermon she spoke with a gentle solemn voice and dry eyes until she came to the account of their meetingthen the discourse broke off suddenly the tender heart overflowed and taking the boy to her breast she rocked him in her arms and wept silently over bim in a sainted agony of tears we must give the parting too what a profound and cruel touch is that childlike selfishness with which georgy receives the announcement of the separation  george was kept from school the next day and saw his aunt amelia left them alone together and went to her room she was trying the separation  as that poor gentle lady jane grey felt the edge of the axe that was to come down and sever her slender life days were passed in parleys visita preparations the widow broke the matter to georgy with great caution she looked to see him very much affected by the intelligence he was rather elated than otherwise and the poor woman turned sadly away he bragged about the news that day to the boys at school told them how he was going to live with his grandpapa his fathers father not the one who comes here sometimes and that he would bo very rich and have a carriage and a pony and go to a much finer school and when he was rich he would buy leaders pencilcase and pay the tart woman the boy was the image of his tallier as his fond mother thought indeed i have no heart on account of our dear amelias sake to go through the story of georges last days at home at last the day came the carriage drove up the little humble packets containing tokens of love and remembrance were read and disposed in the hali long sincegeorge was in his new suit for which the tailor had come previously to measure him he had sprung up with the sun and put on the new clothes his mother hearing him from the room close by in which she had been lying in speechless grief and watching days before she had been making preparations for the end  purchasing little stores for the boys usc marking his books and linen talking with him and preparing him for the changofondly fancying that he needed preparation so that he had change what cared he  he was longing for it by a thousand cager declarations as to what he would do when he went to live with his grandfather he had hown the poor widow how little the idea of parting had cast him down  he would come and see his mamma often on the ponyhe said he would come and fetch her in thc carriage they would drive in the park and she should have everything she wanted the poor mother was fain to content herself with these selfish demonstrations of attachment and tried to convince herself how sincerely her son loved her he must love her all children were so a little anxious for novelty andno not selfish but selfwilled her child must have his enjoyments and ambition in the world she herself by her own selfishness and imprudent love for him had denied him his just rights and pleasures hitherto the character of becky is amongst the finest creations of modern fiction she is perfectly unlike any other clever heartless woman yet drawn with great art she is made rather selfish than wickedthough the excess of the selfishness rises to the force and has the effect of wickedness profound immorality is made to seem consistent with unfailing good humour becky has neither affections nor passions nor principles she uses men as chessmenand is not checkmated at last it is very strange that the reader has a sort of liking for her in spite of his better knowledge the fact is the author has contrived in a surprising way to represent not only beckys mind but her manner we are in some sort under her spellas rawdon was to us she is almost as lively entertaining and goodhumoured as she was to those amongst whom she lived like lord steyne we may see through her yet covet her society her equability of temper is a nice touch it belongs to the physiology of such a character they who have no affections and no principles can be wounded only in their selflove and may obtain the character of being goodtemperea at the cheapest possible cost the consistency of this remarkable character is maintained to the last how full yet brief graphic and suggestiveis the microscopic view of her life after her separation from her husband  our darling beckys first flight was not very far she perched upon the french coast at boulogne that refuge of so much exiled english innocence and there lived in rather a genteel widowed manner with a femme de chamber and a couple of rooms at an hotel she dined at the table dhote where people thought lier very pleasant and whete she entertained her neighbours by stories of her brother sir pitt and her great london acquaintance talking that easy fashionable slipslop which has so much effect upon certain folks of small breeding she passed with many of them for a person of importance she gave little teaparties in her private room and shared in the innocent amusements ofthe placein seabathing nnd in jaunts of open carriages in strolls on the sands and in visits to the play mrs burjoice the printers lady who was boarding with her family at the hotel for the summer anil to whom her burjoice came of n saturday and sunday voted her charming until that little rogue of a burjoice began to pay her too much attention but there was nothing in the story only that becky was always affable easy and goodnaturedand with men especially numbers of people were going abroad as usual at the end of the season and becky hud plenty of opportunities of rinding out by the behaviour of her acquaintances of the great london world the opinion of  society as regarded her conduct one day it was lady partlet and her daughters whom becky confronted as she was walking modestly on boulogne pier the clitfs of albion shining in the distance across the deep blue sea lady partlet marshalled all her daughters round her with a sweep of her parasol and retreated from the pier darting savage glances nt poor little becky who stood alone there on another day the packet came in it had been blowing fresh and it always suited beckys humour to see the droll and woebegono faces of the people ns they emerged from the boat lady slingstone happened to bu on board this day her ladyship had been exceedingly ill in her carriage and was greatly exhausted anti scarcely fit to walk up the plank from the ship to the pier but all her energies rallied the instant she saw becky smiling roguishly under a pink bonnet and giving her a glance of scorn such as would have shrivelled up most women she walked into the custom house quite unsupported becky only laughed but i dont think she liked it she felt sho was alone quite alone  and the farotf shining cliffs of england were impassable to her the behaviour of the men had undergone too i dont know what change grinstone showed his teeth and laughed in her face with a familiarity that was not pleasant little bob suckling who was cap in hand to her three months before and would walk a mile in the rain to see for ber carriage in though line nt gaunt house was talking to fitzoof of the guards lord heehaws son one day upon the jetty as becky took ber walk there little bobby nodded to her over bis shoulder without moving his hat and continued his conversation with the heir of heehaw tom raikes tried to walk into ber sittingrooin at the inn with a cigar in his mouth but she closed the doorupon him and would have locked it only that bis ringers were inside she began to feel that she was very lonely indeed  if hed been here she said those cowards would never have dared to insult me she thought about bim with great sadness and perhaps longingabout his honest stupid constant kindness and fidelity  his neverceasing obedience  bis good humour  his bravery and courage very likely she cried for she was particularly lively and had put on a little extra rouge when she came down to dinner she rouged regular now andand her maid got cognac for her besides that which was charged in the hotel bill perhaps the insults of the men were not however so intolerable to her as the sympathy of certain women mrs crackenbury and mrs washington white passed through boulogne on their way to switzerland the party were protected by colonel hornby young beaumoris and of course old crackenbury and mrs whites little girl they did not avoid her they giggled cackled tattled condoled consoled and patronised her until they drove her almost wild with rage to bo patronised by them  she thought as they went away simpering after kissing her and she heard beaumoriss laugh ringing on the stair and knew quite well how to interpret his hilarity it was after this visit that becky who had paid ber weekly bills becky who had made herself agreeable to everybody in the house who smiled at the landlady called the waiters  monsieurand paid the chambermaids in polhen nnd apologies what far more than compensated ft little niggardliness in point of money of which bea never was free that becky we sav received  notice to quit from the landlord who had been told by some one that she was quite an unfit person s have at his hotel where english ladies would not sit down with lier and she was forced to fly  lodgings of which the dullness and solitude were most wearisome to her still she held up in sdj of these rebuffs and tried to make a character for herself and conquer scandal she went to church very regularly and sang louder than nnvbody there she took up the cause of the widows of the shin wrecked fishermen and gave work and drawing fo the quashyboo mission  she subscribed to the assembly and wouldnt waltz in a word she did everything that was respectable and that is why we dwell upon this part of her career with more fondness than upon subsequent parts of her history which are not so pleasant she saw people avoiding her and still laboriously smiled upon them you never could suppose from her countenancewhat pangs of humiliation she might be enduring inwardly her history was after all a mystery parties were divided about her some people who took the trouble to busy themselves in the matter said that she was the criminal whilst others vowed that she wits as innocent as a lamb and that her odious husband was in fault she won over a good many by bursting into tears about her boy and exhibiting the most frantic grief when his name was mentioned or she saw anybody like him she gained good mrs alderneys heart in that way who was rather the queen of british boulogne and gave the most dinners and balls of all the residents there by weeping when muster alderney came from dr swishtail academy to pass his holidays with his mother  he and her rawdon were of the same age and io like becky said in a voice choking with agony whereas there was five years difference between the boys ages nnd no more likeness between them than between my respected reader and his humble servant wenham when ho was going abroad on his way to kissengen to join lord steyne enlightened mrs alderney on this point and told her how he was much more able to describe little rawdon than his mamma who notoriously hated him and never saw him how he was thirteen years old while little alderney was but nine fair while the other darling was darkin a word caused the lady in question to repent of her good humour whenever becky made a little circle for herself with incredible toils and labour somebody carno and swept it down rudely and she had all her work to begin over again it was very hard  very hard lonely and disheartening there was mrs newbright who took her up for some time attracted by the sweetness of her singing at church and by her proper views upon serious subjects concerning which in former days at queens crawley mrs becky had had a good deal of instructionwell she not only took tracts but she read them she worked flannel petticoats for the quashybooscotton nightcaps for the coconut indianspainted handscreens for the conversion of the pope and the jewssate under mr rowls on wednesdays mr huggleton on thursdays attended two sunday services at church besides mr bawler the darbyite in the evening and all in vain mrs newbright had occasion to correspond with the countess of southdown about the warmingpan fund for the feejee islanders for the management of which admirable charity both these ladies formed part of a female committee and having mentioned her sweet friend mrs rawdon crawley the dowager countess wrote back such a letter regarding becky with such particulars hints facts falsehoods and general comminations that intimacy between airs newbright and mrs crawley ceased forthwith  and all the serious world of tours where this misfortune took place immediately parted company with the reprobate those who know the english colonies abroad know that we carry with us our pride pills prejudices harveysauces cayennepepper and other lares making a little britain wherever we settle down from one colony to another becky fled uneasily from boulogne to dieppe from dieppe to caen from caen to tourstrying with au her might to be respectable  alas always found out some day or other d pecked out ofthe cage by the real daws next in point of skill to that of becky is the portrait of rawdon crawleythe heavy stupid so comutlemanly dragoon and blackleg i nletely subjugated by his clever little wife his affection for his child quite whitewashes him the reader forgets the blackleg in the father it is worthy of note with what consummate truth this heavy dragoon is made to feel his insignificance by the side of his clever little wife but how completely paralysed the adroit little woman is when she stands guilty before her husbandhow silently she obeys him who has hitherto obeyed herhow she feels that her arts are powerless against his passion brute strength long led by mental cunning here reasserts its empire and is undisputed the whole scene is most masterly jos sedley is rather a failure nor is he consistently drawn we are introduced to him as a roan painfully shy nervous and stupid but ti the story proceeds he drops his shyness and retains only the gluttony and stupidity of his former self meant as a decidedly comic character he creates but little mirthgeorge osborne the vain and foolish young officer is capitally drawn lord steyne is one of those telling exaggerations which make people exclaim how true when their acquaintance with lords is confined to fashionable novels though overdone however it is an exaggeration byamaster and the descriptions of gaunt house and its inmates transcend all previous efforts in that style old miss crawley is capital her selfishness her sagacity her terrors in ill health ber triumph over the meanness which surrounds her and which she laughs at and profits by are vividly presented yet by the simplest strokes here is a sentence pregnant with meaning and very characteristic of the author picture to yourself oh fair young reader a worldly selfish graceless thankless religionless old woman writhing in pain and fear and without her wig picture her to yourself and ere you be old learn to love and pray  mrs odowd must not be forgotten the gallant woman has won the hearts of her regiment and of all her readers how true homely affectionate and wise is the description of her packing up the majors traps and preparing his coffee for him on the eve of waterloo the vividness with which the whole of the scenes at brussels stand out before the eye is marvellous when we reflect that the author is not describing the scenes which he himself witnessed but only painting after the descriptions of others they imply a fine faculty for historical romance nor is it only in this more elaborate painting that mr thackeray has exhibited a constant mastery in the present book the instances are abundant of meaning conveyed and intensified by a single line of illustration take only one where amelia reads over georges letters she read them overas if she did not know them by heart already  but she could not part with them that effort was too much for her she placed them back in her bosom againas you have seen a woman nurse a child that is dead our extracts though sparing will suffice to warrant the terms in which we have spoken of vanity fair its great excellence however cannot be tested hy extracts the charm of the work pervades itand is not gathered up into separate bits knowledge of life good humoured satire penetration into motive power of

B7611,['9040671'],  peveril of the peak literary notices by the author of waverley c whatever the extent of the genius and invention of the author of  waverley we know not that it is a whit moro surprising than the singular aptitude with which he stimulates attention and the felicity of manoeuvre by which he tantalises curiosity we question if a committee formed pf lotteryoffice keepers and

of description portraiture tf manners and spiritedness of characteristic sketching this writer always prepares a pleasant repast if not an absolute banquet it is beginning to be suspected indeed that with all the merit of the caterer the feast is more showy than substantial as also that by a light and dexterous employment of garnish and sauces the same dish is served up in a variety of disguises as thia is unavoidable in all who write much we must not complain nf it in one of the most entertaining of defaulters  nor should we have been tempted to allude to it at all but for the enacting

of the author sir geoffrey peveril is a good portrait of the hospitable but despotic country gentleman of hia day abounding in feudal prejudices and a plentiful lack of brains his puritanic neighbour major bridgnorth is but so io and he somewhat unaccountably diverges from a calm man of sense into a gloomy fanatic without a sufficiency of predisposing canse for the alteration the countess of derby is raised from the dead to little purpose except to give motive to a most inexplicable villain of the name of christian whose brother she had executed for treason in her petty sovereignty of man attention is exceedingly roused by this character but it is entirely in the excitation of a curiosity by a species of unaccountable versatility which is very poorly accounted for the hero julian peveril we have already said is nobody  and his counterpart alice however lovely in description is in action nothing at all and is this ailby no means for how could the author of  waverley dispense with the agency of a something mysterious and fantastic  in the present instance the personification is peculiarly grotesque the intriguer christian has a natural daughter by a moorish female whom if we un derstand the story fright he disposes of in her infancy to a dutch tumbler but afterwards redeems on a supposition of making her useful to his purposes this girl ie ted to hekere that his executed brother is her father and in eon sequence is induced to counterfeit deafness and dumbness in which supposed state she is received as a sort of elfin attendant on the countess of derby whose destruction is sought and whose most secret intentions she thereby gets at without suspicion this feasible scheme is however defeated by her imbibing an uncontrollable penchant for julian peveril who being related to the countess ia brought up with her son the young earl of derby and in consequence thrown in the way of this mysterious attendant when therefore he is induced to take some dangerous packets to the catholic friends of the countess during the ferment created by the popish plot she attends him from time to time as a kind of esprit follet until at length we find her a woman of wit speech and spirit although doomed to love in vain and to intrigue to no purpose either for her father or herself the dark moorish yet piquant aspect the slight symmetrical person profusion of dark hair and almost supernatural agility from her education in the tumbling line altogether make up a perfect nondescript and we fear not a very happy one the general conception approaches to j extravagance and the action assigned to it is almost ridiculous only think ladies of a girt agreeing to act deafness pand dumbness for several years and to be pitied and durwarded m such by the man she adored i eran in romance there should be some verisimilitude  upon the whole we think that  peveril and  nigel jjnjr rank pea on a par although charles ii falls tar tefamd jamesil in happiness of

we possess in english and one that is of especial value since the tales are not merely translations the word  english however is somewhat misleadingso many of the tales are scotch it would be of interest also to know the actual source of the tales which mr jacobs heard in australia many of the tales are of course familiar to all students of folklore in english forms and i am not sure that mr jacobs versions are always the best occasionally too one seems to miss the genuine ring not of the folktale but of the folktelling and there are certain omissions thatunless mr jacobs is as i hope contemplating a second volumeare difficult to account for but despite small faults of commission and omission faults one only notices because the work is so good thc volume is most welcome only one protest  tom tit tot mr jacobs declares is  superior to any of the continental variants with which he is acquainted it may be that i am prejudiced and that therefore the german variant which delighted me as a child still seems to me the best be this as it may to me at least  rumpelstilzchen  seems more graceful more humorous and more dramatic than tom tit tot but whatever the grownup folk may say the little folk will be of only one opinion concerning these  talesthey will receive them with a chorus of delight and after all are not children the best as they are also the most honest of critics  the admirable illustrations by j d batten are worthy of the tales no wellregulated nursery should be without these old old stories in their charming new dress  tattercoats from more erglish fairy tales more english fairy talfs collected and edited by iosepii jacobs illtistratel by j  batten d nutt mr jacobs has kept some of the best of his tales for this volume adhering to his former plan and stoutly defending it in his preface he has given them for the most part in the racy speech of the people but always keeping in mind that they are meant to be read and liked by children he refuses to draw a line between scottish and english border tales and so  rashincoatie  and  habitrot  are here it is a delightful and at the same time a very amusing collection full of humour and insight into peasant character and customs but none of the tales are here for any such serious reason but simply because they are good to read and listen to nfr batten never entered more thoroughly into the spirit of the tales than he has done in this volume which should be fully as popular as any of mr jacobs former oncs  celtic fain tales solectod and edited bv joseph jacobs editor of folklore illustrated by john d batten nutt tales and lng ends by av carew hazlitt sonnenschein  co mn jacobs tolls us in the preface that his chief difficulty has been that of selecting where there is so much ready to hand his collection consists of twentysix stories representing ireland scotland wales and cornwall but chiefly ireland and scotland in fact though brythons have here onl five storiesfour from wales  the shepherd of myddvai the wooing of olwen the brewery of eggshells and  beth gellort and one from cornwall  the tale of ivan mr jacobs however explains that it is not his fault that little wales is not better represented and hopes that the eisteddfod may do something for welsh folklore by offering prizes for collecting folktales in the principality this has been done to some extent but with no great rosults as yet at least so far as though public is concerned thus the eisteddfod held in london a few years ago awarded a prize to the rev elias owen for work done in this field  but what has becomo of it  we are not awaro that it has ever boon published then as to complete stories of any length we feel pretty certain that there are none such to be found in wales at the present day and this is our idea also as to though time not long ago when that peculiar collector of folklore wirt sikes flourished mr jacobs gives his readers clearly to understand whero ho has found his tales and how he has dealt with them modifying or excising though original translations from celtic hero and there where he found them ovorliteral for his avowed object is not to appeal to english folklorists and scholars but to intorost and please a more youthful class of roaders and wo certainly think that he has boen eminently successful mr batten has also done his part admirably and both he and mr jacobs leave one under the impression that they have not themselves escaped the fascination whereby  though captive celt has enslaved his captor in though realm of imagination though present volume accordingly attempts to begin the pleasant captivity from the earliest years and it may bo trusted to act in some measure as an antidote to the ruthless unreason of the budding golthers of our day by no means the least interesting portion of the volume is that consisting of the thirty pages of notes to the stories these it is neodloss to say are not quite exhaustive but it would be invidious to suggest here a variety of small additions which occur to us as of interest to the specialist all the notes aro decidedly instructive reading and some such as that in which the origin of the beth gelert story of llewelyn and his greyhound is traced break new ground others illustrate accidentally the position of mr jacobs in the folklore world for our readers are doubtless aware that folklorists aro divided in opinion on the question of parallel developments as against borrowing wo may cite the following passage as both explaining what we mean and dealing with a curious feature of folktales it occurs in mr jacobss notes on the story of  hudden and dudden p 248  it is indeed curious to find as m cosquin points out a cunning fellow tied in a sack getting out by crying i wont marry the princess in countries so far apart as ireland sicilyafghanistanand jamaicait is indeed impossible to think these are disconnected and for drolls of this kind a good case has been made out for the borrowing hypotheses by m cosquin and mr clouston who borrowed from whom is another and more difficult question which has to be judged on its merits in each individual case probably in this instance all would agree that there has been borrowing by somebody  but in some cases the other theory namely that of parallel developments in a similarity of circumstances is held by some students of folklore and to these mr jacobs at the recent international folklore congress gave the name of  casualists what is to bo the name of the other partythat to which he himself belongs probably some such name as  niigrationists  would do as well as any other but the difference between the two schools is only one of degree the migrationists being as they themselves think more sensitive to though numerical argument from a calculation of though chances against independent developments in each particular instance before we turn to mr hazlitts book we may bo permitted to express our regret that leisure was not found to revise the printers errols moro carefully for if words which are not english are introduced into an english book pains should be taken to have them spelled in some way recognised in the languages to which the belong  if you must needs speak of  the cymru you should know that it means  the wales and that you have to write  the cymry  if you wish to allude in that way to  the welsh people we have seen more than ono way of spelling the gaelic word for antiquary or storyteller but ve have never before seen it made into theenachie similarly  archroologia britannia and similar slips in the notes look strange and ought to disappear in future editions of which thore will we doubt not be many as the volume cannot fail to become popular and deservedly so it is difficult to know for what class of readers mr hazlitts book is designed not surely for students of folklore for in the preamble to robin hood on his 242nd page mr hazlitt says that  in dealing with this ancient and favourite tradition the editor has for the first time made use of such material only as appeared to him authentic so exactly half the book is valueless for scientific purposes unless as we gather from other parts of it mr hazlitts command of english is not always so complete as to enable him to say what he means students of folklore too require much more precise information than is here afforded and will naturally prefer to go to the fountain head for these interesting but wellknown old stories neither can the book be intended for young persons  or children for various incidents are related with  the masculine frankness of the old time nor yet for lovers of ballad poetry for none such when reading a selection of ballads from the  reliques which have been digested into prose whatever that may mean  would admit that  the probability is that many of the ancient tales here found present themselves for the first time in an intelligible form or that the handling of say for instance the nutbrowne maid is faithful and judicious and has made it capable of yielding to the lover of the ballad and folktale a store at once of entertainment and instruction what possible instruction is to he obtained from a translation which changes 0 lord what is th s worldys blysse tfhat ohangeth as the mone  my somers day in lusty may is derked bel ore the none 1 here you saye farewel nay nay we departe rot so sone into such prosaic prose as o lord what availeth the happiness of the world  the glory of a summers day is quenched before noon i hear thee say farewell nay nay we are not so soon to depart  if the until death us dopart of the marriage service had not been altered into u until death us do part almost every one would havo known that to depart means to part if mr hazlitt knew it he should have completed the work of modernization hy saying  part here to our mind however such treatment of our old ballads is both barbarous and unnecessary never yet have we seen the child of fair intelligence who could not after taking thought read and got pleasure out of  chevy chace  adam bel the  battle of otterburn and many others which have had both poetry and point taken out of them by mr hazlitt for a bit of fine confused writing showing a great deal of appreciation of and contempt for theso ballads and legends we commend our readers to the preface it is written in the manner of a schoolboy who thinks that a good style can be acquired by the reduplication of nouns verbs and adjectives  more celtic fairy tales ra selected and edited by joseph jacobs illustrated by j d batten nutt mr jacobs first book of  celtic fairy tales did not exhaust the gems in his collection wvere it only to provide a place for one of the most beautiful stories in the world the fate of the children of lir a second volume would have been justified and the black horse and how cormac macart went to fairy  are two others in this second series that must fascinate all with taste for tales of the celtic imagination mr jacobs versions keep the commonsensible rather than the poetical features of the stories in the foreground but that is perhaps no disadvant from  more celtic fairy tales nutt age in a book first meant for children mr batten is as good as ever the illustrations to  powel prince of dyfed and  paddy okelly are capital he knows how to relieve his most fearsome pictures by a touch of humour  english fairy tales by joseph jacobs illustrated by j d batten nutt the flyleaf of this book tells us how to get into it the difficulty however will not be how to get into it but how to get out of it for from first to last almost without an exception these stories are delightful there are old friends among them which never can appear too often there are others with which we have hitherto only had a bowing acquaintance and there are one or two which are entirely new we are not quite sure about the whole party being englishone or two seem to have strayed out of grimms  kinder und hausmiirchen and to have been a little weakened on the way some of them judging from the point of view of folklore might certainly have been more appropriately included in a scotch collection mr jacobs explains their appearance thus  i have also included some stories that have only been found in lowland scotch i have felt justified in doing this as of the twentyone folktales contained in chamberss  popular rhymes of scotland no less than sixteen are also to be found in an english form the reasoning here is not strong but the stories are good we can imagine mr jacobs feeling the same pious joy that thrilled the old north  country steward who recounting to his absent lord the depredations caused by a foray made by the scots when  the falsehearted thieving loons  drove away flocks and herds over the border wound up by saying  but thankit be the lord we have outstolen them the more stories of this kind that are  lifted  into books that the public are likely to read the better and as mr jacobs informs his readers that some day he is going  to treat the subject of the english folktale on a larger scale with all the necessary paraphernalia of prolegomena and excursus  his readers may for the present wink at an english fairy tale called the laidly worm which is avowedly patched up out of a ballad by mr lamb of norham  with touches from the more ancient version  kempton  mr jacobs has performed the service of compiling an excellent version of  jack th giantkiller from two old chapbooks itt the british museum it is in all substantial points the same as that of which grimm gives a summary in the notes on english folktales at the end of the  hausmarchen a satisfactory version has long been needed for the chapbooks which told the story well seem to have been altogether superseded by those which told it badly we wonder no one took the trouble to go to the british museum with this object before all the illustrations to this book are good but that which shows jack entering the giants castle wearing the cap which makes him invisible is very good indeed and decidedly original in the preface to the  cauld lad of hilton mr jacobs speaks of him as the contrariest brownie ever known but he was not more contrary than brownies always are or were  they always behaved just as the  cauld lad  did if they found things orderly and clean they at once proceeded to break furniture and crockery to turn everything topsyturvy and play uncomfortable tricks of all kinds if however the servants were dirty and disorderly and went to bed leaving their work undone the brownie immediately began to put all in good order a brownies mission was therefore to demoralise servants by showing them that it was wise policy to leave their work undone the servants who had to do with the cauld lad of hilton castlenot hall by the way as mr jacobs has it must have been good ones or they would have suffered no inconvenience from the nightly visitant the brownie of hilton was however supposed to be the ghost of a poor lad working about the place who had been murdered there which may account for the servants anxiety to get rid of him another part of a brownies mission seems to have been to teach ingratitude for any present of clothes or of anything more substantial than a little milk or food always resulted in depriving the household of his services if a fault can be found with this book it is that we do not always quite like the way in which the stories are told mr jacobs says in his preface generally speaking it has been my ambition to write as a good old nurse will speak when she tells fairy tales this being the case the critic can but ask himself two questions has mr jacobs done this satisfactorily  and is it a thing that it is well to do  he has done it very well if he wishes his nurse to be a rather vulgar one of the present day it is not prudent however to adopt this form of narration unless the imaginary nurse be made to use a simple and rather antiquated phraseology as a nurse of a hundred years ago whose style was formed on the bible might have done all the events recorded in fairy tales are supposed to have taken place long ago and seem to demand a somewhat archaic or to say the least oldfashioned form of speech the critics sense of fitness was always a little ruffled ly mr dasents method of telling a tale and the same irritation is felt upon perusing such sentences as these   dartersays she  put you them there pies on the shelf and leave em a little  or  go you and get one o them there pies or  she sat down on a stool in the kitchen and law how she did cry   or  he was disappointed in not seeing his young and beautiful wife to come and meet him through being hindered by her parents but that did not btop long or this in  childe rowland  and the thing to do is this  after you have entered the land of fairy whoever speaks to you till you meet the burd ellen you must out with your fathers brand and off with their head or this from  jack and the beanstalk    right you are said the man  and here they are the very beans themselves he went on pulling out of his pocket a number of strangelooking beans  as you are so sharp said he i dont mind doing a swop with youyour cow for these beans  walker  says jack   wouldnt you like it  it is to be hoped that when mr jacobs republishes these stories with the  necessary paraphernalia referred to already he will carefully do away with the only thing that damps the readers pleasure in them by carefully revising the nurses language  literature fairy tales indian fairy tales edited by joseph jacobs nutt fairy tales from the far east by theo gift lawrence  bullen fairy tales in other lands by julia goddard cassell  co scenes in fairyland by canon atkinson macmillan  co household tales and fairy stories routledge  sons mr jacobs has put together a good collection of stories some of which were gathered into the fold of literature more than two thousand years ago in the  kathasarit sagara of somadeva while others are the jetsam and flotsam of the present day rescued by miss frere miss stokes major temple c here too are to be found some of the fables of bidpai and the jatakas being interpreted  kathasarit sagara means  ocean of the streams of story did somadevas title mean that all known stories of all known lands had streamed into the ocean of his collection and found a home there and in the country in which it was formed mr jacobs is evidently inclined to hold the contrary opinion and to believe that all other countries derived their fairy tales and fables from india the majority of the tales in this volume he writes  havo been known in the west in some form or other and the problem arises how to account for their simultaneous existence in farthest west and east surely if as mr jacobs asserts they existed or began to exist at one and the same time in farthest west and east there is no problem to solve for it would be manifest that they were not transmitted from one country to another but that each had its own independent origin some mr jacobs continues aa benfey in germany m cosquin in france and mr clouston in england have declared that india is the home of the fairy tale and that all european fairy tales have been brought from thence by crusaders by mongol missionaries by gipsies by jews by traders by travellers we are happy to find that mr jacobs though he exhibits a strong leaning towards this theory does not go so far as these writers were it true indeed we should have to believe that for more centuries than we dare to contemplate the children of rich and poor alike in europe went supperless to bed so far as food for the imagination was concerned and that the patient peasantry spent the long dark hours when work was impossible unamused and unamusing we do not believe that they waited until the lord of the land brought back a story from the crusades or an argosy of stories put into port from the far east we prefer to believe with the grimmsthe farseeing fathers of all literature of research of this kindthat while the possibility nay in particular instances the probability of a story passing from one people to another and there firmly rooting itself on the foreign soil is not to be denied the property in fairy tales is common to all and that the  selfsame stories crop up again and again in places most widely remote from each other like a spring which forces its way up in spots which lie far apart and just as wherever the eye can pierce we tind domestic animals grain field and kitchen utensils household furniture armsin fact all the things without which social life would be impossibleso do we also rind sagas and stories corresponding with each other in a striking and yet independent manner they are just as much a necessity of existence as these things and only where avarice and the jarring wheels of machinery benumb every other thought can one imagine it possible to live without them this being the case in comparing the stories of various countries it is by no means necessary to attribute a storys origin to the country in which it appears to have been first current we must always remember that the number of rootstories is extremely limited so that a good deal of similarity must naturally be looked for the jatakas or birth stories of buddha have with the assistance of prof rhysdavids supplied theo gift with nine excellent stories for children nine however would by no means have sufficed had she not lengthened them considerably sometimes pleasantly and judiciously at others we are tempted to ask her to study one of the stories she has selected  the tortoise that could not hold its tongue that story bytheby in the original is told in three or four pages theo gift tells it in twentynine she ignores chronology and eastern local colour with absolute frankness and courage in one sense to ignore facts of time and space is to catch the very spirit of fairyland in another to talk of perambulators in a tale which was not new when it was committed to writing in the fifth century ad gives a shock to any reader who cares about the fitness of things deserts in theo giftrs stories seem to have a good deal of juicy grass interspersed with the sand  farmyards appear to be very like english farmyards  cows are called buttercup  and buttermilk aud clover seem to be going there is a story indeed which begins once upon a time in the days when the great great greatgrandfathers of our great great greatgrandfathers were just having their first breeches made there lived a farmer with one daughter of whom he was very fond he was a rich farmer and his fields were full of corn and clover and his orchards of apples and plums  and he had plenty of horses and cattle and sheep and poultry and pigs and pigeons and a yarddog and kitchen cat and every one of them was so well fed and cared for that even the geese in the pond said   this is the best place in the whole country to live in and so said the sage and onions too this is a hopelessly lower class nineteenth century presentment a great many more greatgreatgreatgrandfathers are needed to take us back to the time when these stories were  human natures daily food and a great deal more study to imbue us with its spirit and yet in spite of aberrations of this kind the book is often entertaining and well written we must not omit to commend mr oswald von glenns illustrations the ten little stories miss goddard has printed will be welcomed in the nursery and probably all the better liked for bearing a strong family likeness to other stories which have long reigned supreme in that domain if the  beauty  brings down the  beast on the father by asking for a few samples of the great wall of china instead of the conventional rose the story is still pleasant reading and the beast though much less interesting is as placable as the beast of our early affections if the japanese red riding hood becomes a  blue mantle and the wolf turns into the allegory of the nile the story is still a story in addition to these departures from the wellbeaten track we have a scandinavian somewhere close to the north pole jack the giantkilleronly he ought not to have been called jan an egyptian puss in boots which becomes a cat in yellow slippers and a persian jack and the beanstalk in which the beanstalk is turned into a carrot with a bushy top and jack has to descend underground instead of climbing up to dangerous heights this little book is sent forth with no hint of any desire to do more than amuse children from beginning to end there is not a word as to the origin of the stories or any of their incidents we accept it on its own showing the stories are prettily told fairyland appears to be easily entered from the moorland parish over which canon atkinson has for forty and odd years presided and yorkshire scenery and dialect come largely into play in his volume when they do not coin words for themselves the hero and heroine use those in vogue in cleveland they  scuttle people off home and encounter other people who stump about cannily and laugh a ramshackle laugh the fairies too wash their clothes at  the kerd of the country side and bittle them on the big flat stones near by this is pleasant enough but when  miss mary who does lessons is surprised over things and continually expresses her surprise by exclaiming  whatever will nurse say we wish she had done these lessons to more purpose miss mary is disappointing  instead of being witty she is snappish when she opens her mouth it is most frequently to say  psha and in spite of her various experiences in fairyland she cannot be persuaded to believe in fairies a book of this kind makes us hasten to renew our allegiance to the incomparable alice and the sweet unreasonableness of lewis carroll it is unreasonableness which never runs too long in the same groove but for ever surprises us with some unexpected change of venue while alices good manners and politeness under trying circumstances are unfailing 4 scenes in fairyland shows a considerable amount of invention and fancy were it reduced to onethird of its present length it would be infinitely better this is a description of an ingenious variation of ball playing  then came

nutt mr jacobs though he be editor of oklore looks not to the gay science for spiritual guidaince lie is happily conscious of the literary qiuaslity of the material he handles and remembers that rimitive man had as keen a sense of art as his mental developmnent and the hitter struggle for life would lermit and sol he has selected and edited his celtic airy taes not to illuminate the genesis of the human brain but with the far more laudable object of amusing the young herein he should be successfcal at any rate he has contrived to entertain the old and perhaps the young are not vastly more ritical mr jacobs has thrown his net wide and has gathered in stories from the printed works of campbell kennedy hyde curtin and the rest nor has he shrunk from editing and adapting such work as he elected to reprint indeed his book is completely purged of pedantry his single aim being to amuse he has ingeniously blent the comic and the romantic and has positively published a book without an afterthought a conspicuous triumph in these days of moralities true in his preface he murmurs something about a union of hearts but he obtrudes no  views and one little excursion into the prevailing vice may be condoned the book has its blemishes the story of beth gellert for instance is wholly out of place mr jacobs version is a bald paraphraseworthy of a boardschool boyof the hon w r spencers poem taken from an obviously literary source the narrative chimes neither in diction nor in eftect with the genuine folktale in vain does mr jacobs inform you that the story is an apologue which is met with in every country from india to wales the question may scarce be answered authoritatively and there seems no reason why it should not be a record of actual experience the tidelity of the dog the sudden anger of the master may easily be matched outside the radius of folklore and once you grant the story the moral follows as a matter of course a child of six could hardly hear of elerts death and not take it as a warning against human iinpctulositv but even if it be a recurrence of the old type its sctting is so modern and the atsence of the supernatural and the inconsequent so marked that it were far better away however it serves to suggest to mr jacobs a learned note which we trust no child will be induced to read now and then too the diction generally studied and correct descends into the commonest slang but these are venial errors  and the book in their despite is as pleasant a collection as you could wish to imeet the stories are both quaint and picturesque of

B2585,"['8793448', '8688126']",  mmdlemarch  jfiddlemarch a study of provincial life by george eiiot in four volumev blackwood 1 many theresas have been born who found for them i selves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of farresonant action perhaps only a life of mistakes the 1 offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur illmatched with t he meanness of opportunity perhaps a tragic failure f vhich found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion 1 with dim lights and tangled circumstances they tried to i shape their thought and deed in noble agreement but after all to common eyes their struggles seemed mere inconsistency and formlessness for these laterborn t1cresas were helped by no coherent social faith and order which would perform the function of knowledge for the ardently willing soul their ardour alternated between a vague ideal and a common yearning of womanhood so that the one was disapproved as extravagance and the other k oudemned as a lapse we need to recall those sentences in the prelude  to  middlemarch  in order to reconcile ourselves to its finale in which our last glimpse of george eliots modern theresa is as a comfortable matron very properly devoted to her second husband and only known in a certain circle as a wife and a mother any other novelist would have ended the novel differently and with a good deal more stageeffect but george eliots finding is the true one and if we part from dorothea with somi regret that her first great failure as the wife of mr iasaubon should have no better compensation than the very prosaic success of a marriage with will ladislaw it is doubtless only just such a regret as the author wishes to arouse in us as part of the regret with which every wise student of life must regard the accumulation of blunders and failures that too often befall the worthiest natures while those of coarser mould contrive to obtain all the happiness they are able to enjoy the most carefully mwrought out of all george eliots novels with the exception perhaps of romola  middlemarch  is also the most uelancholy in its tone it is a picture drawn by an artist of consummate literary power and of intellectual strength that among novelists is altogether unique in which are exhibited all the springs of action and all the motives of haracter that go to make up our commonplace society and the impression left by this  study of provincial life  is one of pftinful but healthy sadness there is nothing of the misanthrope in george eliot if she laughs at t r condemns the errors and follies of the world she does so altogether in order to help on their correction and her ridicule and blame are more effective than the wisest preachers sermons but we have no more right to look for shallow merrymaking in her books than to seek amusement from  ecclesiastes or  lamentations she does not preach that  all is vanity and vexation of spirit or that  the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not pitied  but she does show that society is sadly in need of mending and that it can only be mended by a great reconstruction of the rules by which it is now hampered it is with others in their various ways as with dorothea whose later life is the mixed result of young and nobler impulse struggling under prosaic conditions among the ay oek a her mises it was never maid in t ighborood of middlemarch that such mistakes could not have happened if the society into which she was born hd not smiled on propositions of marriage from a sickly man to a girl les than half his own ageon modes of education which make a womans knowledge another name for motley ignoranceon rules of conduct which are in flat contradiction with its own fondlyasserted beliefs while this is the social air in which mortals begin to breathe there will be collisions such as those in dorotheas life where great feelings will take the aspect of error and great faith the aspect of illusion dorothea is only one out of the many dwellers in mid dlemarch whose characters are here portrayed with wonderful truth and vigour but she is the central figure that all the others cluster round we see her first in striking con trast to her simpleminded sister celia and her as simpleminded uncle mr brooke as a highsouled young woman  enamoured of intensity and greatness and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those attributes the rashness causes her to embrace mr casaubon the very perfection of a selfish clerical prig and her marriage issues in nothing but bitterness until all her  vague ideals  have to give place to  the common yearning of womanhood in noticing the instalments of the novel as they were published we bave called attention to some of the stages in this change we have seen how gradually dorothea loses faith in her husband without swerving at all in her duty towards him even as the most exacting purist might define it and how as gradually the way is prepared for her devotion after her husbands death to his cousin will ladislaw it is not easy to like young ladislaw one is tempted to think that in marrying him dorothea makes nearly as great a blunder as she did in marrying mr casaubon how much pleasanter it would have been for lydgate to be her husband but unfortunately things do not always go pleasantly in real life and the fate that befalls dorothea is very natural though not very welcome lydgates fate is harder than dorotheas this portrait of the brave man of science whose purpose in life is destroyed through his marriage with a heartless or very shallowhearted beauty is as wonderful in its way as the portrait of dorothea lydgate and rosamond are the chief persons in the later portions of  middlemarch and in tracing their history george eliot has described with unrivalled force and truth the consequences of an illassorted marriage not the consequences with which novelreaders are familiar in which the silly wife runs away from her husband or the husband is a brute to his wife but the commonplace issues in which gradually love is killed and one heart at least is broken perhaps george eliot weighs down her hero too much with misfortunes but they serve to bring out the character she wishes to show  oh it is hard says dorothea to him that all this should come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways there is no sorrow i have thought more about than thatto love what is great and try to reach it and yet to fail if selfish rosamond serves in one sense as a foil to dorothea unselfish mary garth is a no less complete foil of another sort the really pleasantest portions of  fiddle march are those that recount the sayings and doings of lmary and her father caleb garth and caleb garth is an excellent study of a man whose religion consists in unswerving honesty and persistent welldoing that makes no pretence tovirtue asexcellent in itswayisthe study of nicholas bulstrode the hard hypocrite who uses the form of religion k as a cloak to his base actions and who is at last driven into far baser actions in order that his character for rellgiuu mac 1 not be sullied bulstrode3 downfall is described with great i ability and perhaps the best part of the description is f this which tells of the bearing of his wife just after she  has heard of his wrongdoings and of the worse doings r attributed to him t she locked herself in her room she needed time to get used s to her maimed consciousness her poor lopped life before she  could walk steadily to the place aotted her a new rgicbin light had fallen on her husbands character and she could not j ge him leniently the twenty years in which she had believed irn him and venerated him by virtue of his coacealments came back with particulars that made them seem an odious deceit he had married her with that bad post life hidden behind him and she bad no faith left to protest his innocence of the worst that was imputed to him her honest ostentatious nature made the sharing of a merited dishonour as bitter as it could be to any mortal but this imperfectlytaught woman whose phrases and habits were an odd patchwork had a loyal spirit within her the man whose prosperity she had shared through nearly half a life and who had unvaryingly cherished hernow that punishment had l fallen him it was not possible to her in any sense to forsake him tihere is a forsaking which still sits at the same board and lies on thie same couch with the forsaken soul withering it the more by uloving proximity she knew when she locked her door that she should unlock it ready to go down to her unhappy husband ald espouse his sorrow and say of his guilt i will mourn and not ixcproach but she needed time to gather up her strength she iteeded to sob out her farewell to all the gladness and prride of her ife when she had resolved to go down she prepared herself by t ne little acts which might seem mere folly to a hard onlooker tiey were her way of expressing to all spectators visible or invisible that she had begun a new life in which she embraced hiumniliation she took off all her ornaments and put on a plain 1ack gown and instead of wearing her muchadorned cap and large bows of hair she brushed her hair down and put on a plain b netcap which made her look suddenly like an early methodist bulstrode who knew that his wife had been out and had come in saying that she was not well had spent the time in an agitation co aal to hers he had looked forward to her learning the truth fromn others and had acquiesced in that probability as something easier to him than any confession but now that he imagined the amelnt of her knowledge come he awaited the result in anguish liii daughters had been obliged to consent to leave him and tiiugh he had allowed some food to be brought to him he had not touched it he felt himself perishing slowly in unpitied misery perhaps he should never see his wifes face with affection in it again and if he turned to god there seemed to be no answer but the pressure of retribution it was eight oclock in the evening before the door opened and his wife entered he dared not look up at her he sat with is eyes bent down and as she went towards him she thought he looked smallerhe seemed so withered and shrunken a moveument of new compassion and old tenderness went through her like a great wave and putting one hand on his which rested on the arnn of the chair and the other on his shoulder she said solemnly 1 t kindly look up nicholas he raised his eyes with a little start and looked at her half damazed for a moment her pale face her changed mourning css the trembling about her mouth all said  i know  and her hands and eyes rested gently on him he burst out crying and tiny cried together she sitting at his side they could not yet steak to each other of the shame which she was bearing with hiim or of the acts which had brought it down on them his confession was silent and her promise of faithfulness was silent openminded as she was she nevertheless shrank from the words ostrich would have expressed their mutual consciousness as she would have shrunk from flakes of fire she could not say  how much is only slander and false suspicion   and he did not say  i ani innocent the charity of middlemarch is as notable as its wisdom in every way it is a book to be glad of and if it does not enhance george eliots fame it will only be because she has already attained the foremost rank among novelists who write novels that contain more religion than all the sermons that were ever penned and enough sound philosophy to make the reputation of half a dozen moralists and metaphysicians   i i  middlemarch saturday march 30 1s72 literature by george eliot book iii waiting for death blackwood  sons the third instalment of  middlemarch ends in doubta doubt too evidently adapted to the exigencies of a serial form old peter featherstone not less able than usual to enjoy his consciousness of wisdom in distrusting and frustrating mankind is dying fast and vulturelike the featherstones and waules close round him with testamentary purpose brothers solomon and jonah and sisters martha and jane take bodily possession of stone court where are also installed mary garth of right and mrs viney and her son fred by mr featherstones request that the featherstones should hang together against the vineys is natural still more natural is it that they should quarrel amongst themselves and that there should be a general sense running in the featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the almighty was watching him no scrutiny however can open the secret of old peters iron box true to himself the old man snaps and snarls at everybody is oracular as to his will and inflicts torture with a keen sense of power in the night alone with mary garth he dies he has it seems made two wills of which he wishes to burn one but both remain  and upon their tenor hangs fred vineys life for fred has borrowed money with all belief in his powers of repayment  having the superfluous securities of hope at his command and mary garths father has backed freds bill and fred has been unlucky in speculation upon horseflesh and  not having occupied himself with the inconvenience and possible injury that his breach might occasion other people is now in most unhappy plight seeing himself in his true light as a pitiful rascal who is robbing other people of their savings but it is not for fred and mary alone that the plot is thickening lydgatehow or why it would be as hard to say as in real life  finds himself engaged to rosamond viney and mr viney who is expecting stone court for fred has given his consent to the arrangement  with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch for  the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action and mr viney has discovered that old featherstones death is only his  demise and  considered as a demise old featherstones death assumed a merely legal aspect so that mr viney could tap his snuffbox over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity1 and besides lydgate and rosamond dorothea too claims our interest as mr casaubon is too clearly dying fastindeed has a fit which can have but one meaning and dorotheas future is still further perplexed by the fact that mr brooke who is the most goodnatured of all unwise men has asked young will ladislaw to stop with him  feeling an interest in a young man who is starting in life with a stock of ideas and more than all exactly as  old and young put the riddle of which the answer lies in  waiting for death so in  waiting for death  a riddle is put in the thirtieth chapter the answer to which is even harder to guess and ought to be the hinge of the tale for the rest  middlemarch is itself celia is to become lady chettam and is very full of happiness mr brook is more happily vague than ever his advice to casaubon after his fit being  yes yes get dorothea to play backgammon with you in the evenings and shuttlecock now i dont know a finer game than shuttlecock for the daytime i remember it all the fashion to be sure your eyes might not stand that casaubon but you must unbend you know why you might take to some light study  conchology now  i always think that must be a light study or get dorothea to read you light things smollett roderick random humphrey clinker they are a little broad but she may read anything now shes married you know i remember they made me laugh uncommonlytheres a droll bit about a postilions breeches we have no such humour now i have gone through all these things but they might be rather new to you and we have one or two new actors such as mr horrock the horsedealer  whose costume at a glance gives him a thrilling association with horses and whom nature has blessed with  a face which by dint of mongolian eyes and a nose mouth and chin seeming to follow his hatbrim in a moderate inclination upwards gave the effect of a subdued unchangeable sceptical smile of all expressions the most tyrannous over a susceptible mind and when accompanied by adequate silence likely to create the reputation of an invincible understanding an infinite fund of humourtoo dry to flow and probably in a state of immovable crustand a critical judgement which if you could ever be fortunate enough to know it would be the thing and no other and with mr horrock is mr trumbull the auctioneer who is  an amateur of superior phrases never using poor language without immediately correcting himself aud who if anybody had observed of him that mr borthrop trumbull being an auctioneer was bound to know the nature of everything would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came pretty near that still more heavily outlined is solomon featherstone who  thought himself much deeper than his brother peter indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellowmen inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there  coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others and there is also mrs plymdale who  doesnt think that marrying is everything and indeed  would have a girl first seek the kingdom of god  but who none the less has an eye to this world and its matters and so holds that  a girl should keep her heart within her own power what the end of  middlemarch may be we hardly wish to guess its chief interest is as a study of english life the action does not absorb us as in  adam bede and the mill ou the floss there are too many actors for that and too many threads woven into the one strand  but as a thoughtful anatomy of english habits and english modes of thought full of dry quiet humour waiting for death is worthy its author whether  middlemarch as a whole will suffer from the form which its periodical appearance entails remains to be seen certainly as yet each part has been perfect of itself,britain

B5780,"['3169788', '6799254']",  the washer of the ford the scottish highlander was never a complete convert to the christian faith not that he had doubts after accepting it unlike his lowland neighbour he has always been little of a theologian he is not given to forming little sects the wide fold of the catholic church has been good enough for him or if not that then in later days strong undiluted calvinism the narrative of the christian story the mysteries of the faith as distinguished from nice doctrinal subtleties and the ritual of the church have always appealed to him strongly from the first even christian morality made its way with peculiar ease among the wild people in certain directions in compensation for its total want of success in others but christianity never uprooted the older faiths had to settle down in fact side by side with them in the highland mind intermingling constantly and with such confusion that only the priest and maybe not even he could disentangle the real thing this is a truth constantly met with in all celtic saint lore in highland folklore and in the highland mind today when you reach it it is the truth which miss fiona macleod has illustrated by her  legendary moralities rhese are neither pagan nor christian they are both though more one than the other and recognised maybe as both by the early imagination in which they grew as she says  the washer of the ford might well have appeared to a single generation now as a terrible and sombre pagan goddess of death now as a symbolic figure in the new faith foreshadowing spiritual salvation and the mystery of resurrection quite apart from the beauty of the legends they are thus highlyinstructive as examples of the double working of the human mind almost any of the stories here would illustrate this but muime chriosd does it as well as any the name signifies the foster mother of christ and was given to st bridget of whom there are many legends and bits of legends in scotland and ireland possibly they will never be more faithfully toldthe faithfulness touching the grotesque as well as the poetical sidethan in miss macleods version bridget passed a mysteriously holy girlhood in iona in the druid days before the coming of st colum on a certain day she wandered far and came to where the heather was evermore withered and parched till it passed into reaches of desert sand with palmtrees then a voice reached her ear as out of a sleep that of her father livach talking in the good gaelic of the drought and the sufferings of man and beast round the village of bethlehem he tells her he must set off from their home at the inn and journey to the quenchless well on the mount of olives meanwhile she must give away no drop of water nor accomnmodate anyone in his absence but when days had passed there came to the inn a tired man and a woman soorm to be come a mother riding on an ass joseph a carpenter in arimatheaand mary his wife they too spoke the sweet gaelic of the isles and bridget saw something in the womans face that made her give them all the little water and ale left in the house and because they were weary she lodged them in the stable livach comes back and full of curiosity about his guests goes to the stable which is like  a shell filled with the fires of sunrise plushing open the door they see mary with the babe upon her knee then bridget took him in her arms covering him with her mantle so is she known as st bride of the mantle she nursed him all through the night and so too she is known as muime chriosd the fostermother of christ when she woke the holy company were gone but the power of miracle was on her she did wanderful things going out of the city she followed in the moonlight the footprints of a womnan and child all night she walked never weary yet never seeing any figures though the steps were newly made at last the stopped and she saw the lights of jerusalem but the wind stirring among the olives smelled of heather and rustled in the bracken the lights of the holy city faded she was on duni  iona lay green and gold isled in her blue waters from the sheiling of duvach her father rose a thin column of pale blue smoke but this rough version cannot give a fair idea of one of the most mysteriously beautiful and bold  the washer of the ford and other legendary moraliti by fiona macleod patrick geddes and colleagues renderings of the christian story as conceived by a people who after their dreamy fashion mingled the mount of olives with their own familiar hills and with the hills of heaven the  annirchoille  on the other hand is frankly pagan a story of reaction against the christian spirit of renunciation with passages of striking beauty it is nevertheless in form at least far less convincing i feel sure with the asstuance of ignorance that it has not the accent of its time true to the general spirit of revolt it may be against a faith that despises the bodys needs and joys but the telling is after the fashion of the pagans of this decade now just a trifle exaggerated and again finely swinburnian as in athals song fior i see this thing that the old gods are the gods that die not all else is a seeming a dream a madness a tide ever ebbing i wish i had room to speak at length of other things in the book of that wild tale of alternate madness and terror and exquisite peace in which the whole of death is portrayed  the washer of the ford of the shadow seers especially that one called  the smoothing of the hand  and of the passage in the fisher of men which speaks of the signs of change that the soul knows before the coming of death though pain have not spoken this book so far surpasses miss macleods earlier efforts that any uncertainty one might have had about the best direction of her great talents is gone entirely its superiority i feel sure lies in the fact that here she is in the region of pure poetry her former books dealt more with the drama of common life and i doubt if she realises how the people fed on such imaginative and spiritual food as makes the substance of her legends would act and speak in the stress of living there was a sweetness that cloyed in most of the earlier stories but here where it is the spirit and the dreams of the highlanders more than their outward life that are her themes she is on ground where few could come near her she knows her way about and with her certainty has come an enormous increase of artistic power a m  literature the celtic revival the washer of the ford and other legendary moralities by fiona macleod edin burgh patrick geddes  colleagues miss fiona macleod is a prominent figure in the celtic revival to some extent she may be said to have originated it to a large extent she has contributed to its success her books make us acquainted with the celt in his primitive and unsophisticated form this i believe is the fourth of them and excellent as its predecessors were it is unquestionably the best its superior merit is not due to any accident of subject or treatment it may well be the result of deeper knowledge of more real experience and of sympathies developed in a spiritual direction evidently a gael herself a celt of the celts miss macleod has felt her way through the celtic gloom and the comparative twilight which relieves it into the large atmosphere in which the celtic imagination is capable of great achievements the celtic gloom is miss macleods own phrase she uses it in the prologue addressed to mr george meredith in her third volume as expressing the prevailing note of celtic life such a note it unquestionably was in her pharaie a pathetic and beautiful story whioh to many an english reader was a revelation of things undreamed of before in highland life and character but there was a sadness in the air and on the sea a sadness which no tenderness of love could uplift from the hearts of the sorrowful actors in the story and its very beauty intensified its pathos one perceived the same prevailing note in the mountain lovers though in that book the joyous note of love that seeks and wins its own was a compensating presence here again was a lavish amount of beauty it was evident in the writing in the powerful nature sketches and in the conception of the two lovers and the triumph of their love but the fatalism of the celtic gloom lies like a shadow across ones recollection of even these brighter things the tales in miss macleods next volume the sineater were avowedly with one or two exceptions representative of the darker side of celtic feeling in power of treatment in the fierce imaginative realism of some of them and the profound depth of sadness or bitterness in others they bore fresh witness to the genius which by that time most of her critics recognised in miss macleods work but some of us still looked to her for a fuller revelation of the celt than she had yet given usa revelation of the glamour as well as the gloom in his life of the light that irradiated it as well as the shadow that enfolded it this fuller revelation we have in the present volume the distinction between this book and its predecessors is indicated in its title miss macleod called her previous writings romances and tales the contents of this book she describes as  legendary moralities therein lies the difference the free play of fancy in the tales left the domain of the moralities untouched the imagination in them was bold and brilliant but it exercised itself with possibilities in nature rather than with the spiritual side of human life there was an instinctive groping towards this spiritual side in pharais and the mountain lovers but the external condition was one of gloom and there was no clear irradiation from within here with a more subjective treatment we have spiritual perceptions and suggestions the titlepiece very aptly forms the threshold of the new departure for it links the old order and the new there is all the fierceness of the gael in it the passion of blood the gloom the fatalism but on the other side there is the mystery of the unseen world a mystery which is expressed in hope and reliance as well as in terror it is both a pagan and a christian mystery the bloodguilty and sinful souls who come up to the washer of the ford are cast into the water to remain there till they are white and then the washer plays upon them with her sword and makes white dust of them with her feet but the blind harper who comes with a song of peace is bidden to follow the bells of joy that were his tears and the song of the prayer that came out of his heart for him the washer of the ford is a mary magdalen and the ford is the river of peace the three moralities which immediately follow the titlepiecemuime chriosd the fisher of men and the last supper are the pearls of the volume ana in the present writers opinion are the finest things miss macleod has written muime chriosd the fostermother of christ is her rendering of the legend of st bride st bridget of the isles the legend is a vague and meagre suggestion of a mary of the gael who is held  in universal honour and reverence as second only to the virgin herself this the reader learns from miss macleods brief prefatory note apparently there is nothing else to be learnt save by some gift of insight into the bodiless and unvocal land of gaelic dream such a gift is peculiarly miss macleods own and this singularly beautiful story is one of the fruits of it among the christ myths which the inspired imaginations of many races have produced it is one of the loveliest miss macleods st bridget is a daughter of a druid princess and predestined to immortal honour brought in her childhood to iona her beauty and the spiritual charm about her work a magic to which the fair things in nature are ministers she has ecstatic visitations and experiences iona and her surroundings there are marvellously exchanged for the eastern bethlehem and the byre in which joseph of arimathea and mary rest for the night and it is bridget who receives the holy babe from his mother and knows him to be the prince of peace but to attempt to give in a few words an idea of this remarkable story of vision and dream of realised vision and embodied dreamis almost presumptuous as well might one make a picture of a rose and invite a lookeron to inhale its fragrance and feel the soft velvet of its leaves  the fisher of men and  the last supper  are alto christ myths scarcely less beautiful than muime chriosd and with a pathos in their beauty which is peculiar to themselves the christ in the first of them is the man of sorrows whose acquaintance with grief makes his sympathy so divinely human a weary presence in a shadowy glen there breathes from him a sweet assurance ci fellowship in travail from which any other weary and waiting soul may take comfort in the last supper the weariness of the christ is like a veil that falls away and leaves a face of joy revealed the supper in the huntsmans booth in the shadowy glen as seen by the child whose eyes iota kissed would be like enchantment if one did not feel it to be so absolutely real the master and his disciples are there and the disciples weave with their shuttles called beauty and wonder and mystery fair and wonderful shapes that go forth into the world to bless it trrlyit is a beautiful conception from this part of the book i take the only extract i can allow myself it is from  the fisher of men  god sends the gloom upon the cloud and there is rain god sends the gloom upon the hill and there is mist god sends the gloom upon the sun and there is winter it is god too sends the gloom upon the soul and there is change the swallow knows when to lift up her wing over against the shadow that creeps out of the north the wild swan knows when the smell of snow is behind the sun the salmon lone in the brown pool among the hills hears the deep sea and his tongue pants for salt and his fins quiver and he know that his time is come and that the sea calls    how then shall the soul not know when the change is nigh at last is it a less thing than a reed which sees the yellow birchgold adrift on the lake and the gown of the heather grow russet when the purple has passed into the sky and the white bogdown wave grey and tattered where the loneroid grows dark and pungent which sees and knows that the breath of the deathweaver at the pole is fast faring along the frozen norland peaks p it is more than a  reed it is more than a wild doe on the hills it is more than a swallow lifting her wing against the coming of the shadow it is more wan a swan drunken with the savour of the blue wine of the waves when the green arctic lawns are white and still it is more than these which has the son of god for brother and is clothed with light god doth not extinguish at the dark tomb what he hath litten in the dark womb i have left myself very little room for any mention of the other parts of the book though these remaining parts have their special claims to notice the three marvels of hyhy being another name for ionaare very suggestive glimpses of that early christianity of the isles the crudeness of which was tempered by the druid love of nature st columba is the central figure in these pieces and miss macleod gives us an impression of the militant sainthalf pagan and persecutor as well aa monk and priestwhioh is probably as true as any and is certainly picturesque and real but the straggle between the dying paganism of the lues and the new faith is nowhere so well shown as in  the annirchoille here we have the story of a young monk who enjoyed the favour of st colum he was an apt pupil but he had a comely person a young mans desires and the gift of song colum overheard him singing some amatory verses and doomed him to sackcloth and dust upon his head afterwards when the youth had again been heard singing of white hands and a honey mouth colum sent him to the monk molios who in the holy isle off arran had overcome hit own sinful lusts by mach mortification of the flesh under the guidance of molios young oathal developed so muck piety that the good monk thought him fit for martyrdom and proposed to send him to the isle of mist in the north where the pagans had lately flayed a monk alive but colum decided that cathal should live and should seek to win souls in arran and it was as he went to do this that he was smitten by the beauty of ardanna for her love he renounced his religion and for his sin molios caused him to be left to die in the hollow heart of a great oak and die he did but it waa to find himself a denizen of the elfland of the woods with an  annirehoilte a woodnymph for a fairy mate and all the green delights of the earth for his enjoyment the picture of these delights is one of the most charming mies macleod gives us let it not be supposed however that she has any designs against the christian faith it is not pantheism or any other paganism that she teaches but that largeness of faith and affection whioh has room for the human and the divine for the joy and beauty of life as well as for ita more solemn aspirations but this review must really end and i will trust that it has gone far enough to attract readers to a book which i am myself loth to lay down george cotterell,britain

B4825,"['6786209', '8986863']",  young lives by richard le gallienne arrowsmith fis 7ms is mr le galliennes third novel and taken with these that preceded itthe quest of the golden girl and the romance of zion chapelit shows us clearly what ara his powers and limitations in fiction it shows us that tos the qelineation of a certain type of young man a product of the best two decades mr le gallienne has considerable gifts he young man is of the nonconformist middle dasses his home ls strict arid pious his own bent however is for poetry and gladness he is frank impulsive enthusiastic generous warmhearted intolerant of alltiiat is dull and mechanical and very tolerant of whatever is  done beautifully however it may conflict with the moral code he is an agnostic with leanings towards elaborate ritual a busy but superficial reader his gods being keats and pater a dilletante in art the last word being found in the pictures of rossetti ana burnejones a sentimentalist he oan adore many young women at once and in rhyming  love  and  dova  and  bosom  and  blossom  he is expert if he knew more he would perhaps be more admirable but far less  lovable  and to be  lovable is his end in life that is the type of young man to whioh we refer a type whioh at this moment is common in london and in all the great towns all over the oountry and it is this young man whom mr le gallienne oan set down with precision and literary skill and as we said last week in noticing another new novel every work that accurately reproduces a type is a contribution oi real value to fiction mr le gallienne is not a good novelist he has neither the concentration nor the dramatio power needful he ia always the essayist astorytolling glad of an opportunity to digress but though he has little to toll in the book before us and though it moves spasmodically and ends anywhere we oan imagine a great many simple people reading it with pleasure especially in the provinces will it be enjoyed the tone is bright and sunny and the characters are pretty and gay but the readers will have to be simple we fear because with the exception of the type who rings true there is a great deal of chocolatebox unreality about the story baptist ministers for example onwhose shelves is all the most exquisite literature of doubt are not really named chrysostom trotter it is largely these wilful little perversions of fact which mr le gallienne always indulges in that keep sophisticated readers from his works but for their especial benefit we take it the author baa inserted iri thia story a chapter d clef describing a certain literary set whom his hero meets in the rooms of an enterprising publisher mr le gallienne here hits round him with spirit sparing not even himself we quote a passage presently there entered a tall young man with a long thin face curtained on eaoh side with enormous messes of black hairlike a slip of the young moon glimmering through a pine wood at the same moment there entered as if by design his very eatithesis a short firmlybuilt clerkly fellow with a head hkea billiardball in need of a shave a big brown  moustitohs aad enormous spectacles   that said the publisher referring to the mooninthepiriewood young man is our young apostle of sentiment our new maa of feeling the besthated maa we have and the other is our young apostle of blood he is all for musole aad brutalityaaa he makai all the mouser it is oae of our many fashions just now to sing  britain aad brutality but my impression is that our yoong maa of feeling wul have his daythough he will have to wait for it he would hasten it if he would cut his hair but tbat he says he will never do his hair is his battlecry aad hair too he says is a gift well he enjoys himself and loves a fight though you mightnt think it to look at him in laying young lives aside we cannot honestly say it has interested us but it is innocent and bright and young and it is written with care  young lives bv richard le gallienne bristol arrowsmith a duet with an occasional chorus by a conan doyle grant richards here is another volume of secondrate sentiment from mr richard le gallienne we cannot profess to say whether it is autobiographical or notat any rate it reads as if it were meant to be it describes the little troubles and joys of a priggish literary young man in a northern town whose home surroundings as is usual with literary young men of the kind who write about their homes were uncongenial the young manto the benefit probably of the home to judge from the way he describes himself as talking to his fatherdetermined to leave these surroundings and to set up for himself in literature he gets some poems published he falls in love and he keeps up his affection for his sister but it all reads false somehow the young man is most devoted to his sister which is very right and proper and charming no doubt but he is not content with that and must needs analyse his feelings and her feelings and explain to all the world why he was so fond of her and she of him as if their affection was something extraordinary and something to be inordinately proud of it is the same with his sweetheart angel they go about trying to find recondite reasons and explanations for simple sentiments they see a rossetti picture which they admire and they call it their church and their altar they are probably not conscious hypocrites but they are the worse kind of unconscious hypocrites who having a fine feeling think they have it move really as soon as they have put a label on it and talked about it to the world the sentimentalist is the man who is not sure enough of himself to express his feelings as they are so he clothes them in terms which he imagines add a conventional dignity this book is full of that kind of sentimentality and it is bad mr conan doyles tale on the other hand certainly does not err on the side of excessive sentimentality it is a story of two very commonplace and worthy young people who make love and get married their attitude towards life is profoundly unimaginative and they would probably have been an exceedingly dull young couple to meet but they are fine in character and in the essentials of life are clean and straightforward the book is an excellent picture of the best sort of honest middleclass respectability which is unassuming and not discontented of the two sets of characters mr doyles characters would certainly have less to talk about than henry and angel but in fiction they are distinctly more amusing and interesting for they are genuine and they are described simply and without affectation if mr le gallienne did not convey the impression that he thought his people very fine they would be more tolerable but without a suspicion of satire they are duller than the limited yet excellent crosses,britain

B2967,['4373322'],  wives and daughters some such gentle assuagement of sorrow as many have felt on looking at the face of a beloved one for the last time and noting the perfected beauty that has come upon it with the coming of death will be felt by those who have known and loved the authoress of this book in recognising the grace of its design and the completeness of its execution much as literature lose by losing mrs gaskell in the ripenes of her power regret in tempered by the reflection that her eighteen years work has been crowned by three books at least that will rank as masterpiecescousin phillis sylvias lovers and wives and daughters it is too early to estimate the exact value of these stories but it is certainly not too much to say of them at onceas the editor of the cornhill magazine says in his concluding  wives and daughters an everyday story by mrm gukell with eighteen ro by george du a two volwe london 8uut remarks on the book now before usthat they are  some of the truest and purest works of fiction in the language in many respects they stand alone in no other works of fiction since those of mliss austen has the individuality of the writer been so completely sunk in that of the characters she has portrayed such an achievement implies extraordinary creative faculty and something of the greatness of the measure in which it was possessed by mrs gaskell may be recounised by comparing any of her later works with the best of those of miss austen both novelists have dealt with everyday life its people and its incidents but with an imnmense difference of perceptive power the pictures drawn by the authoress of  sense and sensibility  are clear fresh reliable as the finest photographs those of mrs gaskell as it seems to us more resemble in largeness of treatment the finest paintings of meissonnier on this account we are inclined to think that when the time has come for determining the place of her works on the list of english masterpieces of fiction wives and daughters will be found to rank more nearly with the adam bede of george eliot than with any of the novels of miss austen it is a work above and beyond the reach of critical analysis absolutely faultless it is not but such faults as there are in it appear so insignificant when its great and manifest excellencies are taken into account as not to be worthy of serious notice what is the use of objecting to one of the most exquisitely true and beautiful characters ever drawn by a novelist that she is too good  a lover might as reasonably object to the white perfection of his ladys brow or desire the blemish of a mole or a freckle on her cheek the spotless goodness of molly gibson has nothing in common with such goodness as the authoress of  christians mistake and  a noble life delights to paint molly gibson is good because she is good not merely because mrs goskell has chosen to make her so there are characters enough with faults in wives and daughters  but the mind which created them was too wise to think of exaggerating either the goodness or the badness in them a long way within the extremes of milkandwater saintliness and brimstone sinfulness she had found a great deal of human nature and she was content to reproduce it as she found itneither better nor worse we have no puny preaching about good and evil no nurserytale moral in wives and daughters  but instead a wonderful exhibition of human character an admirable display of intuitive knowledge of human action thought and feeling story there is hardly any in the sense of plot yet there is not an incident in the whole book that is not made as interesting as an event in an ordinary sensation novel by force of strongly awakened sympathy as in ordinary life the experiences of each days existence to each character is a story rounded and complete so far as it goes how endlessly varied and deeply interesting we learn when novelists like mrs gaskell reproduce it of the characters in wives and daughters we are made to know the dailycontinued story more thoroughly than we are likely to know the story even of our own daily lives for few of us ever get so comprehensive a view of our own characters as mrs gaskell gives of those of the personages of her drama no matter how difficult the characterization may be one great charm of her work indeed is the apparent ease with which it has been accomplished the men and women whom she has set before us might be real presences only it is certain that in such a case they would lack the exquisitely perfect contour with whichseenlingly without effortshe has reproduced them in her book they cannot be described apart from the persons and events by which they are influenced to say that cynthiathe most remarkable character of allis a coquette is to convey no idea of the cynthia drawn with such masterful completeness by mrs gaskell she is the child of her mother and her character requires to be studied in conjunction with that of her mother to be thoroughly appreciated so it is throughout the story none of the characters introduced lead lives apart from their fellowcreatures and it is by the faithful representation of their conduct when brought into contact with others that their characters are portrayed few books in the english language or perhaps in any language exhibit such an extraordinary assemblage of perfectly represented individualities the story of  wives and daughters was not finished by the authoress  what promised to be the crowning work of a life says the editor of the cornbill magazine in which periodical the novel first appeared  is a memorial of death a few days longer and it would have been a triumphal column crowned with a capital of festal leaves and flowers now it is another sort of columnone of thosie sad white pillars which stand broken in a churchyard enough of the authoresss intention was known h wever to suggest what would have been the end of the story had she happily lived to finish it only one chapter was wanting to complete her design even without it her work is beautifully proportioned with it it would have been artistically perfect we turn reluctantly to the subject of the socalled illustrations of this charming book we should have been heartily glad if the publishers bad not thought it worth while to reproduce the eighteen caricatures which disfigured the pages of the cornhill and doubly disfigure those of the two volumes now before us that such examples of all that is perverse in taste can give any satisfaction to the readers of  wives and daughters we do not believe to our mind they illustrate nothing but the egotism of one of a small band of artists whose vocation appears to be to bring the admirable art of woodengraving woodcutting has latterly we believe been adopted as the more correct description into contempt,britain

a seat beside her among the branches but this his alajesty refused though smilingly and as one who had it not been for the courtiers would gladly have yielded then came the queen out and so there was an end of the frolic for though her majesty hath need of patience and practises it yet in portugal her country is no jesting wvith such things yet beeause the queen also is fond of mistress stewart and cherishes her for her beauty and simplicity though not boldly witty like our nelly of the kings house there was no anger only the queen did shake her finger at the king and bade him think of his latter end rather than to go climbing trees after scapegrace maids to which the king replied lord madam that was the very thing i was thinking of which all took very well and held to be of a mighty pretty wit it was indeed rare sport to see how little stewart could flout the king and yet keep him more on the edge of himself than castle maine davis gwyn or all the drove of themwithal giving him no satisfaction but only saucy answers and all wvith such a mockery of civility that perforce the king laughed himselfyet methought with a wryish face but afterwards my lord of richmond and the chancellor smiled at her and she at thein so that it was easy to be seen how the three were of a very good intel ligence but the king guessed nothing of it only continued to make eyes at pretty frances till they fairly bulged out of his sallow faceas saith the proverb like the 1101s on a gooseberry fool this mistress frances is used to behave like a child knowin that when she smiles none can find it in their hearts to scoldher face being the most ierfect that ester was seven so much so that the king hath caused his maker of m1eldals john iloettiers to take a medal punching of it in the profile but it is her childishness which wtins upon voui for it is illmpossille to be angry with her she moves quickly like a bird nervous uand light as if ready to dart off in any direction at auy moment though she wears short gowns and those of grey there is always a look about her as of a trolic bird with glossy plumage which ones hand desires to caress but on a sudden lo she escapes from under and is at the end of the corridor laughing and twitter ing and looking back like a thing that always perched upon twigs so at least says the duke and i believe him and so much for mistress frances this day we saw not much of his grace for instead of abiding in the navy office he merely walked a little to and fro stamping his foot and so returned back as he came for this all in the garden wvere heartily sorry for it only made little stewart the more mirthful so that she kneeled anid denianded of the duke of york his fatherly blessing meaning thereby that the story which the lord brunker had told was truenamely that lie was a jesuit still it is a pity to see great men so used in public and the king himself looking on and laughing this doth not make the country respected but the contrary for all the while the french ambassador wvas writing in his tablets and i doubt not all goes to lewis as fast as spur and sail can drive it but after all was done and the king and duke retired once more mistress frances laid aside her spritely manners to talk with the chancellor and my lord richmond very gravely there was none to overlook and mistress stewart did give a hand to each as though mnaking some promise and even the stiff old chancellor set his lips to that which he held while as for my lord richmond he kissed his finger by finger like an holy relic it was by virtue of her maid who is of the country of wales having come hither with miss price that we get us news of the court at first hand of course being my lord dukes servants iv hear much of which i do not speak but what little ann hughes doth prate i think it no shame to tell for if i do not my master will and it is a pleasure to forestall him besides hughes being of the welsh folk doth most merrily invent there is no fear in her being miss frances stewarts favourite woman yet do i believe that for honesty there is none in the court like mistress stewart except only miss jennings who is so for interest and m1iss hobart bv nature and inclination the queen is also well advised of this and tis said little frances doth carry all her sweethearting letters to her majesty to laugh overwhich for a child such as she appears to be is very well thought on juite 4thtoday came the welsh girl ann hughes to our house and my dear mistress made her welcome to such supper as there chanced to be in the house the three of us were scarcely seated before that she clapped her hands and began to entertain us with the very latest news of the courtthe hearing of which gave us much joy there have been mighty fine doings she said all because of the fair at southwark on the common betwixt the abbey and m1argarets hill for nothing would set my lady yestreen but that she must go thither with mistress wells the newcomer among the maids both of them in the garb of saucy pages these they caused us to borrowthat is betty xwho waits upon miss wells and knows all the idle pageknaves in st james found no difficulty but as for me i risked my service and refused to go because of nty modestyand having one knee in and the other out owing to a fall out of my mothers arms long ago in my country but knowing the dangers of the town better than my ladies i did covenant with one rowland glyn a pembroke man and one that is to be trusted to follow them with a wise lad or two of my people anid as things turned out it was just as well for my madcaps being let out on the causeway could at the first do nothing but laugh so that their cloaks wellnigh fell off it was only the clearer dusk of even and no time for such pranks when the theatres are letting so many rambling gallants abroad and the very pavements are far from securesave that is in the puritanic city even so there was a great todo the rude street lads cryers of pampphlets horseholders linkboys and the like made mock onie there was who blasphemed the name of the lord if ever he had seen a sight like that nay he did pretend to faint being a shy knave and summoned his comrades to hold him up sinking into their arms as one overcome by vast terror and amazement but rowland glyn and his mate called for  prentices and the lads of the apron swarmed out of the booths so that my ladiei were briefly rid of these rascals and after this they walked quite close behind mistresses stewart and wells behaving like serving men but still holding their cudgels ready so that few dared meddle with them understanding well that it would be at their peril but when they arrived at the fair there were so many booths to examine and so many fine gentlemen elbowing hither and thither that rowland could by no means keep so close so it chanced that some of these jostling the ladies without intent as i believe miss wells pulled out her little rapier that was no more than a toy anid ait the sight of the naked steel mistress stewart began to weep so there was a great trooping to the spot and as illluck would have it my lord of rochester who is always to be found where mischief is would have them both into his carriage but by great good fortune rowland perceived the duke of richmond who is greatly in love with mistress frances only hides it for fear of the kings anger and he bade him come quickly for that there was a young brother of mistress stewarts just arrived from scotland and in sore need of assistance so richmond with george hamilton and the frenchman grammunt called the chevalier did set rochester at defiance and carried wells and stewart to their coaches and so back to whitehall without any scandal save that which rochester made with his tongue but my lord of bucking ham being willing to stand well with the queens ladies did take rochester aside in the park and say to him that if he did not hold his tongue he would kill him as he had shrewsbury and pray which of the two ladies would hold your graces horse this time  said rochestermeaniing that my lady shrewsbury had done the like while buckingham wvias killing her husband no matter wv hich said buckingham  so be you are lead and whether rochester was afraid or whether as sonie said lie owed his grace money wvhich lie could not pay i know not at all events rochester hath been very civil to the ladies illy mistress anl aliss wellsthe which was very far indeed from his habit however either because of his fear of the king or of buckingham lie had nought to say this was ann hughes tale and my dear mistress was much troubled at the doings of those in high places so after the welshwoman was gone and i returned from the convoy she did question me tightly of all those whom i knew and as to my masters conduct concerning which i made the best answers i could assuring her what is quite true that there is none at court to compare to her for beauty that ever i have seen and that mr pepys do always so uphold it and she was much comfortedthat is at first and i did sit and keep her company almost till her husband did return as lie said fromn working late at deptford and but for its ending this had been a good day and memorable to me in that my dear lady showed me much kindness far above her wont yet can i not cure her of the fits of fury she hath about her husband if he be halfanhour late in returning even if the poor man is but at his booksellers she will not believe but vents her displeasure at large which is but little profit and makes for the unhappiness of the house as for example this very night it happened to myself for mistress pepys was very severe with me because that i went as far as whitehall with the welsh girl ann hughes she was sitting crying when i came back and at first would not speak to me saying that nobody loved her or cared whether she were dead or alivethat it was like master like man for the one courted the mistresses and the other the maids and as for her that she would go to a nunnery to end her days nor would she listen to a word when i told her how that ann hughes was bespoken to the aforesaid rowland who was indeed her bachelor and kinsman she stood before me like a pretty fury stamping her foot and swearing she had done wrong ever to take notice of a clown fit only for the society of waitingmaids she bade me go find doll in the kitchen and in a storm of anger entering her chamber she shut and bolted the door tis eleven of the clock and my master is just come home perturbed enough when i told him what had befallen but presently up he goes to make his excuses as best he may yet do i thank the stars which had made me this night but plain william hewer a bachelor clerk anid not mr samuel pepys of the navy office         after a long interval i take my pen to write in my book which is lean by comparison with the stout quartos amr saml pepys ktaves at the office but yet contains much matter of which mr pepys is unaware now my dear mistress hath been grievously upset these last days because of deb willet concerning whom she need not have troubled herself dear soul for deb cares no more for my master than she doth for the king though indeed she suffers him about her as and the more is the pity all maids must who enter into condition in the house of a man like my master but deb is a right good maid as i do know come of respectable folk and with an aunt who comes here to take her news and lace necktrappings every monday yes i own itshe and i are very friendly when we meet on the steps near pauls churchyard by the bench under the yewtree where she do tell me her troubles and of our masters everlasting running afterherwhich is a shame in the house he having so many out of doors but tis little i can do for deb willet my duty lying to my mistress who as is her nature cannot abide her for indeed they are much too alike to agree of two pretty women in a house one must have the mastery and it is my lady mistress who will not bear with deb the maid is 1 think well enough content to have a lad of her own age about the house and doth confide much in me yea kissing me very kindly from the very first day as she had oppor tunity or i could make one but suchlike favours not being as yet so scarce with me i do not set them all down in shorthand lest i should never come by another as my master doth thinking poor fool  that nobody is the wiser for if my mistress be jealous of master saxiiuel and leads him an vail life by night in the daytime she is more than ever upon poor debs tofknot on iny account not that she hath any reason or even excusedeb and i understanding each other as well as ever did maid and clerk constantly in and out of one masters house yet must poor delb go and i wot as much upon my account as on that of mlaster samuel who doth think himself the sole cause and lets my mistress trample over him but this is no way with such a woman as my mistressperhaps not with any woman for ine i go immediately to the attic and begin to pack my chest to leave the house then in ten minutes at the most up comes my mistress to my chamberdoor crying and begging me to abide for my kind masters sakewhich i always do ah little he guesses what he owes me in the way of peaceful homecomings and cheerful readings of nepotisme which puts him and us all to sleep but there is no right gratitude in man mr pepys cherishes me chiefly because my summations are correct and that i do set his tangier accounts in proper order for binding yet he owes me much more than that and most likely will never knoow it yet i care not let others be mercenary an theyl will i labour for the virtue which is its own reward for last lords day i did hear mr giffords sermon on the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees which made nme think mighty well of myself especially since mr pepys cast it up to me seeing me wvith willet that i did cower like a thief and wear my cloak like a ruffian to escape his observation yet will he come at my umistresss request to my lodging and there eat a custard with deb willet to his hearts content looking from one woman to the other like a pasha which makes me laugh within meyea and outwardly too heaven forgive me when i did catch debs eye or my ladys for our samuel is ever jealous of the wrong fly in his apothecarys ointmentas formerly of posturing jack pembleton the dancing master and lately my mistress and i have sent a piping bombastical fellow named sheres across his bows as they say in the office to draw his fire he is so everlastingly dawdling after his knepps and worse that if any trim lad talks five minutes with my mistress or deb he will sulk for days for as the saying is as you do yourself so you dread your neighbour  but since i ceased to go to her fathers in longacre with my mistress mr pepys pays no heed to my comings and goings especially since i have entered upon the wvellfurnished lodgings of mine own which ve all find to be mighty convenient times and seasons being observed so little doth samuel know of the ways of women that he did actually send me with a letter which he had written to deb willet after she was gone calling her evil names at his wifes desire and to satisfy her so i did show the letter first to deb to break her of any folly that might be in her mind about a man who would not stand to his deeds but let the brunt fall on a girl then having served i brought the original back to samuel for his comfort onl first swearing my mistress to secrecy and the bridling of her tongue i let her know what mr pepys had sent me to do with the letter so though he hath great honour at the navy office and is the great man with my lord duke master samnuel is under sad eclipse where most he desires to shinethat is with his womenfolkthe reason being that lie is over subtle while a plain man though a clerk call take the wall off him by mere simplicity of dealing it gives inv mistress who hath a pretty teasing wit and is ever ready for revelige mighty pleasure to say to her husband when he comes home m2r pepys what a wonderful thing is providence today while out in the coach who should get in beside me you know how light of foot these travelled men are but master sheres or perhaps if it hath rained today being in the row buying green watered moire who should i light upon but mr sheres who most kindly walked home with me  all which is only a little tat  for samuels tit and pleases mi miistress mightily yet all this trouble i take for no advantage to myself but only that i may be a good chief clerk to my master and eke my mistresss most faithful bachelor because i do desire that my master reform his ways and cease to dance doll tearsheet corantos athwart london which indeed is most unseemly for the secretary of his majesty s navy surely the warning of mny mistress is not to be set down against ine as though i were a common informer as for our sins my master is old enough to know better and i young enough to repent when my time comesthough even now i wear my fools cap with a difference as to nmy dear mistress there is none like her for beauty she is worth all whitehall for wit the city cannot show her like had i such a wife wild horses would not draw me from home of nights but theresamuels gravelstones will not kill him much this side of a hundred and my dear ladys repute is as dear to me as my own credit for an honest man so i will abide by her yes for her sake and for a little of his own being as he is a foolish loveable inan i will abide by samuel ior niy dear mistress is hot of soul full of fine quick angers as often causeless as not and i love her for them as one may a child petulant and freshlipped if any try to hold her as like as not she will peck and bite like a wild bird caught in the hands none knows her so well as i being long of the house and as it were of her faction often have i desired to write fully of her thoughts and sufferingsaye and may do so some day because she had the daintiness of an english rose with the lightness and sparkle of her french epernay wineat once light heady and headstrong but it may be that between her husband and i we will keep her memory green for truth it is and i own it samuel also doth love her well perhaps in spite of his corantos better than any this credit i do him and with the more grace that i know well it is to me and not to him that she owes her chosen happiness for she calls me her sparrowhawk and when she beats up into an anger i fly into one ten times as fierce and sudden wxhen she vapours i overvapour her till she weeps when she scolds i storm when she is petulant i grow violent thus she loves me as save for her continued jealousies she doth never samuel yet for all that i cannot break her of these tempers it is pierce this and knepp  that if he comes in a quarterofan hour latewomen that are not worth the filip of her own rosy forefinger and indeed the poor man hath not the spirit to bid her go hang and mind her own businessas i should and do who am not her husband when she vexes me about deb willet but samuel sits like a calf behind a dripping hedge that waits for the storm to blow over poor man i have it in my heart to be sorry for him at times so simple he is and thinks himself so clever yet suffers my lady to ride roughshod over him which however is useful to me as pointing the difference between us making her prefer him who says go and be hanged i  and so slamns the doorto snailbacked samuel who crawls at her feet weeping as often as she hath caught him at his tricks so it was in this business of her tirewoman and companion deb it has been a grievous discomfortable time and the house barely fit to eat meat in for what with crying of rack and ruin treachery and vengeance from mistress elizabeth pepys and samuel on the crawl among the tablelegs beseeching his wife to tread upon him bah i it makes me sick to my soul and i do pet and confort deb every day and have found her a good convenient lodging and byandby she shall have a better place i took her box on1 my shoulder before the very face of my mistress who dared not vent her fury on both samuel and me at once but i do fear she banks it up all the more fiercely against poor debto whom however henceforward it will matter but little at saying of the final goodbye i did even take debs hand and set my lips to it this i did with intent because my lady looks best in a pretty french fury all white with scarlet spot on1 each cheekbone and her eyes sparking like mr hobbes lightnling machine ah it was a rare sight indeed and for a mall that could stand up to it something to be lived for but samuel who grovelled knew nothing about such pleasures how indeed should he for ever knighterranting hither and thither like a roaming grimalkin alas that i should write such words about my dear master or would i save in my secret notanda and to be upsides with him who doubtless doth grievously comb my hair in his many quartos but with deb round the corner and my mistress on tiptoe uncertain whether to embrace or poignard me surely i can afford to be generous yes a good fellow is sam of the navy office but in the matter of women he loveth not wisely but too many so is rightly beloved of none not knowing the art concerning which i william hewer his clerk could draw him certain sealed orders which poor wretch 1 he would not have the sense to act upon for true it is that once a gadabout always a gadabout and samuel follows one woman only until another croses the trail love with our samuel is no more and no less than a childrens game of crosstag led through london streets by players who have never seen each other before yet doth he serve his friends wellthat is so long as they be men and for the others i would rather not be a woman friend of samuels because of the reasons foreanent stated june 4th 1703i have just returned to my house in clapham from the vault near the communion table in the church of the crutched friars in which place i did make my eternal farewells to my oldest friend mr samuel pepys once my dear master the husband of my yet dearer mistress and of late my comrade and partneras he was good enough to style himselffor long dwelling under my roof and so deigning to accept the kindly gratitude of his ancient pupil and chief clerk when i glance at the leaves i wrote fourandthirty years ago i declare i do not know myself for the same man then i was an illconditioned selfconceited coxcombworthy neither of the consolatiomis of my dear mistress nor the lighter favours of mistress willet who in due time married her cousin archibald and died respected by all the landlady of the jolly postboy inn on the bristol road strange it is to think that deb kept her light head and easy ways so long above the daisies when within a year of my writing down all these fancies elizabeth pepys the like of whom the sun hath never since shone on was carried out to st olaves church in our parish of the crutched friars ave a broken man was her husband my master and as for me who was but her servant i never rightly cared to look on woman since and even unto this last year of grace two old men were used to steal in the grey light of the tenth of a london november to st olaves church and stand there a long while bareheaded he at the head and i at the feet now they two lie together wife and husband mayhap more contentedly than they ever did in their hot youth and i being left alone will go my pilgrimage from claphain twice a year instead of once on the day of his death and on hers yet do i think my master ever kept a little sting of jealousy against his servant perhaps as suspecting me of having revealed his doublings about deb and othersperhaps oil account of my dear mistress herself 1 know not for in his will he left me nought but fifty pounds and a mourning ring as he did to the very servants of my house but the truth is a man will forgive all differencesonerniig god man fortune doctrine angers politic and slights personalsave only the offence that cometlh like that first one of eden by a woman betwixt mans and man this is the sin unpardonable yet god knows it is with the kindest of thoughts in my heart that i turn my mourning ring upon my finger and set me as an ancient faithful clerk to carry out my masters wishes for in all save the eden apple the discord which came by a woman he loved me none better s b crockett,britain

copied the motto with the title of this new production of the most fertile imagination ofthe day because it will spare a world of criticism as a tale the fortunes of nigel is a mere abortion and the

whatever the defects of the story or the nothingness of the hero we are still entertained wiih flashes of humour and of characteristic and vivid de ncription which make great if not ample atonement upon these indeed the author rests his pretensions as may be seen by the following quotation from the introduction  believe me i have not been fool enough to neglect ordinary precautions i have repeatedly laid down my future work to scale divided it into volumes aod chapters and endeavoured to construct a story which 1 meant should evolve itself gradually and strikingly maintain suspense and stimulate curiosity and which finally should terminate in a striking catastrophe but i think there is a demon who seat himself on the feathers of my pen when i begin to write and leads it astray from my purpose characters expand under my hand  incidents are multiplied the story lingers while the materials increase ray regular story turns cut a gothic anomaly and the work is complete long before i have attained the point i proposed aain  when 1 light on such a character as bailey jarvie or dolgelly my imagination brightens and my conception becomes clearer at every step which 1 make in his company although it leads me into many a weary mile away from the regular road and forces me to leap hedge and ditch to gt into the rome again if i resist the temptation my thoughts become prosy flat and dull i write painfully to myself and under a consciousness of flagging which makes me flag still more the sunshine with which fancy had invested the incidents departs from them aud leaves every thing dull and gloomy i am no more the same author than a dog in a wheel condemned to go round and round for hours is me the same dog merrily chasing his own tail and gambolling in all the fr ul tc of unconstrained freedom all this is very pleasant and no doubt the truth if not the whole truth whether the most rapid way is mot in some small decree the most pleasant because it is the moat profitable is still a point to be decided and bigamous as the apology is we apprehend that the appearance of a novel every six months instead of every three might tend to improve construction without obscurimc imagination but enough it is the privilege of genius to be bountiful tipou its own terms so now to the performance nigel ts tt young scottish nobleman whose father had advanced money to james i to assist him in his political emergencies before his accession to the throne of england and the sole business of the story is to relate nis fortunes tn a journey to london to induce honest king james to

portrait ture may be almost accidental but it is an accident from which our northern brethren are so genet all preserved we have hitherto concluded that its avoid ance might be safely left to instinct the story opens iu the very best manner of the author by a vivid description of fleetstreet shopkeeping in the reign of james i and a brace of londonprentices conspicuous personages in those dayare etched with fine effect indeed the humours and the vices of the city form the chief of the novel representation in these volumes and the tom and jerry um of the time which is to be amply gleaned from ben jonson and the various other low comedy aod publications of the era supplies nearly the vi hole of iu relief one or two of the court scenes are good especially as exhibitions of james himself and we have a glance at prince diaries which shows the master many of them are however feeble and one descriptive of a forced marriage in the royal presence approaches to the absurd the author on the other hand luxuriates in alsatia or white friars a fleet liberty which being privileged from arrest was famous for harbouring all the bullies and sharpers of the metropolis considering the happy effect of the united labours of messrs cruikshank and egan this part of the book we apprehend will take the grave citizen is possibly not quite so well made out in jingling geordie or in other words george heriot the kings goldsmith but then he is a scot ami has things to do which take him out of the paths of citizenship and deprive him of civic verisimilitude there is a portion of romance attached to the fortunes of nigel which is so decidedly poor and unmeaning we can only account for it by what the author has alleged in our foregoing quotationthat his volumes often get filled up to the exclusion of all deveelopement we have another white lady in this story but mme a corpse than a spiritan absolute inanitpate she has in fact no characteristic but patent auctthe manner in which it is accounted for while physically accurate is certainly imaginatively disgusting contrary however to all anticipation abe does not prove to be the heroine and the lady who is so is after all only a diluted copy of mysie the millers daughter and moreover almost nothing at all the catastrophe is also hurried and extremely unnatural and uninteresting upon the whole we anticipate that the public

when we look at its gor geous furniture and embellishments and also the interesting occasions on which the curtain is drawn up to exhibit acts of grand court ceremonies and banquets we see there is enough to impart sufficient variety to the selection though made from a single royal residence mr nash has executed the de signs with great skill and effect his interiors are exceedingly rich and where perspective is required he has achieved a far more than common success several of the external scenes with moonlight or in the brightness of day possess the beauty of line landscapes and others

was separated from h1is attendants was in imminent antger of death herne saved him by receiving the hurt himself and slew the beast osmonde crook the chief keeper tenderly proposed as hie drew his huntingknife to put the suifferingr youth  out of his misery  but the gratful king offered a large reward for his cure  on which there siddenliv sprang forward a tall dark manl on a wildlooking steed illilip urswick by name and engagred to perform what all lse despaired f lie cut off the head of the dead hart close to the point where thie neck joined the skull and then laid it open from the extremity of the tinder lip to the nuike and ordered it to be bound on thle head of the wvounded man the keepers wvere afraid lest lhe should recover anl the misterious surgeon offered them revenge on ocondition thnt they swore to grant if they could his first request tlle compact was made herne recovered was enriched and honoured by the king and appointedl chiefkeeper but alas  he had lost all his

of a tree at some distance from the bird aimed at the kings brow grew dark the next ly llerne practised as he thought in secret but his enemies watched and saw that not a shaft would go truehie had

deprivel poor ilerne of his office the unhappy keeper when he quitted the royal presence rode oft into tle forestdepthls where he remained till nightfall and then returned with ghaistlv lookswith the

of compassion he presently disappeared agrain amidst the trees iil the 11ome park and in an hour afterwards a pedlar crossing from ldatchett founnl the forlorn and brainistruck keeper suspended tfom a

commenced which lasted until ain hour before daybreak night after night they assembled for the salie purpose at the scathed oak until the kingr hearing of their widl outrages and depredations determined to go forth at nidliuight with a numerous guard into the forest the royal party encountered lherne at the oak and the demonhunter in reply to the kings demand denounced thle kings keepers as the wretches by whose malice an infernal spell had been laid upon him  hang them upon this tree he exclaimed  and i will trouble the woods no more while thou reignest the keepers then prostrated themselves before the king confessing their guilt they were hanged upon the scathed tree and the appeased spirit of herne was seen no more during rtichards reignll thus endeth mr ainsworths inimitable legend of the hunter how he appeared in after reigns especially how he appeared in the eighth harrys time as registered herein is a continuation of the tale of wonders worthy the beginning there is however another version touiching his being tempted by the fiend through a fair nun whona he carries off and slays in a jealous fit destroying himself afterwards in remorse and this lovetale is here taken advantage of herne being devoutly smitten with the pure and simple charins of a forest maiden mabel lyndwood whose father is a keeper leagued with the demon she has a second lover in fenwolf another ot ihernes crew a character powerfully marked  a third in thenry himself whose adventures and disguises in her behalf are lightly and bioyantly described and a fourth even in the fond and passionate wyatt whose heart mabel almost weanis at length from the hopeless unrequited love of anne boleyn but only to leave it by an untimely and piteous death more despondin and desolate than ever another source of tender and rentle interest is in the wooing and wailing the bright love and the gloomy lot of the fair geraldine lady elizabeth fitzgerald the sweet inspirer of the poetical ireams

have so brilliantly and terrifically described as the hunter is now surrounded by the treachierous flames from which hie nevertheless escatpes so do the mortal persons of the story seem shut in and surroundcd by the supernatural agency wvhich affects them all more or less and vhileh seems to be rightly ascribed to a time and a country when such outraoges atrainst law and justice morals and

B4355,"['8876793', '6792195']",  the sacred fount new novels by henry james methuen  co mk james narrates this story in the first person so that the experiences and reflections of the narrator appear as if they were mr jamess own in order to keep up the dramatic illusion we shall preserve mr jamess own name in describing the narrator though it must not be imagined that we regard his use of the first person singular as anything but a dramatic fiction  mr james then one summer day found himself at a london terminus on the way to a country house party which we are to believe was one of the smartest for example not only do the husbands pair off as a matter of course with other peoples wives but they do not even take the same trains as their lawful partners moreover the food and the pictures and other luxuries of a decadent civilization are all to be found of the very best at this smartly unconventional establishment poor  mr james the dramatic character evidently not being wholly at home in such a smart set is naturally somewhat impressed and rather shy at the prospect before him but he very sensibly determines to make the most of a unique occasion by going about with a mental not ebook and an inquiring disposition  and he does not lose an instant j in beginning for at the station he sees a mr long whom he had once or twice before met at the same house but who had always hitherto consistently cut him at other places this gentleman he had consequently put down as a fool but on this occasion long recognises him with some warmth and the change is so remarkable and surprising to  mr james that he immediately assumes that long has become quite intelligent and devotes his inquiring mind through the rest of the book to trying to find out how such a change has come about he has not arrived at the end of his train journey before he has elaborated a theory in collaboration with a mrs brissenden who of course is travelling down without her husband and who in the wellknown way of smart poople habitually calls this husband  poor briss the theory shadowy as it is seems to be the chief point of these pages so we shall leave anybody who is sufficiently interested to find it out for himself to find confirmation for it 44mr james has a merry time of it with all the other characters of the book he goes about button  holing all the men generally opening with my dear man to show his intimate knowledge of polite society and even the ladies of the party have an occasional my dear woman tossed to them he does not impart to any of them his theoryhe is far too subtle for thatbut he tries to lead them by the most terribly long  winded conversations into admissions of a position of which they are supremely unconscious to do them justice most of his interlocutors are supremely bored by liim and have very little scruple in telling him so  you cant be a providence and not be a bore says one of the good women plainly enough to him but if his interlocutors are bored what must his readers be  for not content with writing out all these subtly incoherent conversations at length he sometimes interrupts them for four or five pages on end to explain the portentous signification which his imagination sees in a droop of the lips or a movement of the hand the book ends up with a conversation of about one hundred pages with mrs brissenden it takes place in the drawingroom after twelve when most of the ladies have gone to bed and the servants have been squared another subtle and characteristic touch of smart society to leave the lights on as a result of this terribly improper conference in the full blaze of the electric light it appears that not only is mr jamess  theory incorrect anyhow but that it is absolutely gratuitous as the fact which it should have explained is not a fact for long turns out to be as great an ass as ever the whole book is an example of hypochondriacal subtlety run mad the characters in the book are simple stupid english people direct and comparatively uninteresting and  mr james becomes simply a bore besides being vulgar in his absurd attempt to read into them subtle conditions of soul of which they are totally incapable  fiction the sacred fount by henry james heinemann 6s had anyone but mr james written this book his admirers might well have cried  oh tis sacrilege but since mr james himself is the author what can we say but that he has in his own brilliantly tedious way with his own inimitable art and with his own occult knowledge of what the lifting of an eyebrow or the movement of a back may meansucceeded triumphantly in an elaborate satire on himselfthat is on his own obsession  everybody knows what mr jamess obsession is and after achieving the last page of this volume it is evident to us that mr james also knows with him as with the character without a name who tells the story the vision of life is an obsession to him for real excitement  there are no such adventures as the intellectual ones  in every word or action of his fellowcreatures he perceives motives that like the lines on a railway siding have no beginning and no end mr james has never carried his analysis of the daintily unimportant further than in the sacred fount and never before to our knowledge has he after incredible labour with bricks of gossamer and mortar of sunbeams blown down the dainty edifice with such a goodhumoured series of puffs the last page brings a vision of mr henry james stepping forward and saying with a profound obeisance   you perceive how prodigiously i know myself the sacred fount we may say without more ado is youth the theme of the book is the hypothesis that youth has the power to rejuvenate and vivify age but at the cost of the oozing away of the sap of youth from itself but mr james is not a believer in his own theory or only to a certain extent he turns tail he allows his speculations to be derided and the end is more smoke than fire or perhaps it would be fairer to say that he uses his hypothesis merely as a means of showing to what prodigious lengths the analytical mind can go it is as if the princess in the fairy tale from the suggestion of the presence of the pea beneath her mattress had created a market garden of flowering shrubs the pea represents the cell from which mr james as master nurseryman has produced his garden of exotics a day and an evening cover the period of the story which passes at newmarch a country house of liberal ease and delightful appurtenances there a few choice guests are gathered among them is the narrator with his passion for embroidering on things and his genius for seeing a hundred complex reasons behind a cursory remark or a chance movement the way you get hold of things says mrs brissenden sometimes she is called mrs briss  is positively uncanny it is here is an example of just how much the nameless narrator we must restrain ourselves from the temptation of identifying him with mr james sees in a glance something further had befallen me poor briss had met my eyes just previous to my flight and it was then i satisfied myself of what had happened to hi in at the house he had met his wife she had in 8 me way dealt with him he had beeu with her however briefly alone and the intimacy of their union had been afresh impressed upon him we have not space to quote the many things this rontgenrayeyed guest saw in mrs brissendens back but we can assure the reader that a page of the book does not cover them his awakening is due to mrs brissenden she patiently refuses to play the part of a pretty fly refuses to walk into the parlour to put a pretty copingstone to his palace of gossamer instead she fires her bright artillery at him and the concussion shakes down the palace of gossamer he has been elaborating his theories at infinite length and her comments are   how can i tell please what you consider youre talking about    you see too much    you talk too much    you overestimate the penetration of others     youre carried awayyoure abused by a fine fancy so that with your art of putting things one doesnt know where one isnor if youll allow me to say so do i quite think you always do of course i dont deny youre awfully clever but you build upyou build up houses of cards are we extravagant in suggesting that this is mr henry james in a grimly humorous mood turning his analytical mind on himself the skill of the story is enormous  the triumph of its artistic presentment is indisputable only mr james could have written it so much we grant willingly but since an authors power of being able to interest his reader in his story as story must depend on the temperament and predilection of the reader we will give our personal verdict by slightly modifying one of mr jamess own locutions the narrator in the pause that follows some remarks he has made to mrs brissenden thus soliloquises oh how intensely she didnt like such a tone if she hadnt looked so handsome i would say she made a wry face over it we would saythe transposition is slight oh how intensely we didnt like having to read our way to the very end of the sacred fount if mr james hadnt so handsomely put into it all his delicate talent and thus illumined the tediousness of the story we should not only have made a wry face but yawned ourselves away to the company ofwell of john silver or captain kettle,britain

seems to be the staple of the class these dd women vary only in dress and degree they are all copies of the outline of meg and differ only in texture and colours cooper the american fabricator of

same stamp the only likeness consists in the character common io all of an old woman who like many old women knows every bodys business as well as or better than the parties know it themselves  ami who unlike any old woman as old women now are goes about working wonders mr horace smiths old woman is not a gipsy like the great original mistress margaret merriles nor is she a washerwoman like coopers old woman but she is an old woman in blacknot a black bonnet but a black gown  and she appears at all times and in all places where she is least expected or desired crying out u anathema maranatha  to the unspeakable consternation of the hearers lor why we know not these words arc words of great force and give a terrible and sublime character to thc speaker at least so the author obviously imagines we shall not attempt to describe the plot of this novel because nothing is more wearisome both to the writer and the reader than the description of the plot of a dull tale which this is if ever there was a lnll tale in this world suffice it to say that the scene of the story is laid in england france and the united provinces the time that of the commonwealth and charles h the characters of course roundheads and cavaliers the hero is the son of an old cavalier against whose house the old woman in black has conceived a mortal enmity she haunts the old cavalier says  anathema  maranatha to him discovers his plots against the government of cromwell and denounces him until the end of the third volume of course we do not find out the cause of all this pother when however we arrive at that part of the book where secrets can no longer be kept the old woman becomes communicative and explains her actions her motives and other important mysteries toa stranger in consideration of his performing a certain small service for her which she could not perform for herself and what was that service  that we must state  for nothing so absurd was ever before conceived we think in the brain of a romancer the old woman tells a certain youth whom she meets with in her walks that she has collected with great pain and toil an immense pile of faggots for the express purpose of burning down the old cavaliers uninhabited house merely for the fun or the spite of the thing now she says if you will promise to set fire to thc sticks a thing which she could not do why we dont clearly see i will tell you a great secret in return for so important a service the youth readily perceiving that the old woman who had collected the faggots had not the power of putting a lighted match among them does as he is requested and sets fire to the pile  but there being some gunpowder in the vaults when enjoying the blaze they are both suddenly canted up into the air and blown into a thousand pieces so that though old woman was only just able when she fell down again to say how she carno by her misfortune and to tell the whole history over again which she had told in vain to the young man that was blown to sticks and then she died we have read many cartloads of novels in our time but such stuff as this we never met with before indeed it is difficult to conceive how any mau of ordinary capacity could sit down and deliberately commit to paper and print the pitiable trash before us it is scarcely possible to open these volumes at random without observing some example of extraordinary nonsense which is rendered the more offensive as it is put forth by the author with an air of infinite selfsatisfaction he thrusts a silly conceit on us as if he were presenting us with a gem of the finest water we take thc first sample of nonsense that occurs to us  when the sounds of trumpets and kettledrums gave notice that the procession was about to commence every street window cornice projection and housetop through which it was to pass became thickly studded with heads whose eager eyes gmttkium in thu sun looked like the countless dewdrops that hang upon the forest leaves as they sparkle in the first rays of morningvol ii p 21 it is a pretty bold flight to march a procession through windows cornices projections and housetops but that little blunder wre must set down to the account of our authors want of skill in grammar the other stroke is however a studied conceit and of matchless absurdity what mortal but mr horace smith would ever have thought of describing the eyes in peoples heads as glittering in the sun a child must perceive that this is sheer crazy nonsense and really the follies which this author commits to paper are of so very gross a kind as to astonish those who are unfortunately too well prepared for thc occurrence of foolishness in works of this order in one place he tells us that cromwell practised his troops in hardy exercises by encouraging them to throw pillows or cushions wc forget which at each others heads this is naked nonsense sometimes he disguises it in an abundance of words wc will give an example of this kind a young lady not mad is made to express herself thus on the subject of reciprocal love  reciprocal love must indeed sublimate the soul almost to an antepast of thc celestial beatitudes when the heart can find it sweet to make sacrifices and encounter perils for the object of its secret attachment even where it feels the passion to be unrequited nay even where it knows the affections of that object to be devoted to another the author goes on to say constantia had spoken with enthusiasm for she had been giving utterance to her own deep feelings she had pressed her hand upon ber heart for she had been converting its pulsations into language as we have so generally condemned this book wc cannot pass over any approximation to a merit that may be discovered in it and therefore we must not omit to say that there is one character in it that of bevcrning a dutch merchant which is drawn with some degree of cleverness but here we trace the besetting sin of thc author antithesis  his whole art of writing consists in setting up one thing and then counterbalancing it with another all his periods are seesaws bevcrning on this plan is made a man of the most opposite qualities isle is somewhat like one of sir jonah barringtons irish characters which are commonly thus seesawed liberal but mean cautious vet rash active but indolent fickle yet constant faithful but false c before we take leave of this book wc must entreat the author in his future productions not to make so unmerciful a use of the word egregious as he has done in these volumes egregious is incessantly occurring and is almost always improperly applied perhaps however this is intended for wit we know that drolls endeavour to raise a laugh by the eternal repetition and abuse of some one word,britain

board schools  and in their collected form they furnish material for coming to a fairly de6nite conclusion about the value of the elementary system at any rate they present many of the salient facts in a concrete shape and serve conveniently as an indication of our national gains and losses mr morley has inspected a number of typical schools in various parts of the metropolis and by dint of keeping his eyes open watching everything that he saw in a sympathetic spirit and taking copious notes he has put together a serviceable and diverting if somewhat slangy report much of what he says might have been gleaned from the bluebooks of the education department but there is a great deal more which is not to be found in the official records incidentally he mentions the cost the number and variety of the schools the curriculum the quality of the teaching the characteristics of masters mistresses and parents  and in place of mere bald statistics he lets us see the interior of the hive and draws a thousand pictures from the life which are sometimes more informing because more familiar and unreserved than the reports of her majestys inspectors in brief these thumbnail sketches of board schools and scholars as they actually are show us the great citizenfactory of the nation hard at work with all its processes complete from the collection of the raw material too often rank and

another in which the i in national system is justified of its children is u1 the system justified throughout and on the m whole  it is safe to say that a very large d majority of englishmen in spite of certain strictures in regard to religious teaching and of certain misgivings as to the overeducation of the masses are satisfied with the general outcome of the policy adopted in 1870 the deliberate intent of the nation is that its poorest children shall be systematically trained to citizenship and that by the same means aided by a simple process of continuation the clever minority shall be trained to teach the next generation or to start on a higher commercial or technical career or if that is their bent to pass out by way of the universities as for the fear of overeducating the masses we share it in common with all highly organised nations amongst whom we were the last to accept a national system it may be that the danger is real and that the overeducation of individuals by cultivating their intellect beyond their natural gifts and in excess of their economic needs is not a mere unsubstantial chimaera so far as there is any force in this objection the evil may be and generally is counteracted by the wisdom of school boards and board school teachers out of a hundred boys and girls freely and compulsorily educated by the state there is let us say one who is lifted

competent m anybody to gauge the result of universal and compulsory education it has taught the nation to read easily and as a matter of daily habit the multiplication of poor readers has led to a multiplication of cheap books and periodicals and the stimulus has been manifested not merely in the production of schoolbooks which are printed at the rate of millions every year and of fiction which would naturally be first to cater for the new demand but also which ia peculiarly gratifying in a keener popular taste for literature the board school boy and girl are fed in school with illustrated readers and out of school with penny novelettes and picturepapers  and all this could not happen without largely recruiting the readers of genuine literature so marked has been the increase in the public demand for literary works that it undoubtedly goes far to account for one of the most noteworthy incidents of our recent literary development the enormous output of cheap and good reprints here

B7085,['8304846'],  traditions of lancashire second series by j roby mral 2 vols 8vo rich indeed in legendary lore is the county of lancashire and well for her traditions is it that they have fallen into such able hands as those of mr roby to a thorough knowledge of antiquarian learning he unites a brilliant imagination and is thus enabled to throw over the pile of hoar antiquity the light which renders the ruin so beautiful and attractive with the wand of the magician he stays the rapidly departing shadows  more than this he imparts a new substance and reality to them and gives relief and prominence to things but dimly seen  he rescues  the relics of the past from the oblivion to which they were hastening and by a rare union of the antique and the modern he illustrates manners and customs now obsolete by tales that however bearing upon tradition have still a distinct and separate interest to recommend them if his imagination is tempted to overstep her limits the severity of the antiquary restrains her flight and thus the keeping is perfect the style of the work is another of its excellencieswhether of humour or of pathoswhether of love or terrorwhether in the whirlwind of passion or in ladys bower in the conflict of the elements or in the placid lakenature in her summer beauty or the howling of the winters stormmr roby has appropriate language for each and all nor is it the least of his merits that in every tale there is a fine moral tone and a moral purpose while the impress of a pious mind is visibly stamped upon the whole it is true that we are constantly reminded of sir walter scott and this has been supposed to detract from the originality of mr robys work we do not think so for it is not in parallel passages or in characters for which we could find a prototype in the author of waverley  but we find ourselves perpetually saying  this is in scotts manner meaning that if scott had chosen the subject he would thus have treated it and this we consider as very high praise having thus briefly offered our opinion of the general merits of mr robys volumes we proceed to give extacts which will justify our praise premising that in tales none of which are of any length it is difficult to discover passages which can afford a fair specimen of mr robys manner the following describes the person of that young pretender to the crown of england in the reign of henry the seventh by some historians said to be lambert simnel and by others the unfortunate earl of warwick it was at the peel or castle of fouldrey that his mimic and motley court was first held before a long narrow table near the bed and on a highbacked oaken chair sat the young pretender he was dressed in a richly embroidered gown the sleeves wide and hanging down from the wrists like lappets on his head was a low cap surmounted by long waving feathers and his manners and appearance were not devoid of grace and gentility he displayed considerable selfpossession and wore his kingly honours with great assurance he was of a fair and sanguine complexion pale rather than clear and his hair clustered in heavy ringlets on his shoulders a rapid and somewhat uncertain motion of the eye and his mouth not weil closed showed that although he might have been schooled to the exhibition and could wear the outward show of firmness and decision yet in the hour of emergency and in the day of trial his fortitude would in all likelihood forsake him then we have portraits of his followers  at his right hand eat the priest in a white cassock and scapulary a black hood thrown back upon his shoulders exhibited the form and dismsition of his head to great advantage his features were large expressive and commanding the fire of a brilliant grey eye was scarcely tempered by his overhanging brows though at times the spirit seemed to retire behind their grim shadows to survey more securely and unobservedly the aspect and appearances without  swartz the flemish general a blunt military chieftain was at his side a black bushy beard some inches in advance of his honest goodhumoured face was placed in strong contrast with the wary pale and somewhat dubious aspect of the priest  kildare the irish deputy and lovel with several of the senior officers and captains were assembled round the table  the room was lofty lighted by a small pointed window and contained the luxury of a fireplace in which lay some blazing embers  a grateful and refreshing sight in that chill and ungenial atmosphere by the artifices of margaret duchess of burgundy a mysterious personage of gigantic stature appears and directs the councils of the rebels and is by them supposed to be supernatural this fact comes to the knowledge of the abbot of furness a loyal adherent of henryby dispatches intercepted by a halfwitted fellow dick empson and an attempt is made to turn this information to account and to induce tiie rebels to quit the castle of mr robys talent for the ludicrous not unmixed with the terrible we could not mention a better specimen than the tale entitled  the dule upo dun but we must refer our readers to the volumes where they will find much that is curious and all entertaining we will not repeat our praise of the work  we hope soon to find mr roby employed with equal talent on the traditions of other counties assured that so diligent a reaper will gather an abundant harvest wherever he shall put in his sickle his defence of tradition against the charges of the historian in the introduction to this series is a learned and clever dissertation,britain
B4440,['3159245'],  the lesson of the master the first story of this volume with a slight difference in treatment might have turned out to be a tragedy mr james works us up to a keen sense of the solemn possibilities of the case and just as we are expecting edification he laughs in his sleeve and runs away that is a trick of some storytellers and a very convenient one if the performers be skilful it gets them out of difficult situations and relieves them from the necessity of being emotional so painful to a wellbred writer of fiction mr james has chosen a subject of much significance and of not uncommon occurrence in the world of artiststhe debasement of talents to make them marketable the holder of the talents st george is conscious of his degradation and is benevolently full of warnings to a robuster young brother of the craft the young brother is tenderly appreciative of the generosity of the warnings and the humility involved in the confession of the elder man touches him to the quick of his nature he along with the reader receives a rude shock when circumstances arising that make a return to earlier ideals possible to st george the broad path of smug worldly comfort is still the chosen of the master but of course mr james is right the characters he has drawn are not great creations but three of them have the everyday modem reality of photographs we know some living breathing human beings sat for them there is the master himself expansive beaming with boxhomie and worldly graces he knows where he fell from but the earth on which he alighted is good too and vastly more convenient than the heights above though his remorse causes him sometimes to speak the language of tragedy it never alters the tenor of his life and why should it  he is such a good fellow so full of the high spirits of success and the masters pretty wife of the parisian clothes and administrative ability to whom he owes his fall and his comfortable income is another living portrait a better one still is perhaps the young and beautiful angloindian so athirst for direct inspiration from poets and artists own lips who has literary lions at her feet by quoting in all sincerity their books and concerning whom it wants the astuteness of the master to see that she is bound to be by her environment and her sex a philistine at bottom we have all met her in literary circles or more frequently just outside the other stories in the volume are markedly inferior though brooksmith is pathetic enough and in the pupil we are not without interest in the honourable young cynic who grows up somehow in the midst of an amiable family of adventurers perhaps mr james once made a vow to write a ghost story he has got the vow off his mind now sir edward orme is a ghost and also a malicious bore who ruins an old ladys peace of mind for no adequate reason whatsoever let us hope mr james feels no obligation to make further attempts in this direction a graceful habitue of salons he is peculiarly from home in the neighbourhood of tombstones,britain

svperior intelligence of mackenzie the detective but up to that point their careers were made just a little too fascinating for safety one ofthe cracksmenrather a poor thingoccasionally earned a

after stale verse i could manage but it did not pay to personal paragraphs and the baser journalism i could not and i would not stoop the other is a fargreater man he brought real genius to the pursuit of the calling of his leisure his ostensible interest in life was ctickethe played for the  gentlemen and it is interesting to learn that he thought one game a very pretty way of keeping your hand in for the other as for the stories we shall not retell any of them they should be read but only by strongminded persons warranted not merely safe from a hankering after their neighbours spoons but from hankering after the risky and successful capture of these spoons  fiction the amateur cracksman by e w hornung methuen  co 6s the modern story of crime its detection or its perpetration wherein the leading factor is ingenuity of plot probably deserves more critical attention than it has hitherto received it may not be the highest development of fiction but it is a form of literary artor rather to be cautious there is no reason why it should not be a form of literary art three things are necessary so g h lews has told us to good literaturevision sincerity and esthetic beauty now no one would deny that the sherlock holmes series for example has both vision and sincerity dr conan doyle  realises intensely and his best work is obviously and thoroughly sincere that his outlook is narrow and his characters crudely conventionalised is beside the point for all art is narrow when compared to life and all art must be more or less conventional without convention one could not have form where dr doyle and his imitators fall short is in the quality of aesthetic beauty of which most of them seem to have not the slightest perception it must be said however for mr e w hornung that his book does disclose a certain feeling for beauty his search for the precise epithet is sometimes quite successful and all his stories have a gracefulness of contour not often to be observed in this species of work mr hornung is avowedly an imitator or shall we say a  flatterer  of dr doyle yet he has his originalities his hero a j raffles possesses it is true the sherlock holmes attributes but he uses them for the commission of crimes not for their punishment of course he was not really a criminalonly an amateur though an amateur who could meet and beat most professionals he had a code of honour and stuck to it otherwise he would have been impossible as a hero  we shall have our work cut out was all i said 44 and do you suppose i should be keen on it if we hadnt cried raffles my dear fellow i would rob st pauls cathedral if i could but i could no more scoop a till when the shopwalker wasnt looking than i could bag the apples out of an old womans basket even that little business laat month was a sordid affair but it was necessary and i think its strategy redeemed it to some extent now theres some credit and more sport in going where they boast theyre on their guard against

when a grim scottish detective who has shadowed him throughout brings him up all standing the amateur escapes with his life from a precarious position and probably mr hornungs intention is that at a future date he shall renew his doubtful activities the book is distinctly a good one it is perhaps inferior to its exemplar in that wealth of corroborative detail which convinces and that ingenuity of weaving which enthrals but on the other hand it has a lightness and brightness which dr doyle never attempted  notes on novels these notes on the weeks fiction are not necessarily final reviews of a selection will follow the amateur cracksman by e w hornung the dedication of this book runs thus  to a c d this form of flattery the initials stand for a conan doyle and the form of flattery is imitation mr hornungs oentral character being one taffies a sherlockholmes type of man who however not only detects crimes but also perpetrates them for the sheer fun of the thing a very readable set of stories methuen 6s  the amateur cracksman by e w hor nung methuen  co tins is a highly pleasing story of two young bloods who engage in the agreeable pastime of burglary in order to stave off the bankruptcy staring them in the face one of them as is natural is the mastermind while the other is the weak fool who allows himself to be driven though it must be admitted that he takes very kindly and skilfully to his novel business at first things go fairly smoothly but they make the mistake of getting entangled with some professional burglars and the cunning sleuthhound of the law tracks them down on a german lloyd steamer the different chapters are almost detached stories in themselves and have enough fun and adventure in them to satisfy the most exacting appetite this is certainly a much more amusing book than mr hornungs last volume of short stories,britain
B7151,"['4961880', '5835003']",  i i tyhitefriars or the days of charles the isecond a novel in 3 vols london 1844 colburn this is another romance of great pretension and small performance our readers will doubtless be tempted by puff paragraphs in newspapers scattered among the general news of the time and coming as if from the applauding pei a of editors to apply to their librarian for it but let them beware these paragraphs are but decoys written in the publishers office paid for at advertisement price and false from the beginning to the end  whitefriars  is a very stupid fiction the author wants most of the qualifications of the novelist his descriptions are vague showing an absence of definite conceptions of things in his own mind his characters arc commonplace and nothing more than embodiments of generalities without any of those individualities which distinguish the men and women of real life the plot is the best part of it but taking it for all in all we recommend the librarykeeper not to throw away his money in ordering and the reader not to vex himself in psalawing and pishing over it  whitefiiars or the days of charles the second thc obligations of novel writers and novel readers to that merry monarch  who never said a silly thing and never did a wisc one are almost illimitable like an inheritance increasing in value or a mine under process of working as posterity travels on thc more it is drawn upon the more do riches increase and multiply and in truth those eventful days seem the true era of fiction and kngland the rightful scene of its enactment

never surely did they put on so bold a frontage of enormity as when charles led the wassail in his dissolute court and titus oats made perjury as common as household words thc characters of this date arc indeed marked and emphatic not softened polished and assimilated like society in more modern days but distinct angular full of peculiarities both of thc individual and the class the sobered tone of a more settled state like the frost which hinds every tiling in its chains was then utterly broken up and thc ocean roar of brawl and anarchy rang through the land no wonder then that these are times in which fiction loves to hold its fairy reign thc author of  whitofriars deserves our attention with many faults he has yet many merits and we would infinitely rather deal with these inequalities than glide over the tedium of sleepy mediocrity among these merits are an animated style good powers of dialogue a nev crtiring plot abundance of action and great diversity of character all these arc sterling things in the way ol desert and we desire to give them their full weight but still wc must look to the opposite scale now thc object of a novelist like that of the artist is to paint portraits and these portraits must either be of individuals or of our great mother nature when an author chooses to take those whose actions history has recorded for thc subjects of his

the schoolroom who passes her life having babies until she meets the refined and cultured literary man of infinite understanding it is amusing enoughmr wells is always interesting but it is meccano fiction and really rather slovenly especially stylistically oddly enough the only firm character in the book is the vulgarian sir isaac who at any rate is a man though apparently it was mr wells object to show up the other people for the most part curiously like cinema figures flitting inconclusively about the wife does not bite in at all if she is supposed to stand for womans autonomy as against mans possession then the beast is preferable to the beauty but of course this is no new discovery somehow this book strikes a dyspeptic note it is not the wells of tono or the macchiavelli or is it that he is pulling our legs no serious critic can venture to call this more than another novel if he were to be serious about it he might flesh his critical wit both upon its general want of grace and form such phrases as the manifest spending of great lots of money on rather jar the irish never write carelessly like that  fiorton the wife of sir isaac harman by h g wells macmillan  co 6s i at the cost of a certain loss of brilliancy mr wells has gained restraint and we are well content with the exchange believing that he will thereby obtain the attention of a larger public though he may lose the more vociferous plaudits of extremists his tale runs along familiar lines a plutocrat possesses himself of a very young wife her fourth annual child proving anything but a hardy specimen the doctors suggestion of a halt in the interests of the mother is acceded to  but the lady instead of being merely overcome with gratitude for living in an age when so much consideration is accorded to her sex proceeds to speculate on the uses of the freedom she has gained the husband like many other  enlightened employers has not advanced further than recognising that there is something in the idea of providing conditions favourable to obtaining the most efficient service from a dependent consequently when his wife shows a tendency to use her favourable environment to develop an individualitya thing quite outside his requirementshe naturally feels that his generosity is being abused and seeks to imprison the recalcitrant lady she advancing to the position that she has a right to her freedom and to the knowledge that she can obtain the means to gain it by pawning one of her many trinkets seeks shelter with an advocate of womans rights only to find how easily she can outstay her welcome faced suddenly with the fact that causes are not for individuals but individuals for causes she seeks the means for leisure to think things out by the deliberate destruction of a post office window she obtains in addition to her need of the moment the partial subjugation of her husband who promises much in order to avoid a recurrence of such behaviour her lifework is thenceforward centred in preserving hostels founded primarily in the interests of her husbands workgirls from the defects of institutions readers if only slightly familiar with the authors work will gather from our brief sketch the openings that he has made for airing his views on the lives of those who possess more than they need and those who need so much more than they possess in spite of his inadequate command of expressionwe even welcome the little rows of dots which indicate it his thought gains in many passages by tine illuminating way in which it is conveyed of his characters the most important thing is that they serve the main purpose of the book which is to give us the psychological progress of the lady of the title her lover is a very nebulous person to us but the husband would suffice for any novel written only with the object of entertainment it is a difficult matter to confine ourselves to a single quotation we choose the following because it reveals the heros personality the heroines attainment in mental development and the extent of the authors grasp of what is grand and despicable in contemporary humanity 44 she began to realise something sorrowful and pitiful in his quality in his hardness his narrowness his bickering suspicions his malignant refusals of all things generous and beautiful he made her feel as sometimes the children made her feel the infinite eity of perversity and resistance to the ounties and kindliness of life  the wife of sir isaac harman fiction by h g wells macmillan and co 6s if we had once a sincere belief that mr wells was going to take a very high place among the novelists a place in its way as secure and as fine as that held by the great victoriansit was because his best work began to show a quality of human comprehension that was significant that belief is now being steadily crushed for the spoiling of mr wells as an artist proceeds apace his repeated endeavours to combine the lecturehall or the class in economics with his story leads continually to disappointment and there is a lack pf proportion about this latest book which gives no particular hope that the author will pursue the vanishing spirit of art the story of course is good sir isaac selfmade proprietor of many stores and teashops his wife superior restless concerned for the welfare of the girls be employs mr brumley concerned about the happiness of lady harman offering advice sympathy teas in the countrythese are the principal characters but there is nothing repellent about this quite harmless triangle the chief interest lies in the scheme for the hostels for the teashop girlsplaces which lady harman designed as jolly cosy homes but which her husband with sets of rules and fines a system and a matron turned into comfortless institutions the progress of this scheme its difficulties the girls themselves mrs pembrose the grim methodical matron these things make rich comedy nor must we omit lady harmans spasmodic interlude of windowsmashing in an hour of rebellion and the delightful pictures of her friends lady beachmandarin agatha alimony and susan mr brumley ever hovering is a poor figure and quite unconvincing at the last he completely alienates our sympathies by crying hysterically when lady harmanher husband having conveniently diedrefuses him she by a sudden impulse kisses the pathetic figure and we can only hope that she then leaves him as abruptly as the story leaves us for he was quite unworthy of her shorn of its discussions and digressions this novel would have been simpler and stronger as it is it stays on the level of the interesting fiction of the year  the cost of a promise hodder and staughton 6s is a powerful story which mrs baillie reynolds tells extremely well its weirdness and tragedy its humour and pathos cannot fail to entertain the reader from start to finish the author relates successively the making of the promise its keeping and its cost and the conclusion she deftly reaches is when one comes to consider it the only logical way out of a situation beset with difficulties this is the more to be welcomed as it provides quite naturally a very charming and happy ending the theme runs mainly upon precociousness and heredity especially a supposed homicidal taint as personified in a child of ten the daughter of a french father and an english mother in her presentment of this young girl mrs reynolds has overstepped the bounds of probability making all allowance for her parentage her near male forbears were revolutionariesand her baneful surroundings at that tender age with an irreconcilable socialistic village cobbler as chief instructor it is difficult to imagine that one so young as germaine should speak and act in the way she is made to do in these pages especially when the culminating action is a deliberate attempt at murder in the dead of night without the slightest provocation surely even descent from an aunt of charlotte corday and a mind perverted by illteaching are insufficient to turn a child not yet in her teens into a murderous revolutionary however when dealing with this psychological question the author may have had data for her deduction and hence be justified in creating an  infant phenomenon at the end we are happy to be able to say germaine emerges  in every respect perfectly normal and she marries the man whose heart she had tried to reach with a dagger in another way,britain

mansfield in the court of kings bench took vengeance on dr brocklesby when the physician whilst giving evidence from the witnessbox had assumed an unwarrantable tone of personal intimacy with the chief jubtice  gentlemen the judge drily observed in his summingup  the next witness is one rocklesby or brocklesby brocklesby or rocklesby and first he swears that he is a physician even as lord mansfield wished the jury to accept with caution dr brocklesbys account of himself so do we advise the public to receive with suspicion mr george s philhpss personal revelations he swears that he was an itinerant lecturer in the service of a great literary association in yorkshire that he undertook to throw a chain of libraries readingroomb and schools for grownup people in the dales of yorkshire and between york city and the seaboard eastward and that whilst he was in the act of throwing this remarkable chain over the country he formed a close alliance with a large colony of gipsies in whose society he saw most of the scenes set forth in his book kindly furnishing us with minute particulars he says  it was my business to deliver at least one lecture during the winter season to the members of one hundred and thirtysix literary societies and mechanics institutes which constituted the union to speak at their public soiries and annual meetings when required to do so and to consult with them in their council meetings as to the bebt means of increasing the members and promoting the general efficiency of the societies regarded as a statement of fact theforegoing passage encourages us to believe that mr phillips is not indebted to imagination for his experiences amongst the nomad occupants of danes dike for we cannot conceive a lot more likely to inspire a simple man with disgust for the usages of civilised life and urge him to seek the fellowship of vagrant outcasts than a literary clerkship the duties of which require its holder to deliver two lectures per diem on the advantages of popular education we cannot imagine a more exasperating servitude than that which mr phillips assures us he underwent in behalf of the unlettered multitude but though it seems quite in the natural course of things that our author should have fled to the tents of the ishmaeutes or to any spot of earth where tables covered with green baize and tumblers of pure water are unknown we are uncertain how far the narrative of his doings with  swarthy pals  may be regarded as simple truth the book itself is a farrago of fact and fiction in verse and in prose the author gives us his views on politics rehgion social manners love opium and black pipes of beer and tobacco in the company of unwashed thieves he loudly sings the praise but for the frailties of respectable people he is deficient in charity and tenderness towards the established church he ia contemptuous smiling with derision at her  calvanistic creed and armenian clergy the principal actor on the stage of his story is a philosopher named pro fanoake mr profanoake has been prosecuted for blasphemy is editor of the  reasonera journal devoted to secularism and keeps a shop in fleet street mr profanoake figures as the champion of a poor man who is  sentenced by mr justice coleridge to one year and nine months imprisonment for the alleged offence of writing blasphemous words on the rectors gate at flamboro enough has been said to show who is the original of mr profanoake for whom the author professes lively admiration besides talking in a sublime style about the interests of priestridden humanity mr profanoake is made to tell the following briliant story  by the way he observes  talking of good tobacco reminds me of a capital joke which happened the other night in one of our aristocratic saloons lord john russell gave a large soirte to which alfred tennyson was invited and during the evening his lordship sauntering up and down his magnificent halls doing the agreeable to his guests happened

who is a lecturer on the human intellect they are startling facts but we cannot afford space for more than another brief extract from the authors volume   shepherd smith as he is called in england observes mr phillips confidentially or to give him his proper style and name the rev w e smith so long the editor of the family herald whose leading articles in that journal are the choicest specimens

B1466,['8469993'],  the woman in white by wilkie collins author of  the dead secret  after dark c c in three volumes low son and co in so much ofthe novelists art as consists in the effective telling of a certain kind of story mr wilkie collins has almost attained perfection if the interest steadily rising until the close of the second volume of the woman in white had continued to rise through the third volume also this novel would have been almost or perhaps altogether the best piece of storytelling in our language the interest that mr wilkie collins has peculiar skill in exciting though it is not without appeal to the gentler emotions is one rather of curiosity than sympathy he is great at a mystery and shows his power not merely in the cunning construction of a plot about some wellkept secret but even more strongly in his manner of giving also to minor incidents a strength of mysterious suggestion the substance of his stories is worth very little they never are worth telling again in other words than his being indeed mere blocks of melodrama having the one merit that they are such as he can work upon most easily we use however the word melodrama with a reserve since to that form of composition there belong comic interpolations and mr collins never permits us to laugh over his stories the sense of the ridiculous has no mastery over him and when he attempts humour as he seldom does he may be thoughtful or shrewd but his wit rarely indeed provokes a smile wisely determined as a writer to exert exclusively those powers of mind which are strongest in him he usually resists temptation to be playful and works on with a sustained seriousness that carries all his readers captive in his train of like origin is the literalness of detail on every page let us open at random any one of mr dickenss novels or of the works of the best english novelists and we may occupy five or six minutes with the pleasurable reading of whatever passage we may find there is a wealth of fancy and there are touches of feeling that can be instantly enjoyed apart from any bearing they have on the story in which they occur but enthralling as is the interest of mr collinss tales any one of his pages read in this way proves to be singularly matter of fact and dry except for a bit of clever observation which it will be very like to contain of every page the chief interest is made to depend entirely upon memory of what has gone before and expectation of what is to follow nothing whatever is suffered to distract the mind from fixed attention to the telling of the story but it would be a very great mistake indeed to deny possession of imagination to a novelist because he has spent more fancy on his scenes than in his sentences to the end of the second volume the conduct of the plot of the woman in white and the invention of the successive incidents manifest a power of imagination that no secondrate novelist possesses not only is the plot itself so carefully developed that whatever the reader thinks himself clever enough to foresee in one chapter is presented to him in the next so that his lights are put out as fast as he strikes them and his wonder is kept at its height but the successive incidents however simple the words in which they are told are picturesque and sometimes half poetical in their invention the shadowy appearances of the woman in white are so associated with aspects of nature and surrounding incidents of life as to be in the highest degree impressive the few descriptions of scenery necessary to the story although literal enough are thoroughly distinct and put under the feet of the actors in the story a ground thoroughly in harmony with all the groups they form there is not even a simple conversation in a parlour to be found recorded in the book that is not told effectively to the minds eye as well as to the ear picture follows picture as scene follows scene everything is told as a distinct memory of something present to the eye and in the three volumes not one picture is commonplace this is a praise which mr wilkie collins shares only with novelists of thc highest class and to which some even of t these have not an equal title another source of his strength is though seriousness of manner to which we have already referred ho has a profound relish for though mysterious that enables him to excite wonder by words in which thc subtlest critic might j be troubled to analyse the spell some of thc incidents i that excite us in this book arc not exciting in themselves a and are indeed such as nobody but mr collins could so tell r as to make them appear wonderful it is his supernatural earnestness perhaps that conquers us we cannot illustrate what we have said by example without giving hints of the plot of the tale that would impair its interest for readers who have yet to make its acquaintance we are asked in the preface not to do that and to do so would be of course especially unjust to a novel of which the story is the very soul of the manner of telling by separate narratives or reports we may say that it has its disadvantages as well as its advantages in the narrative of walter hartright the hero and in the diary of marian halcombe only the advantages are felt but nearly all the other narratives especially those of mr fairlie mrs catherick and count fosco obtrude unnaturally the characteristics of their writers and are such documents as would not have been really produced under the conditions stated but the whole novel is so designed that whatever has not the air of literal reality is a defect the defect of the third volume cannot be fully explained without some unfolding of the plot there is a break in the interest the great crime of sir percival with which the second volume ends is something known and clear and it is an event that must have so paramount an influence upon the close of the history that interest in the unknown crime to which the secret points is overwhelmed by it the strong current of curiosity upon which we had been born thus far is turned aside and we are transferred into a current running from another source the question of personal identity which is in the third volume the centre of the final plotting and counterplotting never takes a true hold on the imagination the difficulty raised at starting is not perfectly admitted by the reader he is never once convinced that a highlyeducated young lady who has not only her face to speak for her but her voice her handwriting her manner her evident home knowledge of all that the house contains its servants rooms and furniture could be supposed in her own home by a houseful of the domestics who have lived with her to be somebody else it is not credible that those who had known her for years should mistake her for an illiterate girl whom they have never themselves seen but who was said to resemble her the storyteller thus failsthough he labours skilfullyto carry us with him at the outset of a perfectly new series of complications the contest of wits is admirably planned and told but the end in a rough way foreseen excites no living interest partly because it is delayed too long in strong contrast to the strength of curiosity excited by every passage in the first two volumes is the listlessness with which we read in what should be the very climax of the tale the narrative of count fosco which makes known to the reader nothing beyond what he has already heard or guessed we have said more than enough to explain and justify the popularity that has been earned and will be long retained by this very remarkable work of fiction lt has narrowly missed being that perfect expression of its writers genius for which we confidently look mr wilkie collins not only has the individuality belonging to a man of original power but he knows where his particular strength lies cultivates that and that only the end we believe will be that he will fully attain what he has now almost attained perfection in the telling of a certain kind of story upon his own peculiar ground he is already without a rival,britain

mick  he cant belong to this earth but swhere is the cow  she too was gone and iick went homeward muttering prayers and bolling fast the bottle and what would i do if it broke thought hie  oh  but i 11 take care of that  so he put it into his bosom and went on anxious to prove his bottle and loubting of the reception he should meet from his wife lbalancing his anxieties wvith his expectation his fears wviti his hopes he reached home in the evenina and surprised his wife sitting over the turf fire in the big chimney oh mick are you come back sure you werent at cork all the way w that has happened to you where is the cow  did you sell her ihow much money did you get for her wx1hat news have you tell us every thing about it wwhy then molly if you ll give me time ill tell vou all about

it a quietl for hie ininded the old i inwas adviice loosened lis wifes gsp aud i the bottle again in his bosom poor placed tle bottle arain in him bosom poor lolly sat down crying while mick told her his story with many a crossing and blessing between him and harm his wife could not hell believing him particularly as she had as much faith in fairies as she had in the priest who indeed never liscouraged her belief in the fairies may be he didnt know she believed in them and may be he believed them himself she got up however without saying one word and began to sweep thfe earthen floor with a bunch of heath then she tilied up every thing and put out the long table and spread the clean cloth for she had only one upon it anl alick placing the bottle on the ground looked at it and said bottle do your duty  l look thiere  look there marnmy  sail his chubby eldest son a loy about five years old look there  look there  and he sprung to his mothers side as two tiny3 little fellows rose like liglht froin the bottle and in an instant covered the table with dishes and plates of gold and silver full of the finest victuals that ever were seen and when all wvas done wvent into the bottle again alick and his wife looked at every thingr with astonishment they had never seen such plates and dishles before and didnt think they could ever admire them enough the very sight almost took away their appetites but at length amolly said come and sit down mick and try and eat a bit sure you ought to be hungry after such a good days work w hy then the man told no lie about the bottle lick sat down after putting the children to the table and they made a hearty meal though they couldnt taste half thle dishes now says molly  i wonder will those two good little gentlemen carry away these file things again they waited but no one came so molly put up the dishes and plates very carefully saying  why then mick that was no lie sure enough  but you ll be a rich mhan yet ialick purcell  mick and his wife and children went to their bed not to sleep but to settle about selling the fine things they did not want and to take more land amick xvent to cork and sold his plate and bought a horse and cart and began to show that he was making money and tley did all they could to keep thle bottle a secret buat for all that their landlord found it out for hie came to alick one lay and asked him where he got all his mnoneysure it was not by the farm  and hie bothered him so much that at last amick told him of the biottle eis lanidlord offered him a deal of money for it but mliek would not give it till at last lhe offered to give hinm all his farm for ever so alick whco was very irich thought hed never want any more money and gave limn the bottle  but mlick was mistaken  he and his famnily spent money as if there  as no end of it and to make the story short they became poorer and poorer till at las tipev hlad nothing left but one cow and mick once more drove his cow before him to sell hier at cork fair hoping to meet the old man and get another bottle it was hardly daybreak when lie left   1 home and he walked on at a good pace till he reached the big hill the mists were sleep ing in the valleys and curling like snoke wreaths upon the brown heath around hin the sun rose on his left and just at his feet a lark sprang from its grassy couch and poured forth its joyous matin song ascending into the clear blue sky  till its form like a speck in the airinesn blending and thrilling with music was nmelting in light m mick crossed himself listening as he advanced to the sweet song of the lark 1ut thinking notwithstanding all the time of tile little old man when just as he reached tfie summit of the hill and cast his eves over the extensive prospect before and around him he was startled and rejoiced by the same wellknown voice well mick purcell j toll you you would be a rich man  nieed then sure enough 1 was thats no lie for you sir good morning to you but it is not rich i an nowbut leave you another bottle for i want it nowv as much w i did long ago so if you have it sir here is the cow for it an ad here is tthe bottle said the old man smilinr  you know what to do witiit c s4 oh  then sure i do as good right i have well farewell for ever mlick purcell i told you you would be a rich man and good bye to you sir said mick as he turned back  and good luck to you and good luck to the big hillit wantsa namebottle hillgood bye sir good bye so mick walked back as fast as he could never looking after the whitefaced little gentlenman and the cow so anxious was he to brings home the bottlewell he arrived with it safely enough and called out as soon as he saw molly oh  sure ife another bottle   arrah  then have you  why then you re a lucky man amick purcell thats whifat you are  in an instant she put ev ery thing right and alick looking at his bottle exult inglt cried out  bottle do your duty in a twinkling two great stout men with bio cudgels issued from the bottle i do not know how they got room in it and belaboured poor mick and his wife and all his family till they lay on the floor when in they event again mlick as soon as be recovered got up and looked about him he thomudht and thought and at last he took up his wife and his children and leaving them to recover as well as they could he took the bottle under his coat and went to his landlord who had a great company he got a servant to tell him lhe wanted to speak to him and at last he came out to mick v well what do you want now nothing sir only i heave another bottle 01 ho is it as good as the first yes sir and better if you like i will slhow it to you before all the ladies and gentlemen c come along then so saying mick was brought into the great hall where he sat bis old battle standing hi h uwn a shep ah ihail says he to himself if may be i woat have you by and by tic now says his landlord show us our bottle mick set it on the floor and 4nered the words in a moment the landlord nvas tumbled on the floor ladies and gentlemen servants and all were running and roaringr and sprawling and kicking and 5hrieking wine  cups and salvers were knocked about in every direction until the landlord called out  stop those two devils mick purcell or ill have you hanged   they never shall stop said amick till i get my own bottle that i see up there at top of that slhelf 4 give it down to him give it down to hnim before wve are all killed  says the landlord m mick put his bottle in his bosom in iumped the two men into the new bottle and he carried them home i need not lengthen mv story by telling how he got richer than ever how his son married his landlords only daughter how he and his wife died when they were very old and how some of the servants fighting at their wake broke the bottles but still the hill has the name upoil i it ay and so twill be always bottle luill to the end of the world and so it ought for it is a strange story the next legend we shall quote is entitled tihe field of boliauns torn fitzpatrick was the eldest son of a comfortable farmer who lived at ballincollig tom was just turned of nineandtwentywhen he met the following adventure and was as clever clean tight goodlooking a boy as any in the whole county cork one fine day in harvestit was indeed ladyday in harvest that every body knows to be one of the greatest holidays in the yeartom was taking a ramble through the ground and went sauntering along the sunny side of a lhedge thinking in himself where would be the great harin if people instead of idling and going about doing nothing at all were to shake out the hay and bind and stook the oats that was lying on the ledge specially as the weather had been rather broken of late he all of a sudden heard a clacking sort of noise a little before him in the hedge dear me said tom  but isnt it surprising to hear the storieclhatters sinainry so late in the season  so tom stole on going on the tops of his toes to try if he could get a sight of what was making the noise to see if hie was right in his guess the noise stopped but as tom looked sharply through the bushes what should he see in a nook of the hledge but a brown pitcher that might hold about a gallon and a half of liquor and by and by a little wee dinny dony bit of an old man with a little innffy of a cocked hat stuck upon the top of his head and a deeshy daushy leather apron hangingbefore him pulled out a little wooden stool and stood up upon it and dipped a ittle piggin into the pitcher and took out the full of it and put it beside the stool and thern sat down under the pitcher and began to work at putting a heelpiece on a bit of a broglue just fitting for himself well by the powers  said tom to himself  i often etad toll of the cluricaune and to tell gods truth i never rightly believed in them but here s one of them in real earnest if i go knowingly to work i in a made man they say a body must never take their eyes off them or they 11 escape  tom now stole on a little farther with his eye fixed on the little man just as a cat does with a mouse or as we read in books the rattlesnake does withl the birds he wants to enchant so when he got up quite close to him  god bless your work neighbour said tom  the little man raised up his head and thank you kindly said he  i wonder youd be working on the holiday  said tom t hats my own business not yours was the reply w jrell may be you d be civil enough to tell us what you ve got in the pitcher there  said torn i  that i will with pleasure said lhe its good beer b eer  said tom  thunder and fire where did you get it  w where lid i oet it is it why i made it and what do you think i made it of  devil a one of me knows said toin but of malt i suppose what else  there you re out i made it of hcath of heath  said tom bursting out laughint sure you dont think me to be such a fool as to believe that  i io as you please said he  but what i tell you is the truth did you never hear tell of the danes   and that i did said tom  werent them the fellows we gave such a licking when they thouglht to take limerick from us  hen  said the little man drily is that all you know about the matter  well but about them danes said tom  why all the about them there is is that when they were here they taught us to make beer out of the heath and the secret s in mny family ever since  twill you give a body a taste of your beer  said tom  ill tell you what it is young manit wouild be fitter for you to be lookiing after your fathiers property thaii to be botherino decent quiet people with your foolish questions there now while you re idling away your time here theres the cows have broke into the oats and are knocking the corni all about  tom was taken so by surprise with this that lhe wvas just on the very point of turnincr round when he recollected himself so afiraid that the like might happen again hie made a grab at the cluricaune and catught him up in his hand but in his hurry hie overset the pitcher and spilled all the beer so that hie could not get a taste of it to tell what sort it was isle then swore what lhe would not do to him if he did not show him where his money wats tom looked so nwicked and so bloodyminded that the little man was quite frightened so says hli 1 conie along n itll j11c a 0o111 le of fields off and ill show vvu a tvtw k jf gold i i i i i so they went and tom held the cluricaune fast in his hand and never took his eves from off him though they had to cross hedges and ditches and a crooked bit of bog for the cluricaune seemed out of pure mischief to pick out the hardest and most con trary way till at last they came to a geat field all full of boliaun buies ragweed and the cluricaune pointed to a big boliaun and says hie  dig under that bohiaun and youll get the vreat crock all full of guineas tom in his hurry had never minded three bringing a spade with him so he thought to run home and fetch one and that hie might know the place again he took off one of h red garters and tied it round the boliaun i suppose said the cluricaune very civilly youve no farther occasion for me no says tom you may go away now if you please and god speed you and may good lick attend you wherever you go well good bye to you tom fitzpatrick said the luricaune and much good may do you with what youll get 6so tom ran for the dear life till hle came home anid got a spade and then away with him as hard as he could go back to the tield of boliauns but when hie got there lo arnd behold not a boliaun in the field but had a red garter the very identical model of his own tied about it and as to diggi g up the wnhole field that was all nonsense for there was more than forty good irish acres in it so tom cane horn again with his spade on h is shoulder a little cooler than he went and inany s the hearty curse lhe grave the cluricaune every time he thoulght of the neat turn he had served him the last we shall quote isthe little sh0e now tell nie amolly said mlr coote to molly cogan as hle met her on the road one day close to one of t1se old gateways of kilmallock ldid you ever hear of the cluricauine is it the cluricaune why then

B3777,['6794765'],  other new books annals of a doss house by sydney hallifax mr hallifax writes from firsthand knowledge of a typical dosshouse which he calls the  phoenix located in a turning out of ratcliffhighway each of the ten chapters is concerned with a separate story  nearly all are sad and nearly all end with death perhaps this was inevitable yet we feel that a book of this description having in view a very definite humanitarian object would have gained in force by some presentment of the brighter side the festivities of a dosshouse are certainly as educational as its squalor its degradation its inevitable immorality but it must not be supposed that mr hallifax has produced a book on lines too common in such records there is no narrowness of outlook no inability to take the larger view mr hallifax has sympathy humour and also a healthy and confident optimism one never doubts for a moment the truth of the facts stated there they are set down broadly clearly and on the whole convincingly parson drew the  dossers  bishop  tear em liza and  gentleman jack  are all alive but we think the fictional form which mr hallifax has chosen detracts from their force so handled they make better reading no doubt but for philanthropic and reformative purposes a bare statement of facts would better have served the authors purpose these  annals however are a worthy contribution to the sociology of a subject which has been tinkered at for many years it is good for us to be presented with such narratives from the pen of a man who has both seen and understood george allen 2s 6d,britain

two handy volumes and new interest is imparted to the subject by though literary skill displayed by mr baringgould in handling his materials he is very happy too in his attempts to reproduce on pajier the dialect of that part of the west riding with which he seems best acquainted among the less widelyknown characters whose history has been unearthed by mr baringgould is dr john hildrop rector of wath near ripon about the middle of last century he was a man of obscure birth who had worked himself up in the world by his talents aud great conversational powers the story of his presentation to the living is well worth repeating lord ailesbury the patron surprised hildrop with the offer of it at a time when he was regarding himself as utterly hopeless helpless and friendless amazed at such generosity he waited upon his lordship to express all decent and grateful acknowledgments but was roughly though goodnaturedly cut short with  sir pray spare your speeches and keep your compliments to yourself you arc under no manner of obligation to me for had i known a moro deserving man in england than yourself you should not have had it dr hildrop published anonymously many volumes and detached essays little known at the present time though some of them were clever and witty enough in their own day to be attributed to swift some very good anecdotes of this gifted man are told in these pages memoirs of remarkable clergymen indeed fill up no inconsiderable space in this enumeration of yorkshire oddities the living of leaseholme in the north riding was held by three successive generations of the wikeses for upwards of a century all of them men of great literary talents popular preachers eccentric in character and much given to the bottle the first of the family who held the living was presented to it by charles h not for any theological attainments which he possessed but as a reward to an old soldier of his father for wikes when a captain in the army of charles i had received a wound in his leg which incapacitated him from further active service and no more economical method of pensioning him could bo suggested another instance of rewarding bravery in arms by promotion in the church we have met with in the case of samuel drake vicar of pontefract after the restoration whose chief qualifications for though dignity of doctor of divinity appeared to bo judging by the certificates of his acquaintances his having served in the marching army or the garrisons of newark and pontefract throughout the whole civil war one of though most amusing portions of though book is the account of jemmy hirst a native of rawcliffe who used to wear a broadbrimmed hat of lambskin fully nine feet in circumference a waistcoat and breeches of many colours and yellow boots instead of pictures he would hang the walls of his room with bits of old iron and coils of rope in one place an old fryingpan in another a rusty sword a piece of a chair or a jug the eccentricities of this man having reached the ears of george the third the king desired to have an interview with him  the following report of the conversation which passed has been preserved his majesty  asked jemmy how he liked london  i like it weel enow answered the oddity   but i hadnt any idea afore yesterday and today there were sae niony fools in it   indeed  said the king  you pay us a very poor compliment mr hirst i did not know that we were so badly olf for wisdom in london perhaps that is an article in such demand in yorkshire that thero is none to spare for cockneys   why ill tell thee how it were said jemmy  when i come into t toun yesterday and to thy house today the streets were full o crowds of folks gathered as thick as owt to see me just a cause i happd to ho dressed different frae other folk

shrinking modesty or of that tender selfsacrificing affection so peculiar to women we hold with the writer of  hidden depths that no punishment can be too severe for the wilfui coldblooded seducer of innocence  bat then we require first to be satisfied of the innocence we cannot help feeling that very little account is made of the sin itself by the writer we are told with truth that the social evil is hardly held as a sin by the lower class supposing then that the offender held up to our execration in this novel instead of deserting his victim had pensioned her off before his marriage to another the novel could not have continued to choose what we hope is an extreme case for our inspection is not the best plan for preventing the fate of thousands of women which occurs from far more ordinary causes what are the statistics of seduction and of what the writer would connect with it suicide  take country villages as a test and a fair one in this case as the author describes his unfomunates as innocent country girls w have known an instance of a labourer wjfafe applied to his clergyman for help towwsib the maintenance of his illegitimate child alleging that it was the custom of the bjjfj teadeavosr to secure husbands by mwfig uaeof acode of honour long estahlinmd £ig the lowest classnamely that if m mm had two illegitimate children mt mmmmm f th sass mother it was then his duty to marry her one such birth was not held sufficient cause again working in the fields is another fruitful source of contamination  the language and conduct of the married women being beyond measure vile we write it in sorrow  but the  innocent abodes of the poor with eight or ten persons of various ages sleeping in one bedroom do not yet exist vanity love of dress the desire of a life of excitement proved by female servants declining what they consider dull places the spread of light literature speaking slightingly of such connexions between rich and poorsuch as these are the real sources of the evil among such a class you will not find many who are goaded by excess of feeling or remorse to commit suicide the statistics of suicide prove that the most trifling causes such as sudden passion or illtemper will induce persons to destroy themselves what a terrible indifference to infanticide does the now celebrated case of the devonshire murderess discloseand by the way we have her photograph in hidden depths we now give a sketch of the story the heroine ernestine courtenay is engaged in the search for the sister of a girllois brook seduced by colonel courtenay her brother the girl lois brook commits suicide on being deserted and leaves a letter imploring the colonel to save her younger sister annie from a like melancholy end ernestine who is engaged to a mr lingard sets out with his permission on the search for annie brook who has been also seduced and cast off by her lover the tale shows us the social difficulties which meet ernestine in her mission she finds out the parents of the two girls  the father refuses to take back his child fearing the disgrace and loss of his place as lodgekeeper in a noblemans park  the mother gives a portrait of annie and a clue to the place where she is ernestine meets with a rebuff from lady carleton in asking permission for annies return to her fathers home she then goes to greyburgh university where her brother keginald is residing there she finds her brother dying and in a state of great mental trial from infidel views instilled into him by his college tutor two clergymen are introduced  the first is rector of the oarish in which annie brook is living a o dr granby is horrified at the notion of permitting a profligate to come near his house a good deal of wit is made out of his excuses for not seeking the lost he recommends ernestine to give up the search and to engage herself in real works of charity such as teaching an infant school  to clap their hands in unison or to imitate his daughter marie who leads c our little choir in term time when several of the collegians assist at our services and can appreciate our musical efforts we must here confess our surprise at any clergyman of a large parish represented as being so ludicrously indifferent to the cases of unfortunate girls of whose existence in visiting the poor he must continually be reminded and actually brought into contact with on their sick beds the other clergyman a mr thorold is represented as fully engaged in all the usual parish work of nightschools reformatories c as the book is published in scotlaud we hope that it is simply ignorance on the part of the author as to the conduct of the parish clergy who all more or less must meet with many cases connected with the social evil annie brook is at last found and persuaded to enter a reformatorythe discipline of which is too severe for her  she runs away but prefers rather to starve than to have recourse to the streets again she dies in the hospital but before her death recognises and forgives her first seducer lingard he of course is disclaimed for ever by ernestine who gives herself up to the work of recovering lost females we are treated to four deaths in the book three minutely described and the bodies properly laid out we find a great deal of poetical description as well as sentimental writing all the unfortunates are beautiful mis guided impulsive and affectionate we cannot think that the work although well written and interesting is quite in character with the very serious preface which informs us that the work is not one of fiction for  though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records much of the social evil is attributed teyoung men at the universityboys really of from sixteen to eighteen about whom the girls of the town congregate no doubt but innocent young women are not seduced out of the villages near as the author would indicate the language and turn of thought put into the mouths of the unfortunates are by no means true to nature as the author states in the work the sin itself is but lightly regarded among the poor they would therefore be very unlikely to speak or think even as here represented we cannot get over the feeling that the author more reprobates the desertion than the seduction of females the remarks about the overseverity of reformatories are good  but we cannot forget the overtenderness which lets loose ticketofleave men on the public the real fact is that if half the interest were displayed toward our poorest class before they become so interesting through sin and crime we should be fostering that sympathy between class and class which mr justice talfourd in his last charge declared to be so sadly wanting far more than by endeavouring to cure the evil after its spread the social evil will never be healed by novel writers however talented they may be the attack must not be made on human nature but on those evils which render that nature so weak and are thus the causes of the mischiefviz ignorance and the crowded dwellings of the poor and the poverty which makes them regard money as the sole good in life to be obtained at all hazards there are many landed proprietors even in mucliabtised dorset who are heartily working for the good of the poor by building cottages with more bedrooms the wages are also fixed at a higher rate by those gentlemen with the same objectthat of improving the moral condition of the labourers on their estates all this must be a work of time  and after all we cannot expect that the social evil can be ever eradicated until the whole world is in a far different state from what we now behold when there is no longer any more dishonesty or violence or deceit there will also be no more profligacy meanwhile if the efforts of philanthropists are directed not to exciting morbid sympathy towards the poor but to teaching men more selfrespect they will materially lessen the social evil  hidden depths tiim1 authoress of this very remarkable book writes with vehement earnestness taking for the motto of her work the axiom  verita4 ea major charitas  but we are sorry to say that her earnestness is in excess of her judgment and that what she takes for absolute truth is but a very limited part of a great and complex whole still though we are compelled for the truths sake to pass this apparently sweeping censure upon her work we are equally compelled to bear witness to the high intention with which she has laboured the extraordinary circumstance of a delicate pious and intellectuallygifted woman writingeven anonymouslyon the subject of the  social evil is in itself enough to bespeak respectful attention for her book but in addition the writer of  hidden depths is entitled to special consideration for the striking literary power she exhibits in the present volumes had she contented herself with writing an ordinary novel in which the sin of seduction was held up to the reprobation and scorn of all rightminded readers we are sure she would have deserved to be recognised as worthy of a conspicuous place in the ranks of contemporary english novelwriters she has chosen however to write with a purpose and we might almost say has courted failure for the admiration which hidden depths is well calculated to inspire so long as it is considered in the light of a work of fiction is turned to objection when the story with its narrow bounds and partial exhibition of facts has to be viewed as the exposition of a gigantic social disorderthe most saddening difficult not to say hopeless problem of civilised life 4 though all did not occur precisely as here narrated it is nevertheless actual truth which speaks in these records in this sentence taken from the authoresss preface we detect the error which underlies the whole argument of her book what happens mostly in the case of those who act upon mere philanthropical impulse has happened in her case having become possessed of a few facts she has taken them as representing the whole truth of the subject on which they bear it is clearly to be inferred from her book that she believes seductionthat is to say the systematic ruin of perfectly innocent girls by heartless profligatesto be one of the chief causes of the vice in question but how utterly without foundation such a belief must be is known to every one who has ventured to inquire into the subject at all it is most probable that the writer of  hidden depths  has heard the story of the happy home the perfect innocence the advent of the betrayer the faill from virtue the abandonment and all the other incidents related by some reclaimed unfortunate the mistake she has made is in having given a too ready credence to a relation which in ninetynine cases out of a hundred is found upon searching inquiryr to be wholly or in great part untrue of the poor wretches who qualify themselves to take the distinctive title of unfortunates it is almost certain that not ten in a thousand adopt that miserable calling from the cause assigned by her we need not recapitulate the score of wellascertained causes and we will only say that they have been found enough to daunt the boldest seekers for a remedy the authoress of  hidden depths thinks she has only to take her bible in hand and the cure is found through the lips of her heroine she cries in answer to the objection that she is possibly compromising herself in attempting to reclaim one only out of a tribe better ignored altogether  one onlybut that one an immortal soul that never in all the eternal ages can cease to live and living to suffer if in the whole world there is not enough of compassion found to save her from a doom of such unitnagined horror one only but that one unspeakably precious in the sight of the god who made her for himself that we know his beloved son would have come down from heaven to die in his awful agony for her alone had she only of all the human race been perishing and sinful you speak of thousands like her is it not enough to crush ones very soul with horror to think of what they are in the sight of the righteous heaven and shall be probably for ever  and the thought that it is their own fellowcreatures who have thus blasted their souls with eternal ruin makes one wonder that god ehould still withhold the fire which one day must justly bu to ashes a world so cruel and so polluted and cm you think hugh that apart from the judgement which will fall upon the active agents in the ruin of the thousands of whom you speak there will be no account demanded of their blood from those who were passive instruments in their destruction who might have helped who might have saved them and would not  on such as i am who ought to be ready to give my whole life to win all and any i could am i to abstain from rescuing one one actually given into my hand because some painful humiliation some bitter thence may come to wound my vanity from those who make this worlds approval the idol of their worship oh what will all that wrlnd be to me wpi am lyidg cold and stiff in the grave whence there in no reaw  how much more then

0u1l that will meet me at e baer afjand out egieist m idden depths two vdojuxl u uin md dools6 you might have saved me and you did not therefore you are my condemnation you are my sentence you are my everlasting despair   we give this passage as a specimen of the authoresss style and as affording at the same time an indication of her enthusiastic unpractical view of the subject with which she has undertaken to deal in the course of her narrative however occasional remarks will be foundwith reference to homes for fallen women and analogous institutions for exampleindicative of a large capacity for actual work it appears hard to say that what she has done has been useless labour but the most we can hope from it is that it may serve to set thinking some who never thought before of this ugly side of their social existence by all means let anything and everything that can be done be done to save individual souls by earnest doers like the authoress of  hidden depths the more closely the subject of the social evil is looked at by intelligent women the more likelihood is there of means being found to mitigate the abomination it is beyond doubt in the power of women to give a purer tone to society by doing their best to discountenance all profligacy of life in the men of their own families as well as those with whom they are otherwise brought into contact at present nothing of the kind is done and so long as no  inconvenience results even notorious impurity of life is held to be no disqualification for a man in society indeed the man of many mistresses is an object of special interest and regard with thousands of women who would affect the utmost horror and indignation at being brought into personal relationship with any woman of sullied reputation but these remarks apply only to the upper classes among the lower classes where the horrors of the social evil spread widest it is useless to think of any such ameliorating influence as that which it is possible for the women of the superior classes to exert the authoress of  hidden depths  takes no account of unfortunates below the grade of gentlemens abandoned mistresses or of the mercenaries of university towns and in saying this perhaps we say enough to show that her earnestness has been spent upon a mere fragment or two of the innumerable wrecks that strew the deadsea shore of this miserable subject we are glad however to recognise in her present work signs of an admirable literary faculty read as a work of fiction we are sure that  hidden depths  will not fail to interest thoughtful readers far beyond

B2108,['8526331'],  the literary examiner great expectations by charles dickens in three volumes chapman and hall all who have read this story from week to week as it appeared in the vigorous and entertaining pages of mr dickenss popular journal should join those who now read it for the first time as a finished work it is a finished work in the best sense there are we believe some readers whose taste goes no farther than enjoyment of the wit and animal spirits of pickwick and who prefer the simply joyous humour of that book to the maturest and best work of the mind that produced it such readers may and do cling as they will to their own pleasures of the past let it not be forgotten that to the sober middleaged roan who believes only in pickwick and nicholas nickleby those books were among the choicest delights of twenty years ago when he read only for enjoyment delighted openly and heartily in all that he enjoyed and had a mind that he could deliver alive into the hands of his entertainer such power of enjoyment may be blunted now but very sure we are that in the author of pickwick the power of giving a true and high pleasure has been sharpened and refined mr dickens is at this day not only a writer of rare and original geniuswhen at his best we say it most deliberately the greatest master of the whimsical and the pathetic yet to be found in any age among thc prose writers of europebut ho has wrought himself into a novelist who is a master in his art in place ofthe old sketch books of adventure lengthened at will and the pathetic or humorous personifications of life that were the spontaneous outpouring of an earnest mind and a swift fancy we have now the same wit that has so vividly represented detached scenes concentrated with its whole strength upon the construction of a plot that shall knit every fragment of its detail into one round and perfect whole we dwelled upon the singular success with which this result had been achieved in thc tale of two cities in the story of great expectations the same thing is equally remarkable and the new story has this advantage over its predecessor that its scene is in england and that its contrivance allows scope for a fuller display of the authors comic power there is not a character that does not fit into the plot aa a stone into an arch every dialogue is necessary to the outline or the proper colour of the one thing told thc opening pages could not have been written until the contents of the last pages were known chance phrases in the very first chapter bear so directlythough at the time imperceptiblyupon events to come that after they have served their first purpose in giving the sense of a perfect continuity and harmony to the whole work it is worth any mans while and the better the man the more it is worth his while to read the tale twicefor the second time critically in order to observe the exquisite art of passages that at the first reading influence at the authors will with unsuspected subtlety alike the cunning and the simple everything in art good orbed should have and usually has a central thought to which its parts bear some harmonious relation in great expectations the thought is one often enforced by mr dickens that far greater than great expectations from without is the worth of an honest mans own wholesome labour joe gargery lies at the core of the tale an illiterate blacksmith living by his own large arm and loving with his own large heart strong as a man simple as a childbut like a good woman gentle and true and unconsciously selfdenying about him revolves pip the orphan child he has reared and loved good fellow enough and bright fellow enough but not greater than the vanity of youth he is unwilling to be seen with his simple friend of the forge when a mysterious provision of money as to the source of which he has made a wrong guess and the assurance of great expectations from the same unknown source transform him suddenly into a gentleman his great expectations are the fairy gold that turns to dead leaves in the morning there is gold enough but his benefactor is only a convict wbo has amassed fortune in australia and whose craze it has been to make a gentleman of the boy who fed him upon one occasion of his greatest misery and need he escapes from australia to see and rejoice in the gentleman of his own making and thus becomes a sort of upside down and altogether human frankenstein monster to the youth who is threatened with a lifelong companionship not of the monster that he made but of the poor monster that made him the monster a born  warmint and jailbird is sketched with a generous and wise humour that he is a humiliating patron from whom great expectations cannot rationally be allowed to flow pip sees and feels but the wealth he would not take from such hands becomes forfeit when the man is condemned as an escaped convict to the gallows and from the deathbed that only anticipates the sentence of the law pip turns to his neglected fosterfather joe gargery the blacksmith joe who had in these late years found the fallen pip in his distress tenderly nursed him in sickness quietly bought out the execution for an extravagant jewellers bill with the coin earned with his own daily sweat and vanished when his work of patient love was done pip turns to the truesouled labourer at his forge with the old childish love again before he goes abroad to begin life anew dependent on his own daylabour one with this story is that of miss havisham and her foster child estella who becomes the object of pips love and by a network of incidents in no point violating probability is shown to be his convict benefactors daughter wealthy miss havisham courted in fraud by a villain and by the deceit made manifest upon her wedding morning turned so far mad that she shuts out the light of day stops the clock at the hour fatal to her great expectations and cherishes the wedding garments yellow with time arid the mouldy marriage feast is only unnatural inasmuch as she is insane yet the unwholesome cherishing and the perversion of her passion are so true in art that as it has usually happened with the most singular creations of the novelist living types have already been pointed out that claim resemblance to them upon miss havisham who is rich a knot of greedy relatives found their great expectations while her own expectations now are of the revenge she will take by training up the beautiful estella to win and wring the hearts of men she lives to see a piteous end to her sick hopes but let us turn to the book for a few extracts in the opening scene we have at once the marshes out of which great expectations grew and the beginning of the childs action which begot the convicts gratitude the first chapter is with the convict on the marshes the second is with joe gargery at the forge the delicacies of joes character are often suggested rather than told we make out for ourselves the reason of his marriage with an orphan girl whom he saw left to rear by hand in her solitude an infant brother nothing is urged upon us of the simple love and pity drawing him to take that desolate girl for his wife and to adopt the infant pip as his child but we are told by himself why he leaves mrs gargery to develop into a shrew to pull his whiskers and to knock his head against thc wall as often as she will without once using his blacksmiths arm or speaking one harsh word to quell her my sister mrs joe gargery was more than twenty years older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she bad brought me up  by hand having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as unon me i supposed that joe gargery and i were both brought up by hand she wss not a goodlooking woman my sister and i had s general impression that she must have

redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeggrater instead of soap she wss tall and bony snd almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against joe that she wore this apron so much though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if abe did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life joes forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our oountry weremost of them at that time when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and joe was sitting alone in the kitchen joe and i being fellowsufferers and having confidences as such joe imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner  mrs joe has been out a dozen times looking for you pip and shes out now making it a bakers dozen is she  yes pip said joe  and whats worse shes got tickler with her at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire tickler was a waxended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame  she sot down said joe  and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she rampaged out thats what she did said joe slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it  she rampaged out pip  has she been gone long joe  i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal  well said joe glancing up at the dutch clock  shes been on the hampage this last spell above five minutes pip shes a coming  get behind the door old chap and have the jacktowel betwixt you i took the advice my sister mrs joe throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation she concluded by throwing mei often served her as a connubial missileat joe wbo glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg but the mystery of the submission comes out in a later dialogue  and last of all pipand this i want to say very serous to you old chapi see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days that im dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing whats right by a woman and id fur rather of the two go wrong the tother way and be a little illconwenienced myself i wish it was only me that got put out pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap  i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the upanddownandstraigbt on it pip and i hope youll overlook shortcomings there is a subtle indication we may observe of the servile and broken wife that such a woman as mrs joe would have madeof the great weakness of her sort of domineering strengthin her dealing with dolge orlick of whom she alone knew though others suspected that he had revenged himself upon her tongue by striking her down with a blow that doomed her to the short life of a helpless cripple again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curious t and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted i had in vain tried everything producible that began with a t from tar to toast and tub at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sisters ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent thereupon j had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at joe who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by joe and me  why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see  its aim orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer we told him why we wanted him to come into thc kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all 6be did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without orlicks slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it biddy again who is mentioned in that extract is a delightful instance of the delicacy with which fine womanly shades ofthe mind and character of a truehearted working girl wholesomely bent on the doing of her duty can bc blended with the natural turn of her words and everywhere expressed while they are nowhere explicitly defined poor biddy had kept shop at the village dame school and had taught pip the first mysteries of letters when mrs joe was made a cripple the old woman who had kept the school was dead and the orphan biddy came to help the helpless woman at the forge imperceptibly i became conscious of s change in biddy however her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hands were always clean she wss not beautifulshe was common and could not be like estellabut she was pleasant and wholesome and sweettempered she bad not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful aud attentive eyes eyes that were very pretty snd very good  j it cease ci my urang onay own eyes fan  writing some psssages fros a book lo isanrovs myself ia two ways at once by a sort of stratagem aad aceing biddy observant of what i was about i laid down my pen aad biddy stopped ia ber needlework without laying it down mbiddy said i how do you manage it either i sm very stupid or you are very clever what is it that i manage i dont knowreturned biddy smiling she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean mort surprising how do you manage biddy said i  to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me  i was beginning to bs rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocketmoney for similar investment  though i hsve no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price  i might as well ass you said biddy  how you mansge    ko because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can aee me turning to at it but you never turn to at it biddy  i suppose i must catch itlike a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the names of our different sorts of work and our various tools in short whatever i knew biddy knew theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better tou are one of those biddy said i  who make the most of every chance tou never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing  i was your first teacher though wasnt i   said she as she sewed  biddy   i exclaimed in amazement  why you are crying   no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing  what put that in your head  what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work r i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr wopsles greataunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people i recalledthe hopeless circumstances by which she thad been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered i reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy i might have been too reserved and should have patronised her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence  tes biddy i observed when i had done turning it over  you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like thia in this kitchen  ah poor thing  replied biddy it was like her selfforgetfulncse to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable   thats sadly true 1  well said i u we must talk together a little more as we used to do and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next sunday biddy and a long chat still more exquisite in the same way is the sketch of that long chat between pip and biddy the connexion of pips great expectations with the great old bailey lawyer and the ingenious blending of newgate associations with pips fortunes before many readers will have discovered any relation between newgate and the source of his prosperity we may note as another instance of the skill with which the unity of the story is preserved throughout we may expect nothing from the fact that there was in the village by thc marsh a stagestruck parish clerk with a theatrical delivery but he comes to london as an actor pip looks in upon him once or twice at a minor theatre and on one occasion his early history appiled to the recognition of a second person who is among the audience is of great value in thc conduct of the tale to its catastrophe when pip becomes a pupil of mr matthew pocket whose wife with a grandfather who ought to have been in the peerage was in her way a woman of great expectations and is not a blessing to her house there are two fellow pupils startop and bentley drummle they are not produced as detached sketches each of these also becomes in his turn essential to thc story even thc audacious tailors boy in the village who mocks pip in the street when he appears in his best clothes has his own time and place for an important action necessary to the plot but mr pumblechook docs nothing it is his part to be nothing while claiming to be everything a servile flatterer of wealth for its own sake the pompous and coarse pretender is there to represent the baser chorus of the world that will sing hymns even to a boy whom it has bullied in his poverty when bc becomes by no act of his own merit a lad of great expectations in thc way of cash we are tempted to quote largely from the wit and wisdom of this book but it is in every readers hand rich as it is in scenes vivid with life and truth and in those phrases and sentences which occur only in what ia written for more than one generation of readers it is better that it should be read as it is being read in its entireness no other writer can construct a story with more skill than is shown in the construction of great expectations and most certainly no other writer can unite with a natural presentment of life and character an equal force of original genius,britain
B9015,['8627394'],  dynevor terrace or the clue of life a    e  m ti iti i new n0vkls bythe author of  the heir of redclyffe 2 vols parker  sonwe may anticipate that the author of tlie heir of redclyffe will publish in course of time a little library of novels for quiet family reading not so striking in their interest as her earlier production but truthful vigorous closelycopied portfolios of social pictures each lending itself to the development of a simple drama the leading merit of these books is their general freedom from overwrought effects even the attempt to work every subdivision of the several stories up to a sort of false climax is natural and not suggestive of artifice or effort the author writes intently and freely forgetting few circumstances in the lives of her everyday heroes and heroines and telling her tale as though the reader were bound to appreciate the importance of every incident that occurs to any violet or virginia laura or lucy in the whole round of her unobtrusive romance hence arise at once the faults and the virtues of her style she never loses herself in declamation or tinsels her dialogues with tragic metaphors or swamps her scenery with aurora radiance or puts greek fire into the mouths of eloquent villains the characters have no appearance of being dressed for the stage they converse with ease and spirit above all there are few interludes of pretentious satire or philosophic rambling on the other hand the action is wearisomely slow the events are remarkably small and the moral is imperfectly fetched out from the level mass of personal and local details as in  heartsease there is scarcely any story only a placid surface painted with groups landscapes and interiors and now and then opening upon a passage of dramatic vitality writing less characteristic and a moral tone less attractive would reduce the novel to a gallery of commonplace photographs carefully but not poetically tinted an immense family constitutes the central group in  dynevor terrace a grandmother two uucles an aunt four cousins sistersinlaw a daughter by a former marriage a grandson and several other collateral connexions with a train of domestics old and confidential three generations pass and repass across the scene until the faintly outlined story becomes as bewildering as a maypole dancewhile to enhance the confusion rapid

beyond lay an expanse of parched brown turf here and there an enclosure of unprosperous trees and full in front stood the wide space of stuccoed wall with a great gothic window full in the midst and battlements in the castellated btyle of the early years of the nineteenth century no one spoke after the first glance mrs frost shut her eyes to restrain the hot tears that arose at the thought of the wintery morning when icedrops hung hoary on the firtrees as she had driven away from the portal whence music was now pealing forth a greeting and where oliver was standing on the very spot where with clenched hand he had vowed that all should be restored   they were a new race property hail changed hands rapidly in a region of trade and manufacture and the old dynevor name had been forgotten past recall amid the very population who were thriving upon the identical speculations which had swamped mr frosts fortune if the crowd without looked like a mob the assembly within had a parvenu

B5442,['8933818'],  new novels at ale villa ro8e by a e w mason hodder  stoughton an elderly dilettante in the gay world of aixlesbains lends piquancy to the story of murder and its detection for which mr mason has deserted the field of romance he is a great improvement on the stupid characters or rather puppets who form the usual foil to the clever detective and the intricate deductions of the mind which solves the problem are decidedly ingenious it is obvious by all rules of sentiment that the pretty young lady who has disappeared from the villa cannot be guilty of the murder and we think the expert will detect at least one of the culprits pretty early but the expert is not the reading public which should be well entertained by the surprises of the mystery and grateful for a style of writing which shows both ease and an excellent sense of point,britain
B511,['8671280'],  not wisely but too well new novels by the author of cometh up as a flower 3 vols tinsley brothers we suspect that this book is written by the author of  guy livingstone from its peculiar heroes and very peculiar morality in fact guy livingtone himself under the name of col stamer is here again introduced to the public with his old characteristicshi3 gigantic strength and form fascinating manners and delightful wickedness  so that if this book is not written by the novelist we have mentioned we can only say that the author is guilty of very decided plagiarism and has allowed his admiration of the model to mislead him into imitating his master  not wisely but too well we sincerely hope our original suspicion is correct for we should bo very sorry to see two writers of ability pandering to the gross tastes of the day by writing such books as guy livingstone and  not wisely but too well the great object of books like these is apparently to teach immorality by representing it in an interesting and seductive form and by making good people who live according to the ordinary laws of decency appear tame stupid and despicable at any rate if this is not their object wo can assure their authors that it must inevitably be their effect this has been pointed out time after time but still we find these books being written and published and the almost unanimous voice of rebuke and morality despised and neglected it is time then for critics to speak out boldly and to declare in plain language what they think of the tendencies of these books and see by so doing whether they cannot put a stop to their production now this may seem to some very strong language but it is not stronger than the occasion requires if any one doubts this let him take the book we are now reviewing and read it coolly and critically and ask himself at the end what is its tendency and what impression on the mind of an ordinary reader it is calculated to produce we distinctly affirm that in this novel all the personages who do not continually break the commonest laws of society are made to appear uninteresting and foolish as if though only reason for a man not being a profligate was a want of spirit or an absence of ability while all the art of the writer is lavished on the herocol stamer whose wickedness we are frankly told cannot be exceeded and in making this man obtain the morbid sympathy of the reader as he obtains the passionate love of the heroine a short sketch of the tale will do more perhaps to reveal the nature of this book than all our animadversions the hero colonel dare stamer loves and is equally beloved by miss kate chester the heroine an extraordinarily beautiful and clever girl and before the colonel knew her a very ladylike and modest one this colonel is but guy livingstone again we take his description from the very words of the book  this is he a man with just such a face as one often sees among human creatures endowed with an ordinary degree of intellectual powersof the two perhaps leaning to the side of superior intelligenceand with a big powerful figure  a figure deep chested cleanlimbed thinflanked that promised strengtharms long and sinewy with the musclemuch developed in many a boxingmatch or many a cricketfieldrising in knotted cords upon them and a great columnar throat a head rather apt at towering stately over the heads of other men  penthouse brows that had been seen to scowl dwelling under them in their shadow luminous dark eyeseyes that could look very angry or very tender not a good man at all he might hug himself with the satisfactory reflection that during the six lustres of bis existence he had not done one atom of good to any human being but on the contrary had done a good deal of harm  had broken one or two extrabrittle womanhearts  had dangerously cracked several others all without much compunction  women he used to say in his club where he was listened to with the respect due to much experimental knowledge women were fair game  and game very easily winged too he sometimes subjoined and so on this colonel after a few interviews with kate asks her to run away with him she replies she will do anything for him but naturally inquires why not be quietly married at home in the ordinary way whereupon dare mentions as a small objection his being married already his wife being as he confesses very good and loving  but then he is tired of her and loves kate much more it can certainly be said as his only excuse that he was tired of his wife  but kate reluctantly feels she ought not to run away from home with him for that only and tries to make him understand her sentiments on the point then ensues a desperate scene  embraces kisses c and the colonel nearly succeeds in seducing her when she saves herself at the last moment by appealing to him thus    oh do dare my darling do let me go dont try to keep me it is bitter to part i know dont you suppose i feel that  it is a terrible wrench but oh dare dodo it for my sake what can i say to persuade you  she said in her sore trouble  oh my darlingmy own dare let me go let mo go  at this highly pathetic appeal he gives way and she is saved for the time the whole moral of the scene being what a monstrous shame it is that two loving hearts like these cannot be happy merely because of thc paltry prejudice against a man marrying two wives this takes us up to the beginning of the second volume and the remainder is occupied with kates despair and the imbecility of the good people of the novel after eighteen months separation kate still unmarried and only about nineteen years of age meets her beloved dare once more in a quiet nook of the crystal palace scene number two similar to the first only worse more kisses more embraces he  busy gloating miserlike with bold glad eyes over his recovered pearl eyes that she did not blush or wince under as in the old coy girlish days she was a woman now not a girl past blushing or hiding away from those orbs of fire after a lot of disgustingly immodest and unnatural ravings she consents to be his mistress and to meet him the following day and all this though at the time she first met him in the crystal palace he had another lady with him who he frankly confesses is one of his numerous victims a married lady of rank whom he had seduced merely to keep him from thinking of kate but this seems rather to make kate pity him than otherwise and she is certainly not at all shocked at it to conclude this miserable tale as kate is coming the following day to meet her lover she is persuaded not to go after a severe struggle by an attenuated parson dare is pitched out of a dogcart some short time after and dying from the fall has a farewell interview with kate in which he expresses no penitence for his past life but only a half kind of dread for the future after his death she becomes a protestant sister of mercy and is wretched ever after comment on this story is needless we may observe though that the dressing and details of the novel are worthy of the tale to justify us in saying this we could quote hundreds of passages but they are too bad for us so we only give this one as an example it is part of a speech made by kate at a time when she was uncertain as to the colonels love and when she had only seen him two or three times it must be remembered too that kate is supposed to have been educated in a good english family and to know nothing of the world  o why will not god let us have what we like and be happy in this world in our own way she groaned  instead of making us always be lifting up our eyes strainingly to a country we cannot see and which we shall most likely never get to at last  o dare i would do anything wicked anything insane for you would i have that time back again when i bad never seen your dark cruel face no i d rather be as i amutterly wretched than never have heard your voice never seen you smile upon me as you did that day by the shore 0 such a minute as that would overpay centuries in hell if i could make a bargain this minute that i should have dare all to myself for just one month and then to die and live in tortures for all the countless ages of eternitywhy id do it this second that i would without a moments hesitation  o dare dare moaned the soft woman voice again  what grand eyes you have how they seem to scorch and shrivel up my soul looking always always through it and fo on with the sickening blasphemy with which we must no more pollute these pages nothing but a sense of duty compels us to quote even so much as we have done this is the kind of speech the author of this book imagines innocent young ladies make when apostrophizing their loves and gives a fair specimen of thc tone and thought of the work worse than even the immorality of the whole novel are the stupid misplaced attempts at sermonising throughout they might bo very well in another work but being where they are they simply disgust we need say no more,britain

B1344,['8907261'],  the napoleon of notting hill by gilbert k chesterton lane humour in our day is so scarce and humourists are so few that mr chestertons farandole of farce may easily be wrongly praised it is farce but not pure farce for it often drops into buffoonery this vehement jumble of styles is fatiguing for the kingdom of humour cannot be taken by violence however brilliant farce is the staple of mr chestertons humour he is a farceur with ideas now farce is an excellent and an english thing by all means let us revive it but let us remember that humour has its laws as well as poetry or mathematics what are those laws alas humour still awaits its blackstone perhaps the best code of humour is that which is suggested by mr wattsdunton in his articleon  the renascence of wonder in chamberss  cyclopaedia of literature he points out that there are two kinds of humour absolute and relative  while in the case of relative humour that which amuses the humourist is the incongruity of some departure from the laws of convention in the case of absolute humour it is the incongruity of some departure from the normal as fixed by nature herself applying this test to mr chesterton we find that his humour is as a rule relative the incongruity which amuses him is a departure from the convention of monarchy the convention of municipal routine the convention of behaviour the convention of clothes he invents men who violate these ordinances in england eighty years hence the king is chosen like a juryman by alphabetical rotation the lot falls on auberon quin an alleged humourist in whom we recognize with the help of mr graham robertsons illustrations a shadowy likeness to mr max beerbohm humour doubtless deteriorates on a throne if king auberon were a real humourist he would not spoil the ripe humour of royalty by devising feeble practical jokes his humour is no laughing matter these imaginary borough councils with their provosts halberdiers banners and flamboyant ceremonial are not nearly so humorous as the real borough councils with their pompous mayors who glory in robes and chains of office not one of these visionary cities is so absurd as that actual city of westminster which emblazons its pride on the walls of its very lavatories this is a case indeed in which truth is funnier than fiction rich as is the humour of the borough councils there is something which is richer stillthe humour of the lord mayor and the city aldermen the incomparable humour of gog and magog not until adam wayne enters does mr chesterton reach the true realm of farce the conception of a man possessed by a devouring passion for notting hill is really farcical and the battles between the patriots of pump street and the municipal reformers who desire to annex it are full of that mockillusion that sham gravity which is the attribute of farce the kings dispatches as war correspondent of the court journal are capital fooling and the burlesque of the style of the late g w steevens is very amusing the gas and water strategy of the napoleon of notting hill is deliciously farcical like all empires notting hill is sapped by success its decline and fall lead to a philosophic dialogue between the sham king and the sham napoleon which lifts the farce into the higher region of irony   suppose i am god said the voice  and suppose i made the world in idleness suppose the stare that you think eternal are only the idiot fireworks of an everlasting schoolboy suppose the sun and the moonare only the two eyes of one vast and sneering giant opened alternately in a neverending winksuppose t am god and having made things laugh at them   and suppose i am man answered the other and suppose that i give the answer that shatters even a laugh suppose i do not laugh back at you do not blaspheme you do not curse you but suppose standing up straight under the sky with every power of my being i thank you for the fools paradise you have made suppose i praise you with a literal pain of ecstasy for the jest that has brought me so terrible a joyi ask you in the name of heaven who wins  this passage certainly comes near to being absolute humour it propounds a kind of spiritual pantagruelism as an answer to the irony of an ironic god the idea of course is not new it is as old as the hillsor as the athenaum for more than a quarter of a century ago it was put forward in our columns  the humouristis so perpetually overwhelmed by the irony of the entire game cosmic and human from the droll little conventions of the village pothouse to those of london of paris of new york of pekinup to the apparently meaningless dance of the planets round the sunup again to that greater and more meaningless waltz of suns around the centrehe is so delighted with the delicious foolishness of wisdom the conceited ignorance of knowledge the grotesqueness even of the standard of beauty itselfso overwhelmed is the humourist with the whim of all thiswith the incongruity that isof the normal itselfwith the almightyjoke of the cosmos as it isthat he sees nothing  funny  in departures from laws which to him are in themselves the very quintessence of fun and he laughs the laugh of rabelais and of sterne  for he feels that behind this rich incongruous show there must be a beneficent showman he knows that although at the top of the constellations sits circumstance harlequin and king bowelless and blind shaking his starry cap and bells there sits far above even harlequin himself another being greater than hea being who because he has given us the delight of laughter must be good and who in the end will somewhere set all these incongruities right mr chesterton does not see higher than the harlequin god he does not see the  beneficent showman but he does see that in the ideal man the humourist and the idealist are two lobes of the same brain he finds this ideal man like tolstoy in the ploughmanthe common man whom mere geniuses like you and me can only worship like a god but does the common man really see the ridiculous as the sublime and the sublime as the ridiculous  if so the world is peopled with chestertons and infinitely more

englander the other is to the dweller in the bogs of connaught each author reveals to us the life and habit of thought of a class hitherto but little known and eachpossesses the magic of clothing humdrum trifles with interest and charm but as the new englander and the wild irishman differ much from one anothernot only in way of life but in habit of thoughtit follows that the resemblance between the two writers is the result of many differences the new englander is shrewd protestant and struggling the connaught peasant idle dreamy and resigned and as each author has the power of making us live the life of her puppets and enter into their way of thought it follows that anything like imitation is impossible the irish idylls all occur in the desolate hamlet of lisconnel among cottars huddled together on a low hill or knockaun in the bog in a destitution never far removed from actual starvation  the hopes and cares of the inhabitants centre mainly in the little greydyked fields which make a plaid pattern on the hillside and along a meagre belt beneath and this renders it the more regretable that their most prolific and certain crop should be such an unremunerative one stones upon stones scattered broadcast by some malignant hundredhanded and perennially working up through the thin soil in mockery of tenfingered attempts to collect and keep them under those looselybuilt boundary walls which intersect so frequently that the bit of land looks as if a coarselymeshed net had been flung over it fail utterly to exhaust the supply in each diminutive field a

eventual doubling of his live stock could console him  and as for the ten new sons and daughtersthey would be a failure indeed the working of the irish peasant mind has seldom been indicated more clearly than in this passage and the thoughtful speculative turn of bogland brains reveals itself in a dozen racy conversations which the reader will find only too short though they are too long for quotation in character drawing miss barlow succeeds best with mature women old mrs kilfoyle the widdy mgurk and herself are admirable sketches and mad bell with her face  like a wizened lemon looking shrewdly up at you is a delightful creation but the girls are less living and the menwith perhaps the exception of poor larry sheridanare types rather than individuals like the characters in a modern play but in spite of this defect and of the authors excessive fondness for adjectives the irish idylls are delightful reading and afford a truer insight into irish peasant character and ways of life and thought than any hook that it has been our fortune to read for a long time  irish idylls i imagine that as this book goes the round of the reviews it will become a trite thing to call miss barlow an irish barrie like him she has found her book waiting her in a little and humble place of the earth like him she has the delicate observation that is the harvest of a quiet eye she has his gifts of tenderness of dignity of true and simple pathos of sympathy that comes by love like him she has a fine and beautiful vocabulary and a style that makes pictures to us irish she is more welcome than barrie can be to the scotch we are so long awaiting our real irish novelist while mr barrie comes in the line of succession to great men who have made the world intimate with scotland and scottish folk we have had no such interpreters carleton was too shapeless and too melancholy miss edgeworth despite her genius was oldmaidish and restricted the banims and gryphon did but piecemeal work at best miss lawless in our own day writes of the same sunless country and grey lives that miss barlow treats here but her  grania leaves one an impression of a solitary page of the story a single lonely figure desolate on a low shore amid a waste of waters there is many a lisconnel in ireland at the back of the bogs or  the back of god speed but who else could make of it not a human document but a human book fluttering whose pages we run all the gamut of emotions we have here the human tragedy in such pathetic things as one too many or  herself miss barlow has the gift of tears in verse or prose and as one could scarcely read th old master to take one of her poems without a  irish idylls by jane barlow london hodder and stoughton catch in the throat so it is not easy to be dryeyed over poor larry sheridan and his homely tragedy or over mrs odriscoll and the children going to america but what good honest pathos it is none of the unwholesome things that take you by the throat with a stony horror like those that stalk out of ibsen and the russians irish idylls leaves us more human and kindly when it has wrung our hearts then the humour is truly delightful what a child only we see too little of him is jimmy kilfoyle and what mingled humour and pathos is the warp and woof of all their lives one gets to know them mrs doyne and stacy dear little mrs kilfoyle and mr mcgurk and all the other worthies of lisconnel as if one were going in and out every day among them the humanity is not starved olt of lisconnel it is an innocent little community indeed in which the only thing starved out seems to be vice miss barlow sees not only the primitive lives but the lonely country and the wild skies that seem a part of it she has superb descriptive bits which paint us pictures as finely as any sky painter or painter of moors who works in the legitimate medium i wish i had space to quote the skies that flash into her pictures fixed for us in her nervous and fine english it would not be easy to better this all at once something happened in the western sky it was as if some vast tentrope had suddenly been snapped for the dark riftless cloudcanopy seemed not so much to abruptly rise as to actually recoil back with a swing up from the horizons verge and ere one had realised that it had begun to lift it was flying eastward scudding in festoons and trails and shreds or furled into rumpled bundles in the grip of the careering blasts i believe  irish idylls will be an irish classic i have read every line of it with increasing delight and am glad messrs hodder and stoughton have bound it so substantially not like your mushrooms of a season miss barlow writes a little more from the outside than does barrie this is shown by her occasional slip in the matter of the brogue though she has much mended since  bogland studies another matter in which she does not see far is that in such lives as these religion would be a far more potent element than she makes it katharine tynan  irish ways by jane barlow illus trated by warwick goble allen  sons miss jane barlows reputation as a writer of irish tales or rather irish sketches of character is too high to require any recommendation from us this new instalment has all the merits of her previous volumes but it does not manifest any advance in her art the style is finished and shows evidence of high education and long familiarity with classical and modern literature hence it is remarkable that she should confine herself to so narrow a field where that large learning can show itself only indirectly and where a love of nature and an insight into peasant character form the whole matter of the volume there is but little plot in her stories  the elements of broad farce and of wild tragedy are not there but we find endless quiet humour and deep appreciation of the virtues and foibles of one of the most attractive peasantries of europe the opening chapter  ourselves and our island gives a summary of the complexities of irish character very similar to the larger but not so subtle treatment by mr lynd which we noticed on october 23rd but when we penetrate into the book we find that two or three leading types which other books treat at great length are ignored by miss barlow we say ignored for it is inconceivable that she does not know them the first is the roman catholic priest and indeed the protestant clergyman whose influence on the life of the poor is so great yet so disputed there is occasionally a priest in her backgrounds but as a character she will not tolerate him the same is the case with the local agitator and thirdly there is the gombeen man local moneylender who haunts every village and every market in poorer ireland and gives ample scope to the painter of irish life as for example to william carleton yet though this is the author who has most in common with miss barlow she omits these three types as carefully as the letters upon ireland are omitted from the published correspondence of queen victoria we can offer no clue to this negative feature in miss barlows irish stories but we must say that it limits her field and makes her gallery of local types smaller and more monotonous if she also omits the jackeen and the buckeen the apes of the squireen she would doubtless reply that she writes only about the very poor and only about the country poor who have exceptional manners no one knows better than miss barlow how to bring out this feature in her tales  and she paints the life and feelings of these indigent but refined peasants with a charm that has fascinated the reading public of our day her descriptions of the scenery of bogs and moors and of wild western coasts is often truly poetical indeed she allows herself the licence of french rather than english prose in this respect the beauties of bogland are by no means obvious yet no man who has travelled that sort of country deliberately as for example for sport will hesitate to acknowledge the truth and accuracy of her observation the writing down of dialect is always difficult some eminent irish novelists are very deficient in the power of hearing the sounds and catching the idioms such is not the case with miss barlow though we are not always in agreement with her we make the following suggestions as she surely professes to give the ordinary diction of western peasants and not their occasional use of strange words though the eastern irish speak of an awkward person as a thwart we do not remember the verb  to thwart in their use or with like limitation the verb  to question the irishman does not say  i question whether this is true but i doubt if it is so to be surprised  is also unusual though  surprizin  is common  and the pronunciation  scandeelious  for  scandlous  is new to us the irish know a spruce tree well enough but a spruce lad is a use of the adjective which is surely uncommon  should you suppose is also to be rejected  shall  and  should  being very unusual and replaced by  will  and  would the general impression which the english will draw from the book is that the western irish peasant is not the gay rollicking careless figure of angloirish fiction but rather a patient hardworking creature living in such squalor and gloom as to make his life a prolonged effort against despair miss barlows peasants represent the preceltic population often called firbolgs which was subdued by the invading celts and either exiled to the mountains and bogs of the west or reduced to the condition of churls who tilled the land for the tyrannous and ungrateful celtic swordsmen and their chiefs the hard treatment which the latter received from the english was probably a mere repetition of what had happened ten or fifteen centuries earlier when the celts were the invading conquerors it would be an interesting inquiry to trace the influences of this earlier stratum  probably pre  aryan  on the life of ireland but these are speculations regarding remote and forgotten causes which have drawn us away from the living pictures of today which are the object of this book we need hardly say in conclusion that we commend it strongly to our readers a word of praise should be added for the excellent illustrations of mr goble,britain

B8169,['8519142'],  heathcote of gangoil harry harry hcathcotc of gangoil a tale of australian bush lift by anthony trollope low and co this novel of mr trollopes possesses the double merit of being short and extremely interesting but ws should think lbe would have encountered some difficulty if he had tried to get it published under the auspices of an emigration agency it professes to give a faithful picture of the society of the queensland  bush and of the struggle for existence among the various members of that society which although limited is still sufficiently   ci a naynniqt1ie interests the five drin large to contain antagonistic interests the five principal elements that take an active part in mr trollopes story are squatters freeselectors hired workmen thieves and mosquitos of these the mosquitos are the only animated creatures that seem thoroughly to enjoy life next to them come the thieves whose policy it seems to be to squat on a small leasehold property and to make that a basis of operations for stealing the sheep and cattle of their neighbours the danger of detection and imprisonment or hanging is a certain drawback to the charms of this easy life but that is so slight in a thinly peopled country that the squatter whose notions of property are primitive and elementary as those of paleys pigeon might be ideally happy but for his rivals the mosquitos when however we ascend in the scale of queensland society we have a painful illustration of the cares of greatness and of the advantages for happiness possessed by those at the bottom of the ladder as mr trollope does not make us acquainted with more than one squatter and one freeselector we cannot estimate their relative facilities for leading a tolerable existence but certainly if all queensland squatters are in the same position as harry heath coat of gangoil and have the same happy temperament for adding to their natural difficulties their lot is not much to be envied the nominal occupier of 120000 acres of bush and owner of countless flocks of sheep heathcote has no friends but his wife and sisterinlaw who live with him in his solitude and such of his hired labourers as he can attach to his person his neighbours the freeselectors and smaller squatters are his natural enemies the freeselectors buy from the government the choicest parts of his vast leasehold and the smaller squatters prey upon his dispersed stock and these represent only his smaller anxieties his great enemy is fire in the hot season the wood and grass upon his farm are as dry as tinder and be lives in daily apprehension that a match inadvertently thrown away by a careless smoker or applied by a malicious enemy may raise a conflagration which in one night would mnake him a ruined man an enemy inthe bush is provided with a frightful instrument in the ease with which it is possible to kindle a destructive fire true fireraising in the bush is a crime that means hanging if detected but a man cannot be hanged on mere suspicion and proof in such circumstances can rarely be obtained it is clearly a squatters interest to make as few enemies as possible in a wilderness where the law can afford little protection and the individual must trust chiefly to his own precautions for security against violence now mr trollopes hero heathcote of gangoil unfortunately for himself had a kind of alacrity in making enemies a timid scrupulous contemplative man would necessarily be unequal to the exigences of a squatters situation which is obviously a school for the active virtues and heathcote was the reverse of timid he was robust active and something more mr trollope describes him as an imperious masterfal man resolved to see with his own eyes and to have his own way impatient of advice and opposition de sirous of acting always with straightforward justice but determined not to put up with one iota short of his rights disposed too withal to suspect that other people were not quite so honest in their motives as himself he wore a look in his features which friends called firmness strangers obstinacy and enemies pigheaded ness leathcote soon succeeded in making dangerous enernies in the neighbourhood of gangoil one of his men got drunk refused to obey orders and was insolent to the women of the house whereupon heathcote pitched him over his gate and when he returned next day refused to readmit him to his service another man whom he had hired to watch against fire left his post and employed himself in barking trees for which he was paid separately heathcote caught him in this neglect of duty and attempt to earn double wagesand pointed out to him that he was a swindler whereupon the man left in high dudgeon at boolabong in the neighbourhood of gangoil lived some small squatters of questionable honesty and these heathcote treated with open contempt as the dirt beneath his feet in a few years time things came to a crisis the malcon tents met together and resolved that heathcote had carried himself so high that he could no longer be tolerated and must be put down they conspired to burn him out their plot was to set fire to the long grass on the run of boolabong when the wind was blowing towards heathcotes land and their plot would have succeeded but for the unexpected intervention of a freeselector whom also heathcote had done his best to convert into a bitter enemy mr medlicott was an english emigrant who had come out to queensland to make a subsistence or a fortune by sugargrowing he had incurred heathcotes illwill in the first place by being a freeselector who had bought a small por tion of the huge extent of the run of gangoil this original offence was bad enough in heathcotes eyes but it was aggravated when medlicott took into his service the man nokes whom heathcote had pitched over his gate and dismissed further when heatheote called to remonstrate against this and to express his suspicions that nokes meant to do him a mischief medlicott received his remonstrances coldly crossw examined him as to his grounds of suspicion and failed to see why a man who had been dismissed by one master should be cut off from all employment in the neighbourhood the two men had parted after this interview with mutual disgust heathcote thinking medlicott a foolish theorist who had come out from england with his cutanddry notions and expected them to apply in the bush and mzidlicott setting down heathcote from the brusqueness of his manner and the arbitrary nature of hi request as a conceited illconditioned cur medlicott therefore was the last man from whom heathcote could expect assistance in meet ing the conspiracy against him yet it was by this hated freeselectors help that he was able in the end to triumph over all his enemies we suspected mr trollope at first of trying to point a moral in favour of the rough masterful uncompromising ways of his hero heathcotes suspicions though he could say so little to justify them in crossexamination turn out in the end to be right and it might appear to those who look for a moral beneath an artists work that mr trollope had held up this robust selfwilled squatter as a model for the admiration of his countrymen and a light to guide them to success but on closer examination we see after all that heathcotes masterful behaviour and obstinate pursuit of his own hardy instincts would have ended in utter failure but for an accident to which his robust energies in no way contributed miedlicotts real motive for taking a kindlier view of his pigheaded neighbour was not that he recognised the mans honest intentions or was overborne by his force of will but simply that he had fallen in love with his wifes sister this provision of a natural motive completes the artistic symmetry of a wellwritten novel and redeems the novelist from all suspicion of trying to preach a somewhat vulgar sermon heathcote is the hero of the novel but medlicott who combines with enterprise and pluck a reasonable amount of caution seems rather to be his exemplar for though emigrant,britain

and truth mr trollope has not succeeded better in this endeavour than those greater novelists who have gone before him barchester towers is a continuation of the warden with the same heroine widowed and marrying a second time but apart from the difficulty of the attempt to coin a plot out of such materials there is the ame want of skill in the invention of a story which we had noticed in the warden m1r trollope however like his mother does not write novels for the purpose of telling a story but to exhibit character and illustrate certain phases of modern society that is the aim of barchester towers it is levelled at the religious feuds of our daythe parties that divide the church and satire is unsparingly levelled against such as do not accord with the authors opinions or iympathies mrs bold the widow the eleanor harding of the warden is courted by three suitors who are thus contrasted with one another and we are introduced to high church and low church parsons and an evangelical bishopmr trollope tendencies being strongly against the low church which he does not omit to present in the most unfavourable aspect as a novelist always can if he pleases and for which reason it is that we have systematically denounced polemical fictions as an unfair method of warfare ad a perversion of the design of fiction which is to teach virtue by example not to introduce controversy or dogmatism in the form of a narratlive apart from this objection barchesfer towern is entitled to critical praise it is clever in its sketches of character and in its somewhat malevolent satire as a satire it is amusing but it will convince nobody mr trollope has powers which applied to a more genial theme would give him a high place in fiction the same objection only to a still greater extent applies to nightshade it is an attack on roman catholicism and more especially on jesuitism the tale if it may be so termed is the attempt to convert two orphan sisters to the romish church partly for the sake of their souls but chifly for the sake of their fortunes to this end the jesuits forge a will and by forcible abduction carry off the two sisters to the continent where they are conveyed to convents first and afterwards to dungeons one charles annandale a protestant of course comes to their rescue releases them from their thraldom exposes the jesuit plots and restores the young ladies to home and fortune such is this absurd and improbable fiction contrived purposely to enable the author to give vent to extremely unchristian emotions and hatreds which he does in the style and manner of a schoolboy  the wifes sister  was mrs hubbacks most successful novel it was remarkable for its vivid portraiture the personages who played their parts in it lived and moved before usrealities and not abstractions this recommended it to favour in spite of many faults of structure and composition the rival suitors preserves the merits and avoids some of the defects of its predecessor it is a better plot and the writing is nore natural and unaffected while the characters are equally of flesh and blood mrs ilubback has profited by practice and experience be ginners are always too anxious about what they think to be style  they are not content to put their thoughts into plain words and so let their style adapt itself to their tlitughts as naturally it would and thus become their own but they must nees go out of the way to look for a dress in which to clothe their ideasand usually they copy the dress of some author already famous and so appear to the world as poor imitators if mrs ilubback continues to improve as she has done she will take a very high place in fiction we can commend tde rival suitors to the libraries it will not sleep upon the shelves  i rmiadar towrs by anthony trolione antlw a i the warden three vols longmian a co bdow the swffe a tale of english country ife three vol smith elder and co the sister of charity by mm chalile two vo bentley mr anthony trollope has found more to tell of his friend the gentle warden of hirams hospital at barchester  of the various members of the wardens family it m be remembered that in the story of the warden mr pr centor harding ready to distrust himself had meekly accepted the decree of  the jupiter  newspaper that be wo an abuse and had resigned his charge of the old men who were maintained in the mismanaged charity thereupon as we now learn his disinterested conduct won for him during a few weeks the plaudits of the press the hospi tat funds were then taken in hand by parliament and the plan of the charity remodelled the post of warden with the salary reduced from eight hundred to four hundred and fifty pounds and with its duties augmented waited to be filled up how it was filled up and before it was filled what wars were waged under the shade of barchester cathedral towers between bishop and bishops wife chaplain archdeacon and all other magnates of the church of bar chester it is the purpose of this sequel to the warden to relate the new story is so far complete in itself that acquaintance with or recollection of its predecessor though desirable is not at al essential the former tale was good but this is better in the warden there were certain characters developed carefully and their creator by the time the book was ended had made the best of them real to his own mind in barchester towers we begin with them as real they speak for themselves and make themselves known promptly to the stranger without need of formal introduction the story however is quite new and most of the characters are new beginning with the new bishop of barchester whose palace is the centre of the plot for with the death of dr grantly the new volumes begin and with the true grief of his son the archdeacon whose energy and love of command mingle a natural desire to succeed to the bishopric with a yet more natural sorrow the ministry is changing when the bishop dies and the archdeacon sure of the support of the outgoing premier telegraphs news of the death to london without loss of time but he is too late the ministry has pased into new hands the archdeacon remains archdeacon to the end and the bishopric is given to dr and mrs proudie people professing liberality unfriendly to cathedral music and to all those highchurch tendencies which would be most to the taste of the chapter of barcbester cathedral they are rigid sabbatarians they meaning the lady who is both the bishop and the bishops wife the ladys pet preacher mr obadiah slope a descendant of the famous dr slop with an e appended to his name for love of euphony is made the bishops chaplain but slope has an ambition of his own to play the bishops part the question of the appointment of the new warden of hirams hospital is soon made the battleground of the contending factions into which the clerical society under the shade of barchester towers becomes quickly divided mr slope struggles with the bishops wife for mastery over the bishop and if the bishop never bad to lay his head upon a pillow with another pillow by the side of it there might be hope for the chaplain he almost succeeds the busy archdeacon cannot soil his dignity by entering personally into a contention with the hateful chaplain who has taken the first opportunity to sound from the cathedral pulpit a loud note of war but he makes use of his patronage to give a barchester living to a distinguished high churchman mr arabin competent to play very good dog to the chaplains cat moreover there is the family of dr stanhope a nonresident prebend who has been brought by the exercise of gentle episcopal pressure to reside for a few months in barebester stanhopes family is cleverly described and his daughter the beauty with the crippled feet who is the siren of the story and lures mr slope into a whirlpool is an odd character most skilfully worked out eleanor the precentors daughter widow of john bold and mother of a precious baby is the heroine of barchester towers with her for her money or her beauty or her worth three persons seek marriage the deans death opens a greater vacancy at barchester before the mighty question of the appointment of a new warden is settled mrs proudie triumphs of course over all meddlers between man and wife our old friend mr harding does not return to hirams hospital as warden and because he does not so much as know what a deans duties are in his determined conscientiousness and honesty be refuses to be made a dean but although not destined to be a deans daughter eleanor becomes a deans wife and the archdeacon attributes much of the good end to which everything is brought to his own activity in waging war against the bishops chaplain we have thus indicated what is the subject of mr trollopes novel of barchater towen but we should add that it does not depend only on story for its interest the careful writing the good humour with a tendency often to be shandean in its expression and the sense and right feeling with which the way is threaded among questions of high church and low church are very noticeable and secure for it unquestionable rank among the few really wellwritten tales that every season furnishes below the surface is another novel dealing with tvxed social questions of the day and giving much prominence to the antagonism between bighchurch and lowchurbh tu it has two hero sir regnald clinton a rocaholic with a lost son whose mother had been entrpped into a madhouse and oliver nugent of the 3aorbound farm a country gentleman by birth yeoden and working farmer by necessity a brave and congoientious man with strong religious feelings evangelical so to their colour he marries a young wife and is troubled first by the phenomenon of a hot dinner on sunday then by a croys over a mantelpiece and evangelical works in a ooalscuttle then by an unaccountable intimacy between his relative sir reginald clinton and his wife whom he refuse to distrust until a parcel found under her bed which really serves in the end to identify clintons lost son in a poor boy whom he has cherished and harboured seems to be demonstrative at once of his wifes unfaithfulness to evangelical religion and to him a story of this kind winds through many interesting details to a happy end the details are chiefly such as bring out views of english ouintry life of abuse in the management of workhouses and lunatic asylums details of life on a farm cottage scenes riots and the calling out of yeomanry with many matters of the kind the novel is one that keeps attention fixed and it is written in a genial often playful tone so that although containing much that is romantic in its incidents there is so strain for effect anywhere visible the temper of the work is throughout excellent from these two novels we pass to yet another in which social questions are discussed the siter of charity by mrs challice this is inferior in execution to the two works we have been discussing but deserves a fair position among novels of the day it deals especially with the hard lot of women who exposed to sore temptation fall into a pitiable sin  bareheskr towns by anthony trollope 3 vols longman  co enerlno the episcopal palace of barchester we find at once that  the warden was an uncompleted story mr harding is again upon the stage with eleanor tom towers and the jupiter there is however a new bishop of the diocese dr proudie successor of dr grantly with mrs proudie of evangelical ambition supplemented by a loosejointed lowchurch chaplain obadiah slope but we again make acquaintance with the loud clearvoiced overbearing archdeacon the tyrant of his father and fatherinlaw who has a theory about oblong diningtables and sets down any obnoxious brother asa beast thus mr trollope baa not to contend against the difficulty of interesting us at the outset in his personages or in his narrative wc are by no means strangers in barchester but he has perhaps to meet a worse difficultythat of prolonging successfully the interest of a tale which seemed some time ago to have been brought to a natural conclusion yet we doubt whether  barchester towers is not a more satisfactory book than  the warden it is certainly more dramatic in its construction the characters are more varied an infusion of romance gives lightness and brightness to the ecclesiastical picture it may still be said indeed that mr trollope has a happier art of drawing sketches from life and striking off pungent sayings hot and vivid upon the page than of elaborating the action of a novel nevertheless the incidents that lead up to the marriage of eleanor if to some extent conventional are yet contrived with skill and will engage the sympathies of other readers than those who appre date the excitement kindled in a cloistered city whenever a bishopric or deanery is vacant parallel with the many wooings and one love of the youthful widow moves the tearful tragedy of obadiah slopetragic in all but its consummation for though oily obadiahbeaten thwarted slapped in the face confuted confounded detected in the act of kissing a married ladys white hands discarded by his querulous patroness and driven with shame from the eden of virtnal episcopacyis comforted at last contracts an offensive and defensive alliance till death them do part with the opulent relic of a sugarrefiner including a house in baker street mounts a metropolitan pulpit and ripens in the golden warmth of patronage until the soul of sweetness enriched within him suffuses his plump rotundity and he ages and mellows and excites the envy of the irreligious and the poor this reverend slope is the low church personified and it is mr trollopes pleasure to mock his ral hair large hands weazel eye and sardonic intonations perhaps some of this sarcastic finish is unfairly applied but we are to take  barchester towers for what it isa satire on men and opinions in a certain corner of the eeclesia and if mr trollope makes low church ridiculous he does not make high church sublime to say the truth the entire establishment as here represented is but a worldly wellspread table with a hundred covers for baked meats purple and amber juices glittering in globes of crystal and all the spiced dainties of samarcand and lebanon to tempt the taste of the shoeless and the scripless no stirpliee1 party in england can complain that though novelist insults it by flattery to go a little further human nature itself has not much excuse for being aggrieved on that scoreunless it be the unpolluted babelike nature of the exwarden who is satisfied that he should not holli his wardenship and that he should not accept a deaneryor the warm honest crystaltransparent nature of eleanor bold who has to rebut the courtesies of obadiah slope with a tingling blow from her ivorywristed handto reject the explanations of bertie stanhope with sweet tears from her eyes and who ultimately takes up a definite position in her mortal state as mrs arabin wife of a blameless doctor and a dean bertie stanhope is a caricature the mundaneminded dr stanhope stands dimly in the background  but the signora herself with her loveliness and her wiles her fascinating insolence and ready points of repartee is brought out with singular force and fancy with respect to the other characters signora neroni last but one of the neros in reality however only a stanhope is the most conspicuous siren among the sinful she has a beautiful face and a perfect bust but has been crippled by the violence of an italian castaway her husband infidel philosophy and sensuous vanity occupy her remaining days and with almost harrowing humour mr trollope describes the victory of her sensuous charms over the conscience the worldly scruples the heart encased in carrotcoloured flesh of chaplain slope as an example of mr trollope s boldest method ot writing we will connect two passages relating to the passionate interview between mr slope and signora neroni  mr slope as was his custom asked for mr stanhope and was told as was the servants custom that the signora was in the drawingroom upstairs heaccordingly went he foundher as he always did lying on her sofa with a french volume before her and a beautiful inlaid writing case open on her table at the moment of his entrance she was in the act of writing ah my friend said she putting ont her left hand to him across her desk  i dkt not expect you today and was this very instant writing to you mr sloe taking the soft fair delicate hand in his and very soft and fair and delicate it waa bowed over it his huge red head and kissed it it was a sight to see a deed to record if the author coidd fitly do it a picture to put on canvas mr slojie was big awkward cumbrous and having his heart in his pursuit was ih at ease the lady was fair as we have said and delicate every thing about her was fine and refined her hand in his looked like a rose lying among carrots and when he kissed it he looked as a cow might do on finding such a flower among her food she was graceful as a couchant goddess and moreover as selfpossessed as venus must have been when courting adonis oh that such grace and such beauty should have condescended to waste itself on such a pursuiti was in the act of writing to you said she but now my scrawl may go into the basketand she raised the sheet of gilded notepaper from off her desk as though to tear it  indeed it shall not said he laying the embargo of half a stone weight of human flesh and blood upon the devoted paper  nothing that you write for my eyes signora shall be so desecrated and he took up the letter put that also among the carrots and fed on it and then proceeded to read it cracious me mr slopesaid she i hope you dont mean to say you keep all the trash i write to you half my tune i dont know what i write and when i do i know it is only fit for the lack of the fire i hope you have not that ugly trick of keeping letters at any rate j dont throw them into a wastepajhr basket if destruction is their doomed lot they perish worthily and are burnt on a pyre as dido was of oki with a steel pen stuck through them of course said she  to make the simile more complete of all the ladies of my acquaintance i think lady dido was the most absurd why did she not do as cleopatra did why ditl she not take out her ships and insist on going with him she could not bear to lose the land she hail got by a swindle and then she could not bear the loss of her lover so shu fell between two stools mr slope whatever you do never mingle love and businessmr slope blushed up to the eyes and over his mottled forehead to though very roots of his hair   a nd so she continued to insult him and he continued to bear itsacrifice the world for love  said she in answer to some renewed vapid declaration of his passion  how often has the same thing been said and how invariably with the same falsehoodfalsehood said he  do you say that i am false to you  do you say that my love is not real v false  of course it is false false as the father of falsehoodif indeed falsehoods need a sire and are not selfbegotten since the world began you are ready to sacrifice the world for love come let us see what you will sacrifice i care nothing for nuptial vows the wretch i think you were kind enough to call him so whom i swore to love and obey is so base that he can only be thought of with repulsive disgust in the council chamber of my heart i have divorced him to me that is as good as though aged lords had gloated for months over the details of his licentious hie i care nothing for what the world can say will you be as frank  will you take me to your home as your wife  will you call me mrs slope before bishop dean and prebendaries the poor tortured wretch stood silent not knowing what to say  what you wont do that tell me then what part of the world is it that you will sacrifice for my charmswere you free to marry i would take you to my house tomorrow and wish no higher privilege  i am free said she almost starting up in her energy for though there was no truth in her pretended regard for her clerical admirer there was a mixture of real feeling in the scorn and satire with which she spoke of love and marriage generally lam free free as the winds come will you take me as i am have your wish sacrifice the world and prove yourself a true manmr slojie should have taken her at her word she would have drawn hack and he would have hod the full advantage of the offer but he did not instead of doing so he stood wrapped in astonishment passing his fingers through his lank red hair and thinking as he stared upon her animated countenance that her wondrous beauty grew more wonderful as he gazed onjjt ha  ha ha she laughed out loud come mr slope dont talk of sacrificing the world again people beyond oneandtwenty should never dream of such a thing you and i if we have the dregs of any love left in us if we have the remnants of a passion remaining in our hearts should husband our resources better we are not in our premilre jeunesse the world is a very nice place your world at any rate is so you have all manner of fat rectories to get and possible bishoprics to enjoy come confess on second thoughts you would not sacrifice such things for the smiles of a lame ladyit was impossible for him to answer this in order to be in any way dignified he felt that he must be silentcome said shedont boody with me dont be angry because i speak out some home truths alas the world as i have found it has taught me bitter truths come tell me that i am forgiven are we not to be friends and she again put out her hand to himhe sat himself down in the chair beside her and took her proffered hand and leaned over herthere said she with her sweetest softest smilea smile to withstand which a man should be cased in triple steel there seal your forgiveness on it anil she raised it towards his face he kissed it again and again and stretched over her as though desirous of extending the charity of his pardon beyond the hand that was offered to him she managed however to check his ardour for one so easily allured as this poor chaplain her hand was surely enough by far the larger proportions of  barchester towers is ecclesiastical in its interest but we have quoted that which will show that mr trollope is not occupied only with the dialogues and dealings of church men or church matters it should be added that tom towers oracle of the jttpikr is an ally of

B2163,['8448312'],  the literary examiner a tale of two cities by charles dickens with ii lustrations by h k browne chapman and hall this novel is remarkable for the rare skill with which all the powers of the authors genius are employed upon the conduct of the story in this respect it is unequalled by any other work from the same hand and is not excelled by any english work of fiction the subtlety with which a private history is associated with a most vivid expression of the spirit of the days of the great french revolution is but a part of its strength in this respect if the whole purpose of the author had been to show how the tempest of those days of terror gathered and broke he could not have filled our hearts more truly than be has done with a sense of its wild pitiless fury but in bis broadest colouring of revolutionary scenes while he gives life to large truths in the story of a nation he is working out closely and thoroughly the skilfully desigued tale of a household the story is all in all yet there is nothing sacrificed to it it is as truly the tale of two cities as it is the touching history of doctor manette and lucie his daughter the pleasure will be great to any thoughtful man who reads the book a second time for the distinct purpose of studying its exquisite construction except mr stryver who is necessary to the full expression of the character of sydney carton and the slightly sketched family of jerry cruncher by the help of which jerry himself is cunningly defined there is not a person in the book who is not an essential portion of the story there is not a scene that does not carry the tale onward not even a paragraph that is not spent on urging forward the strong purpose of the book mr dickens bas obtained his hold upon the public by the energy of an original genius that penetrates with a quick instinct through the outer coverings of life to much of its essential truth even when he has succeeded least the living force of a mind rarely gifted has been strongly felt in this book all his natural powers seem to have been concentrated and directed steadily with a consummate art towards the purpose and the end it had in view there are worse books with plots more highly wrought and exciting deep as is the interest awakened by the tale of two cities in most of mr dickenss works there is more of the quaint humour by which bis reputation was first won here we especially admire the energy of genius the concentration of innumerable subtleties of thought upon a single purpose the abiding force of the impression that is made the skill spent upon the depiction of the mind of doctor j manette during the life following his release from a long  burial rn the bastille it is hardly necessary to illustrate the detail is original in its conception yet it carries with it j the conviction of deep truth we may recall as one example of the manner of the book the art with which the echoes of j the future are suggested by the echoes in doctor manettes j quiet street corner near soho square a little group sits uni der the plane tree in the garden on a sultry summer afternoon  darnay the future husband of lucie the inheritor as it j will appear of the curse upon those by whom the doctor  had been buried alive has by chance struck heavily upon  the hidden chord that yields the keynote of the story the i doctor starts but refers this to one of the slight surprises 1 against which he is not yet proof and shows on the back of bis hand that the first large drops of rain are falling the slow coming of the storm the hurrying of the echoes the i bursting of the tempest blend with the innocent fancy of a 1 girl to suggest the greater storm of wbich the first drops  had then fallen this is artifice but it is the artifice of rn 1 poet and by like touches that often are flashed suddenly uito a word or through a single line the force of poetry is added to the book we are inevitably strengthened by a work hke this in the conviction that mr dickenss place hereafter in our literature will be in the first rank of the poets who have not expressed themselves in verse what intensity of life and truth is in the picture of the dawn of revolution contained in the story of the marquiss journey to his country seat before his assassination saint antoine and its wretchedness have been described red wiue bas been spilled at a wineshop door and gathered from the mud by a gaunt wolfish people with their human sympathies among themselves but grim and ominous with the red stains upon their hands and mouths when they are first shown to us we have seen the silken courtiers to whom these people are as dogs bound by no ties of love among themselves the marquis bas left the reception room of monseigneur devoting him to the devil he has run over a wretched mans child and offers gold for its loss as if it had been but a whelp swinging by the chain under his travelling carriage goes one as a passerby afterwards said  whiter than the miller all covered with dust white as a  spectre tall as a spectre who at the hilltop before the village leaves him to plunge down the steep side the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hilltop that its occupant was steeped ia crimson  it will die out said monsieur the marquis glancing at his hands directly in effect the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment when the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel and the carriage slid down hill with a cinderous smell in a cloud of dust the red glow departed quickly the sun and the marquis going down together there was no glow lefc when the drag was taken off but there remained a broken country bold and open a little village at the bottom of the hill a broad sweep and rise beyond it a churchtower a windmill a forest for the chase and a crag with a fortress on it used as a prison round upon all these darkening objects as the night drew on the marquis looked with the air of one who was coming near home the village had its one poor street with its poor brewery poor tannery poor tavern poor stableyard for relays of posthorses poor fountain all usual poor appointments it had its poor people too all its people were poor and many of them were sitting at their doors shredding spare onions and the like for supper while many were at the fountain washing leaves and grasses and any such small yieldings of the earth that could be eaten expressive signs of what made them poor were not wanting the tax for the state the tax for the church the tax for the lord tax local and tax general were to be paid here and to be paid there according to solemn inscription in the little village until the wonder was that there was any village left unswallowed few children were to be seen and no dogs as to the men and women their choice on earth was slated in the prospectlife on the lowest terms that could sustain it down in the little village under the mill or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag heralded by a courier in advance and by the cracking of his postilions whips which twined snakelike about their head in the evening air as if he came attended by the furies monsieur the marquis drew up in his travelling carriage at the postinghouse gate it was hard by the fountain and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him he looked at them and saw in them without knowing it the slow sure filing down of miseryworn face and figure that was to make the meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years this is bis last converse with the outer world the halfdozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels like sheep the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their skins and bones they had very little else to save or they might not have been so fortunate the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the rise beyond was soon checked hy the steepness of the hill gradually it subsided to a foot pace swinging and lumbering upward among the many sweet scents of a summer night the postilions with a thousand gossamer gnats circling about them in lien of the furies quietly mended the points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses the courier was audible trotting on ahead into the dim distance at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it it was a poor figure in wood done by some inexperienced rustic carver but he had studied the figure from the lifebis own life maybefor it was dreadfolly spare and thin to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been growing worse and was not at its worst a woman was kneeling she turned her head as the carriage came up to her rose quickly and presented herself at the carriage  it is you monseigneur  monseigneur a petition with an exclamation of impatience but with his unchangeable face monseigneur looked out  how then what is it  always petitions  monseigneur for the love of the great god my husband the forester  what of your husband the forester  always

B538,['6662006'],  general literature and art traditions and hearthside stories of west cornwall by w bottrell penzance  w cornish london  trubner ever since the brothers grimm published the german popular stories of the rhineland under the title of kinderwid haustndrchen nursery tales and popular fiction of all ages have been looked on in a new light it was soon seen that much of early mythology was embodied in them the  sleeping beauty for instance can be traced back to the early myth which symbolises spring being awakened by the suns touch doing away the sleep of winter the process by which a myth became a romance can in many instances be investigated wayland smith the vulcan of the north has been degraded into a travelling tinker in sir walter scotts kenilworth the red oxen of the sun that is the clouds round the setting sun who are carried away by the dark power of the west and again rescued from him by the returning lord of light have become in livy real oxen whom cacus carried away from hercules and the local guides in rome showed the cave of cacus with undoubting faithhad not evander shown it to eneas when they took that memorable morning walk up the tiber side so many ages ago  it became therefore a very interesting pursuit to collect these stories in as many distinct localities as possible and this led to another striking discovery it was soon found that tales collected in hindostan or in ireland in scandinavia or in southern europe were in many cases identical not only was the indoeuropean race proved to be one by comparative philology but the same conclusion was arrived at by a comparison of popular fables the proper name of the science has not yet been invented of late however as the investigation has extended this conclusion has become uncertain for some of the popular tales are found to be widely spread among other races not belonging to the indoeuropean stock thus in steeres swahili tales as told by natives of zanzibar just published we find the story which tells how the ox began to drink the water and the water began to put out the fire c in a way not unlike the nursery story we can all remember see a notice of this book in the gottingen gelehrte anzeigen 19th oct 1870 have such stories been borrowed or do they date from a still earlier age and point to a still higher unity of races  the question is not yet settled and much previous sifting of the evidence will be required baring gould has further tried to show what in most of these stories is the original element the  mythradical which is at the root of all the various forms that poetic imagination can give to the tradition the celtic races have done their share of the work campbell has collected the tales of the west highlands carleton and others those of ireland britanny has not been neglected it remained to gather together whatever of the kind might survive in the west of england robert hunt in 1865 published the popular romances of the west of england and mr bottrell who contributed part of hunts materials has here taken as his province the extreme west of cornwall we are somewhat surprised to find how little of the purely celtic element can be found in these two collections the existing traditions should in most cases perhaps be considered anglosaxon it is true that the celtic saints of the middle ages play a part in them and this naturally for while irish saints evangelised the extreme west northeast cornwall was closely connected with the welsh church and the southern coast with that of brittany but these legends of saints are not what we are looking for again there are many stories of giants and that veracious chronicler geoffrey of monmouth already tells us writing in henry ls days how corinaeus who gave name to cornwall beat the local giant in wrestling it is to be feared that corinoran others read cormoran whom jack the giantkiller killed on st michaels mount is no other than corinaeus so unfair is tradition and so often does it invert the parts of the story but mr bottrells first story which tells how tom killed the giant who lived between marazion and st ives though armed only with his axletree and cartwheel does but repeat the wellknown tale of tom hickathrift whose tombstone was to be seen at tylney in norfolk with the axletree and wheel carved on itprobably a cross with the upper part inscribed in a circle a form often found the reader should refer to the amusing article in the quarterly for january 1819 antiquities of nursery literature it is curious to see how legend localises itself here and there the celts probably when flying before the english took with them the legend of arthur and gave it a local habitation in each of their places of refuge there are excellent reasons for placing king arthurs court in scotland says a modern antiquary but so there are for placing it in wales and in cornwall and any one travelling in  king arthurs land in brittany had better not express an opinion in favour of any other locality but although tintagel has undoubted claims to arthur and it is certain that he is yet alive under the form of a raven or perhaps of a chough yet nothing of him survives in cornish tradition and the cornish antiquaries can only mournfully point to the existing female name jenefer as a reminiscence of guenevere just as they quote the not uncommon name hannibal to prove that the phoenicians once traded in the land but the change of the early celtic proper names itself shows how much devonshire and cornwall were saxonised after athelstans conquest in the remarkable list of manumissions in the bodmin gospels dating from the century previous to the norman conquest we find numberless celtic names such as ourdylyc golden robe arganteilin  silver forehead and mens names like grifiuth modred bleidiud which at once remind us of welsh but the famous  tre pol pen names are mostly of very late date comparatively being names of places adopted by the leading families the celtic language lasted practically to the reformation but even then the miracleplays acted at the monastery of glasney near penryn had to be translated into english and the active mining and fishing population soon lost the old traditions what remained was chiefly superstitions as to witches mermaids fairies warnings ghosts and a glance at mr bottrells book will show the comparatively modern character of much which it contains how the spaniards landed in elizabeths reign in mounts bay how the sallee rovers were a terror to the same coast the doings of the smugglers various love stories one of them has a  spirit ride like that in burgers ballad these make up the chief part of the book many of the stories reflect the wild character of the country the desolate moors and the lonely hamlets each in its own sheltered valley opening out to the sea have their appropriate legends the miner can distinguish unearthly sounds which tell that the lode of metal is near at hand and the seamen hear voices from the spectre ship summoning the dying wrecker to his doom the author has inserted too much local topography to be interesting to other than the natives of penwith and in fact the stories are arranged as they relate to various localities proceeding from hayle westward he gives however a very curious account of the semiprofessional drolltellers who were formerly welcomed at all firesides and feasts for their recitals of the old ballads and stories of which they knew so many and of which their audience rarely tired the variations in the mode of telling the same stories some of which occur in ballad form are characteristic the names and localities are varied to suit the district and the hearers and perhaps the minstrels who sung the tale of troy divine in the halls of the ionian chieftains did no otherwise in any case these stories illustrate the social life of our own immediate ancestors in the time when reading had not taken the place of recitation and public interests were not so absorbing as personal talk and home side stones c w boase,britain

grounds indeplently of the mythological and philological interest attached to the dear existence of these stones this collection is valuable for another reason in it is preserved authentic remnants of pure scotch gaelic in the spoken lic as it flow exists there are three elements the irish gaelic of the chi bithe printed religious gaelic of later times which dates after he f  anntion ad the pure scotch gaelic of the morven and tine weurchan districts of ar leshire and of the western islands which b lenained uncorrupted by the english idioms that exist in perthshire d the lrishisns elsewhere the pure vernacular language is more perfectly werved in legendary tales and in poetry orally handed down than in written rw into which foreign idioms must gradually creep hence the value of p cl pupular ales as these and of such poetry as that of the uncultivated d3 published recently in the book of the dean of lismore it is another qesti how far it is desirable to foster the gaelic language or to let it die vttif it is to be preserved there can be no doubt on this point that it ought tobe preserved as far as possible in its original purity in these ballads nd stories handed down from generation to generation by oral tradition perfection of the original dialect is a necessary ingredient mir campbell beu collected these tales from the mouths of the speakers and thus he has done good service in preserving his favourite language pure and uncorrupted on these various grounds there can be but one verdict upon the three first lous of mr campbells book every one must thank him for his work and congratulite him upon the result of his undertaking it is a disagreeable task to find fault with what has given us so much pleasure but it is the duty of the reviewer to state his conviction honestly and it is more satisfactory for the author to see such a conviction expressed h toreadso many lines of undiscriminating laudation miscalled criticism the publication of the fourth volume is to be regretted twothirds of this rolume are occupied by the resuscitation of the ossianic controversy most people considered that it was buried and left to the oblivion of its grave it was not beautiful in its life in its resurrection it is not more imposing mr campbell raises the dead body but he fails to galvanise it into existence not one man in a hundred who will read his book can now feel the smallest interest in that exhausted controversy and if any interest was excited it would not be satisfied with the manner in which mr campbell reopens the discussion he is indeed an easy and agreeable controversialist neither flippant nor sarcastic but pleasant bantering and on this subject sensible but he is unsatisfactory he does not grasp the question thoroughly or handle it vigorously he is sadly inconsequent and inconsistent he begins with clearness and logical precision but soon falls away into digression and rambling desultory writing the reader is left much where he was he closes th book and has learned nothing similar accusations must be brought against mir campbells mythological fragments and his plea for gaelic there is throughout both these portions of his book a want of scholarlike thoroughness the argumentation is feeble sometimes frivolous and the whole discussion is pervaded by a superficiality that is the reverse of satisfactorv the following passage will show that this accusation is well founded if it was important for the interests of the state to found a chair of sanscrit which nobody speaks surely there ought to be some means of learning gaelic devised for england where a large section of the people speak the language sti this is unworthy of mr campbell on the same principle he would abolish all the chairs of latin and greek in the different universities and would establish in their place professorships of the language of the japanese and the maories it is of a piece with these two passages which at best are trifling and superficial iny one who knows gaelic can easily put a meaning on numbers of italian ames for example monte soracte monadh sorachan mountain peak or hi1lo is a small peaked mountain standing alone near rome monte afppennino mlonadh na beinne the mountain tract of the hill country is at last as descriptive in gaelic as italian and the sounds are very like still  english is a  bar to the advancement of proprietors if they cannot speak those who pay their rents and it is the want of english not the pos ion of gaelic which retards the advance of those who seek employment ere english is spoken so highland proprietors should learn gaelic and teach rlish gaelic is no bar to advancement it did not clog the steps of the lord ricegeneral or his brother the ambassador or of the vicechancellor or of us of other men of mark whose learning included gaelic it has not ighed in my slower race through life and it gave me a stock of sounds which in other languages and which an english tongue can rarely pronounce wt do not fec fn controvert the position advanced in this last passage fallacy implied in the use of the word  advancement  must be plain to r campbell himself when a man of mr campbells ability allows hims to write on a great question in this very inefficient manner his best iise is that his celtic proclivities at times get the better of his reason in pa for gaelic and in his idealisation of the highland costume on which etio we lo not propose to enter his celticism becomes ungovernable otally forg ets his acceptation and assertion of the aryan theory of lan and instead of looking upon gaelic as an offshoot of aryan he appears consider aryan as an offshoot of gaelic he gets upon his hobby and it away with hiii it is as uncontrollable as jains niare to whom the sea landare all one it gives its front to the sea and its back to the  and son carries him beyond his depth and leaves him hopelessly at it i a pity that this volume has been published in it mr campbell up then questions which he ought either to have left untouched or to worked out with much more thorough elaboration any one who has the masterly dissertation on subjects similar to those here treated at the ecftcent of the dean of lismores book by mnr w f skene will rle the difference between the vigorous writing and forcible reoning e ane and the colloquial ineffectivenems of the other  popular tales of the west hiejhlands orally collected with a translation bv j f campbell vols iii and iv edmonston  douglas we have two more volumes of mr campbells contributions to the existing mass of celtic literature they will be perused perhaps with some disappointment by those who received with alacrity and pleasure his former two volumes and readily appreciated the hearty nationality and good humour of the collector it is however in the nature of things that a second gleaning should not offer such rich results as the first the first of these new volumes contains mythological tales fables and ossianic ballads and the last is a volume of dissertations by mr campbell on the ossianic controversy gaelic poetry british traditions highland dress ornaments and mythology of the ossianic portion a good deal of the interest has been forestalled by the recent publication of the dean of lismores book and other ossianic publications nevertheless such versions as mr campbell has collected will be of use to the celtic scholar the compiler however entertains the ambition of setting the ossianic controversy at rest once and for ever but in this he mistakes his capabilities  as a collector he has done good service but he has too little of the critical faculty to render his opinions of much value most highland gentlemen imagine that nobody but a highlander is competent to pass judgement on their literature or on the genuineness of a certain portion of it but this ian entire mistake the mere possession of a knowledge of highland gaelic is of little moment for the purpose in view with whatever facility a man may speak gaelic that in itself is no evidence of his capacity to pass judgement on the genuineness of a single ossianic poem this will be apparent to any one who considers how few englishmen well read in english literature would be competent to pronounce a verdict on any newlydiscovered poem said to be by gower or chaucer how many englishmen who have not made such things their study are there at the present day who would discover rowleys poems to be forgeries from a mere inspection of their diction  indeed the general critic unacquainted with gaelic who has compared the poetic evolutions of thought and sentiment in other languages ii far more likely to come to a right conclusion i such matters than the mere speaker of gaelic but the critic av ho is now required to take th matter in hand is the scientific philologist who shall be neither a scotchman an irishman a welshman nor a breton at least in feeling and prejudice but a celt one who shall take up th whole of the literature of the celtic races and edit their legendary and traditional relics with true impartiality philosophic insight scrupu lous comparison and broadness of view suojb an investigation would clear up much that clark and perplexing in the history of one of the most interesting of the races in these islands among the celtic races none deserve moiecareful consideration for their literature thao the welsh as m renan himself a breton has shown with great ability in his essay  sur la poesy celtique and his countryman m hersart de villemarque also has declared the same thing in the preface to his translation of the poemes des bardes bretons published in paris in 1850 perhaps m renan with his vast philological learning and philosophic breadth of mind is the only maa of the day capable of embracing the whole range of celtic literature and marshalling the literary treasures of its various dialects in due order and showing the affinities which subsist between the different legends in the different countries of all the labourers in the field of celtic antiquities who have hitherto done good service none deserves more honourable remembrance than owen jones the poor peasant of myvyr who unassisted by patronage devoted his life to the preservation of the literature of his country he came up t london a poor boy engaged as a clerk in somecity establishment and after forty years f selfdenial with the accumulations of his hard won scanty earnings published the myvyrian archaeology at his own cost in 1801 and 1807 and it is from this repertory that sharon turner was enabled to draw his welsh legends and bardic poems in the first volume of his history where they first attracted the attention of m villemarque it was a work which might havebeen done by a king an institution or a society ofthe noble and the learned but it was accomplished and scrupulously accomplished by a poor welsh peasant nor must we forget the great service rendered to the literature of her country by lady charlotte guest whose three splendid volumes of the mabinogion with their fine paper type and steel engravings form a direct contrast in costliness of production tethe three modest and closelyprinted quartos cf poor owen jones the mabinogion is however also an invaluable treasure and there are the favourite topics of the most celebrated troubadours of mediaeval europe to be found in all their primitive beauty and simplicity for the stories of arthur aud guinevere of geraint nnd the rest of the knights of the round table of the famous  parceval le gallois of the  chevalier au lionall these are pure welsh li breton ont fait les lats says a poetess of the thirteenth century andy without any disparagement to sir thomas mallory or mr tennyson few can have any notiaia of the primitive beauty of these old tales till they read them in  the mabinogion it is curious however that the mabinogion clas of story seems to have no points of contact with taliesin and the bardic literature yet the welsh popular tales have certain undoubted analogies with the gaelic legends arthur and guinevere for example have a certain likeness to finn or fion and grainne his wife and lancelot and diarmaid have a resemblance for in both canes the beautiful warrior is the cause of the infidelity of the queen and in both eases he is more tempted than tempting a resemblance has also been attempted to be traced between oisein or ossian and taliesin hut on this as on many other points criticism will suspend its opinion till philology has done it work with more scrupulous severity  the literary iaier popular tales of the west highlands orally collected i with a translation by j f campbell two volumes edinburgh edmonston and douglas a better book of its kind than this no country possesses dr dasents norse tales are of high value and the relation of scandinavian mythology or legend to our own folk lore as well as to the traditions of the east is very close but gaelic of the british islands interests us even more than the traditions of the norse and mr campbell while he takes in his work as a collector all the interest of a philologist and shows a complete sense of the value of literal accuracy in placing the old popular tales of the west highland gaels within reach of all students of literature proves himself by the manner of his introduction to be not only a scholar but a man of genius his vi porous and graphic english and his curious felicity of illustration are of a sort very seldom to be met with in asciation with the scholarly exactitude for which these tolumes are conspicuous it is a very great addition to the value of the work that not only are the stories taken in gaelic from the lips of west highlanders collated compared and when proved by the form of their frequent occurrence to be true traditions of the gael set down in the closest of translations all the closer for being also nervous english but the gaelic itself has been taken down and printed hector urquhart gamekeeper at ardkinglas on loch fyne and hector maclean schoolmaster at ballygrant in islay have been mr campbells chief helpers in this part of his work a body of gaelic literature is thus taken from the lips of the people and fixed before the ministers and schoolmasters shall have silenced the last reciters of tradition that has lived through generation after generation the old days of telling tales or sgeulachd by the highland fireside are even now passing away as hector urquhart depoes i knew an old tailor who used to ted a new tale every night during his stay in the village and another an old shoemaker who with ilis large stock of stories about ghosts and fairies used to frighten us so much that we scarcely dared pass the neighbouring churchyard on our way home it was also the custom when an aodia or stranger cele brated for his store of tales came on a visit to the village for us young and old to make a rush to the house where he passed the night and choom our seats some on beds some on forms and others on three iokestd i 5insulto gh now ta  ju u i ha o whn a rfaed acor ca om to persan in the gtheave the goodman 1 th e uually

riddles in the solving of which all zn the hoos had to tax their ingenuity if one of the party put a riddle which asnot osved thatnight he went home with the title of king of riddles besides this there was usually in such gatherings a discussion about the fei which comes from fantamdh giant the fantaibh were a body of men who volunteered to defend their country from the invasions and inroads of the danes and norwegians or loclusia fiu who was always called king of the fein was the strongest man amongst them and no person was admitted into the company who was les in height than he however much taller i remember the old black shoemaker telling us one night that fiunk had a tooth which he consulted as an oracle upon all important occasions he had but to touch this tooth and whatever he wanted to know was at once revealed to him the above is all i can at present readily call to mind of the way in which the evenings were spent in the highlands thirty or forty years ago the minister came to the village in 1830 and the schoolmaster 1 soon followed who put a stop in our village to such gatherings and in their place we were supplied with heavier tasks than listening to the old shoemakers fairy tales from that period till i collected the few in this collection i have not heard a tale recited on going to visit my friends last summer i expected that i would get some old tales among them but i found that the most of the old men who used to relate them in my young days had died and the few who were then alive of them were so old that they bad lost their memories so that i only got but a trifle to what i expected it was doing no small service to literature to save these tales from perishing giving them to the english student in his own language to the gael and the student of gaelic in the exact words of the teller with the tellers name and habitat assigned to every one as precisely as a botanist would name the habitat of any plant in his collection mr ijrquhart in the letter we have quoted speaks of tales of the fein or fenii the first of our volunteers the irish and scotch gaels have many of these legends in common for all tradition bears witness to the close association in old timesin the third century if we may accept the date commonly assigned to fionnbetween ireland and the western isles of scotland and that mainland of alban the alpland or highland from which we have derived the name of albion the fein were the first of british volunteers sworn say the irish legends to defend their shores against invasion and each bound to fight nine men of any other nation who should challenge them their marvellous qualifications have been often told oisin ossian the son of fionn commanded the more ambitious of the two clans into which it split and he according to the book of hoath was sole survivor from the battle of gabhra in the year 296 he could live therefore to have his dialogue with st patrick and to be unwillingly converted by the saint quite apart from the extinct controversy about macphersons ossianie work which is now generally admitted to have been a sentimental rendering of gaelic traditions into a form suited to the english humour of his day all that can now be collected of traditions of the fein has a strong interest three years ago a weak effort was made by mr j h simpson in poems of oiain bard of erin to present to the public these traditions from the irish side his book included six or eight fenian traditions orally collected from among the mayo peasantry and incomplete and unsatisfactory as it was it has in the absence of a better certain literary value we trust that mr campbells example will now stimulate some irish scholar to do for the gaels of his own island what has been done so thoroughly for those of the western highlands giving as mr campbell has given precise authority for all that he prints and the gaelic of the storyteller as well as his own translation mr campbell himself with curiosity strongly excited and much baulked during a visit to the isle of man asks for a manx man who will fix also the legends of the manx gaels before in these days of schoolmasters who consider it their duty to discountenance all oldwives tales the oral literature that he compares aptly to the driftwood floated from a faroff world shall have been utterly destroyed we may question the speculation that can find analogies between the fairies and the lapps that will trace celtic fairy legends back to the supposed tatar tribes thinly spread over europe before the days of the great halfl historical invasions of cimmerians and goths those tribes that according to professor worsaae left their traces in the coast barrows containing only tools and weapons of shaped stone pass for the aborigines of europe who are represented in the south by the basques and in the north by the finns esths and lapps but there is ground even for that speculation which appears so fanciful and it is not so hostile as at first sight it may appear to another speculation that connects the fairy with the peri however that may be it is on this earliest period of european history that we may expect light to be thrown by an extended study of the popular traditions of all nations there can be no doubt also that this is the right time of year for a profound speculation on the fairies mr campbell who has himself spoken gaelic from his childhood went systematically upon storyhunting tours as other men engaged by other sciences set out upon botanical or geological excursions his specimens were of a kind to be got only by the skilful thus we are told how he went at easter to a highland district near the lowlands where a gamekeeper bad marked down a lot of taletellers and i was soon convinced that there was plenty of game though bard to get the difficulty may be worth some explanation for it exists elsewhere and bears on the collectior of tales everywhere highland peasants and fishermen especially those dwelling near the lowlands are shy and proud and even more peculiarly sensitive to ridicule than peasts elsewhere mauy bawc a lurking belief in the truth of the sioies whi they tell man a 3 eated castlatom tha wi ym with a better educaon will la1g at the bliet northwest the stay an the nu raw and his landuage f he should bwei enough to ventin on english and betroa his knowledge of seultachd and his creed e cannot im n that any on out of his owf clan am possibly be amused by his fivolous p sim no one ever has hitherto he sees every year a summer flood of tourists of all a ou ring through his loa sandglens but he knows as little of them as they know of him the shoal of herrings that enter loch syne know as much of the dundoer on the hialssde a londoners and highland peasants know of each other each gets an occaioial peep at the other as the deer may see the herrings capering on the locheach affeeb the other slowly but surely as the herrings do drive away the wild deer by attracting men to catch them but the want of a common language here as elsewhere keeps highlands and lowlands celt and saxon as clearly eparate as oil and water in the ame glass the first step then towards the acquisition of a story is to establish confidence it may be that the wouldbe collector sees before him a strapping lad dressed in the garb of a west country fishermana rough blue bonnet jacket and trousers he steps out and ranges up alongside the highlander glances from under his busby eyebrows and sees with his sharp grey eyes that the new comer is a stranger he looks rather like a saxon highland curiosity is strong and he longs to ask whence he comes but politeness is stronger and it would be uncivil to begin questioning at once so with a nervous kick of one foot and a quick shy glance the fisherman jerks out  its a fine day  tha n latha briagh  the day is fine replies the stranger and as he speaks the whole face and manner of his companion change as if by magic doubt and hesitation suspicion and curiosity become simple wonder his eyes and his heart open wide at the sound of his native tongue and he exclaims you have gaelic  you will take my excuse by your leave but what part of the gaeldom are you from  and then having found out all that is to be discovered the ice being broken and confidence established it oozes out gradually that the fisherman knows a story and after much persuasion he tells it while he rows the gentleman who can talk gaelic across a high land loch at parting he adds that he has only told it to please a  gael and that he would not have said one word to a gall stranger but the man who is fluent in his boat is shy and awkward when set down to repeat his story for transcribing and it is only when set with one of his neighbours whom he knows that his story is got on paper or it may be an old dame in a tall white mutch with a broad black silk band a red cloak and clean white apron she is seventy and can walk ten miles she has known all the neighbouring families for generations if you can claim cousinship with any she is your friend but she will praise the ancestors and tell of the adventures of bob roy the gregoracl the last of the freebooters but mary can you say murachag and mionachag huch my dear that is an ursgeul that is nonsense the good being bless you i knew your grandmother etc etc so one must rest contented with the fact that old mary knows one tale and probably many more which a weeks persuasion might perhaps extract and so forth the tales when got are often rude but sometimes excellent even to the spoilt modem taste the riddles in which celts delighted as much as the early anglosaxons are singularly pointless but some of the fables are as neat as man can wish nothing for example can be better than the fable of the fox who sat on his tail for a gossip with the cock in the farmyard and asked him how many tricks did your  mother teach you    three he said  how many have you been taughttwo or three thousand i know one that is capital i can shut my left eye and scream so as to wake a parish i can do that said the cock so he shut his left eye and began to crow with all his might the fox on the blind side of him snapped him up and was running away when the farmers wife looking out of doors cried iheigh fox stop that is  my cock tell herthe cocks yours whispered the victim so the fox opening his mouth cried to the dame the cock is mine  then it was his no longer out of a tolerably thorough study of the folk lore of all nations that has based on works like this but to which few so good as this are likely to contribute a most interesting and important book has to be written we have in these tales variations upon bluebeard and upon known stories of almost every land thus the incident in the battle of the birds of the giants beautiful daughter hid in a tree top over a well we read last with all its details as an incident in one of jacob ayrers plays a german translation of the english play from which shakespeare may have taken the first notion of the tempest  popular tales of the west highlasdst  the northwestern perts of scotland says an old dutch geographer are inhabited by irishmen the southeastern parts by englishmen this distinction one of the highest importance when these words were written is now of little practical value and is hence often overlooked intercourse between the two races to which he refrrs having almost obliterated the differences between them it must be clearly apprehended however by any one who would understand aright the history of scotland or the subjects discussed in the learned and able introduction to these volumes the scottish lowlands densely peopled by an english population were at all times permeable to the influences acting upon the civilised countries of europe every new continental school of philosophy or literature sent a wave of thought or feeling over this island which only broke when it reached the welldefined frontier of the highlands the old scottish knights who threw off the yoke of the english kings were closely connected with france and through france with all the latin countries of southern europe some of them indeed had been educated in the schools of paxis need we feel surprised then to hear that robert brace when he osted weary and travelstained by loch lomond side under the birch and the rowan trees with his mailclad followers withthomas randolph and hugh de ia hay and good sir david de berkelay read to cheer their spirits and wile away the time tales of gallantry and prowess from the pages of an old french romance a generation later and the first great poem in the english tongue recorded the exploits of the good king and his companions and told by its references to the nitingale and its use of the commonplaces of romance how much the literature of scotland had been influenced by the troveres and the troubadours the reformation burst forth in germany and forthwith appeared the evidence of a close intercourse between scotland and the low countries before the storm had reached the frontier of france the northern parliament had passed an act to prohibit  skippers  from introducing heretical books from the continent and friars were denouncing from the market places as familiar namesmartin luther that saw loon black bullinger and melanctoon a ery different state of things prevailed in the highlands there the people spoke a language unintelligible to the english of the lowlands their flinty hills attracted no foreign priesthood their old celtic institutions repelled feudalism no norman aristocracy introduced into the land the study of southern romance no highland students rose to fame at pari or padua the irishry or selvages of the highlands lived apart altogether from the traditions of the great continental world with ireland however the connexion of the highlands was intimate just as the english dialects of the people melt into each other between london and aberdeen the dialects of the erse pass gradually into each other between cork and inverness the people of the highlands ireland and the isle of man formed indeed one people the early history of the erse race is ill undertood six centuries before christ they are supposed to have reached the british islands already occupied by the welsh or british races and to have settled in ireland and northern scotland their oldest traditions throw little light however on this event they record the exploits of the brave tribes of the feene and more especially of fin mac coul thegreat hero of the race it is frm one of his epithets  miledh the warrior that the monkish chroniclers devised the story of milesius the word seene being after a similar fashion perverted into phamician the poems which record the exploits of the seene bore in some respects the same relation to the erse people that the homeric poems bore to the greeks many ments of them are yet preserved by oral tradition some have been committed to writing the gaelic poems of ossian which were formed of passae from poems of the feene have been proved to be authentic and he who now calls their genninenes in question

the persons from whom they have been gathered are housemaids nurses and old women drovers fishermen blind fiddlers and tinkers tailors and shoemak are however the principal tribuators the reason is

gatherings the sgeulachd have been set down just as they were told by mr campbell he well remarking that it would be as absurd to tamper with such relics as to gild an old copper coin or to paint the fossil bones of an ichthyosaurus one of the most striking and characteristic of these highland tales is that of i the southeast maiden told by an old fishean in the hebrides it is a tale to be found in all the european langaages it resembles an irish  fenian story taken from a very old ms there is something much akin to it in sanscrit it is a version of shortshaiks in the norse tales of dasent grimms german tales contain it its incidents appear in the classical stories of  perseus and an dromeda and hercules and hesione it is in the italian of strapanola as fortunio and in the french of the6 cabinet des fees it is in every lan guage in europe as st george and the dragon it is the story of sheep shanks  in a ms collection of lowland scotch tales made by mr peter buchan in 1847

to say he hag  set down stories told him by the egyptian priests which reappear in the high land tales k in the introduction to which we have already referred mr campbell endeavours to ascertain the date of the tales he has recorded and to ascertain whether his countrymen have derived them from other european nations or have inherited i them from old primaeval times to some it may be difficult at first eight to under stand how this is possiblean illustration may serve to explain it when an old wall was disinterred some years ago in paris a dispute arose as to its age some said it was roman others that it was medkeval  let us pull down one square ard of it said an antiquary  and i will be bound to say that you will find precise evidence of its date the wall was dragged down and in the very heart of it there was found an onamnt of the renaissance the building was proved to belong to a late period in modern history mr campbell has subjected these tales to a somewhat similar testcomparbng them with other stories to ascertain if they contain incidents which indicate the source by which they have head this island examined in this way he thinks that they have not been rived through the same channels as the old fairy tales but like the breton irman and norse tales recently published in truth ae directly derived from people in a very primitive stage of civilization here are a few of the consi rations which lead to this conclusion the hero often saves many maidens and weds them all this implies a state society at the period of their importation among the irish people

popular tales that combs were but those who have travelled among halfcivilized people understand what is meant when the knight lays his head on the ladys knee and she dresses his hair the giants may

part of the harm though of course it is an extrinsic one in the stories whlicih mr camnphell has collected for tile first time lies in thle fiamiliarity ever and anon of the incidents and characters

unlettered and unreading speaking anl hearing only its native ralic sometimes mr campbell has to seek a parallel in a novel of boccaccio or in an episode of a sanscrit epic for a passage in the

the family which plhiloloists used to call the indogermanic the philological proof is an excellent ind irrefragable one but this irawn fron the similarity ot or recurrence of incidents in tales popular from the himalayas to the hebrides is one of the pleasantest and most interesting that we know lwe think however that mr campbell has somewhat exaggerated the historical value of these stories

B4767,"['2434491', '6850788']",  sons and lovers by d h lawrence duckworth and co 6s a strange book this full of haunting memories which perhaps if not entirely successful must yet be welcomed as an achievement it was evident from the authors first book the white peacock that here was a writer who not only had something to say but who was gifted with an unusual sensitiveness and receptiveness of sympathy and observation sons and lovers confirms the impression it is full of good things full of charm full of truthful delineations of character if a little rambling a little overlong a little meticulous in unnecessary detail there is a sentence in the book which would seem rather apposite in these days in a conversation between the man and the woman he loves she says so a man can give au himself to a work whereas a woman can only give the unimportant part of herself if it is true she says it is a great shame the book in a way is built round that theme the woman whom the man loves and who passionately loves him he does not marry when finally he asks her whether she will have him to marry and she asks him whether he really wants to he replies not much it is the end the work of life to him is more than its illusions it is in little flashes like this that lawrence excels but the book has much more in it than this the descriptions of mining life the study of the rough rather sodden father and that of the refined and sensitive mother above her station in life is a remarkable piece of writing all through the characters are most carefully thought out and distinctively edged in so much so that one has to read the book very carefully to grasp its charm and truthfulness which is one of the great qualities of mr lawrences work then again there is great beauty of expression a wonderful sympathy with nature and flowers and the hidden springs of humanity and a fine understanding of the lives of these mining people he depicts this is certainly a book which stands out far above the ordinary novel it brings the authors reputation very high it makes one think that mr lawrence is going to be a great writer as it is of all the young writers he is quite the most promising  i sons and lovers by d h lawrence duck worth and co 6s in this book mr lawrence has given us a very curious study and at the same time one that is far from pleasant we are introduced at the outset to mrs morel as a central figure and through her are made to realise the inner life of her son paul who later on takes the centre of the stage and struts uglily in company with two women between whom he wavers he is unable to love either and apparently the only love of which he is capable is that for his mother for her death leaves him derelict these are humble people for pauls father was a collier and paul himself was a clerk in a surgical appliance factory though he evinced a capacity for the arts in that he painted at times the author renders these things with such clearness that we believe in them and feel the characters of the book as real persons we feel too that mr lawrence strips everything naked there is no delicacy nor reticence about his work but he probes and searches and analyses in ruthless surgical fashion finding never a bit of soul but sense and passion and brutality and cruelty evidently he has found life a very bitter ugly thing with no joy in it nor any warmth but the warmth of lust his people are animalshighly developed it is trueand very fine mentally but throughout all the book there is no glimpse of spiritpaul and the circle of people among whom he moves live by sense and sense alone the only fine quality in the work is mother love the rest is naked ugliness on the whole it is a very fine study of the cruelty of life and very depressing in its effect,britain

B2597,"['8592699', '6672445']",  litetature daniel deronda daniel deronda by george eliot london w blackwood and sons we know not which to admire most in  daniel deronda the profound moral earnestness which could create two such characters as gwendolen and daniel deronda or the giggling flippancy wbich could place at derondas wedding feast  the entire cohen family with the one exception of though baby who carried on her teething intelligently at home in none of george eliots novels have her sense of humour and her conviction of the supreme duty of earnestness come so flagrantly into conflict as in the present one cannot lay down though last volume of  daniel deronda without some tribute of astonishment at though vast range of the authors powers it is possible to regard her last novel either as a sermon in disguise or as an impartial picture of existing phases of english societya great work of course in either view on the whole perhaps ones impression is that in  daniel deronda george eliot is a preacher and teacher in the first place and a novelist in the second the purely pictorial purpose in this as in others of her novels is subordinate to the ethical in  daniel deronda strange as it may seem in the production of such a humorist the dominant motive as revealed in the last volume of the work is a protest against the vanity and frivolity of the time in its last pages instead of an invitation to esthetic or humorous reverie we seem to find a trumpetcall to young men and maidensto young men to take example by the noble gravity of daniel deronda and to maidens to take warning by the frivolity of gwendolen harleth and its tragic consequences a protest against low sordid personal aims an incentive to a higher worthier more aspiring and humane life such would seem to be the ruling intention of daniel deronda wrought subtly into a humorous picture of things as they are which may satisfy though flaunting gallio to whom the enthusiasm of humanity is merely one among its many diverse qualities the earlier volumes of the work gave little hint of though elevated strain which predominates in the later volumes and the full earnestness of the authors purpose was not certain till the very last and even then it is open to argument for the subtle mind this says much for though success with which george eliot can subdue herself into the attitude of dramatic impartiality even while she retains as a governing idea in her work that it should as a whole point somewhere teach some lesson have some aspiration towards the infinite all through the skilful dissection of gwendolens heartlessness which seems to leave not a nook or corner in ber being unsearched and unexhibited exposing the most secret and unacknowledged of her little vanities we are left to speculate as we may upon the phenomenon we feel as if we were present at a lecture in social pathology by a most skilful professor of the social microscope this creature a product of the generation is dissected before us and put piece by piece under the glass wo look on peep in our turn through the instrument and admire the skill of the anatomist as she flourishes her keen knife whether the structure is a diseased or a healthy structure professor eliot does not say till she has anatomised it to its minutest filaments but having completed her pathological lecture she next proceeds to indicate what an abominable perversion of nature this creature is and how it is possible to reform it into the likeness of something nobler several times in the course of the lecture she has drawn marked attention to a certain rudimentary part of the creature an undeveloped organ  note this i will return to it another time in though course of though exposition we have become deeply interested in this organ and byandby our curiosity is gratified we aro shown how the whole nature has been perverted by the starvation of this part and by what means it is possible to nourish it till it attains its proper strength and restore the natural balance of the system it seems as if george eliot had feared lest the baser tendencies of the age should take heart and flourish from the discomfiture of the nnworldly aspirations of dorothea and the ridiculous collapse of the ambitions of casaubon and had resolved to concoct an antidote in the careers of gwendolen and mordecai to show the danger which sometimes attends calculating selfishness and lightheaded conceit and the sweet reward which sometimes waits npon disinterested enthusiasm there must be hundreds of girls more or less like gwendolen among george eliots readers and the exposure of her shallow frivolous aims is meant to make them ashamed of themselves and to lift them into a higher conception of their duties and destinies perhaps if george eliot had thought fit to make this lesson to the girls of the period more than a gentle hint she ought to have increased gwendolens punishment for after all gwendolen comes very comfortably out of her troubles being left with two thousand ayear and a developed conscience and free to marry if she chooses a hearty handsome young cousin whose addresses she had slighted in her unregenerate days but then gwendolens crime after all was girlish giddiness and thoughtlessness and the justice of the circulating library is completely satisfied if her heart is softened and her wicked husband is drowned if grandcourt had turned np again or if he had left her as poor as she was when she came to him her fate would perhaps have been a moro terrible warning but it would have been too miserable besides that if sho had been left in physical misery we could not have had though same assurance of the reality of her moral regeneration if gwendolen is a warning to the girl of the period daniel deronda is equally an example to the young man of though period in the gravity and loftiness of his aims our flippant youth would probably call him a visionary or a prig and would jeer at his relations with gwendolen as impossible  and their judgement of his impossibility would probably be right if he were meant as a type of our own race his grave meditative nature his profound composure and selfcontrol his steady persistent passion are eminently hebraic and are meant to be so he is an illustration of an element in our complex insular life that is not of indigenous origin it is an influence too to which in our earnest moments we are not incapable of yielding ourselves and with the healthiest of results there is a something in it also which is repellent to the average common sense of englishmen that something is well expressed by sir hugo mullinger an admirably drawn type of the cultivated english squire i have long expected something remarkable from you dan  but for gods sake dont go into any eccentricities i can tolerate any mans difference of opinion hut let him tell it me without getting himself up as a lunatic at this stago of though world if a man wants to be tikn seriously ho must keep clear of melodrama dont misunderstand mo i am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account i only think you might easily bo led arm in ann with a lunatic especially if he wanted defending you have a passion for people who arc pelted dan im sorry for them too but so far as company goes its a kid ground of selection still sir hugo does not quarrel with daniel deronda for his innacy ho respects his earnestness and here again he is typical of his countrymen by far the most wonderful part of  daniel deronda its chief claim to admiration as an achievement is its picture of the jews its exemplification and analysis of different forms of jewish life some of them not so estimable as deronda and mordecai we have spoken of the cohen family in noticing previous numbers of the work in the last volume there is a notable addition to the gallery in thc portrait of lapidoth mirahs father who verities her presentiments by suddenly arresting her one clay in the street as she is walking homo from giving some musiclessons ho is one of the most perfectly drawn and lifelike figures in thc book who has not seen him with his ineffaceable air of jauntiness duo to his small hands and feet and the bushy locks that escape from under his hat  thc look of impudent suavity the result of a habit of courting favour while accepting disrespect is a look which lives of social struggle have stamped npon the features of many of the hebrew race the interview between this glib unconscionable vagabond who has something of the character of charles mathewss awful dad and the son and daughter from whom he has been so long separated is very finely conceived there are very few students of human nature who would have conceived the idea of making lapidoths impudence break down in so hysterical a way beneath his sons stern rebuke  or who having done so would have made the fit of repentance so transient that he is making capital of his tears before they have dried on his cheek the humour of lapidoths subsequent attempts to make himself agreeable to mordecai and deronda and of the irksomeness of his feigned industry is exquisite george eliot shows due regard for the requirements of the comic muse in getting rid of the old knave so lightly among the minor characters in  daniel deronda  there are many charmingly delicate and truthful studies but perhaps the finest and certainly not the least difficult of all is lapidoth when we think of all that there is in daniel deronda we are much more disposed to admire the stupendous genius of the work than to regret the absence of any of the qualities of the novelist still wthen wc look upon the novel merely as a work of art we must admit that it has deficiencies it is a subepidermic subcutaneous kind of art the figures are too much like elaborately dissected specimens laid out upon the table of a professor of psychology it is not to be deniedt hat the novel has in many passages a tendency to dulness and that dullness comes from the action of the story and the portraits of the characters being too much overlaid with professorial comment the novel is not a work of art pure and simple but a novel mixed up with an elaborate running criticism of all its parts there is a want of courage in george eliot she cannot leave her characters to explain themselves she must always be telling us why they do this and say the other thing what principles of their nature they are illustrating she is too professorial too much like a professor who bores the average members of his class by overanxiety to take the dunces along with him nevertheless she is a great writer a great genius and if the homage which she receives is sometimes misdirected no one will contend that it is excessive in its sum total  literature daniel deronda by george eliot edin burgh and london w blackwood  sons 187g independently of its interest as a mere story and as a vehicle for reflections daniel deronda is eminently interesting because it presents in a fresh and brilliant light though merits as well as the faults of its writer merits and faults which are here sharply accentuated and are not as is too frequently the case blurred and confused by the wearing of the plate both classes of peculiarities should be by this time pretty well known to the student of english letters on the one hand we are prepared to find and we do find an extraordinarily sustained and competent grasp of certain phases of character  a capacity of rendering minute effects of light and shade attitudes transient moods of mind complex feelings and the like which is simply unparalleled in any other prose writer  an aptitude for minting sharply ethical maxims and a wonderful sympathy with humanity so far at least as it is congenial to the writer on the wrong side of the account must be placed a tendency to talk about personages instead of allowing them to develop themselves a somewhat lavish profusion of sententious utterance a preference for technical terms in lieu of the common dialect which is the fitter language of the novelist and a proneness to rank certain debateable positions and onesided points of view among the truths to which it is safe to demand universal assent to this black list must be added some decided faults in style in discussing a book which is in everybodys hands it will be well to show how the above points are brought out and how they affect the general merit of the book rather than to indulge in superfluous description of the plot in the matter of character then wo find two signal triumphs of portraiture the part of gwendolen harleth is throughout an overwhelming success and the minutest and least friendly examination will hardly discover a false note or a dropped stitch her selfwilled youth the curious counterfeit of superiority in intellect and character which her selfconfidence and her ignorance of control temporarily give her her instant surrender at though touch of material discomfort  the collapse of her confidence in the presence of a stronger spirit the helpless outbursts of selfpity of rage of supplication which follow that collapse  the struggle between blind hatred and almost equally blind glimmerings of conscience  the torrent of remorse and final prostration of willare all imagined with a firmness and succeed each other with an undoubted right of sequence which cannot but command admiration the husband is almost equally admirable  indeed ones admiration is here increased by the perception that the hand which is so faithful is distinctly unfriendly and that the author would like ns to detest grandcourt yet there is not the slightest exaggeration in the portrait as he appears before us acting with strict politeness to his wife in no way violent towards ber if we except the occasional use of somewhat forcible language and employing for the purposes of his refined tyranny nothing stronger than the methods of  awful rule and right supremacy if he should appear to anyone all the more detestable it may be suggested that it is difficult for any husband to extricate himself handsomely from the position of being hated by his wife and having that hatred confided to a bewitching rival the more study we give to these wonderful creations the better we like them and an additional interest is impaitcd by the discovery that gwendolen is at heart a counterfoil of dorothea animated by an undisciplined egotism instead of an undisciplined altruism and by the fanaticism of enjoyment instead of the fanaticism of sympathy it might even suggest itself to a symmetrical imagination that though soul of casaubon clothed with the circumstances and temperament of a fine gentleman would animate just such a personage as grandcourt but these nro fancies the point of present importance is that though interest of the story undoubtedly tends to centre in these two admirable characters and is unfortunately not allowed to do so of the third according to though authors design the first personage wo cannot speak as we have just spoken the blameless young man of faultless feature who clutches his coatcollar continually who at the age of some twenty years wished  to get rid of a merely english attitude in studies  who in the words of his best friend was disposed  to take an antediluvian point of view lest he should do injustice to the megatherium   of whom it was impossible to believe in the still more graphic words of the friends sister  that he had a tailors bill and used boothooks who never does a wicked thing and never says one that is not priggishis a person so intolerably dreadful that we not only dislike but refuse to admit him as possible only once perhaps is he humanwhen he persuades himself on all sorts of ethicophysicohistorical grounds that he should like to be a jew solely becauso as that very sensible woman his mother the princess discovers at once he wishes to marry a fascinating jewess we cannot accept as an excuse for the selection of this  faultless monster  as hero though pleas put forward in the book that it is only though  average man  and the  dull man  that will not understand him and that the average man is not very clear about though structure of his own retina and the dull mans  dullness subsists notwithstanding his lack of belief in it in the first place the cases are not parallel for though the average man may know very little about the structure of his retina he can tell a real eye from a glass one well enough and in the second place though dull man may fairly retort  if you are a great novelist make me believe in your characters in this dearth or rather distortion of central interest the minor characters do not help us much they are far less individual and far less elaborate than is usual with george eliot daniel deronda does not supply a fifth to join the noble quartette of mdmes holt and cadwalladcr poy ser and glegg sir hugo mullinger with hans meyrick and his sister mab makes a shift to fill up the gap but it is but a shift lapidoth the unwelcome father is chiefly welcome to us the readers because ol the happy boldness of the incident which finally unites the lovers mordecai we must not we suppose call a minor character but of him more hereafter there is no lack in these volumes of thc exqtxisite cabinet pictures to which george eliot has accustomed us though account of gwendolens grounds of confidence  the charming etching of though wagon passing pennieote keeto ry the scene of thc first ride with grandcourt gwendolen nfl cr klesmer has crushed her hopes of artistic success and again immediately before she at last accepts her lover the wonderful sketch of grandcourt sitting meditatively on a sofa and abstainingfroiu literature deronda in the synagogue the stables at the abbey  thc waiting at genoa for the princess  and lastly gwendolens retrospect of ofleiulonc are all effects ofthe finest in this kind but this good gift and other good gifts have been somewhat repressed as it seems t o us in order that certain tendencies not so excellent in themselves and very much the reverse of excellent when inordinately indulged might have freer play no one can read daniel de rt nt da without perceiving and regretting thc singular way in which the characters are incessantly pushed back iu order that though author may talk about them and about everything in heaven and cart li while the action stands still very sparingly used this practice is not ineffective hut the unsparing uso of it is certainly bad especially when we consider in what kind of language these parabases or excursus are expressed we cannot away in a novel with emotive memory and dynamic quality with  hymning of cancerous vices  and keenly perceptive sympathetic emotivencss with  coercive types  and  spiritual perpetuation still less with hundreds ol phrases less notable because bulkier xo doubt many of these expressions are appropriate enough and they are all more or less intelligible to decentlyeducated people no doubt though truths of science mental and physical are here as elsewhere in our authors works rendered with astonishing correctness and facility but it appears to us that the technical language of psychology is as much out of place in prose fiction as illustration of its facts is appropriate in philosophy in politics in religion in art a novelist when he speaks in his own person should have no opinion should be of no sect should indulge in no argot if we are dissatisfied with though jewish episode which is so remarkable in this book it is not merely because it has supplied temptations to indulge in psychological disquisition we do not in the slightest degree feel  imperfect sympathy with jews and we hold that shylock had the best of the argument but the question here is whether the phase of judaism now exhibited the mystical enthusiasm for race and nation has sufficient connexion with broad human feeling to be stuff for prose fiction to handle we think that it has not and we are not to be converted by references to the average man the average man has never experienced the passion of hamlet of othello or of lear he is not capable of the chivalry of esmond of the devotion of des grieux of the charity of the vicar of wakefield but he has experienced and he is capable of something of which all theso sublime instances are merely exalted forms now the  samothracian mysteries of bottled moonshine to borrow a phrase from allon locke into which mordecai initiates deronda are not thus connected with anything broadly human they aro not only  willworship but they have a provincial character which excludes fellow feeling poetry could legitimately treat them indeed many of mordecais traits may be recognised as we think moro happily placedin though sephardo of the spanish gypsy they are no doubt interesting historically they throw light on the character and aspirations of a curious people and supply an admirable subject for a scientific monograph but for all this they are not the stuff of which the main interest or even a prominent interest or anything but a very carefully reduced side interest of prose novels should be wrought it is hardly necessary to say that this dissatisfaction with though manner and scale of his appearances does not blind us to the skill applied in the construction of mordecai probably no other living writer is capable of the patient care with which these intricate and unfamiliar paths aro followed certainly no other is master of the pathos which half reconciles the reluctant critic if though thing was to be done it could hardly have been done better assuredly it could not have deen done with greater cunning of analysis or in a manner more suggestive we should have no right to complain that to the simplicity and passion which characterise the subjects and situations of the authors earlier books there has succeeded something more complex and analytic in the present it is a timehonoured transition and one which has before now yielded excellent results but in reality the transition is not in this case great because the subjectmatter really remains the same although there may be somewhat less directness of treatment the book is little more than a fresh variation on the theme which has informed so much of george eliots work which lurks even in the scenes of clerical life which is hardly in abeyance in adam bede which is though professed motive of the mill on the floss of the spanish gypsy and of romola which gives charm to the slightness of silas mar uer  to wit the excellence of obeying the instigations of kinship and duty hither than the op posing instinct all for love and the world well lost perhaps the motive has hardly depth and volume enough to bear such constant application but this is matter of opinion the matter of fact remains that we have once more presented to us in the contrast between gwendolens misery and the prosperity of the sleek deronda the same moral as we had in hettys catastrophe in the fate which punished maggie tullivers partial declension from the standard in the ruin and disgrace that sprang from duke silvas passion in the degradation and death of tito melema though same theories which led to the sympathetic selection of felix holt for a hero and of dorothea brook for a heroine the moral and the standard and the theories aro doubtless of a fine severity and deal deserved rebuke to though lax pleasureseeking which has been considered a vice at all times and is not openly considered a virtue even yet in though illustrations of these doctrines the author has again given us admirable portraits and much exquisitelydrawn surrounding but perhaps she has also once moro illustrated the immutable law that no perfect novel can ever be written in designed illustration of a theory whether moral or immoral and that art like atticus and the turk will bear no rival near the throne george

B8739,['6731465'],  sixty folk tales from exclusively slavonic sources translated with brief introduc tiena and notes by a h wratislaw elliot stock it was the late mr ralston who introduced to the notice of the british public the wealth of slavonic folklore his work w as done in scholarly fashion and to his translations of the origical russian talesfor to these he confined himselfhe added references to variants in other collections the little book of mr j t naake of the british museum entitled slavonic fairy lalee which appeared in 1874 also possessed considerable merit and we believe has long been out of print it has been followed by the interesting collection of mr wratislaw which is the subject of our present notice there is probably a richer field of folklore among the slavs than any other european people and the eastern members of the family show greater abundance than the western mr wratislaw begins his book with the bohemian tales but these are not to be compared in interest with the russian the late karl erben cf prague whose edition forms the basis of mr wratislaws work appears to have treated his folkstories conscientiously such cannot however be siid to have been the case with bozena nemcova the once popular author who almost always improved  upon her originals from her book mr wratislaw gives one specimen mr naake and prof a chozdko have both made use of erbens bookthe latter in his conies des paysans et des patres slaves it has the advantage of a fairly copious vocabulary in which all the wordsand some of those in provincial dialects are rather obscureare fully explained but unfortunately these txplanations are in bohemiana language but little studied in western europe all honour must be given to erbtn for his conscientious treatment of the tales but we do not blame the ingenious author previously alluded to for her tamperings with the original text un fortunately she lived at a time when no one had the courage to print these simple stories as they were received from the mouth of the peasant the comparison made by mr wratislaw p 51 between one of the moravian stories and a tale in the collection of grimm reminds us that chodzko complains with apparent reason that the germans have appropriated many of the slavonic folktales perhaps however we should be nearer the truth in saying that they are the common property of the aryan peoples and indeed of the whole human race certainly many of the magyar stories and national songs look very slavonic just as their national singer till he magyarised himself was called petrovich a name of unmistakable origin we should have preferred the term  slovakian for hungarian slovenes on p 62the adjective is used by miklosich and prevents any confusion with the real slovenes the driving of the great magyar wedge into the midst of the slavonic peoples to which mr wratislaw alludes has formed the subject of a valuable historical monograph by prof k grot of warsaw entitled moravia and the magyars st petersburg 1881 since erben published his book the lusatian talesor sorbish as we should prefer to call themhave been more comprehensively treated by veckenstedtwenosehs sagsn mareken und aberglauhische qebrauche gesammslt und nacherztlhlt gratz 1880 the variant of  little red riding hood  given by mr wratislaw on p 100 is very interesting he remarks with truth that the word nesets for  moon  is masculine how far it is a secondary formation it is difficult to say certainly the old slavonic has the feminine word luna which is also found in russian and slovenish miklosich sees traces in polish and bohemian and connects the word with lukna even the kashubes the humble section of the slavonic family dwelling on the coast of the baltic near danzig contribute their quota of a single tale and that is taken of course from the collection of dr cenova the only literary representative of these poor fisherfolk before the civilised world polish is fairly supplied with folktales as we know from the fine collection edited by oscar kolbcrg but this work appeared long after the compilation of erbens book coming to the obscure dialect of white russian we find some good specimens in mr wratislaws extracts the number of malorussian stories has been greatly increased by the publication of the narodnia tuthnorusshia shazjci of rudchenko erben does not seem to have used this book which appeared two or three years before his death in his introduction to the bulgarian stories p 175 mr wratislaw adopts the views of miklosich on some of the peculiarities of that language we think however that the idea of deriving the postposition of the article from the old thracian language originally spoken in the same localities can be otherwise explained the same tendency to put the demonstrative pronoun at the end of a noun or pronoun is seen in russian and polish thus russian smielosutu disknet  creates boldness or polish s kt6rogoto dkielk from which work some excellent remarks on this suffix are to be found in prof sobolevskis lectures on the history of the russian language nor do we accept the view of mr wratislaw that the old thracian or dacian language conjointly with latin has produced the present roumanian too little is known of thracian to justify these assertions and it would be difficult to point out the thracian words from that language in the roumanian vocabulary unless we are to consider albanian as such the remarks on the bulgarian cases also require modification as in some of the dialects the terminations of the genitive and dative are distinctly found nor again on p 204 can we accept the view that serbian has been modified by thracian influences the tendency to supply the infinitive by a circumlocution with the subjunctive is found in other languages eg low latin mr wratislaw has done excellent work in his versions of these folktales it is only with some of his philological views that we cannot agree thus we are at a loss to see what can justify his statement that the malorussianit is a language and not a dialect is more nearly allied to the bohemian than to the white russian surely its characteristics are sharply enough marked as of a southeastern slavonic language as opposed to bohemian a western mr wratislaws frequent use of the word  dialect is also to be somewhat reprehended thus slovenish cannot be called in anyway a dialect and the views of schafarikan excellent ethnologist but poor philologistare now out of date of the three dialects coordinated on p 204 serbian and croatian are almost identical but slovenish exhibits great variations from both in his work on the slavonic languages and literature published in 1826 schafarik actually grouped bulgarian with serbian these remarks are not made with a view of disparaging that eminent man but to show how slavonic studies have advanced since his time the fact is that a great deal of schafarik8 work is now antiquated the old divisions of the slavonic languages made by him and dobrovsky have been superseded by the classification given by johannes schmidt zur oeschichte des lndooermanischen voealismus part ii p 178 vienna 187175 the early attempts were based on distinctions many of which existed only in imagination as regards slovenish it is a language of great interest on account of the many old forms it contains although it is spoken over a small area and the literature which it contains is comparatively trifling since however the excellent grammar of j suman a pupil of miklosich slovenska slovniea laibach 1881 it is no longer left in such a state as to admit of philological guesses but folktales and not philology are the scope of mr wratislaws interesting and useful book which we feel sure will be heartily welcomed bv all

B1782,['3167331'],  the men of the moss hags it seems only the other day we were reading and revelling in  the raiders and here is already a rival to it from the pen of its own maker while all the year between has been dotted with mr crocketts stories the least of them alive and spirited this is vitality indeed which should defeat the degeneracy if anything could that the sad prophets say must wait on overproduction it is to those who delighted in  the raiders  that the men of the mosshags appeals to those who see the better mr crockett in stories of wild riding and hiding in galloway and by the shores of the solway than in the tamer merits of  the lilac sunbonnet just at this moment it is not very useful to declare ones preference between the two rival tales they appeal to the same instincts they have about an equal amount of adventurous incident and breathe equally of the openaira fine feature in a book and all the horrors of the killing  cannot cancel its benefit here it is emphatically a good story though without any very definite plan or plot and though it postpones some of its romantic consummations till a second part which shall give us the lives of the hero and his kinsfolk and friends in holland and presumably the mating of the hero with maisie and of young lochinvar with kate of balmaghie it is merely a first volume and we leave off with an appetite for we like our company but we beg mr crockett in his next instalment to hurry a little over the dutch exile and hasten back to galloway where he is ever happiest and surest where he shows most of his own natural strength the influence of stevenson is strong in  the men of the mosshags  but whatever echoes from other romancers we find in his characters there is one thing that is all his own his glegness of eye his sense of the beauty of the earth and his power to tell itif it be galloway earth here is a picture of a faringforth in the early summer  now as we went up the hill a sound followed us that made us turn and listen it was a sweet and charming noise of singing there at the door of earlstoun were my mother and her maidens gathered to bid us farewell upon our sad journey it made a solemn melody on the caller morning air for it was the sound of the burying psalm and they sung it sweetly so up the deuch water we rode the little birds making a choir about us and young tailless  a the men of the moss hags being a history of adventure taken from the papers of william gordon of earlstoun in galloway and told over again by s r crockett 6sa ibister thrushes of the years nesting pulling at reluctant worms on the short dewy knowes mr crockett has known better than to make the young herowilliam gordon a very orthodox whig at thi time of day orthodox whip are not in favour and we all prefer a hero for whom we can have a warmer feeling than approval lame as he is he is nevertheless more of a soldier than a preacher and his testimony he gives more willingly by his sword than by word of mouth a still more original departure is seen in the career of the wullcat the young lord ot lochinvar whose gallantries get his more douce cousin into difficulties at the beginning of the story most romancers would have bored us with the love affairs of the hotheaded irresponsible and inflammable young man all through merely from convention but when once wat takes to the heather he contents himself with a single ladylove and he is generally to be counted on to take part in the wildest and least gallant of adventures without hindrance from his caprices and affections the silent devoted and daring maisie take her all in all is a living personage but not easily describable one should not be surprised at any of her exploits after watching her conduct when the dragoons are riding on the conventicle  maisie lennox who was nearest to me looked over to where her father stood at the corner of his company then because she was distressed for him and knew not what she did she drew a halfknitted stocking out of the pocket that swung beneath her kirtle calmly set the stitches in order and went on knitting as is the galloway custom among the hillfolk when they wait for anything a remarkable woman but the story of her rifling the mailbags we cannot believe it was a feat of the wullcat and some clerkly allies if it was done at all that is the one strong protest we have to make though while we are in a dissentient mood we might mention that there are too many thunderstorms we have no other grievances nothing else but praise indeed for a fresh and imaginative story it is a point to be noted about mr crockett that where he has to describe he is never dull it would be easy to select twenty excellent descriptive passages from the book before us to prove this but none in force and tenderness could rival one part of the terrible tale of johnstones brutality to the children  then i saw something that i had never seen but among the sheep and it was a most pitiful and heartwringing thing to see though now in the telling it seems no great matter there is a time of year when it is fitting that the lambs should be separated from the ewes and it ever touches one nearly to see the flock of poor lammies when first the dogs come near to them to begin the work and wear them in the direction in which they are to depart all their little live the lambs had run to their mothers at the first hint of danger now they have no mother to flee to and you can see them huddle and pack in a frightened solid bunch quivering with apprehension all with their sweet little winsome faces turned one way then as the dogs run nearer to start them there comes from them a little low brokenhearted bleating as if terror were driving the cry out of them against their wills thus it is with the lambs on the hill and so also it was with the bairns that clung together in a cluster on the brae face,britain

patriotsin short what all who have the wellbeing of country or the interests of humanity at heart ought to have been up and doing before herthat is inspecting the real condition of a people who are casting themselves in legions upon our shores a nation which must hereafter form a most powerful admixture in the blood of our country whose numeric power is already frightfully felt in modifying our clecti is t least deserving of a passing study we hear the irish branded daily as idle and filthy we see all the great avenues to the hard exercise of bone and muscle filled to overflowing by these  hewers of wood and drawers of water in our great and growing republic we see them swelling the ranks of our excited and frightful mobs and finally they order our bedrooms cook our food and drive our carriagesare with us when we lie down and when we rise upat the ballotbox the church and the fireside yet no one has investigated truly and closely the associations to which they lived prior to coming hither except this womanwho with the patience of a woman and the courage of a man has travelled the entire length and breadth of the island that she might as she says visit those who in caves and dens of the earth  were forgotten of their neighbours truth to say this unique volume is not a work of literary pretension the author seems to have been one of those beings of fervent piety about whom it has been the will of the good god to loosen earthly ties  and she has taken up the pilgrims staff in the true missionary spirit to do good as best she can the reader who hopes to find descriptions of  round towers of castles and cathedrals stirring legends or dainty fairy tales will find himself disappointed but once let him reconcile himself to the idea of a woman whom the irish everywhere pronounced as  light on the fut a  comely body  beautiful discoorsing and  a lady plain to be seen but i gone astray in her mind  crazed the crater  cracked indade in the brain in lost the sinse she has or she wouldnt come and eat praters with poor ljoi  let him once cast himself in media res into this state of things and lie will find a most readable book filled with amusing incident in a lively offhand style without cant or prejudice and yet giving a better notion of the true irish character the paddy as he is than in any score of travels yet written and if he does not laugh at the suppressed humour of the writer the suppressed fastidiousness and suppressed womanhood all breaking out so whimsically and naturally he has little genuine heartiness about him  and more than this he is but half human if he do not sometimes find his eyes run over at the fervent  god save you the  good god bless ye kindly of these simple affectionate and buoyant people when found amid their own bogs and alive with the miseries yet blessed with the associations of home and country the author had her full share of trials in every shape and when rudely interrogated as to her motive in visiting ireland being suspected of  jesuitism of  democratic intermneddling and radicalism she makes the following spirited reply which shows that the lady of nearly half a century as she describes herself has yet the material for much exertion and usefulness left i replied she saysi came to ireland because i had a right to comae that theiy were daily sending loads of haggard1 and abused ernigiants to us and i came to see bow and what they could be at horme  from the american literary world to do this she travelled almost entirely on foot walking distances of ten and twenty miles sleeping in smoky cabins eating potatoes rejecting meats tea and coffee talking sympathising and reading to the people and everywhere meeting in return the most affecting gratitude expressions of tender ness offers of aid and protection of the mat beautiful and primitive kind indeed one would be apt to suppose when we find a woman whom the irish declared comely young in the face light in the fut travelling alone often late into the night on foot unharmed and unmolested one would be apt to think this people had degenerated little since the days of brian boru when he sent a young and beautiful virgin to travel over the island with a crown and golden sceptre and she passed on safely as did the poetic una with her snowwhite lamb critics might find passages at which to carpthe overfastidious might revolt at scenes which this brave woman encountered unflinchingly but for ourselves we look at the heart of the book at the spirit of the author and the positive tangible knowledge to be derived therefrom of the irishman as he is and the book just as it is the best it could be in its kind for it is what the writer meant it should bean exponent of the irish not a work of art we read with interest and hope others will be disposed to do the same for the sake of getting at the knowledge it contains the following is a graphic description of her first appearance in kilkenny we reached our destination and alighting from the kish i wits told for the honour of the spot that here some two hundred years ago lived a noble lord who had twenty noble sons with these he daily rode out with each an attendant on twenty noble horses all shod with silver shoes i was desired to stay outside till the way should be prepared for my reception in a moment i was ushered in as a fine gal he had found in kilkenoy the family were sitting at their supper of potatoes and buttermilk around a naked deal table upon which the potatoes were poured the widow two growntip sons and a grandson constituted the group and when i was seated anl for a moment were silent this is marys mis tress said my companion simultaneously every potatoe was dropped all rose and with a kind of unaffected dignity reached me the hand saying welcome to our cabin  they then sat down and all was silent again weve been long waitin for he said the mother  and was in dread that he might be lost but ye must be wairy and in want of the tay i assured her that a potatoe would be a greater relish ii ye eant ate the potatoes said she the sons joining in the assertion till by actual expe riment i soon convinecd them to the contrary the reader should he informed that the daughter of this widow 141 in three years service at my house sent home 401 which had not only kept her mother in ten and bread but had given them all the ii blessed

bade me good night and though i would not wish the reader ever to be packed in feathers in such a narrow box in a hot august night yet i am not unwilling  that he should know that my first night in a cabin with nil its concomitants was a sleepless one and one which can never be forgotten the dawning of light found the good woman stealthily peeping around the cupboard and with a shabke of the head i heard her whisper ah  she didnt lie down in her bed the cratur she crept to the hearth made her peat fire swept every vestige of dirt from the earthern floor and sat down to smoke her sons soon joined her each in his turn taking a blast at the pipe and then walked slowly out for said the mother  shes wairy and a fat of ye mustnt be movin that lay was a memorable one in this parish lived a young married girl who had been a servant in my house in new yos k she had returned and was living a mile distant she had been aroused at midnight by the man who conducted me to the parish and early the next morning sbe was at the door anne was young handsome and tidy and had been a great favourite in my house i was a little concealed when she entered and did not recognise her till she fell on my neck and wept  ah i and its ye that may bawl when yer two eyes meet the one that took you a slip and made ye the thriftiest woman for the man that owns ye in all the parish anne spoke not nor could

parish was now in a stir work was suspended and a general levee held they talked of building bonfires they talked of uniting and buying a sheep to kill though not one had eaten a dinner of flesh since christmas the greyheaded and the little child were there to welcome me to thank me for  thinking of the like of such poor bodies  and from some miles around visitors called before the setting of the sun to look at the american stranger and bid her god speed what will she ate the cratur its not the potatoe that raired her two children begged the honour of going seven miles in quest of fruit and went sight and rain overtook them yet they persevered slept away through the night and cheerfully returned the next day veth two pears and a spoonful of blackberries which was all they could procure all went away sorrowful that  so nice a body should be so trated and all asked me to visit their cabins  though they were not fittin for such a lady the next morning anne again called to invite me to her house and to say she had been sent by a few in the parish to invite me to attend a field dance which was to be on the next day and the sabbath in surprise i was alout to answer when anne said  i knew you would not and told them so but they begged i would say that they had no other day as au were at work and sure god wouldnt be hard upon em when they had no other time and could do nothing else for the stranger i thanked them heartily for their kind feelings and declined judge my confusion when about sunset on sabbath eveniig just after returning from johnstown where i had attended church the cabin door opened and a crowd of all ages walked in decently attired for the day and without the usual welcome or any apology the hero who first introduced me seated himself at my aid took out his flute and wet his fingers saying  this is for you mrs n and what will you have  a company were arranged for the dance and so con founded was i that my only answer was  i cannot tell he struck up an irish air and the dance began i hiad nothing to asy taken by surprise as i wag my only strength was to sit still this dance finished the eldest son of my hostess advanced made a low bow and invited me to lead the next dance i looked on his glossy black slippers his blue stockings snugly fitted up to the knee his corduroys above them his blue coat and brass buttona and had no reason to hope that at my age of nearly half a century i could ever expect another like offer however i was not urged to accept it improper as it might appear it was done as a civility which as a guest in his mothers house and a stranger he thought and all thought as i was afterwards told he owed me the calbin was too small to contain the threescore and ten who had assembled and with one simultaneous movement without speaking all rushed out bearing me along and placed me on a cart before the door the player at my right hand and then a dance began which to say nothing of the day was to me of no ordinary kind not a laughnot a loud word was heard no affected airs which the young are prone to assume but as soberly as though they were in a funeral procession they danced for an hour wholly for my amusement and for my welcome then each approached gave me the hand bade me god speed leapt over the stile and in stillness walked away it was a true and hearty irish welcome in which the aged as well as the young participated a matroun of sixty of the protestant faith was holding by the hand a grandchild of seven years and standing by the cart where i stool and she asked when they retired if i did not enjoy it  what are these wonderful people  was my reply i had never seen the like the beautiful customs of the peasantry find an appreciating observer in our author who often throws off comments of much suggestiveness if not of grace the custom of the peasantry in this part at least of the country has been to assemble in hundreds and reap down a harvest or dig a farmers potatoes taking their musicians with them who play through the day to amuse the labourers and escort them home at night this they never do but for those whom they respect and the generous farmer who has fed and paid his labourcrs well is sure to meet with a return of this kind women will go out and bind sheaves rake and toss hay pick up potatoes c and the sight to a stranger is not only novel but pleasing the ambition manifested to aceowiplish much and to do it well is often beyond that of a paid abourer and the hilarity over their dinner and supper of potatoes and butter and  sup of milk is to a generous mind a pleasant sight for drunk or sober rich or poor it is the irishmans character to remember a kindness andl to do what he can to repay it we passed this interestiog company listening to their music till it died away in the distance and though i knew they were going home ta lie down in floorless cabins with no prospect of better days yet for the moment i saw more to envy than to pity for theses people are so happy with little and make so much from nothing that you often find them enjoying when others would be repining travelling in tipperary she found herself with out lodging hungry and fatigued every cabin was full and she seated herself under the side of a wall utterly unable to proceed at length the old man seconded by his wire said come in come in and sit in the kitchen ye cant stay here we are sorry we cant do better  we had hoped that some of our lodgters would have gone before ye come for we wanted ye here i followed them into their floorless kitchen sitting by a comfortable turf fire i became drowsy the two kind irishmen were sitting in the room and supposing me to be asleep one said  poor thing she must feel quair in a strange country alone i wonder how her people would trate a stranger in her situationwould they trate her tendlerly  aw  to be sare they would answered his friend the amerieana have always showed great love for the irish t6 be sure they have answered the woman of the house thinking it time to awake i inquired the time  it was late and i had not been told that a lodiging could 11 be provided  and rising from my chair i said i  must seek some place to stop for the night and that ye wont responded the woman we wvil do what we can and her husband with much decision said  ye cant and shant go the question was thus settled and a daughter irm seat out to get a bed from a neighbours which she brought in upon her back and adjusted upon chairs and after a repast of some potatoes and salt without knife or fork i lay down in the kitchen in a clean bed and not a being in all ireland slept more sweetly than 1 with my bodyguard wrapped in her cloak on the floor at my side hospitality of this kind was everywhere abund ant the poor giving of their poverty often with a delicacy of sacrifice worthy of a better fate we believe it to be a fact that as a people the irish are the last to fall into dotage through age she saysamong the crowds that returned from early mats was an old woman of one hundred quite sprightly and who never fails of being every morning early sitting on the gallery steps  and as passencers go in they drop a little into her hand i found many old people in this town as well as in all towns i had visited in ireland and not in any case had i found one who bad lost his faculties after reading the following one will hesitate in making the charge of wanton idleness or laziness as an irish characteristic i met many interesting characters through the morning and whether labourer or beggar most of them were smoking and none of them in a fretful mood i talked a little with all and scarcely spoke to one who di dot drop something in my ear worth recalling it is noticeable in all the peaantry of ireland that whether the idea be new or old which they advance it will be given in such a novel dress and in so unexpected a manner that something new and often something beautiful will be suggested to the mind on my return to my lodgings i saw a company of men assembled in the square and supposed something new bad gathered them but draw ing near i found it was a collection of poor country men from distant parts who bad come hoping on the morrow to find a little work each bad his spade and all were standing in a waiting posture in silence i hungry and weary for many i was told had walked fifteen or twenty miles without eating nor did they expect to cat that day sixpence a lay was all they could get and they could not afford food on the sab bath when they could not work their dress and their desponding looks told too well the tale of their sufferings when i had passed them looking about one was near me walking slowly picking a few shreds carelessly in his fingers his countenance such a finished picture of despair as said it is done i can do no more i three times halted and paused to speak to him but could not give utterance as soon as i met his countenance hunger wife children lanl despair were so visible that i turned away and could mnly say good god i have merry on poor irela nd when i reached my lodging the landlord re marked that every week the poor creatures are com ing in from the country and often they stay two days without eating watching and hoping a chance may conme and sleep where they can and then most of them go away without getting any work go to now ye rich men weep and howl 1here is a whimsical account of some of her experience in the way of lodgingm siy lodgings should not pass entirely unnoticed in all lodginghouses i had found that a single room was an extra privilege scarcely to be expected  and often the man woman and children would be fixed in the same apartment with one or two transient lodgers as the case might be this is not so in hotels in this house the apartments looked tidy l and i was shown to a chamber where were two cur tained beds  one of these i was to occupy before retiring the woman said  i shall sleep down stairs the chill is sick and nobody will he in your room but john w ho is john  i asked my old man was the reply yourold man beassured madam i shall be your company down here then that you dont you shall have a good bed and room where you can rest the matter was settled by telling her in plain english i would not go into the chamber as a penance i was put into a confined room with her mother a s1id oy across the foot of my bed bolstered and tucked against the wall so that there was no danger of falling out or off the poor old mother was dying with the asthma keeping up almost a continued coughing her uuneadtly breathing so frightened me fearing she was in deathgonies i kept calling woman woman i i for i did not know her name when she was coughing she could not sleep and when she slept i could not awake her nothing but the cough could do it thus two doleful nights i kept my eyes waking not conscious that i slept at all  the thiri night i slept a little from downright necessity but complaining was out of the question  there wrs an empty bed and the wife seemed glad to punish me for casting contempt on as good and as quiet a man as there was in all galway she visits the farfamed blarney stone  now came blarney the celebrated blarney where many a name is carved where lords and ladies pea sants and beggars have strolled and sat here weas the seat pointed to me where mrs hall the writer ion ireland rested  and the old priest suggested the inspiration i might receive by sitting there on the same stone by the same stone summerhouse the whole is a romantic spot a hermits cell

much she passed us while we were admiring aid told our guide to show us all that it contained the granil castle containing the blarneystone is a great curiosity standing as it does on an awful high rock overlook ing the river far below it deep and winding in its way among trees and thick grass to me it was frightful to look out from a loophole and see the river below and to climb to the top to kiss the blarney stone stretching my neck out of the window over the dizzy steep would have been madness though i was told many a silly boy and girl had done it in conclusion we would say read the

B1947,['8691054'],  poor miss finch a novel by wilkie collins 3 vols btntley  son it is impossible even to dip into  poor miss finch without at once recognising the hand of its author and yet the work is in many respects unlike any other of mr wilkie collinss many novelsunlike the woman in white unlike  armadale and most of all unlike  basil it is dedicated to a lady and it is worthy of its dedication the rhapsodist weaves his plot virginians puehsqite the sanctifying influence of casselts magazine and which is more of casselfs magazine suffering from the intense reaction consequent upon a terrible temptation  is feebly apparent in every chapter lt is in short a sensation novel for sunday reading and as such can be confidently recommended to the notice of parents and guardians there is a perjury in it it is true but as it is told by a distracted lover to enable him to get a marriagelicence it is after all of the kind at which the gods laugh andthe perjury exceptedthere is no positive sin against the decalogue there are no redheaded messalinas aged jezebels rascally doctors or spurious baronets of the hidden horrors which made  basil perhaps the most powerfully characteristic of all mr collinss achievements there is not even a shadow and if it is a triumph to have demonstrated that the ordinary machinery of a sensation novel can be turned to the purposes of edification by weekly instalments it is impossible to deny mr collins credit for as large a triumph as he may wish to claim that the fiftyone chapters should be full of plotting and counterplotting was inevitable the good people and the bad people scheme and counterscheme and overhear one another and write to one another and intercept letters andthe bad people that is to sayforge letters and employ detectives and work the telegraph and study law and science and trip up and are tripped up in turn with all the assiduity of clown and pantaloon in a pantomime what is delightful is not that all this should he donefor mr wilkie collins has done as much before and has done it far betterbut that it should be done in so proper a spirit poor miss finch as possibly our readers know is a blind girlblind almost from birth she is little more than a baby in character although very lovable and she falls in love with a good silly young fellow who is nearly as big a baby as herself oscar this latter baby has a twinbrother named nugent and for the purposes of the story oscar and nugent are very like one anotherespecially nugent that nugent should personate oscar and that poor miss finch should be in love with both at once and yet with only one was inevitable but the situations are multiplied ten fold by the facts that oscar takes nitrate of silver which turns him blue that miss finch has a blind antipathy to blue as being a shade of black that she recovers her sight that she takes oscar to be nugent and nugent to be oscar that everybody first deceives her and then undeceives her and then deceives her again  and that to the very last moment it is impossible to tell whether she will marry oscar believing him to be nugent or marry nugent believing him to be oscar or marry oscar in spite of his blue face because he is so good or marry nugent in spite of all his wickedness because he is so pink and white each of mr wilkie collinss novels is a riddle to the answer of which each chapter brings us a degree nearer the riddle propounded in  poor miss finch is  whom will she marry and although we suspect that fate will ultimately side with virtue we yet must in fairness admit that the story might quite well end either way and that our interestas far as interest can be felt in a wax dollis tolerably sustained mr wilkie collins is a very clever mechanist and a very inferior novelisteven when judged by his two best works  the woman in white and armadale each of these is clever each is very interesting each piques us as a chinese puzzle might or a charade or an ingenious mathematical problem or a trick of sleightofhand with a pack of cards we read patiently on for chapter after chapter working our way inch by inch to the true answer in what is essentially the last chapter the answer suddenly bursts under our feet with a pop and a bang and a good deal of harmless smoke aa at the springing of a theatrical mine all is over at once we have all we wanted lucilia is married to oscar who cares to read further  we shut the book with a slam much aa experienced playgoers leave the theatre long before the curtain falls indeed that the reader shouldapart from the mechanism of its plot take the faintest interest in one of mr collinss novels would argue him easily interested  and that he should care to read through even  the woman in white a second time except upon the assumption that he has forgotten the answer to itwould be almost incredible  for the truth is that clever as mr collins isand his cleverness is beyond all questionin the construction of his riddles he has not yet called into existence a single character worthy to find its way to  kennaquhair abstract from count fosco that he is at that he speaks a somewhat italian and hyperbolical english that he keeps white mice and canaries and that he plays selections from  israel in egitto and we have left as ordinary a rogue as ever disgraced a novel abstract from miss gwilt her red hair or from geoffrey delamayne his big muscles or from herr gross the great character in  poor miss finch his love of lunch his anglogerman oaths and his general shabbiness and fatness in each case we have left us the very sorriest residue mr collins holds we believe that the main element in the attraction of all stories is the interest of curiosity and the excitement of surprise to this he does not add the analysis of human nature he is no  psychologist and seems to feel towards any such overrefinement as mrs squeers felt when she boasted that she was  no grammarian thank heaven the little subtle touches that make up such a character as mrs poyser or colonel newcome or even captain cuttle and the clever little nothings by which such a character is indicated are apparently beneath or beyond mr collinss power he paints in distemper with good strong colour primary bright and plenty of it he turns on the limelight  voila tout we have persons not characters and for a tale in which the labyrinthine contortions of the plot are everything persons do fully as good service as characters while they entail far less labour on the author the popular delusion that fosco is a carefullydrawn character is dispelled the moment we compare him with herr grosse fosco is a fat gluttonous accomplished italian gross is a fat gluttonous learned german gross would make a capital villain exactly as fosco would have made a capital burgeon all that mr collins apparently attempts in his actors is to secure a certain definite individuality this he effects by the most extrinsic devices which are neither part of nor in any way consonant with the character itself strip gross of his broken german his love of mayonnaise his fat and his abruptness there is as little of real character left as is left of fun when a  breitmann  ballad is written with due regard to grimms laws after the english orthography it is easy then to see why  poor miss finch is not to be compared to mr collinss other works the plotting has for the ordinary reader no sufficient raison detre miss finch would bewere she not  poor  miss finch  such a limp lay  figure that neither does the lover who nearly loses her win our sympathy nor the villain who nearly deceives her arouse our indignation we crave matter more stirring to justify mechanism so elaborate we feel that even miss gwilt and her wicked red hair would be a pleasant foil to miss finch and her madonnadisansisto face and are hardly sure that even such horrors as those of  basil would not be in a certain sense a relief and yet as far as the story will allow him mr wilkie collins is himself he has many good points sufficient to justify his popularity his english is always passable often good sometimes incisive he has a certain sense of humour although too obviously modelled during his apprenticeship to household words humour of the kind which suggested  pray employ major namby the reverend finch is worth several hearty laughs and the metaphysical fitness of things is admirably preserved when he becomes a colonial bishop far more fitly than when nugent is frozen to deatha somewhat theatrical and familiar method of killing off a villain there is humour in madame pratolungos biography in her reminiscences of the doctor of his mahogany complexion and of his devotion to the republic of the future in her confession that  i cast all feminine restraints to the winds i sat down with my legs anyhow like a man i rammed my hands into the pockets of my dressinggown did i cry  a word in your earand let it go no further  swore the fun would have been better perhaps had the last verb been more realistic but it is good fun as fun goes and so too is the fun got out of herr grosse who opines that  when got made the womens he was sorry afterwards for the poor mens and he made tobaccos to comfort them and who when more anxious for news than for the amenities of life roars out  good morning  good morning godamn where where where is feench  and in addition to his sense of fun it must be placed to mr collinss credit that he is never tedious not a single ethical diatribe in spite of temptations the most terriblelurks from the first cover to the last of the three volumes that the writer of a serial tale should be capable of such selfcontrol is no small matter of commendation mr wilkie collins probably does not himself expect that any of his works will live he certainly has no right to expect immortality for miss finch but it is something d to be facileprinceps even in a transient school tl y n ie rt and to novelists of his own kind mr collins stands as stands the author of  guy livingstone  to his three or four copyists he has made what may be called the detective novel his own and  for comparisons are unnecessaryneed fear no rival he takes so much and such evident trouble over what he writes and his workmanship is so good and so conscientious that the result is always of its kind as good as can be got many a man in his position would write five novels in every three years but mr collins respects his readers and pro tanto his readers respect mr collins no one ever yet began one of his novels to throw it aside it is possible that having read one we may not care to begin a second but if we once begin it we shall most certainly finish it for although mr collins has grave defects he has no positive faults that miss gwilt is not vivien that foscoto go more widely afieldis not say the earl of crabs is what was to have been expected but for ingenuity for cleverness for power of rousing curiosity and keeping interest alive mr collins stands altogether alone the art is not a high art perhaps but he has mastered it and mastered itas his books show by honest industry to judge him fairly we must not go out of our way to compare him with thackeray or with george eliot he writes with no other object than to amuse andjudged by his object he achieves a substantial success in not one of his best tales can we foresee the plot or even guess at its result save in so far as he chooses to help us there is no sameness about him nor does he ever inflict upon us a mauvais quart dkeure armadale the woman in white and  man and wife are as good as those who read six novels a year have any right to expect and better by far than those can expect who read a novel a month and if  poor miss finch is not as good as others it is not that mr collinss hand has in any way lost its cunning but simply that the subject is one on which he could hardly be expected to work with zeal he is at his best when his puppets are either in the dock or being fitted for it exactly as his tales read best when we get them by instalments of three or four chapters at a time in  poor miss finch as it appears in its threevolumed form neither of these conditions are fulfilled and yet although  miss finch is for mr collins weak and although we hope he will return again with all speed to his favourite topics can nothing be made out of the disappearance of mr bauer we none the less feel bound to express our opinion that if not as good a novel as might have been written by mr collins  poor miss finch is yet of its kind far too good a novel to have been written by any one else,britain

B3600,"['6713689', '8584519']",  far from thc madding crowd by thomas hardy london smith elder  co 1874 far from the madding crowd is so clever a novel so original in atmosphere and in character that its brilliant qualities are likely to neutralise the glare of its equally prominent faults the writer has the advantage of dealing with an almost untouched side of english life his scene is laid somewhere in the country of mr freemans favourite seaxsaetas in a remote agricultural and pastoral district of southwestern england among peasants who look on bath as a distant and splendid metropolis it is likely that much of the old country existence lives on undisturbed the country folk in the story have not heard of strikes or of mr arch they have to all appearance plenty to eat and warm clothes to wear and when the sheep are shorn in the ancient barn of weatherbury the scene is one that shakespeare or that chaucer might have watched this immobile rural existence is what the novelist has to paint  in comparison with cities he says weatherbury was immutable the citizens then is the rustics now in london twenty or thirty years ago are old times in paris ten years or five in weatherbury three or four score years were included in the mere present and nothing hiss than a century set a mark on its face or tone five decades hardly modified the cut of a gaiter the embroidery of a smockfrock by the breadth of a hair ten generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase in these nooks the busy out aiders ancient times are only old his old times are still new his present is futurity no condition of society could supply though writer who knows it well with a more promising ground for his story the old and the new must meet here and there with curious surprises and our world may find itself face to face with the quaint conceited rustics of shakespeares plays such a story might be written as george sand has often told of the vallee noire sober characters and simple might appear in the foreground of scenes exquisitely quiet and harmonious in our opinion the writer of far from the madding crowd has only partially succeeded in making the best of his theme and though his failure is more valuable than i many successes he has been misled by attempting too much in his way of looking at his subject he rather resembles george eliot than george sand he contemplates his shepherds and rural people with the eye of a philosopher who understands all about them though he is not of them and who can express their dim efforts at rendering what they think and feel in language like that of mr herbert spencer it is this way of writing and thinking that gives though book its peculiar tone the author is telling clever people about unlettered people and he adopts a sort of patronising voice in which there are echoes now of george eliot and now of george meredith thus there aro passages where the manner and the matter jar and are out of keeping there are three circles of interest in this storyfirst the rural surroundings the effects of weather and atmosphere the labours of beasts and men as the lambing of sheep and such mild struggles with natures storms and rains as m victor hugo would scarcely find dramatic enough for his tremendous canvas next there are the minor charactersa sort of chorus of agricultural labourers very ready with advice very helpless and very much taken up with themselves as was the way with the ancient chorus last there are the main persons of the dramathe people in whose passions and adventures the interest ought to centre of these three component parts of the tale the first may bo pronounced nearly perfect and worthy of all praise we might instance the description of norcombe hill by starlight in the beginning of the second chapter as an original and admirable treatment of natureof nature which is more and more tending to become a main interest in our modern fiction we prefer to quote the enumeration of the signs by which the hero detected the approach of a storm because the quotation includes the sheep whose birth and death in this tale are narrated with great minuteness  the sheep were crowded close together on the other side around some furze bushes and the first peculiarity observable was that on the sudden appearance of oaks head over the fence they did not stir or run away they had now a terror of something greater than their terror of man but this was not the most noteworthy feature they were all grouped in such a way that their tails without a single exception were towards that half of the horizon from which the storm threatened there was an inner circle closely huddled and outside these they radiated wider apart the pattern formed by the flock as a whole not being unlike a vandyked lace collar to which thc clump of furze bushes stood in the relation of the wearers neck  this was enough to reestablish him in his previous opinion he knew now that he was right and troy was wrong every voice in nature was unanimous in bespeaking change but two distinct translations attached to these dumb expressions apparently there was to be a thunderstorm and afterwards a cold continuous rain the creeping things seemed to know all about the latter rain but little of the interpolated thunderstorm while the sheep knew all about the thunderstorm and nothing of the latter rain when the thunderstorm bursts it is described with much pictorial effect and is a quite disagreeable enough trial to oak the english gilliat and contender with nature coming from though scenery to the chorus we are a good deal puzzled few men know the agricultural labourer at home and it is possible that ho is what mr hardy describes him the labourers are all humourists in their way which is a very dreary and depressing way odd scraps of a kind of rural euphuism misapplications of scripture and fragments of modern mechanical wit are stirred up into a queer mixture which makes the talk of henery fray cainy ball jan coggan and especially of that preeminent bore joseph poorgrass do labourers really converse like this  i look round upon life quite promiscous do you conceive me neighbours  my words though made as simple as i can nmy be rather deep tor some heads   oh yes henery we quite conceive ye  a strange old piece goodmenwhirled about from here to yonder as if i were nothing worth a little warped too but i have my depths ha and even my great depths i might close with a certain shepherd brain to brain but no oh no hero is another specimen of rural speech   for a drunk of really a noble class and on the highest principles that brought you no nearer to the dark man than you were afore you began there was none like these in farmer everdenes kitchen not a single damn allowed no not a bare poor one even at the most cheerful moment when all were blindest though the good old word of sin thrown in here and there would have been a great relief to a merry soul   true said the maltster  nature requires her swearing at the regular times or shes not herself and unholy exclamations is a necessity of life and so on shepherds may talk in this way we hope not but if they do it is a revelation and if they dont it is nonsense and not very amusing nonsense leaving the servants and coming to their master and mistress we cannot say that wo are greatly fascinated with the persons or much concerned in their fortunes nothing could be more true or more careful than the study of troy the handsome sergeant with his half education his selfishness his love which he only finds out to be something like true love under the influence of remorse when the soldier erects a costly tomb to the woman whose heart he has broken and plants flowers on her grave in such a way as to wound to the quick the woman he has married we recognise an insight and a touch like that of flaubert but we cannot easily pardon bathsheba the heroine for losing her heart to troys flattery and to the glitter of his brass and scarlet indeed we have some difficulty in being much moved by bathshebas character and mischances when wo first see her she is stealing a look at herself in a mirror unconscious of the presence of young farmer oak when she hears that oak has asked her aunt for leave to court her and has been discouraged she runs after the exemplary man and explains that she is heart free then she sends a valentine with a seal marry me to farmer boldwood and so fascinates that apparently calm but really passionate rustic meanwhile oak fails as a farmer and bathsheba having become a farmer in ber own right takes him on as shepherd and has  curiously confidential passages with him at last the gay sergeant fixes her fancy with a display of swordsmanship and sho drives alone at night to bath and is married to him we feel inclined to say to her as mr buckstone does to galatea in the play  youre sure its innocence   the young ladys misfortunes deepen as troy spends her money and takes to drinking thero is a very powerful and strange scene between them when she opens the coffin of her dead rival fanny robin and her husband kisses the lips of the corpse and tells his wife that he only loved the dead it is a situation worthy of the drama of webster or of ford and wild as it is is lcd up to in a perfectly natural way this part of the tale including fanny robins terrible walk to her rest in the workhouse is ominently tragic and is not improved by the commonplace tragedy of the denouement we leave bathsheba wedded to the worthy oak a capital overseer and a husband who may be trusted we hope the babies were  put in the papers every man jack of them as mr oak promised when ho wooed bathsheba is so seldom on though level that her troubles with her husband raise her to that wc feel she does not decline on oak and have no sense of her as wasting her sweetness it is unlikely that even her remorso for having tempted boldwood would lead her into her foolish latter relations with such a man and on the whole we cannot look on bathsheba as a firmly designed character in spite of this want of success and of incongruities of tone tyar from the madding crowd displays undeniable talent which has scarcely as yet found its best and easiest and most natural expression in taking leave of an interesting provoking and clever story we must say a word in praise of though graceful illustrations a lang  far from the maddlng crowd far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy author of  a pair of blue eyes smith elder and co without making minute comparisons between mr hardy and any of his contemporary novelists let it suffice to say that this last work of his at once lifts his name above the crowd and gives him a position among the eminent few which it rests with himself to confirm or to diminish mr hardy is not a novelist to whom the exercise of his art is a bywork or a recreation it is clear that he has given his best energies to its service and has worked with faithful and patient zeal for his reward it is pleasing to meet with work that is so obviously the outcome of high aims and one should not be grudging in expressing ones conviction of the artists thorough success far from the madding crowd is not mr hardys first novel but it is so much more mature and powerful in every way than his earlier efforts that in them he seems rather to have been exercising himself with a view to obtaining a command of his materials this is particularly true of under the greenwood tree published some two years ago which the author called  a rural painting of the dutch school and in which he depicted rural life in an english county with the most loving minuteness and intimate fidelity of detail  a pair of blue eyes mr hardys next effort was not so exclusively pictorial it was a study of a more tragic kind with more complex characters and a more stirring plot but the evolution was none the less deliberate and every situation was worked out with the same painstaking and searching method both under the greenwood tree and a pair of blue eyes are very remarkable novels which no one could read without admiring the close and penetrating observation and pictorial and narrative power of the writer but far from the madding crowd is not only an advance upon them in freedom and firmness of handling but it excels them also in concentration of interest and in spacious breadth and solid truth of proportion when the first chapters of  far from the madding crowd appeared in the cornthill magazbine a supposition was started that this must be a new novel by george eliot and the point was very generally discussed indeed if those chapters stood by themselves as a fragment of unknown authorship no conjecture could be more plausible they deal with the kind of life that george eliot has more than once chosen to describe to which in fact she has almost acquired a prescriptive right and the opening description of farmer oak is a portrait very much in her manner if the critic cared to go into minute corroborations of such distinguished parentage he would find them in the incidents of bathshebas unpacking the mirror and taking a survey of her beauty while waiting on the top of the cart and her higgling over twopence with the tollkeeper these little incidents have a delicate spice of malicious truth to nature which one often finds in george eliots pictures at the same time if we had read mr hardys previous novels we need have had no difficulty in tracing the authorship of  far from the madding crowd for mr hardys style is his own and sufficiently distinctive to be easily recognised one might mistake a detached portion of his work for george eliots but when it is viewed as a whole it has a good many striking points of difference mr hardy is not such a master of language as george eliot his style has not the same freshness nor the same eloquence and momentum and this difference of style goes along with a more deeplyseated difference of matter mr hardy is much less of a preacher than george eliot his interests are more exclusively dramatic he is absorbed in delineating character and tracing the workings of passion by minute touches and does not withdraw from his dramatic work to deliver his soul of pentup reflections with all george eliots impartiality towards her creations and her desire to represent each ones life truly as it is nothing extenuating nor setting down aught in malice the heart of the preacher is to be detected in her choice of subjects her characters derive a large part of their interest from their opinions and views of life now the drama in mr hardys novels is in no sense a warfare of opinions or ideas it is a warfare of persons persons moved by the primaeval motives of love and jealousy far from the madding crowd is concerned with no deeper mysteries than womens hearts and how they are lost and won its story lies in country fields and farmhouses and occupies itself solely with the secular and social life of the inhabitants whether we regard this as a merit or a defect or a matter of indifference depends entirely on our conceptions of art and its functions but if we hold no dogma concern  ing the functions of art and approach mr hardys novel simply as a drama willing to believe that it need not be frivolous because it has no great lesson to teach it is impossible not to recognise the novelists power the plot of far from the madding crowd is of the simplest kind mr hardys art does not lie in the multiplication and complication of incidents but in the searching and complete way in which he traces the effect of each incident upon the thoughts and feelings of his personages the central figure all through is bathsheba everdenea marvellously welldrawn and difficult heroine who unites ha iunlits of her biblical namesake to an inner nature  is     i ius maut vl inne fak curiously compounded of shrewdness strongmined irankness and courage and decorous imperious wayward womanliness the two little incidents that occur on her first introduction to us her satisfied selfinspection in the mirror and her obstinate refusal to give the toilkeeper what he askedat once give us the clue to two sides of her character the novel may be viewed as a history of a struggle between impulsive womanliness and worldly good sense all bathshebas troubles coming from her beauty and consequent waywardness and vanity and the rectification coming from the homelier side when we first see her she is on her way to live with an aunt in whose neighbourhood lives a shepherd farmer named gabriel oak oak was a sturdy capable fellow neither ugly nor particularly welllooking who had raised himself by thrift sobriety and superior knowledge of his work from being a common shepherd to having a farm of his own he naturally fell in love with bathsheba and the account of h1i drein before going througlh the momentous ceremony of making a

B5653,"['8831810', '6655091', '3180846']",  a child of the jago by arthur morrison methuen  co realism is so often an excuse for immorality in what is called art that one can gladly praise mr arthur morrison for a realism which deals frankly with dirt brutality and crime his story is without plot a mere straightforward chronicle of a mt of life in the lowest class at the eastend of london it is told with great vigour and with powerful simplicity the author must no doubt seem to many to dwell too minutely upon details of fighting and to be tempted at times into exaggeration in the following horrible account of an affray between women the reader can hardly fail to mark the zest of the narrator norah walsh vanquished champion now somewhat recovered looked from a window saw her enemy vulnerable and ran out armed with a bottle she stopped at the kerb to knock the bottom off the bottle and then with an exultant shout seized sally green by the hair and stabbed her about the face with the jagged points blinded with blood sally released her hold on mrs perrott and rolled on her back struggling fiercely  but to no end for norah walsh kneeling on her breast stabbed and stabbed again till pieces of the bottle broke away the human frame can bear a great deal but if this description is taken literally it is pretty clear that sally must have been killed on the spot at another place it is said that a constable was laid low by a firegrate adroitly let drop from an upper window laid low may of course mean killed but if so the author for once fails to choose the plainest word if it does not the exaggeration is palpable many pages are devoted to elaborate accounts of free fights and one chapter describing a single combat furnishes the most disgusting passages in the book what is the object of it all those who have to pass their time in police courts or in the central criminal court know very well that villainy such as mr morrison depicts and worse exists in london the clergy of all denominations the officers of the chanty organisation society mr waughs society for protecting children and other societies and many philanthropists who work in the eastend have certainly not uah remiss in letting the world know what jsj on in places like the jago mr sorrison has nothing new to tell he is lycastic about the philanthropists who surely do not deserve his sarcasm if his aim is to beguile novelreaders into taking interest in the slums it is not to be commended the facts are known attempts have been made to attack the evils by rousing excited sentiment better directed efforts are not wanting and those who are in earnest must deplore the method of the novelist who dwells upon revolting details of blood and blows if the example of dickens is pleaded as a precedent it must he remembered that dickens went straight to a definite point and had something to reveal with mr morrison it is not so fortunately there is one bright spot in his pages he sincerely admires his father gturt who labours without much success hut with fine courage and perseverance the dedication of the book to mr jay the vicar of holy trinity shoreditch suggests an explanation of the word  jago  a child of the jago by arthur morrison methuen mr arthur morrison has drawn upon fresh material for this powerful and unequal story it is a steep desoent from the mean streets to the jago one to be indicated by a considerable deepening of the tints upon that lurid map of mr charles booths it means all the difference between respectability as an ideal rarely attained to and respectability as the memory of an ideal long ago forsaken for in the jago for one hundred years the blackest pit in london you touch the very bottom of the social scale the ultimate dregs and offscourings of humanity dealing thus as it now does with the extremes of filth and rapacity and cruelty mr morrisons style has dropped something of its old effectiveness powerful it is still and grimly humorous and scrupulously faithful but the quality of tragic restraint so noticeable in the earlier book has hardly fair play among conditions where the sheerest fidelity of expression can only read like extravagance tragedy indeed is wellnigh impossible in the jago for want of that conflict between good and evil out of which tragedy essentially springs there is no good at these levels to count for anything we are bound to say that we think there are passages in mr morrisons book where the brutality exceeds the limits of art the account for instance of the street fight between sally green and norah walsh is a thing which like certain scenes in le debdcle and one or two exceptional stories of mr kiplings stirs not the imagination but the gorge nevertheless it is in many ways a book of extraordinary merit for the remorseless vigour of the descriptions and for the dramatic power with which the writer has conceived entered into and maintained throughout the jago point of view to put this squalid record of robbery and murder as they are side by side with the fagin and bill sykes scenes in oliver twist is to get an object lesson on the difference between the realistic and the romantic conceptions of fiction mr morrisons genius we think is rather for the episodic than for the epic the book would have held together better if attention had been concentrated throughout upon dicky perrott who is admirably done and not divided as it is at the end between him and his villainous father mr weech the   fence who narks  and gets the reward of a  nark is a creation conscious that his picture is lacking in high lights he has introduced an heroic parson the rev henry sturt but the rev henry sturt has as little to do in the book as he was able to do in the jago and his real function seems to be to afford an opportunity for mr morrison to express his preference for the methods of the church in the slums over those of general booth or of toynbee hall  a child of the jago0   people are so very genteel arent they     but hang it all men like ourselves neednt talk as though the world was built of hardbake its a mighty relief to speak truth with a man who knowsa man not rotted through with sentiment by the mouth of the jago surgeon mr morrison has expressed his own attitude the mild sugary speech of philanthropists the comfortable complacency of westend slummers the blind absurd enthusiasm that looks to make the eastend into paradise by culturehe turns and rends them all for he knows that they have not seen have not dared to see the black slough of sin and cruelty and unspeakable wrong that lies beyond their efforts and their courage woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing  because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered mortar say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye 0 great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it it is an attitude only tolerable to the courageous it is a knowledge that would kill if it were forced on the feeble but the attitude and the knowledge must be a part of any true understanding of the world as it is made it is a recognition of a state of things desperate but not entirely hopeless he gives us dicky a young thief a man of the world an evil world at ten yet staunch spirited responsible and he sends father sturt in our way probably to show the kind of temper that has any chance of redeeming the dwellers in such a place of crime and misery sturt has no illusions he knows the worst of the district he has tenacity courage a keen sense of humour and cannot be humbugged it is no use paying mr morrison compliments at this time of day on his vigour and his unusual ability these must be everywhere acknowledged they are acknowledged by us very heartily but this new book of his has pages which it is almost impossible to read we do not combat his general attitude at all he does not pretend to tell the whole tale of eastend misery which has its genteel sides of course but he tells one awful chapter of it and we respect his sense of responsibility in doing so however much he shatters our complacency and our shallow convictions that alls right with the world we do not accuse him of exaggeration and as to his excesses of realism we can at least understand the temptation but to understand does not take away the right of protest and we do protest against the useless riot of brutality the orgies of physical violence which we are made witnesses of if we read the book through zola has never outdone some of the pages here in their horrible defiance of any sensitive feelings we may have but we declare our right to have these feelings respected if not pampered and our opinion that an unblinking perusal of these tales of brutal fights would show much more morbid efleminacy than any shrinking from them would do they are no necessary part of mr morrisons strenuous and courageous purpose but we must not part from the book with a censure for dicky the hero must be given his due in the midst of the sordid cruel desperate jago he grows up unashamed of it accepting its conditions ambitious of its honours a plant of the hideous soil yet a sturdy not unwholesome plant he has affection loyalty and endless courage mr morrison killed him not for the sake of his pathetic deathscene we are sure but because he loved him and his heart  1 a child of the jago by arthur morrison 6s

his part well and much lessens our reirnt at the want of mr seymours spirited hand  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club edited toy boz london chapman and hall 186 strand wa have before us seven numbers of a work which has attracted no little notice in the world of wit and which certainly deserves the serious attention of all laughterloving mortals these memoirs contain some account of the adventures of mr pickwick the founder and messrs tupman winkle and snodgrass three of the members of the club in search not of the picturesque like dr syntax but of information concerning men and manners for the instruction and edification of the members of the society of course the story is merely a framework in which to exhibit pictorial representations of the incidents which befell these gentlemen in the course of their travels the comedy is interspersed with some occasional touches of tragedy which we do not think by any means so felicitous in their execution as the lighter and more humorous parts and for poetry at least poetry of a serious character we recommend the author of these papers to eschew it for ever to borrow the words which he has put into the mouth of the supposititious creator of the lines on the  joy green when called upon to recite his offerings to the muse its a very slight affair and the only excuse i have for having ever perpetrated it is that i was a young man at the time the style of ideas brought into fashion bv monk lewis and sustained for a time by the vigorous pen and wild imagination of barry cornwall has long since been forsaken under the influence of returning good taste and consigned to the  tomb of all the capulets  and young poets should recollect that the uneven lines of thomas moore are excused only by their exquisite matter or by the kwill which h rendered a deformity of metre pleasing to the ear as a skilful composer will enhance the value of his harmonies by the occasional interposition of the harshest discords but such liberties with the rhythm of verse may only be taken by the lofty spirit of genius or the practised band of longtried ingenuity having thus blamed what we consider blameable it is but just that we should offer our meed of praise the scenes from life are sketched with considerable graphic power and rich humour showing an insight into the mechanism of human actions and a knowledge of the workings of that incomprehensible cause the mind which give a more interesting character to the fun and frolic of these racy pages than if they were mere farce unseasoned with the sharp relish of a strong satirical vein a scene in mimicry of the tranquil and digtified proceedings of a certain great house not a hundred miles from westminsterbridge is well worthy of perusal and in short if we were to particularise all that is good we should give the numbers of all the comic chapters and if we were to select a specimen of every variety of merry jest we should reprint half of the contents we give one extract which will serve to initiate our readers into the mysteries of the pickwick club and refer them to certain little monthly numbers which are displayed in green coats in the majority of the booksellers shops we have passed for some time since it should not be forgotten that the illustrations of the earlier numbers proceeded from the pencil of the waggish seymour but since his lamented and premature death they have been of course transferred to another operator the portion we have chosen is a description of the chain of untoward circumstances by which mister weller boots of the

without a murmur from the circumstance of two sturdy little boys having been repeatedly seen at tha gate of the back garden we have reason to suppose that sam has some family the elder mr weller drove a coach for twelve months but being afflicted with the gout was compelled to retire the contents of the pocketbook had been so well invested for him however by mr pickwick that he had a handsome independence to retire on upon which he still lives at an excellent publichouse near shooters hill where he is quite reverenced as an oracle boasting very much of his intimacy with mr pickwick and retaining a most unconauerable aversion to widows mr pickwick himself continued to reside in his new house employing his leisure hoars in arranging the memoranda which he afterwards presented to the secretary of the once famous club or in hearing sam weller read aloud with such remarks as suggested themselves to his original mind which never failed to afford mr pickwick great amusement he was much troubled at first by the numerous applications which were made to him hy mr snodgrass mr winkle and mr trundle to act as godfather to their offspring but he has become used to it now and officiates as a matter of course lie never had occasion to regret his bounty to mr jingle for both that person and job trotter became in time worthy members of society although they have always steadily objected taratara to tha scenes of their old haunts and temptations he is somewhat infirm now but he retains all his former juvenility of spirit aad may still be frequently seen contemplating the pictures in the dalwieh gallery or enjoying n walk about the pleasant neighbourhood on a fine day ha is known by nil the poor people about who never fail to take their hats off as he passes with great respect the children idolise him nnd so indeed deas the whole neighbourhood every year he repairs to a large family merrymaking at mr wardlea on this as on all other occasions he is invariably attended by the faithful sam between whom and his master there exists a steady aad reciprocal attachment which nothing but death will saver a preface which touches on some of the difficulties the author has had to contend with in his undertaking and a dedication are given in the last number the dedication is to mr sergeant talfourd  mm a slight and roost inadequate acknowledgment of the inestimable services he is rendering to the literature of his country and of the lasting benefits he will confer upon the authors of this and succeeding generations by securing to them and their descendants a permanent interest in the copywright of their works  the posthumous papers ofthe pickwick club edited by boz jno viii chapman and hall we continue to read these papers with great admiration of the easy original and unaffected powers displayed in them we should be ungrateful if we passed by the appearance of a new number without a word of notice and welcome there is no flagging in this number before us every stroke of the writers humour the most common or the most careless tells to a desired effect and that rarely mastered distinction between thc power of embodying the serious and the ludicrous is thoroughly mastered here we should say that the grave passages of the number even excel the comic tn the heartrending calamities of common life as in its sidesplitting oddities and humours the writer bids fair to show himself unrivalled the number opens with an impassioned rhapsody by a mysterious old lawclerk on the many miseries that have darkened the dingy old inns of court mr pickwick stares at him in silence the old gentleman resumes with a leer   look at them in another light their most commonplace and least romantic  what fine places of slow torture they are think of the needy man who has spent his all beggared himself and pinched his friends to enter the profession which is destined never te yield a morsel of bread to him the waitingthe hopethe disappointmentthe fearthe miserythe poverty the blight on his hopes and end to his careerthe suicide perhaps or better still the shabby slipshod drunkard am i not righi about them eh  and the old man rubbed his hands and leered as if in delight at having found another point of view in which to place his favourite subject mr pickwick eyed the old man with great curiosity and the remainder of the company smiled and looked on in silence  talk of your german universities said the little old man pooh pooh theres romance enough at home without going half a mile for it  only people never tb ink of it  i never thought of the romance of this particular subject before certainly said mr pickwick laughing  to be sure you didnt  said the little old man a of course not as a friend bit of it said he he died one morningw  his outer door fell with his head in his own letterbox and there he lay for eighteen months everybody thought he had gone out of town  and how was he found at last  hundred mr

ehich always preceded his entering into conversation with his master u it is not indeed som replied mr pickwick surveying the crowded j jhy street through which they were passing  its a wery remarkable circumstance sir said sam  that poverty and oysters always aeems to go together u l dont underataad you sam said mr pickwick a what i mean sir said sam  is that the poorer a place is the greater call there seems to be for oysters look here sir heres a oyster stall to efery halfdozen housesthe streets lined vith ern blessed if i dont think that ven a mans wery poor he rushes out of his lodgings and eats oysters in reglar desperation  to be sure he does said mr weller senior  and its just the same vith pickled salmon  those are two very remarkable facts which never occurred to me before aid mr pickwick  the very first place we stop at ill make a note of by this time they had reached the turnpike at mile end a profound silence prevailed until they had got two or three miles further on when mr weller senior turning suddenly to mr pickwick said  wery queer life is a pikekeepers sir  a what  said mr pickwick  a pikekeeper  what do you mean by a pikekeeper  inquired mr peter magnus  the old un means a turnpikekeeper genlmn observed mr weller in explanation  oh said mr pickwick  i see yes very curious life very uncomfortable  theyre all on em men as has met vith some disappointment in life said mr weller senior  ay ay   said mr pickwick  yes consequence of vich they retires from the world and shuts themselves up in pikes partly vith the view of being solitary and partly to rawenge themselves on mankind by takin tolls n deat me said mr pickwick  i never knew that before  fact sir said mr weller  if they was genlmn youd cali era misanthropes but as it is they only takes to pikekeepin all this is excellent but the wit of boz excellent as it is has not exhausted this subject of turnpikes he may return to it with some effect we look upon it as only another strong proof of their misanthropical turn for annoying and disappointing mankind that they are specially called trusts because they all declare  no trust it is malice and false pretence the elder mr weller acquits himself through the number in a manner infinitely worthy of his esteemed aad ingenious son we will close our extracts by quoting his touching farewell to sam when he is obliged to resume the reins for london   pm a goin to leave you samivel my boy and theres no telling ven i shall see you again your motherinlaw may ha been too much for me or a thousand things may have happened

i know i may trust you as veil as if it was my own self so ive only this here one little bit of adwice to give you if ever you no matter and pison to say to that pison yourself samivel my boy pison yourself and youll be glad on it afterwards with these affecting words mr weller looked steadfastly on his son nnd turning slowly upon his heel disappeared from his sight we see in this the foreshadowing of some deep and pathetic interest or other and wait impatiently for the ninth number of the papers of the pickwick  the posthumous papers of the pickwickian club indited by bo and the library of fiction  or lui utily story teller boz marches on triumphantly and has completely taken possession of the ear and of the hearts too of his countrymen his fifth number is joyous in the scenes of a contested election and the honest wonder and indignation ol the great mr pickwick at the venality he witnesses are charming the contents of the  story teller  this month are all good and two of the pieces are original the one jesse chile by miss mitford and  the alchymist by mr harvey this is really a great advance upon the last hoing thus this periodical cannot fail to do well  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club  containing a faithful record of thc perambulations perils travels adventures and sporting transactions of the correspotiding members edited by boz with illustrations the public have now had a full dozen of these papers and they are cager for a dozen more they seem to increase in interest and ability as they proceed instead of flagging they grow more uproarious in their fun and more rich in their drollery we like this number the best of any that have yet appeared still it has a striking fault and we shall take this opportunity of reading master boz a friendly lecture in public that we are quite secure he would not submit to in private when he brings his scenes home to us in their familiarity of everyday life he should always be not only strictly possible but even probable thus if an artist choose to paint a dragon or a chimera we give him a little latitude as to his proportions and the free use of his colours  but should he choose to paint a pig it must be a pig and nothing else but a pig that he paints or we shall pronounce his attempt a failure the trial scene that makes the interest of this volume is as familiar to his readers as is the appearance of a denizen of the sty  and everybody who reads it knows badly as much of our judicature is conducted that the verdict was not possible from the evidence produced this is a pity inasmuch as it has no thing to do with the humour of the proceedings if it were necessary for the following out of the story that the venerable and muchtobeidolized pickwick should be wrongfully cast in damages the evidence against him should have been made strongerthe misconception could easily afterwards have been explained away however ull this may not have struck the million but we will still maintain that however wild may be the fiction or rampant the humour of a literary production all the groundwork upon which it is erected such as the face of the country the manners of the time and the operations of public institutions should be strictly in accordance with truth  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club containing a faithful record of the perambulations ptriis travels adventures and sporting transactions of the corresponding members edited bv box with illustrations boz iroes on triumphing and has again proved to the world that the comic muse is not yet quite defunct the seventh number of this pickwickian risibility has more than rivalled the preceding six the sporting excursion on the 1st of september which was undertaken with all the strength of the club still more strong in its adjutant sam weller is one of the best things of the sort that we have ever read the impounding of the dignified leader in a barrow among the pigs and the asses in the tillage receptacle for the wandering is a happy hit and though a most powerful still a most probable one for quiet humour and keen satirical acumen the interview with the lawyers is really not to be stirpassed the next number promises us a rich treat wo are just admitted into the vestibule with the foldingdoors partially opened that are to disclose some rich scenesupon which we are impatient to enter  posthumous

illustrations very good this number the eleventh indeed sam weller improves upon acquaintance the world never saw drollery and wit offered to them before in a form so singular the renowned mr pickwick is himself the legitimate successor to don quixote  indeed he is the cockney quixote of the nineteenth century and instead of armour of iron he is encased in a good coating of aldermanie fat and instead of spear and sword has his own powers of declamation with which to go forth to do fearful hattie upon the swindler the wrongdoer and the oppressor of the innocent wc wish that the humorous boz would call to mind that the knight of la mancha was really the victim of a veritable flame we should like to see mr pickwick confess to the soft impeachment this gentlemans attendant has the process of mollification already going forward in his heartwe trust that it will not ascend to his head but that he will make love with the same effect that hitherto he does everything else wc know of no publication that is productive ot more genuine amusement than these pickwickian papers  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club edited by boz no ix chapman and hall this is the best pickwick we

magistrate going as dont commit himself twice as often as he commits other people at this sally another special laughed and then tried to look so tuperoatu rally solemn that the magistrate detected him immediately an inimitably humorous passage ensues in which it appears eer tain that the inst named unlucky special must have been committed  only that mr jinks who is the magistrates adviser having bad k legal education of three years in a country attorneys office whispers the magistrate that bc thinks it wouldnt do and so mr nop kins makes a speech and says that in consideration of the

true to nature than these extracts we have given we have great pleasure in quoting this just tribute to geuius from blackwoods magazinebut blackwood bas always had a generous sympathy with talent aod genius for its great writer is himself of the brotherhood44 but there are higher works of which twill be our hint to speakworks of poweray of geniussnd we must begin with bulwer his tame is fixed and on a wide foundation in his provinceand it is a noble oneis be since the death of the unapproachable u the foremost man of all the world   thc easiest and shortest way to prove that he is not would be to show who is privileged to take precedence ofthe author of paul cu ff tr j and eugene aram washington irving no cooper no his name does not occur to us at this moment but perhaps we may find it in the london beview  that posthumous payers of the pkhtrick cm edited by box no 7 chapman and hall this is beyond a doubt the most original and amusing series of comic sketches that have been published in our time and we are inclined to think the present number so far as they have gone the best of them the jest is kent up with excellent breadth of humour and a most studied insight into the niceties and peculiarities of character scene after scene is worked out as if on the spur of the occasion without much appearance of any previous bias or ultimate purpose but always broadly and powerfully and from a rich rein of comic invention the style continues racy and unaffected the writer reminds us frequently in his ingenuity in the vivacity of his talents in the wonderful local truth of his pictures and in the general accuracy of his observation and humour as well as in the ease and animation of his manner of the elder english comedies and farces he has a share of the ludicrous invention of vanbrugh and touch of the higher powers of wycherley the number before us opens with a serious imputation on the character of mr winkie whose friendly attentions to mrs pott the wife of the redoubted editor of the eatanstrill gazette were remarked upon in a previous number as mr winkle is sitting in mr potts breakfast room in all the unconscious simplicity of perfect innocence mr p enters and calls him a  serpent mr w very naturally supposes this to be a piece of pleasantry we recommend what follows to the reader in the hope that none of our contemporaries will suppose its allusions levelled at them   pleasantry sir  exclaimed pott with a motion of the hand indicative of a strong desire to hurl the britannia metal teapot at the head of his visitor u pleasantry sir but no i will be calm swill be calm sir and in proof of his calmness mr pott flung himself into a chair and foamed at the mouth  my dear sir interposed mr winkle  dear sir  replied pott  how dare vou address me as dear sir sir  how dare you look me in the face and do it   well sir if you come to that responded mr winkle  how dare yon look me in the face and call me a serpent sir   because you are one replied mr pott  prove it sir said mr winkle warmly  prove it a malignant scowl passed over the profound face of the editor as he drew from his pocket the independent of that morning and laying his finger on a particular paragraph threw the journal across the table to mr winkle that gentleman took it np and read as follows   our obscure and filthy contemporary in some disgusting observations on the recent election for this borough has presumed to violate the hallowed sanctity of private life and to refer in a manner not to be misunderstood to the personal affairs of our late candidateaye and notwithstanding his base defeat we will add our future member mr fizkin what does our dastardly contemporary mean  what would the ruffian say if we setting at naught like him the decencies of social intercourse were to raise the curtain which happily conceals his private life from general ridicule not to say from general execration  what if we were even to point ont and comment on facts and circumstances which are publicly notorious and beheld by every one but our moleeyed contemporarywhat if we were to print the following effusion which we received while we were writing the commencement of this artiele from a talented fellowtownsman and correspondent    lines to a brass pot   oh pott if youd known how false shed hare grown when you heard the marriage hells tinkle youd have done then i vow what you cannot help now and handed her over to w     v   what said mr pott solemnly what rhymes to  tinkle villain   what rhymes to tinkle  said mrs pott whose entrance at the moment forestalled the reply  what rhymes to tinkle  why winkle i should conceive and saying this mrs pott smiled sweetly on the disturbed pickwickian and extended her hand towards him the agitated young maa would have accepted it in his confusion had not pott indignantly interposed  back maamback said the editor  take his hand before my very face ln  mr p said his astonished lady  wretched

ingenious young man that sam said mr pickwick with a slight shudder  just was sir replied mr weller continuing his occupation of emptying the basket  and the pies was beautiful we began by describing an imputation on the character of mr winkle and we regret to say that before the number closes mr pickwick himself plays some opening passages in the part of defendant in an action for  breach of promise his visit to the office of messrs dodson and fogg is inimitably toldthe sketch of the clerks is finished adunguem but we must pass these and also the sharp lineaments of captain boldwig and likewise the choice spirits assembled at the magpie and stump for the purpose of introducing the father of mr weller and the scene of his affectionate recognition sam and mr pickwick have turned in for a few minutes to a house of refreshment by way of relief from thc toils of a very anxious afternoon m the room was one of a very homely description and was apparently under the especial patronage of stage coachmen for several gentlemen who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession were drinking and smoking in the different boxes among the number was one stout redmeed elderly man in particular seated in an opposite box who attracted mr pickwicks attention the stout man was smoking with great vehemence but between every halfdozen puffs he took his pipe from nis mouth and looked first at mr weller and then at mr pickwick then he would bury in a juart pot as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving and take another look at sam and mr pickwick then he would take another halfdozen puffs with an air of profound meditation and look at them again and at last the stout man putting up his legs on the eat and leaning his back against the wall began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all and to stare through the smoke at the new comers as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them at first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped mr wellers observation but by decrees as he saw mr pickwicks eyes every now and then turning towards lum he began to gaze in the same direction at the same time shading his eyes with nis hand as if he partially recognised the object before him and wished to make quite sure of its identity his doubts were speedily dispelled however for the stout man having blown a thick cloud hom his pipe a hoarse voice like some strange effort of ventriloquism emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his throat and chest and slowly uttered these sounds vy sammy  whos that sam  inquired mr pickwick  why i wouldnt ha believed it sir replied mr weller with astonished eyes  its the old un  old one said mr pickwick  what old one    my father sir replied mr weller  how are you my ancient and with this beautiful ebullition of filial affection mr weller made room on the seat beside him fbr the stout roan who advanced pipe in mouth and pot in hand to greet him  vy sammy said the father  i hant seen you for two years and better  nor more you have old codger replied the son  hows mother in law    vy ill tell you what sammy said mr weller senior with much solemnity in his manner  there never was a nicer woman as a widder than that ere second wentur o minea sweet cretur she was sammy and all i can say on her now is that aa she was such an uncommon pleasant widder its a great pity ahe ever changed her condition she dont act as a vife sammy  dont she though   inquired mr weller junior the elder mr weller shook his head as he replied with a sigh ive done t once too often sammy ive done it once too often the illustrations are excellent they are quite equal to the best attempts of mr seymour in the early numbers  the posthumous pt

w boz and thc library of fiction consisting of critical fssaijs talcs tad sketches of character wv notice these two works together because together they first appeared and together we are in the habit of receiving them at the beginning of each month but the race is all in favour of the pickwick club elderly though its members be and very obese its renowned chairman and sundry of its members  bo is making for himself a standard fame and this number is perhaps the best that luis yet appeared the witjif these papers is subtle and beneath the surface  their humour is not that of extravagance but of nature the laugh that the author has raised against the strenuous trilling oj antiquarianism is a fair laugh and it is exquisitely excited the whole thing is well clone and we shall say no more in the library of fiction the k diary of a surgeon does not improve  sandie saudeman the piper will be pleasing to a certain class of readers and of the nonoriginal papers we shall say nothing thc redeeming point of this number is tk the sybils stone by the author of the  gentleman in black though the idea has often been worked up before yet it is so pleasantly done that we do not regret its want of novelty we wish well to this periodical and we trust that in its next number it will put forth greater strength even the engravings are infinitely inferior to those of its pickwickian brother  the posthumous papers of the pickwick club by boz nos 1 to 6 chapman and hall as a lively caricaturist the author of these papers may take rank with some of the best comic writers in the language in hitting off the eccentricities of life few have excelled him his style is fresh and racy and has all the stamp of an original spirit the reader will thank us for the extracts we are about to make if he bas not already had the good fortune to meet with thc papers themselves the idea worked out is that of a  faithful record of the perambulations perils travels adventures and sporting transactions ofthe corresponding members of a cockney club founded by mr pickwick  for the promotion of science thc advancement of knowledge and the diffusion of learning the corresponding members consist of thc illustrious founder himself whose character is sustained throughout with a very romantic gravity and of messrs tupman snodgrass and winkle who are respectively distinguished by admiration ofthe fair sex a taste for poetry and a sporting turn the different parties play upon one anothers failings and into one anothers handsthc plot of their adventures is kept up with infinite liveliness bustle point and interestand many neb sources of the truly ludicrous are opened tne nature of mr pickwicvs observations on the various towns that are visited may be gathered from an abridgment of what he

delicious to those who are extremely fend of smoking a superficial traveller might object to the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it is truly gratifying our next extract is an admirable picture of a family party the travellers have been invited to the house of a goodhumoured country gentleman mr wardle some strokes of character in the following description of the scene of their reception are truly excellent for humour force and reality a very old lady in a lofty cap and faded silk gownno less a personage than mr wardle s motheroccupied the post of honour on the righthand comer of the chimneypiece and various certificates of her having been brought up ia the way ihe should go when young and of her not having departed from it when old ornamented the walls in the form of samplers of ancient date worsted landscapes of equal antiquity and crimson silk teakettle holders of a more modern period the au ut the two young ladies and mr wardle each vying with the other in paving zealous and unremitting attentions to the old lad crowded round her easy chair one holding her eartrumpet another an orange and a third a smellingbottle while a fourth was busily engaged in patting and punching the pillows which were arranged for her support on the opposite side sat a baldheaded old gentleman with a goodhumoured benevolent facethe clergy noan of dingley dell and next him sat his wife a stout blooming old lady who looked as if she were well skilled not only in the art and mystery ot manufacturing homemade cordials greatly to other peoples satisfaction but of tasting them occasionally very much to her own a little hardheaded ripstone pippinfaced man was conversing with a fat old gentleman n one corner ana two or three more old gentlemen and two or three more old ladies sat biltupright and motionless on their chairs staring very hard at mr pickwick and bis fellowvoyagers mr pickwick mother said mr wardle at the very top of his voice  ah maid the old lady shaking her head  i cant hear you  mr pickwick grandma  screamed both the young ladies together  ah  exclaimed the old lady well it dont much matter he dont grasping the old ladys hand care for an old ooman like me i dare say u i assure you maam said m r pickwick and speaking so loud that the exertion imparted a crimson hue to his benevolent countenance  i assure vou ma am that nothing delights me more than to see a lady of your time of life heading so fine a family and looking so young and well 44 ah  said the old lady after a short pause  its all very fine i dare ssy bot i cant bear him u grandmas rather put out now said miss isabella wardle in a low tone  but shell talk to vou presently mr pickwick nodded his readiness to humour the infirmities of age and entered into a general conversation with the other members of the circle  delightful situation this said mr pickwick u delightful echoed messrs snodgrass tupman and winkle  welt i think it is said mr wardle  there aint a better ipot o ground in all kent sir said the hardheaded man with the pippinface there aint indeed sirfm sure there aint sir  and the hardheaded man looked triumphantly round as if he had been very muck contradicted by somebody but had got the better of him at last 44 there aint a better spot o ground in all kent said the hardheaded man again after a pause u cent mullins meadows observed the fat man solemnly u mullios meadows  ejaculated the other with profound contempt  ah mullins meadows repeated the fat man  heglar good land that interposed another fat man  and so it is surely said a third fat man  everybody knows that said the corpulent host the hardheaded man looked dubiously round but finding himself in a minority assumed a compassionate air and said no more  what are they talking about  inquired the old lady of one of her granddaughters in a very audible voice tor like roany deaf people she never seemed to calculate on the possibility of other persons hearing what she said herself  about the land grandma  what about the land nothing the matter is there  u no no mr miller was saying our land was better than mullins meadows  how should he know anything about it  inquired the old lady indignantly u millers a conceited coxcomb and you may tell him i said so saving which the old lady ouite unconscious that she had spoken above a whisper drew herself up and looked carvingknives at the hardheaded delinquent  come come said the bustling host with a natural anxiety to change the conversationu w hat say you to a

was employed upon it when the fatal mania overtook him it is a heartrending subject that engraving and too exciting for the sensitive and overwrought nerves of misery might it not have been the one

B8197,"['4918137', '8464930']",  our library ta b l e framley parsonage by anthony trol i lope chwpman and hall 193 piccadillyit is as yet by no means decided what a novel should be there is a growing inclination to restrict the domain of the novel within narrower and narrower bounds novels with a direct moral purpose or a historic purpose or a scientific purpose are sure to be carped at by the critics an essay they sav is the right form in which to embody these high purposes an author ought not to foist his speculations upon the public in a manner necessarily so untruthful and incomplete then tragical subjects are said to be unfit for novels io choose a tragical subject is instantly pronounced to be a mark of illtaste an intricate plot is decried as impossible in real life carefully elaborated characters are held up as burlesques of human nature altogether it will be found that unfavourable criticisms generally point to the fact that the novelwriter has aimed at too much his plot or his characters or his speculations are overdone to say that the novel shall represent without overstepping the modesty of nature real human life is no longer a sufficient definition we are beginning to restrict it within very much narrower bounds some weeks ago we read in a critical journal a definition of what the novel should be which perhaps most of our modern school of critics would accept the writer stated that the only proper subjectmatter for the novel was the manners of the time in which it was written with great ingenuity he proceeded to show bow invaluable such books would be to historians of later ages who would thus have documents ready to their hands from which to cull those historical flowvers which so pleasantly bestrew their heavier pages  tom jones was cited as an example of this orthodox novel tom jones from which book we learn that swearing was more common in those days than in these and that the lighter vices were not so strictly kept behind the veil as they now arc if we accept this definition of the novel viz that it shall represent solely the manxerg of the time in which it is written then  framley parsonage is a model novel this with the other numerous works of mr trollope will be hailed by after ages as a priceless possession from its pages the future antiquary will learn among other curious fact that the contemporaries of mr trollope were accustomed under all circumstances whether of joy or grief to dress for dinner surely mr millais when he drew that personification of crinoline representing lucy nobarts in state of woe was in au humour of grim satire there could nqt be a better emblem of the book than this picture the pretty woeful face and claspd hands and jjtj pen4ant foot though this must be bloto4 id a godw breaker fashion squeezed into odd corners to give due prominence to that mountain of flounces are as the touches of real human nature which mr trollope has sparsely scattered on the ourskirts of his huge mass of conventionalism the story turns upon the inconveniences caused by a billacceptance and the disquiets arising from a loveaffair between a rich lord and the sister of his parsonfriend the bill with all its attendant expenses does not exceed a thousand pounds mark robarts who accepts it has an income of fifteen hundred ayear moreover all his friends are rich and are eager to lend him or to give him the thousand pounds in question one does not quite see why the affair should end in bailiffs taking possession of the parsonage furniture save that the exigencies of the story demand that little piece of excitement and that a moral is thus pointed how very much more shocking it is for a clergyman to suffer such misfortune than a layman with regard to the lovepassage between lucy robarts and lord lufton the only difficulty is that lady lufton his mother is supposed to be hostile to the match lucy will not accept ludovic until the consent of his mother is gained the mother never could or did refuse ludovic anything and so when he asks her to consent to the marriage she does consent why lucy should so often enter upon the scene woebegone in crinoline does not sufficiently appear there are the usual questions of conscience in the bookthe struggaes between duty and pleasure which lie at the bottom of all human stories here these take the form of casuistries as to what a parson ought to do or ought not to do how far may he act against the wishes of his patroness ought he to visit a bachelorduke does the presence of his bishop with him in questionable society render that society innoxious to himself  mtay he ride to the meet with a friend and if so may he cross one field after the hounds and if one how many more by how much its the wickedness of having anything to do with a bill increased by the party being clerical instead of lay we know of old that mr trollope takes a great interest in the clergy he tells us some where in this story with a somewhat grandiloquent gravity that his mission towards them extends only to consideration of their social relations not of their parish or diocese business we are glad his mission is so far limited in another place he hints that he has a scheme for the equalising of ecclesiastical incomes which scheme would seem to us to be an interference with ecclesiastical business in its most sacred point however we are spaed the unfolding of his scheme in  framley parsonage and so we have only to look at mr trollopes mission according to his own proclamationa mission to satirise gently the  social relations of the clerg  spare the rod and spoil the child quoth solomon and mr trollope when after mild castigation lie relegates this child to a fools cap and the corner performs these severities ostensibly with an eye to the chiids good we have often wondered w hat lie purposes in these constant inild satires we get always now in his hooks a flourish of trumpets when he is going to trot out a pearson isle has acbievel fame for that trick and it is always printed in his bills in the largest letters mr trollope in his famous act of parsonship is received with loud applause at the threshold of the arena and probably hisses would follow if hle substitutel any other performance for that timehonoured one tlhe lady  e art of his audience especially aplreciate this poking of fun at their pastors bishop proudie turned into an old panrtaloon is meat and drink to titem the wickedness of making fun of a bi8shop gives an exquisite edge to their delight we could understand that applause of this per forinance would make mr rollope repeat it also that habit would make limn repeat itit nust be very easy to do what he has been doing for half a life but when we find limn gravely hinting a high moral purpose in these exhibitions andl referring to his labours past and to come as giving him a claim to the gratitude of his countrymen we recur with double force to our old wondermentwhat is his object  is he a special enemy or a special friend to the parsons  did a parson ever injure him or are all his relations in the church does he think the parsons the only men worth warning in this wvicked age or does he think them the only men foolish enough and defenceless enough to he lashed by satire  or is it that he has some natural sympathy or antipathy anent them  some men are strongly affected by a cat or the singing i the nose of a bagpipes any how the parsons would be well rid of him that the question of parsondom in its social as well as its other relations is a difficult one and becoming more and more difficult yearly is pretty generally acknowledged but poking gentle fun at the manners and customs of the clergyman will not hell towards a settlement of the question it has long ago been pointed out that the pet parson holds as it were an intermediate position between the sexes male and femalehe is a weaker man he is a stronger woman and it is against this emasculate condition which has been forced upon our priest hood graduallynow by rampant platitudinarianismn now by rampant attitudinarianismthat our muscularians have risen in revolt such discussions as mr rollope brings forwardhow far a clergyman is justified in putting himself in the way of contaminationwhether his virtue is pure enough to resist seduction and strong enough to repel ravishmentwhether the pharisaical attitude of gathering ones garmelits about one is not the most becoming and the safest attitude for himsuch discussions take for granted the semifeminity of the clergy and propose only to decide what precise cross between breeches and crinoline would be their most fitting garb another novelist is fond of touching upon this parson questiontouching upon it in its social light and in an humorous manner if mr trollope cannot get cured of his itch parsonwards he would do well to study george eliots treatment of the subject to return to the hypothesis of manners being the proper subject of the novel accepting this we must inquire what manners are in the sense of our definition manners are the conventional habits of society society lives in london for so many months of the year at countryteats for so many hunts in leicestershire during this season fish in norway during that shoots in scotland or travels on the continent during another society has its boxes and stalls at the opera its entrance into certain houses it consists of lords and commoners anl of some few out of the lower world who gain admittance into society by reason of their great wealth higher dignitaries of the church are in society and during the countryseat season parishparsons gain entrance on a lower footing sometimes an apothecary or a lawyer is heard of there lbut either is sure to have a ludicrous name and a burlesque manner ladiesmaids and foot men and grooms play the broadly comic parts speaking a language peculiar to themselves alone the countryseat has its attendant village and so we hear of robin postman and mrs podgerss baby the town has terrible dens upon its outskirts whither wild young men resort and so we are introduced to the tozer family society consists of a few thousand people who all agree to live much in the same way and to do the same things probably among these few thousands there is genuine tragedy and farce enough to form the basis of as heartmoving a human story as has ever been written animal hetties and mystical dinabs godfrey casses devotees of favourablechance and silas marners godstricken we have them all in those higher walks of life made by the same maker creepitig on the same earth different only in that their clothes are finer and their grammar more precise but then these deeper commotions of life never rise to the smooth surface of mlanner lovesick lucy wears innumerable flounces and the flounces are the chief business of our novelist we want description of the savages warpaint not speculations as to his thirst for blood to say that there are no touches of nature in framley parsonage wvould be untrue but we do say that they are almost lost and swallowed up in the overwhelming floods of conventionality lucy is pleasantly drawn and sometimes her satiric utterances against herself express as well as can be her bitterness of heart thedevotion of mrs robarts in the bailiffscene is touching the spice of poetry that exists in sowerby gains instant acknowledgment in every heart as true the pride of crawley in its first conception is excellent but then fmr trollope has chosen to burlesque it with his flippant wit there are passages in this book so truthful so pathetic so humourous that they move those who are not admirers of the author to a tenfold impatience of the mass of twaddle in which they are buried the standard which the story sets up for itself is a false one there are no men and women in  framley parsonage  they are never viewed as men and women but only with regard to their relations to society the only conscience in the book is what will the world say the only morality  such conduct does not become such a position unfrock mark robarts anrd he does not exist deprive lord lufton of his title mliss dunstable of her wealth and they cease to be no doubt the accidents of life affect inen greatly but men do exist apart from these accidents we can take hetty strip her of her lowcly circumstances and raise her to the rank of a lady and she will remain the same hetty in maggie tulliver we have the very type of a nature always at war with the circumstances encompassing it but can we imagine lucy robarts lowercd to the station of hetty  does she not disappear entirely when we take from her her educated sharpness of tongue and her conventional notions of propriety  it is because mr frollopes characters are not men and women hut effects of given circumstances only that be errs so greatly in bringing them again and again upon the stage he has not the wonderful talent to show a beatrix esmond developed into a baroness bernstein  i   we have said enough about mr trollope to show that we differ from all the world in our estimate of his novels he is now perhaps the most popular of our modern novelists his name heaven save thc mark is coupled with the toast of english literature at literary dinners is novelwriting the highest branch of literature  and have we no dickens or thackeray to represent it if it is rumour promises us another novel from his hand in the pages of the cornhill his orley farm illustrated by an artist once our first is on every drawingroom table mnr trollope is at the height of his fame we prophesy that he will live to see his novels rated at their worth that we should return to an admniration of the fashionable novel long since buried beneath worthier fictions now resuscitated in all its flimsy flippancy is not a good sign ja i  rr tile literary examiner 7 itklei i unonage by anthony trollope author of  barchester towers c c with six illustrations by t e millais ra in three volumes smith elder and co the warden and barchester towers are the only novels of mr trollopes better than framley parsonage it has been said that every man if he could write it has one good novel in bin barchester tower is a sequel to the warden and framley parsonage is an appendix to them both it is in as far as they resemble the warden that the sequel and appendix claim preeminence because they contain the particular novel that seems to have been according to this notion in mr trollope or that which it was in his nature to write better than another man however superior he might be in genius could have written it his sketches of clerical life are his own when writing upon other topics he is always clever lively and observant but the limits to his power are more clearly manifest mr anthony trollope is not in the highest sense a man of genius in all his works best and worst perhaps there is not a touch of original fancy as far as it is possible for a no ve 1st to be without invention he is without it there is nc ingenuity in the construction of his stories the sketches of character on which they depend for their value are the result of shrewd observation cleverly expressed in everyday phrase never of any subtle or peculiar insight into character a remark that a square forehead expresses intelligence rather than thought or that most eyes are green may be said to represent the utmost stretch of mr trollopes subtlety these are such individual opinions and notes of observation as one may hear daily from a b c and d at any dinnertable without wondering at a b c or ds profundity but they are always lively and clever in expression always therefore acceptable again in the inability to represent strong passion mr trollope shows his want of the insight that belongs to genius the passion of lucy hobarts in framley parsonage when she pours out her secret misery of a baulked love to her sisterinlaw is an example of this she speaks of herself as having been  bowled over like a ninepin when she was so sure that she  should never be missish and spoony and sen ti  mental calls herself an unutterable ass and so forth all which is of course very manly and preserves the author from all risk of being himself considered to write spoony love passages but it does not represent the passion of a woman even when she as lucy is here doing hysterically mocks at her own grief there is no want of hearty feeling in the book a healthy human sense of what he has fairly seen and entered into with full understanding in the course of life is no mean part of the strength of this as of all mr trollopes novels the author is no doubt too much at the usual level of society in observation and expression to admit of pathos in his writings they do not even contain any flashes of the wit with which not a few men who do not write are able to enliven social intercourse but when he is at home with his subject and it represents a cause that has his sympathy mr trollopes clear expression of a wholesome human feeling makes its wsy home to the readers heart there is force then snd there is some force everywhere in the literalness on which he depends necessarily for his power as a novelist the literalneeb let it be leceembered of a thoroughly quickwitted and observant man mr tieheee is et his heat we hewe laid when writs of the clergy not of the bench of bishops for his bishop is a feeble caricature but of the leaser dignitaries of the cathedral close their wives and daughters and not of these only as framley parsonage shows the picture of mark roberts the young country rector too early possessed of a good living who is tempted into the fast set of country society beguiled by an embarrassed county member and led through weakness of character to risk the very existence of a home to which he is attached j with his whole heart is excellent the domestic sulo ofhis nature is well kept in view and even when ho  known in thc county as a hunting parson we ay mario to understand together with his weakness the dornotio qualities and the religious nature underlying p the sketch of the generous impulsive wife and a nr rc el ornate study of the not less generous friend and neighbour tidy j lufton patroness of the living whose son was marks j schoolfellow and is his friend are simply fault ss the j little weaknesses and the great strength of a relined womanly nature in lady lufton thc simple and iojd j hearted prejudices the pleasant airs nf patronage always a part of the true dignity with which she is inviterthe1 generous conquests of prejudice and temper and though gentle j sacrifices that come of the love ot a widow ibr her on iv son are combined in the character of lady linton with i deli  cacy of touch that is perhaps only the more admirably true j and effective for that literalness of manner upon which we have just dwelt lord luftonher handsome and good1 natured son who falls for a short time into the hands of i the philistines and mr sowerby the embarrassed county i member whose estates are mortgaged to whom little bills are a necessity of daily life and who with unprincipled goodnature never with malice ruins himself and swindles his friends represent also thoroughly well certain forms of life the weakest parts of the book are those which affect political satire the meeting at gatherum castle  all that relates to the immensity of tom towers to the jupiter and to mr harold smith who becomes lord petty bag or to the parliamentary struggle described as a contest between the gods and giants is feeble and confused the blending of false names of party leaders with the most resent dates the triviality of the particular alludion sometimes blended with a clumsy and exaggerated general satire represent the defective side of mr trollopes literalness it may please some readers to congratulate themselves on their own cleverness in identifying with lord brougham the lord boanerges who explains the philosophy of soap bubbles to mis dunstable at that assembly at gatherum castle about which the readers curiosity was raised only to bc disappointed utterly but mr trollope makes visible no reason that he could have had in art as a writer or in politics as a satirist for an introduction of lord brougham in that place neither is the passing sketch of him in any respect clever this criticism applies to everything that may have been meant for political satire in framley parsonage the chapter on the triumph of the giants is kindred in its affectation and clumsiness to some of the classical chapter headings and to the silly opening of the penultimate chapter entitled nemesis by introducing nemesis as  peen a that just but rhadamanthine goddess  whom we moderns ordinarily call punishment or nemesis  when we wish to speak of her goddessship straight j forward and sensible as he is owing much of his popularity i to the fact that he is the cleverest of novelists who with j out being more subtle than most of their neighbours speak j to the world in their own way out of a shrewd head and a sound heart mr trollope still has affectation  oe conquered there is one very noticeable but necessary osequence of this wandering beyond the true bounds of hi  skill by a writer who for his knowledge of character depends j on clever and genial observation rather than on what may be called the intuition of genius ft is that the distinctest men and women side by side with the most shadowy abstractions people the same book ieverything is real at framley there is an admixture of mei  ghosts at chaldicotes and they are all ghosts at gahrrunir castle while as for the town gods and giants they aro as like anything in life as mr trollopes articles suppose to have been written

a literary family suffering obviously from the 1 cacoethes scribendia very unfortunate complaint for people of sinall parts to labour under we should almost be inclined to suppose that i the tenant of wildfell hall  is a family affair in which each member of the said literary family from the young inan who has just begun to shave down to the schoolboy who has a monstrous liking for i a jolly row has had a scratch each adding an incident in his own fashion the difference of style is obvious throughout the whole of the novel and the effect is by no means pleasing but it would be too severe to say that there is no good writing in the tenant of wildfell hall for we now and then stumble upon some fine flashes of sentiment which like an occasional gleam of sunshine on a showery day puzzles us to think where it can come from whilst at the same time we occasionally meet with some touches of nature which are well put together and like the oasis in the desert refresh the readers wearying soul with the plot of 1 the tenant of wildfell hall we shall not meddle for what seems to have somewhat perplexed the author will necessarily puzzle the reader but may simply state that t1he  tenant is a certain widow lady who seenis to have attracted the attention of the surrounding gentlemen with one or two of whomn she appears disposed to coquet in a manner not quite so creditable as the formalities of society will warrant mrs graham the widow lady in question lives at wildfell hall with an old female servant and occupies that portion of her time which is not spent in the company of

supported by leathern gaiters and anklejacks paying a visit one evening to the hall for the purpose of ascertaining how mrs graham might be disposed to pocket certain slanders involving her fair fame which appear to have been rife in the neighbourhood the widow manifests a certain uneasiness at his presence which has the effect of procuring his speedy retreat and here we shall let this youth speak for himself at the same time gladly giving him credit for more refinement than the v arm generally produces  but i gave one look back before i closed the door and saw her leaning forward on the table with her hands pressed against her eyes sobbing convulsively yet i withdrew in silence i felt that to obtrude my consolations then would only serve to aggravate her sufferings i to tell you all the questionings and conjectures the fears and hopes and wild emotions that jostled and chased each other through my mind as i descended the hill would almost fill a volume in itself but before i was half way down a sentiment of strong sympathy for her i had left behind me had displaced all other feelings and seemed imperatively to draw me back i began to think why am i hurrying so fast inl this

towards the gloomy object of attraction something called me nearernearer stilland why nqt pray  might i not find more benefit in the contemplation of that venerable pile with the full cloudless heaven shining so calmly above it with that warm yellow lustre peculiar to a warm august night and the mistress of my soul within than in returning to mv home where all comparatively was light and life and cheerfulness and therefore inimical to me in my present frame of mind and the more so that its inmates all were more or less imbrued with that detestable belief the very thought of which made my blood boil in my veins and how could i endure to hear it openly declared or cautiously insinuated which was worse  i had had trouble enough already with some babbling fiend that kept whispering in my ear it may be true till i had shouted aloud 4 it is false  i defy you to make me suppose it  1 i could see the red firelight dimly gleaming from her parlour window i went up to the garden wall and stood leaning over it with my eyes fixed upon the lattice wondering what she was doing thinking or suffering now and wishing i could speak to her but one word or even catch one glimpse of her before i went there is sonmething very truthful and lifelike in the preceding and following extracts which is told in a tone of thought and feeling natural and upsophisticated but  i had not titus looked and wished and wondered long before i vaulted over the barrier unable to resist the temptation of taking one glance through the window just to see if she were more composed than when we parted and if i found her still in deep distress perhaps i might venture to attempt a word of comfortto utter one of the many things i should have said before instead of aggravating her sufferings by my stupid impetuosity i looked  her chair was vacant so was the room but at that moment some one opened the outer door and a voiceher voicesaid  come out i want to see the moon and breathe the evening air they will do me good if anything will  here then were she and rachel coming to take a walk in the garden i wished myself safe back over the wall  i stood however under the tally holly beach which standing between the window and the porch at present screened me from observation but did not prevent mne from seeing two figures come forth into the moonlightmrs graham followed by another not rachel but a youngt man slender and rather tall oh  heavens how my temples throbbed intense anxiety darkened my sight but i thoughtyes and the voice confirmed itit was mr lawrence  you should not let it worry you so much helen said he i will be nmore cautious in future  and in tinme  i did not hear the rest of the sentence for he walked close beside her and spoke so gently that i could not catch the words my heart was splitting with hatred  but 1 listened in tently for her reply i heard it plainly enough  but i must leave this place frederick she said  i never can be happy here nor anywhere else indeed she added with a mirthless laugh  but i cannot rest here now we condemn scenes like this in inferior novels upon principle here is a plain and palpable laxity of moral that even the most skilful novelist would find difficult to deal with much more so young a writer as mr acton bell even admitting that a subsequent eclaircissement miglht set matters straight here is an appearance of evil which is highly obtjectionable and seems to answer no other purpose in the construction of the plot than to give place to a scene of the most inconceivable impossibility which we shall presently extract it is in our opinion a great mistake to suppose that in order to secure success as a romancist an author must pander to they vices of the age and endeavour to display in most gaudy but deceptive colours those points of the human character vhich are most objectionable and least worthy of imitation there can be no doubt that owing to the somewhat vitiated taste of the romancereading public incidents of a somewhat questionable nature possess charms of unusual interest and as a matter of course young writers in order to be read seize such subject for their lucabrations as will admit of the introduction of points of character which really have nothing to iln terest one in their behalf but their vice but this is bad and in young writers particularly so it shows how little they depend upon their own talents to interest the reader in short how little confidence they have in themiiselves which we regard as very essential to success but we shall make one inore extract froin mr bell in order to show why we find fault mr gilbert markham the  gentlemnan farmer  the reader wotw of having had the satisfaction of seeing the lady on whom his affections are bestowed taking a midnight walk with another young gentleman has the happiness to meet his rival on his s pretty grey poney the twaddle that follows is almost too silly even to satirise but in order that our strictures may not be considered unjust we shall append an extract the italics and notes of admiration being our own as i trotted along however chewing the cud of bitter fancies i heard another horse at no great distance behind me but i never conjectured who tihe rider might be or troubled mv head about him till on slackening my pace to ascend a gentle aclivity or rather suffering my horse to slacken his pace into a lazy walk  for lost in my own reflections i was letting it jog on as leisurely as it thought proper i lost ground and my fellow traveller overtook me he accosted me by name for it was no strangerit was mr lawrence  instinctively the fingers of my whiphand tingrled and grasped their charge with convulsive energy  but i restrained the impulse and answering his salutation with a nod attempted to push on but he pushed on beside me and began to talk of the weather and the crops 1 gave the briefest possible answers to his queries aild observations and fell back he fell back too and asked if my horse was lame  i replied with a look at which he placidly smiled    this looks something like a climax and reminds us very much of the proceedings generally adopted by two dogs prior to a commencement of hostilities in the street when each is afraid to begin but our friend the  gentlemanfarmer girts up his loins right manfully and goes on to says i grasped my whip with more determination and energy than before  but still forbore to raise it and rose in silence waiting for some more tangible cause of offence before i opened the floodgates of my soul and poured out the dammedup fury that was foaming and swelling within smarkham said he in his usual quiet tone  why do you quarrel with your friends because you have been disappointed in one quarter  you have found your hopes defeated  but how am i to blame for it i warned you beforehand you know but you would not  he said no more for impelled by some fiend at my elbow i had seized my whip by the small end andswift and sudden as a flash of lightningbrought the other down upon his head continuing in this silly tone of nambypambyism for it really is nothing else our author proceeds to describe the feelings of the valiant  gentlemanfarmer whose sympathy for his fallen foefor lawrence tumbled out of his saddle it seeinsand whose courage and manliness have already engaged the kindly feeling of the reader he says that the  little grey pony somewhat astonished no doubt at this extraordinary proceeding  kicked and capered a little and quietly cropped the grass off the hedgebank having  made use of its freedom to do so mr markham gallops off leaving lawrence sitting in the road blowing his nose having some compunctions of conscience however he returns to the spot where he finds his rival with his handkerchief still at his nose but let the gallant hero tell his own story in his own style i dismounted however and having fastened my own animal to the nearest tree first picked up his hat intending to clap it on his head but either he considered his head unfit for a hat or the hat in its present condition unfit for his head for shrinking away the one he took the other from my hand and scornfully cast it aside i its good enough for you i muttered my next good office was to catch his pony and bring it to him which was soon accomplished for the beast was quiet enough in the main and only winced and flirted a trifle till i got hold of the bridle but then i must see him in the saddle  here you fellowscoundreldogaive me your hand and ill help you to mount no he turned from me in disgust i attempted to take him bv the arm he shrank away as if there had been contamination in my touch  what you wont  well you may sit there till doomsday for what i care but i suppose you dont want to lose all the blood in your body ill just bind that up for you  let me alone if you please   but we will not weary the reader with more of such twaddle as this nor shall we stop to speculate on the gross absurdity of such scene as this even allowino all reasonable latitude for the rambling brains of a romantic writer but shall conclude that no intelligent person can possibly be interested by incidents such as we have just extracted being so glarinfly improbable in their action the  tenant of wildfell mall is evidently mademanufactured and that too in a very clumsy manner and though we cannot and will not state that it is  a tale told by an idiot we are compelled to say that it is  full of sound and fury and that of a very silly and mawkish deqcnptionand most decidedly that it  signifies nothing  i the tenant of 9ildfeu hau byacton bell newby  like the other novels by the bells there is much to object to in this there are unnatural personages and isolated specimens it is a tale of wonders and eccentricities in which something of atrocity is mixed yet does it rivet the attention only its picturings offend and they merely on account of their truthfulness it is not always advisable to tell the truth disgusting truths had indeed better be concealed when their revelation has a tendency to corrupt it was the error of sir edward blulwers lucretia that it brought to light certain modes of life which it would have been wise to leave to the political reformer and the agent of moral improvement in wildfell hall a wouldbe widow falls in love with another man while her dissipated and reckless husband lives now this is not a spectacle for young minds to dilate upon boardingschool misses would be apt to misconstrue it and model it into a virtuous and justifiable revenge no amount of beautiful writingno intermixture of refined and elevating thoughts can counteract the evil which the introduction of such a character is calculated to work in its plot wildfell hall is well constructed the narrative is vigorously sustained and the incidents are of the absorbing class that is sure to obtain popularity for an author we trust that in future mr acton bell will be less maladroit and avoid the slaughtering of his own handiwork an extract or two will show how near to the style of currfr bell is the composition of this talewildfvlil hall near the top of this hill about two miles from lindencar stood wildfell hall a superannuated mansion of the elizabethan era built of dark grey stonevenerable and picturesque to look at but doubtless cold and gloomy enough to inhabit with its thick stone mullions and little laticed panes its timeeaten airholes and its too lonely too unsheltered situationonly shielded from the war of wind and weather by a group of scotch firs themselves half blighted with storms and looking as stern and gloomy as the hall itself behind it lay a few desolate fields and then the brown heathclad suinmitof the hill before it enclosed by stone walls and entered by an iron gate with large balls of grey granitesimilar to those which decorated the roof and gablessurmounting the gateposts was a gar denonce stocked with such bard plants and flowers as could best brook the soil and climate and such trees and shrubs as could best endure the gardeners torturing shears and most readily assume the shapes lie chose to give themnow having been left so many years untilled and untrimmed abandoned to the weeds and the grass to the frost and the wind the rain and the drought it presented a very singular appearance indeed the close green walls of privet that had bordered the princial walk were twothirds i withered away and the rest grown beyond all reasonable bounds the old boxwood swan that sat beside the scraper had lost its neck and half its body the castellated towers of laurel in the middle of the garden the gigantic warrior that stood on one side of the gateway and the lion that guarded the other were sprouted into such fantastic shapes as resembled nothing either in heaven or earth or in the waters under the earth but to my young imagination they presented all of them a goblinish appearance that harmonised well with the ghostly legends and dark traditions our old nurse had told us respecting the haunted hall and its departed occupants and here is a domestic pictire i with too late for tea but my mother nad kindly kept too teapot and muffin warm upon the bobs and though she scolded me a little readily admitted my excuses and when i complained of the flavour of the overdrawn tea she poured the remainder into the slop basin and bade rose put some fresh into the pot and reboil the kettle which offices were performed with great commotion and certain re markable comments  well if it had been me now i should have had no tea at allif it had been fergus even he would have had to put up with such as there was and been told to be thankful for it was far too good for him but youwe cant do too much for youits always soif theres any thing particularly nice at table mamma winks and nods at me to abstain from it and if i dont attend to that she whispers  dont eat so much of that rose gilbert will like it for his

make that pie a large one rose i dare say the boys 11 be hungry and dont put so much pepper in theyll not like it im sureor  rose dont put so many spices in the pudding gilbert likes it plainor  mind you put plenty of currants in the cake fergus likes plenty if i say well mamma i dont im told i ought not to think of myself you know rose in all household matters we have only two things to consider first whats proper to be done and secondly whats most agreeable to the gentlemen of the house any thing will do for the ladies   and very good doctrine too said my mother  gilbert thinks so im sure a very convenient doctrine for us at all events said i  but if you would really study my pleavure mother you must consider your own comfort and convenience a little more than you doas for rose i have no doubt shell take care of herself and whenever she does make a sacrifice or perform a remarkable act of devotedness shell take good are to let me know the extent of it but for you i might sink into the grossest condition of selfin dulgence and carelessness about the wants of others from the mere habit of being constantly cared for myself and having all my wants anticipated or immediately supplied while left in total ignorance of what is done for meif rose did not enlighten me now and then and i should receive all your kindness as a matter of course and never know how much i owe you  ah and you never will know gilbert till youre married then when youve got some trifling sees cornceited girl like eliza millward careless of every thing but her own immediate pleasure and advantage or some misguided obstinate woman like mrs graham ignorant of her principal duties and clever only in what concerns her least to knowthen youll find the difference  it will do me good mother i was not sent into the world merely to exercise the good capacities and good feelings of otherswas i but to exert my own towards them and when i marry i shall expect to find more pleasure in making my wife happy and comfortable than in being made so by her i would rather give than receive  oh thats all nonsense my dearits mere boys talk that  youll soon tyre of petting and humouring your wife be she ever so charming aid then comes the trial  well then we must bear one anothers burdens  then you must fall each into your proper place youll do your business and she if shes worthy of you will do hers but its your business to please yourself and hers to please you im sure your poor dear father was as good a husband as ever lived and after the first six months or so were over i should as soon have expected him to fly as to put himself out of his way to pleasure me he always said i was a good wife and did my duty and he always did hisbless him he was steady and punctual seldom found fault without a reason always did justice to my good dinners and hardly ever spoiled my cookery by delayand thats as much as any woman can expect of any man   hypocrite   i exclaimed and he held his breath and looked very blank turned white about the gills and went away without another word  you must not stay long gilbert said she when the door was closed upon us  im not going to said 1 somewhat testily  the tenant of wmildfell hall mir bells new novel ba acton bell london newby tif names of acton bell currer bell and else bell are no1w pretty generally recognised as mere noms le guerre in the literary world the novels lately published by these supposed individuals or at least those which have the names of the first two of the three are too palpably the wtork of one hand to deceive even the unpractised critic while few people would doubt that that hand belonged to a woman and as wve suspect a yorkshirewoman jane eyre is the best known of all the tales hearing the bell designation  and the last that has conme forth from the same source is the story whose title is the tenant of wildfell hall these two are indeed so strikingly alike in sentiment style and general mnodes of thought that the criticisms which apply to one of them are almost equally applicable to the other that the author is a clever and vigorous writer the popularity of jane eyre is a fair proof she has also a certain marked tone of mind which has impressed itself upon her books and rendered them more individual and clharacteristic than the ordinary run even of clever novels and for the sake of the morals of the novelreading public we hope that this their peculiar feature has been the real cause of their attractiveness to manye readers and not that truly offensive and sensual spirit which is painfully prominent both in jane fpyre and in the tale now before uts we should be sorry to believe that sympathy wvith the authoress s personages or approval of her principles had any thing to do with the interest which her books are calculated to excitc in those who are wearied wvith the cloying monotonousnesses of the average rtun of novels and who are fascinated with every thing and any thin that is new jane eyre is indeed one of the coarse3t books whiclh we ever perused it is not that the professed sentiments of the writer arc absolutely wrong or forbidding or that the odd sort of religious notions which she puts forward are much worse than is usual in popular tales it is rather that there is a certain perpetual tendency to relapse into theat class of ideas expressions and circumstances hichi is most connected with the grosser and more animal portion of our nature and that the detestable morality of the most prominent character in the story is accompanied with every sort of palliation short of unblushing justification the heroine who tells the story and who cer tainly is iuiade to paint herself anl her comi panions with very considerable force and skill is as utterly unattractive and unifeminine a specimen of her sex as the pen of noovelist ever drew the teniant of wfeildrl hail is also a species of autobiography one third of the story is toll by thc lhero a kind of gentleman farmer whose morals religion cultivation aiid talents are about on a par with those of jane eyre herself and the other two thirds consist of the diary of the lady with whom lie falls in love not knowing that though living in solitude she is really married to a living husband throughout the whole book there does not appear a single character who has the power to interest the sympathies of the reader all are commonplace vulgar rough brusquemannered personages whatever their supposed station in life while the scenes which the 1eroine relates in her diary are of the most disgusting andl revolting species she is married to a man of family and fortune to whom she chose to link herself against the w ishes of iter fricnds and who speedily turns out a sensual brute of the most intolerable kind andl treats her with every indigniity insult and ill usage which can be conceived slhort of actual personal violence 11er diary is the record of what she endured at his hands anl dtailk with offensive minuteness the disgustine scenes of debaucher blasphemy and lrofaneness inl whichl with a herd of boon companjions he lelighted to spend his days by and by of course lie dies and the authoress gives us one of those pictures of a deathbed which are tneither edifying nor true to life nor full ol warning to the careless and profligate in the end the hero and heroine nmarry after a courtship conducted with that peculiar bluntns anld roughness of conduct and language which is the characteristic of all thia writers creations nevertheless on the whole we should say that the tenant of wildfell lall is not so 1xad a book as jane eyre there is not such a palpable blinking of the abominable nature of the morality of its most prominent characters the hero and heroine are people of decent intentions and though the same offensive element of interest so to call it occurs in both of the tales and in each our sympathies are unwittingly engaged for an attachment formed by a married person before death had dissolved the first contracted bonid yet the subject of this second passion in the last published story is more conscious of its real natture thaij in its predecessor

how far the intentions of a novelist should be impenetrablewhat light should glimmer at the end of his shadowy vistaswhat clues should be afforded to the pilgrims of romance of course no ono is tempted on by utter darkness yet in a tale which appeals simply to one element in the imaginationcuriosity it is a proof of defective development if we at ouce anticipate the catastrophe the secret is buried not dead but its coffin is of crystal having said so much we are in no fear of abating the interest likely to be aroused by the sibylline words dead secret what is perplexing on the titlepage

the servant swears neither to destroy nor to take out of the house while she is about to vow also to deliver it to the person mentioned in the address mrs treverton expires and sarah leeson is left free to reserve the deadly revelation from her perturl xx i agony the simple reader might surmise a tragic concatenation of crime and sin but the more experienced fancy flies off instantly to some cloud that hangs over the cradle of rosamond treverton however sarah leeson after visiting a miners tomb from which glances another ray of premature disclosure hides her paper in the myrtle room of

degree the progress of mrs frankland and her spouse is interrupted by an interesting event a young frankland is born into the world and from among the aliens in an utterly alien locality who should emerge like an ilian goddess from the clouds but sarah leeson under an altered name the dramatist thrusts in the coincidence not very adroitly sarah otherwise mrs jazeph is engaged as nurse and her conduct in the twilight etherscented cluunber of birth is such as naturally provokes in the semiconvalescent ladys mind a belief that instead of being wise her new attendant is insane innumerable changes of colour undirected driftings about the room twitches of the countenance burning but surreptitious tears an attempt to steal a memorial ribbon and a whisper when you go to porthgenna keep out of the myrtle room corroborate mrs franklands suspicion that mrs jazeph is a lunatic anti render assurance doubly sure on the part of the reader that sarah leeson is present theatrically making over the memory of her secret concealed in the myrtle room dismissed from the inn as likely to damage the patients nerves she hurries to cornwall and attempts to remove the mysterious dooument but imagined ghostly influencesa favourite machinery with mr wilkie collinscombine with other accidents to prevent her and in due course rosamond frankland arrives at her ancestral tower stimulated to curiosity by the words of her wild nurse and still more by the intelligence that the fearful woman had preceded her on the truro road she explores the pile ransacks its apartments and finally discovers herself to be the daughter not of captain and mrs treverton but a lovechild of sarah leeson and the miner in the tomb imposed by the exactress upon her credulous husband conscientiously she bears the legal consequences of tinapocalypse but at a convenient moment forty thousand pounds sterling arrive in an envelope from a misanthropic connexion and although cypress shallows wave over the close of the second volume the novel concludes felicitously with a very pretty moral the resurrection of the secret after all brings no terrible consequences in fact too much is made of too little mystery now this story although an exaggeration of melodrama is cleverly told the writing is keen spirited graced occasionally with happy allusion and equal to the exigencies of the slowlymoving incidents but the slow movement w allude to is a signal defect in mr collinss method there is an abundance of pale dutch painting bestowed upon trivial objects  we detect continually where touches have been elaborately multiplied to deepen the pathos to intensify the mystery to finish the dramatic parts so much patient manipulation has been devoted to every chapter that it is with unaffected regret we confess the result to be not commensurate with the authors ambition after reading and rereading an entire novel by so proficient a writer as mr collins we are disappointed to find that no character has left an impression upon us and that not a single epigrammatic saying has been added to our memory what we do recollect and admire is the jiower of certain dramatic passages which if the action were more rapid would make the blootl tingle as the narrator proceeded with his btory the construction is everywhere excellent although ujon tqo large a scale now and then when the artist seems inspired by his own creation some real and noble tenderness suffuses a scene of love and penitence and sorrow wo quote one example of mr collinss best manner as exhibited in  thc dead secret the passage is descriptive of rosamond at her mothers deathbed the western clouds wore their quiet twilightcolours already the close of day had come the moment she moved in the chair she felt her mothers hand on her shoulder when she turned again towards the led she saw her mothers eyes open and looking at herlooking fit her as she thought with a change in their expression a chango to vaoaney why do i talk of heaven v bhe said turning her face suddenly towards the darkening sky andspring in low muttering tones  how do i know j am fit to go there  and yet rosamond i am not guilty of breaking my oath to my nustress you can say for me that i never destroyed the letter and that i never took it away with me when i le fit te house i tried to get it out of the myrtle room but i only wanted to hide it somewhere else i neva thought to take it away from the house i never meant to break my oath it will be dark soon mother let me get up for one moment to light the candia her hand crept softly upward amd clung fast round rosamonds neck i never swore to give him the letter she said there waa no crime in the hiding of it you found it in a picture rosamond they used to call it a picture of the porthgenna ghost nobody knew how old it wab or when it came into the house my mistress hated it because the painted face had a strange likeness to hers she told me when first i lived at porthgenna to take it down from the wall and destroy h i was afraid to do that so i hid it awfty before ever you were born in the myrtle room you found the letter at the back of the picture rosamond  and yet that was a likely place to hide it in nobody had ever found the piotuine why should anybody find the letter that was hid in ittlet me get a light mother i am sure you would like to have a lightno no light now give the darkness time to gather round there in the corner of the room lift me up close to you and let me whisper the clinging arm tightened its grasp as rosamond raised her in the bed the fading light from the window fell full on her face and was reflected dimly in her vacant eyes  i am waiting for something that comes at dusk before the candles are lit she whispered in low breathless tones  down there and ehe pointed away to the farthest comer of the room near the door  mother for gods sake what is it what has changed you sothats right say mother if she does come she cant stop when she hears you call me  mother when she sees us together at last loving and knowing each other in spite of her oh my kind tender pitying child if you can only deliver me from her how long i may live yet how happy we may both be dont talk so dont talk so tellme quietlydear dear mother tell me quietly hush hush i am going to tell you she threatened me on her deathbed if i thwarted her she said she would come to me from the other world rosamond i hare thwarted her and she has kept her promiseall my life since she has kept her promise  look down there her left arm was still clasped round rosamonds neck she stretched her right arm out towards the far corner of the room and shook her hand slowly at the empty airlook she said  there she is as she always comes to me at the close of daywith the coarse mack dress on that my guilty hands made for herwith the smile that there was on her face when she asked nie if she looked like a servant mistress mistress oh rest at last the secret is ours no longer rest at last my child is my own again rest at last and come between us no more she ceased panting for breath and laid her hot throbbing cheek against the cheek of her daughter call me mother again she whispered say it aloud and send her away from me for ever rosamond mastered the terror that shook her in every limb and pronounced the word her mother leaned forward a little still gasping heavily for breath and looked with straining eyes into the quiet twilight dimness at the lower end of the room ronej she cried suddenly with a scream of exultation  oh merciful merciful god gone at last  the next instant she sprang up on her knees in the bed for one awful moment her eyes shone in the grey twilight with a radiant unearthly beauty as they fastened their last look of fondness on her daughters face oh my love my angel she murmured  how happy we shall be together now as she said the words she twined her arms round rosamonds neck and pressed her lips rap turously on the lips of her child the kiss lingered till her head sank forward gently on rosamonds bosomlingered till the tune of gods mercy came and the weary heart rested at last acknowledging all the merit that characterises  the dead

new issue of the dead secret in our literary summnzar last week  btit a niore detailed criticism is called for alike by the justly eminenit positwn of the author and the sterling character of the work itseltc mir collins is one of those mcn who make the construction of a story an art and who give themselves up to the elaboration and perfection of their plot with the sante feeling ot entire devotion as that which made the sculptor of old finish the back of his statue though it was to be entirely hidden by the niche in which it stood with as much minute attention to truth and beauity as he had bestowed on those parts which were to meet the general gaze anuny writers of novels are content if they produce stiking effects every here and there like the  situations in a melodrama whice coine in at opportune moments when the audience are getting sleepy but mr collins iprovidles for all the contingencies of his narrative beforehand and takes no step that does not lead in the direction of the catastrophe a great leal of this nice regard for the completeness of the whole is no doubt lost on the indolent or utiobservant circulatinig library reader who scampers through a novel in the course of as maity hours as there are volumes but the author has his reward firstlv in the sense of satisfaction which is always derived from performing any work with all ones conscience and secondly in the appreciation of those few who can perceive the delicate strokes alnd subtle tints which make up the living picture to such observere the back of the statue is not hidden though to others it may be au

B8459,['8665899'],  a lifts secret by mrs henry wood 2 vols wood whitten six years since for though pages of a serial this story of love amongst the rich and strikes amongst the poor is now for the first time ottered to the public as a distinct work and in a preface wherewith she lays it before a more critical class of readers than those for whom it was originally composed mrs wood speaks somewhat disparagingly of her performance and anticipates adverse criticism by intimating that the book is not without faults and hinting that criticism should deal leniently with its shortcomings out of respect for its benevolent purpose so far as it may be regarded as a lovestory the work will endure critical examination and from first to last it may be taken as a favourable specimen of mrs woods artistic method that she has produced stories that are stronger in plot and more ingeniously constructed no reader of her best tales will dehy but in some respects its literary stylo is greatly superior to that of the story by which its author is most widely and favourably known free from the wordiness of her more recent tales it presents us with a series of cleverly managed scenes that would not discredit any living novelist in the second grade of romantic artists and though it is highly improbable that a gentleman of businesslike habits and sound intelligence would without investigation accept as true a comparative strangers assertion that he had committed bigamy when a simple course of  inquiry would show him the utter falsehood i of the statement the incidents which are though  basis and substance of the mystery from which the book derives its title will afford considerable excitoment to marvelloving readers who so long as they get a mystery of some sort are not very particular inquirers into though reasonableness of the devices that yield them their favourite stimulant nor are these though only merits of a book which exhibits mrs woods knack of telling even a bad story so that whilst its leaves arc being turned it occasions j an idle peruser all the pleasure which ordinary j folk in their hours of idleness derive from the  perusal of the finest productions of our best j writers of prose fiction i but while wc render homage to the authors  distinctive lightness and facility we hold her guilty of something worse than indiscretion in  selecting the relations of labour and capital as j a subject for though display of her trivial powers  it is to no purpose that she observes in her apologetic preface concerning her treatment of  the labour question  i presume not to touch j upon the political bearings of the question leaving them to wiser heads than mine  but if  the book shall cause even one workman to stand j bravely to his daily labour in the teeth of adverse counsels and offered hindrances and so  avert seasons of bitter suffering from his family i i shall bc thankful to have sent it forth  without inquiring how a writer can discuss such a question as the policy of combinations i amongst workmen for the purpose of regulating  the remuneration of labour and altogether j abstain from touching its political bearings j wo will merely say that mis wood deals so j fur as her limited knowledge and the functions i of a novelist permit with the principal poli i tical problems which she claims credit for j avoiding and that in doing so she gives offensive i utterance to thc worst prejudices of those sections of our prosperous middle classes that i are most strougly opposed by their selfish inter j ests to trades unions she teaches that strikes j arc mere devices for doing injustice to em i plovers of labour  that masters arc the humane enlightened and munificent benefactors of the  servants by whose labour they are enriched  i that though operatives who favour trades unions j are for the most part discontented and indolent j men whose main object is to grasp more than though worth of their toil or miserable simpletons who aro though contemptible dupes of dishonest agitators  that the workmen who are nrot conspicuous amongst their generally thriftless and depraved kind for intelligence and moral worth are those operatives who are but lukewarm supporters or actual opponents of labourcombination  that the paid agents of trales unions are sheer knaves who live in idleness by playing on the credulity of their fellows and that workmen arc generally growing so impatient of the tyranny of their cooperative societies that they trouble themselves far less about the rights of labour and the despotic exactions of capital than about the grinding injustice of club rules not only does mrs wood enforce these views by all the ordinary devices of the storytellers art but she republishes her story in the face of protests against the unfairness and falsity of its delineations which six years since induced the editor of the magazine in whose columns the tale originally appeared to publish an intimation  that sam shuck and his followers were not designed to represent though more intelligent members of trades unions but only though ignorant and unprincipled section of those who engage in strikes it woidd be easy to show thc inconsistency of this editorial disclaimer with the general purposo and details of mrs woods denunciations of strikes but it is enough to state that whilst she asserts the nonpolitical character of her tale she furnishes evidence that the violence and onesidedness of its political statements have to her own knowledge roused the animosities and heartburnings which she professes herself anxious not to provoke  in writing this story she urged in may 1862 in reply to expostulations against her libellous caricatures of unionists and their agents  though i authors object has not been to deal with the vexing questions between masters and men j between capital and labour about which there  must always be conflicting opinions so much j as to depict the injurious social results that i those quarrels produce and the misery they  leave behind them unfortunately for mrs wood this declaration is irreconcilable with  the contents of her story which gives less j consideration to the results of strikes than to  thc means by which strikes are effected had she merely deplored the sufferings caused by  the periodical contentions of labour and capital j no voice would have been raised against her compassionate utterances and now that she i republishes her book with scant discretion and j questionable taste at a time when the relations  of workmen and their employers have been  disturbed by recent conflicts and disclosures i wc say no word against her pity for the innocent i victims of strikes though we are constrained to state that she has doneand to no good puri posethe very thing which she wishes us to think that she has left undone,britain

messrs kingsleycharles and henry both affectthe former may claim the honour of having inventedwhat is called  muscular christianity in both the ideal of goodness is intimately associated with a sound

entirely to the sterner sexto be dyspeptic is difficult to be  larmoyant would be impossible the characteristics are utterly incongruous charity indeed forbids them to lay down as a broad principle that no true christian can be subject to neuralgia or afraid of bronchitis or weak on his pins or less than four feet ten inches in stature or too feeble to fight the blacksmith and too timid to shoot a robber but the best that can be said for suchjfrail brethren is that appearances are strongly against them according to the kingsley theory the perfect christian should be recognizable if exhumed a thousand years hence by some theological cuvier of the thirtieth century by the size of his skeleton and the magnificent expansion of his os frontis living in our own day this species may be known chiefly by their vigorous vitality their endurance of fatigue the inextinguishable laughter with which they greet every crisis of suffering or adversity and the stalwart strength1 which upon adequate provocation they can impart to the extensor muscles of the forearm written upon these principles the romances of either kingsley are full of excitement and interest their heroes are apt to display all manner of feats of personal prowess and of course find innumerable opportunities for such performances the author of  geoffrey hamlyna younger brother we believe of the rector of eldertonnow makes his first appearance as the writer of an independent work hitherto his productions have been limited to a few u spirited  articles in frasers magazine describing the sporting capabilities of australia his present work relates chiefly to the same country with which mr h kingsley is evidently well acquainted and concerning which he has much that is at once novel and interesting to tell the family theory indeed prospers amazingly by emigration to a new country in our old and hotpressed society at home we are forced to confess that  muscular christianity  is somewhat out of place it is not altogether true and might occasionally be found inconvenient a muscular christian of the kingsley type would sometimes under contingencies that must now and then occur in england find himself entangled in rather disagreeable relationships with the police magistrates but in our antipodean colonies the church is still in every sense a church militant religion and civilisation have still to clear their path and conquer their peace  a coups de poing not to mention rifles and revolvers muscularity there becomes an eminently christian endowment and of this specialty the author of geoffrey hamlyn has taken excellent advantage as a novel his present work shows at once the clumsiness and the wealth of a young writer he squanders incidents ideas thoughts and knowledge like an heir just come into the possession of an estate which he thinks inexhaustible the story comprises a period of more than forty years and summons into view nearly as many personages  in all of whom the reader is expected to take greater or less interest and whose fortunes are followed out through the direst vicissitudes of love of matrimony and of murder many of the scenes especially those illustrating the condition of australian society in its early antegolddigging era are described with admirable piquancy and the style throughout is lively terse and sparkling the plot is so full of variety and incident as to defy analysis we regret however to find so clever and in many respects original a writer condescend to imitate the hackneyed expedients of a wornout school of novelists when attempting to wind up his story that an honest simplehearted doctor who has practised benevolence and talked geology through two volumes and ahalf should suddenly start up with a star on his breast as a prussian count and proximate prime minister to king frederick williamor that rollicking captain desborough three pages farther on should announce his succession to an irish earldom and twenty thousand ayear are devices which as we supposed had long since been surrendered to the concoctors of thrilling romances for the penny journals mr kingsley has however reintroduced them to respectable society and although we are not altogether pleased with the acquaintance we are unfeignedly willing to excuse the authors maladroitness in consideration of the many scenes and characters so delightfully fresh original and fascinating with which we are brought into communion during the course of his three volumes we cordially reciprocate the authors hope that  we may meet again  the recollections of oeoffiy hamlyn by heury kings ley 3 vols macmillan and co mr henry kingsley follows with much vigour his brothers lead and iu the school of muscular christianity which his brother has founded he may prove better claim upon the rank of a head master than that of founders kin the author of geoffrey hamlyn not only talks about life in australis but knows it and as this field of exertion occupies a large place in the ethical system he is helping to develope bia australian experience is worth a doctorate to the new teacher there are four stalwart lovers of a wayward heroine who marries unwisely and at last finds herself an orphan with an infant at the breast her husband a transported coiner he was transported by the judge to a place where he became captain of a gang of bushrangers killed his own son snd wss hung most of the other persons of ths story are transported also by the author to australia there it may be that the compactness of the plot suffers a little from the full and fresh impression of the

exhausted by a single effort  recollections of geoffrey hamlyn new novels by henry kingsley o vols macmillan  co  mr henry kingsley has here written a work that keeps up its interest from the first page to the last it is full of vigorous stirring life and though an eager reader may be prompted to skip intervening digressions and details hurrying on to see what comes of it all he will nevertheless be pretty sure to return and read dutifully all the skipped passages after his main anxiety has been allayed the descriptions of australian life in the early colonial days are marked by an unmistakeable touch of reality and personal experience as a novel however the recollections of geoffrey hamlyn is too straggling too panoramic the first volume which contains the previous life and antecedents of the various characters who are to be gathered together in the australian world is too diffuse there are too many details about minor matters which are not gathered up neatly and dextrously but allowed to hang loose a vexatious tax on the readers powers of memory for he will find many allusions to things and people he has utterly forgottenr the story has a constant disposition to run wild the author does not keep it well in check this arises partly from want of practice in managing stories but more from exuberance of materials which are not kept in due subordination there is no chief hero or heroine the young lady who plays that part in the first volume and the cause of woes unnumbered to everybody who is nearly or remotely connected with her subsides in the subsequent pages into little more than a walking lady only appearing at intervals saying little and doing less she is like the string in sugarcandy round winch the crystals gather but is no real addition to the mass or the sweetness mary harker is indeed an extremely troublesome selfish selfwilled young womanheadstrong to follow her humour out and without any fortitude or good sense to support the briers and thorns which she meets with in the wayloved a great deal better than she deserves by several worthy men who are under the hallucination of her charms causing them endless trouble and being on the whole as disagreeable to the impartial reader as a spoiled child to a sensible maiden aunt the other characters are all well drawn but there is no especial hero amongst them the conversations are carried on in the language generally spoken by rational beings in their intercourse with each other thia gives a human interest to the book and makes it look tntethat first charm to children and to which most readers return after serving their apprenticeship to the seductions of fine writing and heroic sentences the escape of the convicts and the chase after them by capt desborough is the most exciting incident in the book though too long drawn out the minor characters horses and dogs included are pleasant to make acquaintance with the descriptions of the scenery of australia are goodbut the descriptions of scenery are generally received with great ingratitude by the general reader and authors write them mainly for their own satisfaction there is an escape from a forest on fire which makes the reader hold his breath there is an occasional coarseness of expression which though allowable in the rough and ready intercourse of bush society is not admissible under any plea into the artificial precincts of three volumes post 8vo no matter who or what the interlocutors may be mr henry kingsley however has written a book which the public will be more inclined to read than to

that irish novelists have uniformly given a party cast to their fictions the tangled and bloody threads ofthe political wo of stretch so far as to blend with and blemish even the bright aerial web of fancy lt is certain that not one able irish romance from thc  absentee to the   nippy has been unmarked by this peculiarity  and the book before us is of a similar character ve do not complain of this for it is unquestionably mr violation of the laws of art to make a novel sub servient to whatever outward end may please the author lint so long as it shall continue to be the tendency of the irish mind to think iind feel in relation merely to politics and to usc the imagination solely for writing supplements to the newspapers so long will it be evident that ireland and irishmen are not what they ought tobe so long will it be vain to hope for the production of poetry or philosophy in a country where there is a fashion of laying claim to a large measure of both lt is the curse of that nation that no man seems there to think of himself as any thing but the member of a party and thc eye is seldom turned to those higher regions of human nature which rise above the tumults of the hour men see but through a mental prism which distracts their at tentiou to the green ray or the orange instep0 contemplating inds creation in that unlrot light svhich gives it all its unity and beauty

yet if st paul or st peter svere to address an epistle to the irish it svould probably excite far less attention than so vulgarly and miserably brutal a performance as mr oconnells letter to mr hunt faking for granted hosvever that no irishman is likely to svrite a novel svhich shall not have a direct political bearing it svould be impossible lo deny that the book before us holds a very elevated place in the class to sshich it belongs of the politics svhich it advocates we shall only say that in our eyes they are replete svith exaggeration and not slightly tinctured svith direct error not that the book manifests any violence of temper on the part of its author or that its mistakes are suck as svill probably do much mischief the doctrines boss ever in truth pushed to extremity are among the mildestmannered sophisms ssc knosv and the whole style and conception of the book is so allen to the mental habits of the crosvd that on them it can produce but little effect while on the other hand the interests of the higher classes of england and ireland sufficiently guard them from bolng seduced by thc ss titers ingenious paradoxes the main moral is decidedly au important a precious truth that without national feeling there is no hope or stay for nations or for individuals but the author fills up this outline by a style of colouring and a fashion of details svith svhich sve all englishmen and most instructed irishmen must undoubtedly quarrel we are loth to speak hardly of a man of genius and of benevolent enthusiasm but our opinion svould be utterly svorthless if any consideration public or private critical or political could deter us from maintaining that thc enemies of the irish connexion svith england are hosvever unconsciously the most mischievous of all men as pleaders for ireland and for england it is exquisitely painful to he obliged to speak this svith reference to the svork of a man of 80 tine talents such acute observation so keen a sense of the humorous and so hearty a sympathy with the beautiful and the good as must be the writer of the  angloirish but as to such mistakes as that which wc find in the gravest and most pregnant political portion of this book vol iii c 1 and 5 where it is over and over assumed that a nation requires nothing but numbers to fulfil all the purposes of the social union the author with all his talents aud they are of the highest order and all his knowledge of kngland and ireland which is always abundant and in many cases to us tit least new seems in our mind to have given far too little attention to any political principles except those which would lead him hy the shortest road to a conclusion which he had previously determined to arrive at we will now however dwell no longer on this thorny and trampled soil than while we observe that the questions to thc illustration of which a part of this book is devoted would in our view receive a very different solution from that of the author hy proceeding on the simple premises that the most important elements of political calculation are neither rights nor numbers but property and intellijienee we shall convey to our readers an erroneous impression of the  angloirish if we led them to believe that any considerable portion of its pjwes is directly devoted to those serious arguments svhich sve have probably frightened them by mentioning we think indeed that sse can trace throughout the svhole the same undermeaning which rises to the surface in some fesv points but wc can set the public at ease by assuring them that they are perfectly at liberty to read ninetenths of tbewk as nothing more than ti very clever story of chiracter and circumstance loves sears rivalries and dinnerparties and its succession ol ludicrous brilliant and impassioned pictures svill famish them with ample entertainment though they should not be inclined to study their political significance we doubt svhethcr sve are doing s erv morally svhen sve add that these volumes contain much portraiture of svellknosvn men and will probably bc much the more favourably received on account of this doubtful merit we svill nosy endeavour to give a short abstract

a lively and beautiful child who surprises the young englishman by her talents and good humour but shocks him by her irish svildness jerald is next taken to cambridge there is here a striking passage about the great men svho have been educated at cambridge though it is souiesvhat too much crosvded with heterogeneous and in one or tis o cases obscure names a party of the students is the described

the public has often been told sometimes liy themselves that it ought to take a deep interest ah the various personages f the company tyre described with extraordinary spirit and few things of the kind have ever been made more accurate or more amusing than the portraits of mr tinning au inglish cynic and qoh rirunt and mr gore a needy ailkytongucd irish fine gentleman then conics an evening at the house ofthe spanish ainassmlor from which we may perhaps quote a laughable episode and next the house of commons this is followed hy a long and vivid description of an evening party at a lady kilbanes in which a vast variety of amusing people glitter along the wall from the magiclantern of the author among these the hero falls in with his old schoolfellow blond who has somehow or other been changed by his peninsular campaigns into a rather lively but very pedantic opinion of hussar atlectation ieraltl also renews an old acquaintance with a lady cox a very young and pretty woman who has teen driven from ncr husbands house by his ill treatment of her on this intimacy of icraid much of the story turns the book from this to the end of the first volume takes a higher and stronger dight than before lady ox falls in love with ierald and lets him know it in a dissenting chape whither she had persuaded bim to make a pilgrimage that he might hear the preaching of a young and popular pulpit orator she i overheard by her disguised husband and determines to elope vvith the young amourist  but she becomes indignant at his remaining qualms of conscience and to revenge herself at once upon him and her husband makes the sentimental preacher the companion of her dight they are pursued by sir richard ox who first murders the lady and her paramour and then himself the whole of the story is conceived with the utmost intensity of power and passion an interview of fitraids with lady cox previous to her escape from london gives rise to the belief that he is privy to the place of her retreat and while the husband is pursuing her this mistake induces one of her relations captain stanhope to call out jerald  who receives ii wound declared by the surgeon to be slight and stanhope one said to be mortal our hero escapes to france and when he has nearly recovered from his hurt meets by accident in peer tu tlinke a beautiful girl who seems to know something of his history and whom he has a vague impression of having before seen this lady is we confess especially attractive but we trtit she will be permitted to change her dress before the next edition he again obtains a glimpse of her at brest where she is at a window exhibiting au enthusiasm which seems to us one of the worst and most absurd that can exist in favour of the lmpcror napoleon thc return of that oellish aud remorseless adventurer drives gerald from france and after being tossed by tempests and billows he is wrecked upon the coast of ireland without knowing what country he has reached after having received a hospitable entertainment and passed through some curious adventures which we have not space to detail he is on the road to dublin and hears from the coachman the tale of an irish peasant which is one of the most touching and interesting narratives of the kind that we have ever seen after liebig upsetand having his arni broken he reaches dublin isle has strong prejudices against his guardian mr knightly and his family though his sister is then living with them  and when that gcntleiiiin and his eldest sou cull upon him al his hotel in dublin lie causes himself to be denied to

amusing descriptions of some of the chief personages of dublin aud are tikcn to the roman catholic association this is followed by a walk through dublin  and here the author in doing nilpie justice to the beauty of the irish capital writes with a far too evident feeling of soreness and jealousy on account of the unjust depreciation ol ireland by some knglishnien lt is a chapter however of pleasant and powerful writing and must interest all its readers whether of this country or ofthe other gerald encounters mr gore in dublin and all that we luiir of him bis family and his guests is exceedingly rich and edifying the beginning of the third volume contains some passages of immensely strong excitement especially the last scenes of mr gore the author proceeds to clear up a variety of doubts and dilliculties which had perplexed the previous volumes by informing us of the partial resemblance between one of the miss gores and the heroine jerald then leaves dublin to seek bis sister and by the way gets into those political discussions with a fellowtraveller to which we have before alluded ile flood and gunning severally contrive to fall into the hands ofthe same band of rockites and after

B5507,['3163797'],  esther waters esther waters is not the turning point in mr george moores literary career in several recent utterances it might have been read that the turning point was reached some time ago that he had worked out his old inspirations or was getting such new light on them as would transfuse them into something new only till now he has had no prominent opportunity of showing the changes in his aims or in his expression of these esther waters will then stand to mark the place where he turned off and sought other things than of old not that he has forsworn all his former methods or his former self but these are made to subserve the impulsive dominating force of the new spirit what mr moore set out to do in this story was to relate the life and adventures of a poor little kitchenmaid whom an unkind fate forced into the household of a racing betting squire and afterwards cast adrift on london in poverty and loneliness the circumstances of such a history are suggestive enough of ugliness meanness and vulgarity and mr moore it must be said has not heretofore been slow to make use of such opportunities well  esther waters  is not an idyll exactly but plunging boldly into the harsh unclean tawdry cruel life of london squalor of racecourse and publichouse glitter he has drawn up the essential reality and behold there is nothing in it alien to heroism of sturdy growth and purity that is inherent honesty courage and wholesome sweetness are hardy blossoms that stand and endure and bloom in poisonous air  esther waters the most vigorous denunciation of gambling that ever was written has been laid it is said under some kind of modified taboo it would be well to discuss this point of view if one could bring ones self to understand it it is easier to conceive of its striking readers as showing a moral purpose far too insistently from beginning to end it is pervaded by a sense of the everlasting usefulness and beauty of moral effort but though the purpose is always evident and near the surface mr moore has reached his particular result mostly by a refining and a ripening of his artistic perceptions the heaping up of detail and circumstance the pride in gathering all the material possible for scenebuilding the photographic method of  include everything as it comesit must be right if its there was an interesting stage in modern fiction accepted by some as a final artistic inspiration while as a matter of fact it was only science putting its spoke in begging art to take life seriously and look it in the face without fear half the behest was based on a complete misunderstanding of the temperament and the uses of art the other half was intelligent but the whole was obeyed for a time with conscientious literalness art is now recovering a sense of its own essential differences and conditions but it has retained a respect for common life and the understanding that such life can be used for artistic purposes mr moore has gone through the discipline he keeps the habit of minute observation some of the old pride in lack of fastidiousness and a belief in the uses of the camera but these he is not mastered by now  esther waters  is a democratic novel through it there breathe not only sympathy with life at its hardest but a hearty and altogether unpatronising respect for the strugglers mr moore exaggerates just as little as he idealises you see no giant tyrant consistently threatening and opposing and killing help friendliness kindliness are lights that stream into betting holes and burn down area steps and amid squalor and low aims for all his french sympathies mr moore has read the english heart aright he has seen the springs that keep it wholesome divined the consolations that keep it from being altogether debased the emotional protestantism of the little sects that gather into their narrow folds so much fervour and tender passion is shown as a living force and not only without cynicism but without patronage  i esther waters by george moare w scott and co there is little of beauty in circumstance or setting mr moore is wonderfully sparing of prettiness indeed his hand is a hard one in only a few passages does the beauty of the world shine through and this is one of them esther has been taken into kent to make friends with the relatives of her lover fred the religious stationer fred was on a ladder shaking the branches but he came down when he saw esther and harry his brother took his place esther and fred filled one basket then yielding to a mutual inclination they wandered about the orchard stopping on the little plank bridge they hardly spoke at all words seemed unnecessary each felt happiness to be in the others presence they heard the water trickling through the weeds and as the light waned the sound of the falling apples grew more distinct then a breeze shivered among the tops of the apple trees and the sered leaves were blown from the branches the voices of the gatherers were heard crying that their baskets were full they crossed the plank bridge joking the lovers who stood aside to let them pass a red moon rose behind the hillside into a dark leaden sky when they entered the house they saw the old farmer who had slipped in before them sitting by his wife holding her hand patting it in a curious oldtime way this is a glimpse as rare to the reader as it was to esther she did not marry fred after all a life with him was the brightest prospect she had ever had but duty with its roots in the past seemed to point away from the paths of comfort and even of strict morality  one doesnt do the good that one would like to in the world one has to do the good that comes to one to do this is esthers philosophy not a bad one faithfully adhered to to be in keeping with his subject mr moore has adopted a very plain diction he has held himself in there is nothing grandiloquent either in sentiment or expression there is no fine writirg at allto tell the truth there is a good deal of uncommonly poor writing but blunders and carelessness apart it is artistic in its methods and its tone it is painstaking plain and detailed like the life it paints there are shorter ways for poets and a poet mr moore is not but poetry after all while making us realise the misery and the heroism as a whole might have obscured what he particularly desired to showthe daily buffetings hourly chances mischances hopes and despairs of those that are not fortunes favourites gy,britain
B4391,"['8906800', '6810007']",  new novels the golden bowl by henry james methuen  co thb theory of impressionism has been summed up in the dictum of monet that light is the only subject of every pioture the theory of mr henry jamess art might also be put in a formula  human thoughts are the sole material of the novelist whoever fails to realise this elementary principle is sure to come to grief in the effort to follow a master never other than difficult this principle alone accounts for the order in which events are narratedor rather they are not narrated at all they are delineated only in so far and at such times as they are producing an effect on the inward life of one of his characters conse quently they are never seen in a clear dry light such as serves to display the events of scott or even thackeray we learn them always through the refracting medium of some persons mindand that often is rather not his notion of the event in itself but his suspicion of somebody elses notion of it now this is in reality the only way in which events whether personal or historical exist for any of us a fact when it is past becomes an idea said creighton this truth forgotten alike by most novelists and nearly all historians is the justification of mr jamess method it gives us of course no ground for asserting his success but one reason why some folks give him up is that they refuse to see that he is attempting what to the best of our belief has never been attempted before even by the most psychological of novelists or poets such as browning for even brownings characters always display themselves to an audience not so with those of mr james here we are shown not the human heart under a microscope as with the ordinary analytical novelist but the soul developing itself from within finding in other persons circumstances and happenings nothing but the matter of its thought it is objected that mr james is supersubtle and trails an idea through far too many windings sets it in too many lights refines and explains and exiguates so to say ad nauseam this book will awaken this objection more than ever but let any one reflect on his thought upon any matter that concerns him personally let him take only halfanhour of it and try to retrace all its involutions and he will find himself ten times as full of distractions of strange backward twists of hesitations of reasons and imaginings as any of mr jamess characters the fact is brought out in this new book for none of the dramatis persona is at all extraordinary j the impecunious but charming italian prince who marries the daughter of a widowed american millionaire his wife his fatherinlaw and his lover the american girl of brilliant social qualities who marries the millionaire are all commonplace persons enough indeed the lack of greatness in his characterstheir essential littleness while it may enhance the realism of mr jamess work strikes us as one of its serious defects as great art the father continues so wrapped up in his daughter that the two former lovers are naturally brought together and the plot turns on a peculiarly treacherous adultery the gradual discovery of this by the princess her desire to shield her father from the knowledge of it his discovery of it and desire to shield her her success in finally severing her husband from his paramour and in securing his love are the theme of the story it is toldor to be correct it works itself out  with all the convincing realism of which mr james is a master but it is very difficult for everybody is occupied in concealing from every one else what he or she knows and even when they desire to convey the truth it is commonly done by the statement of something else the triumph of this method is shown in the scene between maggie and her father when as a result of what she omits to say the millionaire resolves to pack his traps and take his wife back for good and all to america but for the chorus work of bob assingham and his wife the whole thing would be scarcely intelligible as it is the book is clear to those who think mr james worth a little trouble the method in spite of its  inwardness is detached cold and if the word is possible a little cruel but its mental agility its likeliness its atmosphere are perfect why mr james should require so very disagreeable a situation to develop his study we cannot understand but that he has elaborated it as no one else could we are sure indeed we should have liked two more books in the novel one giving the story as it affects the mind of charlotte the brilliant hard repulsive woman and the other showing it in the mind of the millionaire strange compound of shrewdness and simplicity inexorable decision and inexhaustible kindliness mr james can hardly achieve a greater success than that of making even one of his readers desire that the book were double its length at the same time we trust that in the next book which he writes he will purge himself of certain mannerisms that are little more than affectations he overworks the word lucidity even more than writers of an earlier age did that of  sensibility he plays upon the phrase there you are as though the words were the strings of a violin he puts the commonest and most obvious expressions in inverted commas and we dislike his too frequently interrupting adverbs doubtless all are defensible as necessary on the hypothesis of the method we grant the method but deny the necessity all the same we admit that mr henry james is at his best throughout this book the final month at fawns especially the two scenes between charlotte and maggie is a veritable triumph we quote one descriptionthat in maggies mind of a cardparty   meanwhile the facts of the situation were upright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux  the fact of her fathers wifes lover facing his mistress  the fact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking between them the fact of charlotte keeping it upkeeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fanny assingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three and knowing more about each probably when one came to think than either of them knew of either erect above all for her was the sharpedged fact of the relation of the whole group individually and collectively to herselfherself so speciously eliminated for the hour but presumably more present to the attention of each than the next card to be played  the golden bowl uv henry james london methuen 6s mr henry james luis lure put forward the most important work in point of hulk and complexity which he has issued for some tune lt is indeed the longest novel we have of late years read elosepackeel full of matter elaborated with remarkable and meticulous precision of labour lt is no novel which he who runs may read its every page exacts of the reader concentration it must be followed with care and patience nor can the critic without much diffidence judge on ii first reading work of such a scale and prepared with so manifest su conscientious a deliberation for it is preeminently henry james and henry james of the latest tin most elitlicult refinement the plot is cunningly contrived artfully interwoven perhaps for plot we should say situation since as in all james novels it is the evolution of character under though development of a situation lilt her than plot in the usual sense which is the groundwork of the story a james situation is always subtle but this is intricately subtle so intricate in its subtlety as to intimidate iiuy attempt at brief description or analysis it is the case of ii couple an italian prince and an angloamerican girl forced into ii false position by a love affair preceding the princes marriage to an american heiress a love affair concealed from the bride who is the angloamerican girls bosom friend conceive that the latter girl afterwards marries the brides millionaire father is thus brought into permanent relation with the prince and his bride and that circumstances drift her into renewing her former connexion with the italian you then have but a part the most obvious part of the tangled web woven by mr james the interest is heightened by the fact that all the four people thus netted in domestic t rageely indeed all the chief people of the story are in their varying measure sympathetic to the reader the issue as one foreknows in a janies novel is partial and unsatisfying as life itself the emotion the tragedy though keen is never violent never fullblooded mr janies knows that inoehrn domesticity is a thing of halftints even in its suffering it bleeds but it does not bleed red the jolden bowl  is a crystal vessel cased in gold which plays ii part in the tale with somewhat ibsenlike symbolism ii crystal vessel with a secret flaw which finally shatters allegorising the character and fate of the italian prince not only in length and elaboration is this a novel which claims attention even among mr henry jamess work as the plot so is the execution subtly intricate often alas but too much so mr james later work has frequently carried his peculiar qualities to a baffling extreme and much of this book has the defects of those qualities harassingly m evidence the intellectuality overpowers the sensuous and objective traits proper to a novel until one has the impression of reading an absturse treatise of psychology rather than a tale the reader is never for a moment allowed to  take it easy he is required to be alert always and at all points even the inverted commas to which th schoolgirl looks as marking the green oases in the sands of narration betoken for lum nu relaxation of vigilance we know that in life people often answer tu each others meaning rather than to the thing actually spoken that you may have passages of dialogue wherein the actual words are but signposts pointing to the intended significance fspcially is this the case with very cultivated intelligence or vry uncultivated intelligence where the sense and habit of language is very trained or very untrained in the one case it is an art of delicate suggestion in the other a groping for expression mr meredith at his best handles this manlier of dialogue admirably so in his separate way can mr janies but in this book it is at times pushed to a nebulousness a tenuity which gives one the feeling of walking on tightropes moreover people after all talk in this way but at moments under stress of some withheld emotion impelled by som particular motive but here people often propound enigmas to each other for page after page till the wearied reader rebels then too mr james extraordinary gift in detecting and expressing though most evanescent complexities of psychological feeling subconscious or unconscious thought has seemingly become such a passion that he cannot for au instant disembarrass himself of it it overpowers his instinct of proportion he must analyse everything important r trivial with like minuteness and like prolixity thus you have page upon page in which the game is beaut ifully played but the game was really not worth thc camile nay at one point there is the we should think unparalleled exhibition of three successive chapters almost wholly engrossed by analysis and unbroken by a single conversation it is magnificent but it is scarcely novelwriting also mr janies faculty of finessing with and reducing to psychological abstractions what with any other would be the most pedestrian commonplaces of statement in association with these other things grows rather appalling to the jaded attention of the muchtried reader but his analysis in the proper place triumphs a father marries his daughters young friend mainly to satisfy his daughter ami we believe it for mr james persuades us of its truth when he does concentrate on his story there is the old power and art he is admirable in sureness and cumulative convincingness  through all the intricate evolutions and changes of emotional situation which from another hand would seem artificial as a congreve comedy he guides us with perfect persuasion of natural truth despite exasperations of detail the novel in the main is masterly the three leading women are differentiated with the nicest skill  each is living and persuasive the prince in a position somewhat recalling that of tito molema never forfeits the readers sympathy or appears less than a natively highminded man a southern min but the women are the success of the novl to analyse its charm its power is far less easy than to not its defects but it fairly ranks as a masterwork if a master work mawed by some of his obscurest later mannerisms il is not inuit for popularity but no lover of mr henry lames can neglect it without loss it is a last word of subtlely marred n inns by sub let v out of place,britain
