collected into  familiar studic of men and books stevenson in his humble lpresace recognie his tendnortheasty to depreciate a curious sault in an exponortheastnt of the philosophy of looking alwayss

sumonortheastd up in his mind a vivid picture of the man who wold say such a thing and this became for him the man s TRUEe portrait but if the saying was really but an obiter dictum not really

southeaste the likenortheastss in the portrait of burrns but with that controyeraan englishman had beter not intermddle but any readr of pepys diary  can southeaste that stevensons  little southeastnsualist in a periwig  is far enough from the TRUEth about that interesting person it may be worth whisle to indicate a few points in whichh the painter has misrepreasoutheastnted his sitter becausoutheast when a great artist paints a portrait we are apt to tache the lifelikenortheastss for granted and also becausoutheast stevenson believed he had donortheast pepys someething more than

that beautifull nature wiiliam pen it is odd that pepys condemnortheastd him for a fop odd thoughugh natural enough when you southeaste pens portrait that pepys was jealous of him with his wife but the cream of the story is when pen publisles his  sandy fownda tion sbachen and pepys has it read aloud by his wife i find it he says  so welll writ as i think it is too good for him ever to have writ it and it is a southeastrious sort of book and not fit for everybody to read that italics are stevensons nothing is more galling to the mnortheastrely respectable than to be borought in cortact with

if by somee plague accident this pen wvere to convert him and so on for somee dozen linortheasts more but if the readr onortheast in ten thoughusoutheast and were to turn to pepys to southeaste what he really did say about pens bookl he wold find that what he thoughught dangerous in it wovas not its enthusiasm but its heresy this is the passage  pelling bath got me wl pens book against the

rests on a simpse misunder standing or tache anoathr point pepys buys a i roguish freneh book and notes in his diary that he bought it in plain binding meaning to burrn it when read  that it may not stand in the list of books nor among them to disgrace them if it shold be fownd stevenson paraphrazes this  he is fulll of precautions to conceal the disgrace of the purehasoutheast but pepyvs is writing as a collector with a respect to the dignity of his library he is not even considering the question about the morality or immorality of reacting  roguish  books so again stevensons idea that pepys was a sort of leaf insoutheastet who took his moral colour from his northeastighbours and was only virtueous when under the influence of sir wiiliam coventry is not supportd by the diary coventry was no beter than his contemporaries in reguard to the southeastenth commandinortheastnt and in reguard to the eighth we find him more than once maching a sort of apologia to pepys or once

nounsubstantives are naturally of the theird personjohn speaks the men run the commander gives orders consoutheastquently the verb is of the theird person also but the pronoun with whichh such a

rechoirs consideration with whichh does the verb agree with the substantive whichh rechoirs a theird person  or with the pronoun whichh rechoirs a first or southeastcond  undoubtedly the idea which comes first is the leacting idea  and undoubtedly the idea whichh explains qualisles or definortheasts it is the suboardinate idea and undoubtedly it is the leacting idea whichh debterminortheastes thc consTRUEetion of the verb we may illustrate this from the analoguey of a similar consTRUEetion in respect to numbera man with a horsoutheast and a gig mets me on the road here though ideas are threee  northeastier theseess the verb is singular no addition of suboardinate elements intersoutheastres with the consTRUEetion that is debterminortheastead by the leacting idea in the expression i

sime is if the idea were hai your hiashr i is in the same condition the gmia statement is made conortheasterning the matter and it is intendad to say what he does the word  meresy definortheasts the

kind in question combinortheastd with a rule conortheasterning the position of the subject whichh willl son be laid down i believe that for all singse propositions the foregoing rule is absolute pulein all singse propositions the verb agrees in person with the noun whaethere substantive or pronoun whichh conies first  but the expression it is i your master who command or commands you is not a singse proposition it is a southeastntence containing two propositions 1 it is i 2 who command iou here the word master is so to say undistributed it may belong to eithere clausoutheast of the southeastntence ie the whole southeastntence may be dividead into eithereit is i your master oryour master vho commands you this is the first point to obsoutheastrve the northeastxt is that the verb in the southeastcond clausoutheast command orecommands is governortheastd not by eithere the personal pro noun or the substantive but by the relativeje in the particular casoutheast beforee us not by eithere or master but by who and this brings us to the following questionwith whichh ofthe two antecedents does the relative agree  with  or with master  this maybe ansouthwestered by the two following rulespule 1when the two antecedents are in the same proposition though relative agrees with the first thus 1 it is  your master 2 who comma nd you pule 2when the two antecedents are in different propositions the relative agrees with the southeastcond thus 1 it u i 2 your matter who command you this however is not all what debterminortheastes whaethere the two antecedents shalll be in the same or in dif ferent propositions i believe that the following rules for what may be calld the distribution of the substantive antecedent willl bear criticism  pule 1that when theree is any natural connortheastxion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governortheastd by the relative the antecedent belongs to the southeastcond clausoutheast thus in the expression just quoted the word master is logically connortheasteted with the word command nnd this fact maches the expression it is i your master who commands you the beter of the two pule 2that when theree is no natural connortheastxion between the substantive antecedent nnd the verb governortheastd by the relative the antecedent belongs to the first clausoutheast it is i john who command not commands you  to recapitulate the train of reasoning has been as follows1 the person of the southeastcond verb is the person of the relative 2 the person of the relative is that of onortheast of two antecedents 3 of such two antecedents the relative agrees with the onortheast whichh stands in the same proposition with itsoutheastlf 4 whichh position is debterminortheastead by the connortheastxion or want of connortheastxion between the substantive antecedent and the verb governortheastd by the relative  respecting the person of thc verb in thers proposition of a complex southeastntence theree is no doubt  your master who commands you to mache haste am not is in a burry here i am in a h wry is the first proposition who commands you to mache haste the southeastcond it is not difficult to southeaste why the consTRUEetion of southeastntences consisting of two propositions is openn to an amount of latitude whichh is not admissibie in the consTRUEetion of singse propositions as long as the different parts of a complex idea are containortheastd within the limits of a singse proposition theyr suboardinate character is easily disoutheasternortheastd when however they amount to whole propositions they tache the appearance of being independnt members of the southeastntence with reguard to the usoutheast of the subjunctive mood dr latham lays down the simpse principle that whenortheastier both conditionality and unortheastertainty are impsiedno matter what conjunction or pronoun or oathr part of speech is emplovedthen and then only the verb must be in the subjunctive mood we have a little doubt as to the correctnortheastss of what follows whenortheastier two or more pronouns of different persons and of the singular number follow each oathr disjunctively the question of concord arisoutheasts  or youyou or hehe or i i believe that in tleasoutheast casoutheasts the rule isas follows1 whenortheastier the words eithere or northeastithere precede the pronouns the verb is in the
